Unless they make their main character the mule and gives them something to do that'll immediately lead to the next several DAYS being bogged down from them swapping over shit

Each of the others certainly do. I was pretty sure I bought a plan for "Pocketed Marine Limbs", but I only have deep pockets unlocked on marine armor.
---

---
According to this list, you can unlock pockets for marine armor by scrapping, unlike all the other armor types. That may mean that they're not available at vendors. Not that it matters much when you can get deep pocketed instead.

Did you find the one outside, in the world map? I was searching for that one for at least 20 minutes.
---
The quest marker shows it through the exit door (because it is), so I just assumed it was for one of the other active quests.
---
have you definitely encountered anyone yet who has spoken? The voice chat is based on proximity, so you wont hear someone the other side of the map. If you are hearing game sounds you should be hearing chat too.

An even better Place to scrounge for cobalt is to drop a nuke on Mama dolces. 
---
Around that area there is a load of Silt bean, wild mutfruit bushes, and bloodleaf which all give cobalt flux.
---
Slap on green thumb, and you should end up with around 80 to 100 of the stuff.

Being a long time fan of this series, I regret my purchase. The game is so riddled with bugs and unbalanced gameplay, I found myself putting it down after less than a month. During that time, my friends and I were never able to party up, making the game very frustrating. And looking back at my time spent playing, it wasn't all that great. 
---
Just going to say this same thing. Selling off junk and saw the Servo one. I‚Äôm hoarding like crazy working on my X-01 so the added carry weight will make my scrap/sell trips a lot more efficient.

I have a nice L40 mutant +30% damage pistol if you‚Äôre interested. I‚Äôm BellmanComp. Currently L82 mostly melee. Camp is at Whitespring Station

You can craft it... pipe weapon.

Scrap them to learn mods.

Nope

Yeah I've done that before too. Turns out hipfiring a fat man is a terrible idea.

Ahh, Blondie...

Yeah, the "Bot Stops" are used for Enclave events where it builds the robots and you have to protect them. I would imagine in the future we might be able to spawn some for helping us though.

good luck, in the BETA i submitted official bug reports of all the problems gatling plasma has and they havent done anything about it yet
---
Woof, that‚Äôs my life in those games. My old Tribe had standing rules on the treatment of new players. Good folks. Got nuked and wiped and I lost my passion for the game sadly
---
 nah man pistols are weak especially compared to melee weapons in general. Asy 1h weapon can use a shield would be fine. Make reloading take twice the amount of time perhaps. Black powder pistols would be the only one that realistically wouldn't work. 
---
Craft like 10 syringers under pipe weapons. Scrap them. Profit.

Any area is low level friendly if YOU ARE A MAN.

Currently the damage of the explosion of an explosive weapon is about the same as the non-explosive part, not sure if that was intended because in fallout 4, the explosion was only 15 damage

Gotta keep it in character! Gotta vaguely warn him about the scorched threat and tell him you all have to work together to stop it!

There's only one mod for the 50cal, "heavy barrel". Scrap if you need it (or the steel), otherwise dump it on a vendor.
---
 Apparently it gets tougher with more people. I did a dry run solo too, and did OK, but some I have talked to say it throws more at you if you are teamed up. 
---
Fo76 isn't a mmo. and most people play solo or with a small group of close friends at most.

give it a while and mostly solo players will remain, though.

Unrelated but sorta related, turrets at the moment are kind of a joke... I had a mob of turrets at a workshop watch me go through 3 rounds and not one of them shot a single bullet. I'll even have mobs shoot at my turret and they'll do nothing back.

12 levels means squat in the grander scheme of things. I once oneshot a 220 at level 60.

proper builds can oneshot anyone.

TBH i've always had an extremely rocky relationship with my own father, one where he's overly strict and could be downright threatening and abusive under the right circumstances. but over the past two years with many surgerys slowing him down and catching up with him he started to become more docile and outright kind to me, he bought 76 the moment it was announced for both me and himself (course he bought himself the power armor edition and pipboy haha) since were both heavily into fallout, (which was a huge thing for him since he knows i could've paid for it myself) as an early christmas present. Ever since the beta released i kinda binged all the content i could on the game and i guess he would have too, if he'd been able to get off work, so i ended up helping him a lot throughout the early game and levels. Anyways my point being is that its brought us a lot closer and allowed me to see him as more of a father figure and him to see me as more of a son to connect with i guess. Fo76 may not be the perfect game, but it helped me interact with my dad in a way that he understood. Fo76 came at the perfect time in his life for him to grab at it and has had a very positive and constructive influence on mine and his relationship

I can get my finger on the trigger of a pistol in power armor, but I can't boil some water in it.

Something that bothers me about the pvp mechanics is if you claim a workshop they can stroll right in past all of your turrets and traps while virtually invulnerable and they have complete control of the situation when to initiate pvp. Why should the attacker have so much power in that situation? It doesn't make sense. If I want to keep people out of my claimed workshop and build defenses, traps and turrets they shouldn't just get to just stroll in and survey all of the defenses and decide the exact moment to initiate pvp and step outside of their bubble of invulnerability.
---
They last played 2 days ago on the 4th, so they're in for a surprise... One person on their friend's list. Googling the name revealed that dude's twitch channel is disabled for some reason and is platinum 5 apparently in LoL...for whatever that's worth.

I have a question. I‚Äôve heard so many people talk about getting stuff via alts and stuff.

My question is: if I get good stuff via an alt, how can I get that good stuff to my main character? Does my stash correspond with my account not character?

unless you got a full set of assassin's + sentinel's and the server is stable, I know for a fact that's not true.

armor penetration on melee is pretty crazy

Same, and not just when I load in, happens all the time, walking along and stuff just drops dead, some sort of coronation to distance from the enemy for me though. Like a doughnut, if they are outside the ring they are safe also safe inside the ring, but if caught in that middle zone the drop dead for no reason, no exp and no loot.

What are good weapons for close range or legendary perks in a shotgun besides explosive 
---
"That Austin guy from game theory"  
---
I cringed a lil, not because of that and what you said but because thats what he is now..  
---
he used to be on his own independant channel with a ton of fallout related stuff called shoddycast with like two other guys. Lots more swearing too 
---
If you're trying to get out of the Forest, probably yes.
---
Best way to use the hunting rifle is to crouch for the 2x stealth damage bonus. Preferably shoot stuff in the head too. Try to unlock the suppressor by scrapping as many of them as possible.
---
Thank you! 
---
 I don't think they are even expensive, if I remember right.
---
 Whitesprings and the Bot at Harper's Ferry often have a lot of good CAMP stuff.
---
I've got a cultists dagger with 40% faster swing speed and more damage as health is down, it's my goto 90% of the time and works in power armor.
---
I thought as much, that's what I've been doing so far I just wanted that extra boost for making ungodly amounts of ammo.
---
If I came across this in game I would not think it was a players camp. I would think it was an unnamed place on the map that I somehow missed before. Incredible. 
---
Not to be an ass, cause I cross post too, but also try /r/FO76Bazaar !
---
I did answer your question. You were wondering how a guy 12 levels below you was one hitting you. And I said levels are irrelevant past 50.And  he likely had a melee build with good legendary effects on the weapon. It‚Äôs really not that hard to one hit people. Balance is practically nonexistent
---
Pacifist mode makes it so you do not damage other players but can damage their structures.
---
Attacking other players does not give you an immediate wanted status so your first example means you hit a nearby camp structure that you may not have noticed.
---
Teams disable friendly fire so you cannot hurt a team member regardless of pacifist or not unless they are wanted.
---
No problem! Start looking for an automatic mod for it instead, it's better and doesn't cause crashes. 
---
I'm using a melee build and I've never been able to one shot someone like that.
---
As of right now there are no legitimate ways to enter those areas. Either they are slated for future content or reminents of cut content.

What am I missing?

is it also glowing?

I used a 2nd account, fast traveled to watoga at level 4.  I used steel into railway spikes to level so it was slow and I was able to check several times per level.  I checked everyday from 4 to 15, about 3 weeks and it never showed up.  It showed up the 2nd time I checked at level 15 and has at least once for every level until 19.  Once I hit twenty with my mule, it stopped showing up.
---
I am trying the same thing with the lever action but have yet to see it at Grafton, Lewisberg or Welch.  I have checked levels 15-27 so far with no luck and a lot of caps spent on travel.
---
bought the plan from BOS vendor
---
Also it requires the same perks to bolt on a mod you bought or found in the wild as it does to build the same mod from scratch. 
---
As we all know it takes an equal amount of technical know-how to install a hard-drive on a computer and to make a new hard-drive from scratch...
---
I preferred 4's method where you could install a mod without perks.

Or a meat hook that can be wielded in power armor

I'd also like to know if carnivore is fixed. I have a few mutations I'd like to keep. Healing factor, Talons and Chameleon, I wanted to add others with Serums, but if Carnivore is bugged, I can't!

Oh crap, Thanks! Must have miss selected. Sorry.

the shortcut would work 100% of the time if it wasn't for Bethesda. how is this my fault and not theirs?

I hope they all get perma-banned. Death to dupers.

An even better Place to scrounge for cobalt is to drop a nuke on Mama dolces.
---
Yeah I dunno, I hung around whitesprings for a little bit last night just to check but maybe I should stay longer or check out a nuke site.
---
I havent been able to one shot someone like that using All Rise, which I assumed was the best two handers. This axe is a one handed right?
---
Well I mean there is no realistic way to implement something that functions anywhere near as well as as Radaway and Rad-X since you'd need some ridiculously advanced medicine to be able to instantly cure imminently lethal levels of radiation like it's nothing.

It doesn't unfortunately :( although the Syringer itself is mainly for the barrel utility mods. A lot of weapons are missing from the Legendary loot pool, i.e. Hunting Rifle, Chainsaw, Drill, etc.

My wife and I cleared there last week, and we had the same thoughts! It just seems like it w as s so built up for no reason...  unfortunately fallout 76 is full of this sort of thing. I hope these places receive a second pass in future updates.

The first time I ever played was fallout 3, actually my first real game. My bf was watching over my shoulder. He told me everything I was supposed to do to play the perfect game and was super irritated about any deviation. I couldn't follow the story because his constant patter and my ADHD made it impossible to pay attention to the game. It was so stressful and unenjoyable I didn't play games again until after we split. Then I went on to raid in WoW &amp; Swtor, was an officer in a big guild, finished fallout 4, Halo, borderlands, and borderlands 2, to name a few. There are plenty of cool people out there to play with. üòâ
---
These games are fantastic *because* there are so many ways to enjoy them. PVP, settlements, story, factions, exploring, lore. To think there is only one correct way to play is quite immature. 
---
Anyhow, you rock! I can't wait to sneak and snipe my own scorchbeast.
---
How can they not have patched this in the time since the game came out? Surely if anyone at Bethesda is playing their own game, they'd have came across this by now. It happens litterally every time now. 
---
True that, I found him in big bend tunnel when I had like 300 caps...
---
from what iv experienced no, and it sucks because i had pictures from the very first beta when me and my crew ran into a bethesda dev and played with him the whole time and a couple more times
---
Junkies, double/quad ammo/ and bloodied are great. Why so anti-explosive?
---
Also if a player has a wanted level they cannot see anyone not on their team on the map.
---
No problem man! Good luck! Also, remember me for your material grinding needs! 
---
Under armor aside, And theory-crafting aside, has anyone *actually tested* 400+ RR unpowered armor piece set as proposed above? 
---
I think you're trying to argue just to argue and not reading or thinking.  If I ran a business and purchased this game it's not going to cause loss in sales of my next game. Game companies didn't go out and buy this game. Stores did and may take a loss on it but then selling this game isn't going to cause people to stop going to that store. Also the store might be able to send unsold copies back for little to no loss. However this isn't just the case for Fallout 76. And like i said if you're not happy no one is forcing you to buy things from the atom shop or any Bethesda game in the future.  
---
My suggestion is just relax. If you bought the game at launch or preordered it let this be a learning experience. Don't preorder or buy at launch. If you didn't buy at launch or preorder then do your research on the game next time. The issues with this game won't be fixed overnight or over the next month. I'm thinking 6 to 12 months after launch. Is it acceptable, no I don't think so. Unfortunately that's the way things are and yes they should change.  Bethesda shouldn't have released this with the issues it has. Unfortunately Bethesda probably got lazy with coding seeing how the other games they made supported mods and mod authors fixed the issues. Seeing how the code for most of the issues is server side mods can't fix it. 
---
I don‚Äôt think they are healing, it‚Äôs that your client tries to estimate the damage/health bar and is corrected by the server a second later.  No reason to believe it‚Äôs anything but latency.

Great story, Hansel. Dude was probably spitting mad. Last time I had a dude that mad at me, he was trying to take over my workshop with a 3v1. He was so confident it would be easy work he didn't even bother stashing his extremely considerable scrap. I one shot him and picked up a staggering 300 lbs of scrap. I couldn't take all of it obviously so I took the ultracite, adhesive, ballistic fiber and basically everything worth two caps a unit and swapped out all my steel and wood and glass that I could before he came back. 
---
Protip for PVP guys that need a numerical advantage: an entire workshop worth of turrets acts as almost an entire defending player, especially if they're all rocket and heavy laser turrets.

I tried to use that to my advantage but when I can't kill them instantly like they can me, the wanted level makes it moot

Strength at 15 is a must. At least 1 in each of gladiator. Inscisor is good. Makeshift warrior in intelligence will keep your weapons from breaking as often. Other than that I think it comes down to play style and what you want out of it.

I've gotten quite a few two shot explosives ironically, though they've all been useless to my builds. i did also buy a few from reputable sellers, so there not as rare as people think i think its just people being unlucky and me being lucky, i got atleast 4-5 off the top of my head (All sold now) which included a pipe pistol/rifle, a combat rifle, a black powder rifle and a laser rifle (laser rifle being the only one of the originals i have left)
---

That has nothing to do with it. If they have wanted from attacking your camp, you can fast travel anywhere and they will not know where you are.
---
Already have a explosive handmade and if an enemy gets to close I can no longer use it and have to try to run away so having a powerful none explosive shotgun would be nice that I could quickly switch to
---
Two handed. The mutation Twisted Muscles also buffs your melee an additional 25% (If I remember correctly). Pair that with a full melee build, a good three star legendary melee weapon (maybe some food and chems that boost melee damage) and you backhand everyone

Grognak Axe is one of if not the best 2h weapon. With legendary effects and all of the perks it can do a lot of damage. It could have any number of legendary effects that increase the damage. Also Incisor will basically shred armor.

I still wanted to defend my camp from being destroyed, since I didn't have the materials nor the caps to move or fix it. I stated that the focus had shifted from trying to kill me to trying to destroy my camp, which they succeeded because of how broken their weapon is. But, since I did try to defend my camp, they got the best of both worlds

&gt;chem search perk (forgot the name)
---
Pharma Farmer?
---
I'm only on board because unarmed is already one handed despite a basic one-two combo needing two arms. 
---
Plus they already have leftover Skyrim code they've been milking for eight years so it can't be that hard to implement. 
---
If you're new to content creation I'd recommend doing something more original than making videos critical of this game. You're opening a hamburger stand behind a McDonald's and across the street from a Wendy's.
---
I mean... Instead of duping 500 TSE weapons, the dupers would just dupe 500 TSE weapons and 500 of whatever else you're making viable. Right? 
---
I'll give it a go, I suppose. I haven't gained a level in days, lol, just dicking around, collecting, crafting, and selling to other lvl 15's.
---
I have TSE Shotgun and didnt get it by dupers. Dont penalize people who are just luckier than you.
---
Huh, interesting and I thought unarmed was the weakest link of melee thanks to the lack of expert iron fist and master iron fist guess not to though
---
That's lucky, but it would be cool if it was a story driven fight, not a random one. 
---
Plus, I still wanted to get some scrape of caps back considering their bounty was 500+, which would have bounced me back to half of what I had originally
---
Yah; do the change only after fixing duping.
---
As someone in BETA who struggled on his own to finding the Enclave, I'll do nothing but help other newbies. 
---
Even at higher levels I've been surprised by how many people just help you deal with other events or clearing buildings even without talking to each other. Most of my conversations have been through emotes. This has genuinely been one of the friendliest online communities I've ever encountered. 
---
OP, you're doing some good work out there in Appalachia. If you happen across a character named "Palpadean", feel free to say hello and get a friendly greeting back. I've no time for the dickheads and trolls. I've a world to rebuild. 
---
I wonder if there is a difference between crafting at your camp and crafting in the wild
---
Have you considered melee
---
Pretty sure this is the Pixar lamp and you can‚Äôt pick it up because of copyright infringement. 
---
it is a cylinder and not a sphere, i have the same maximum height at the edges of my camp as the center. i can fit the same height tower regardless of where i place it in the circle
---
Damn, you're right. Idk how I mixed that up the first time... Well, I still prefer the rad resist and look of the T-60 so I'm gonna stick with it.
---
I have a question.
---
I was fighting the queen and wasn't taking any damage with my explosive shotgun. Are they immune sometimes?
---
 I have one. Its not exclusively pistol but she carries 3 these days. The 20% run speed increase makes a high speed pistol a lot of fun. The Black Powder Pistol with the speed increase will reload while moving faster than a melee Mutie forward and nearly as fast backwards. So kiting even high level ones is fun, pretty safe and profitable. 
---
You mean I don't have to go s arching for anymore stupid fire caps? Nice.
---
My character is a pistol main and I'd say once you get to level 50 and have all of the perks you need it can be pretty viable and even usable in non power armour, a sneaky vats pistol build can clear out whole areas without even being seen but will struggle inside of a rad zone. If you can get the lead for it a .44 build can be pretty good, but .45, .38 and .308 pistols are also pretty useful and variation is better
---
Still it would make some fights more fun to need to figure out what weapons to use rather than just TSE the hell outta everything...
---
scorch receiver if the only legendary effect I know of that can be applied to hunting rifle 
---
Not viable at all unless you just want it for the looks. Rifles way stronger. Do the same thing. It's just pointless to run pistols unless your doing it for RP. I've even done bloodied pistols and tse pistols and they underperform even a basic commando build. Imo. 
---
I was simply trying to pass on a tip. 
---
That was either a visual glitch or he‚Äôs in power armor where all melee weapons are held with one hand but are held with two in 1st person. There‚Äôs also a legendary prefix to swing 40% faster. There‚Äôs also a perk card that increases swing speed
---
It's easier to stand still as a ranged than a melee.
---
I was hoping it would get some attention...but damn lol
---
I'm waiting for the "I'm outside his house, looking through his dining room window after those comments... 
---
The Enclave salutes you, OP. Show no mercy to the Muties in Appalachia who want to take what's rightfully yours. 
---
Worse case, you could always nuke them into submission.
---
I try and not buy plans. I keep wasting my money buying ones I end up already knowing lol I wish they told us we already knew them somehow. 
---
Recieving, not doing. Not big on PVP
---
Maybe a power fist would be cool don‚Äôt have a lot invested into strength have a stealth rifle build but what legendary perks would be good? Faster swing speed with instigating maybe?
---
At least it's moving around properly, I'd say that's a bit less creepy than floating
---
I got two TSEs at Whitesprings and I‚Äôd still be okay with this change. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôd penalize anyone to add variety to the game.
---
That's what my plan kinda is, I've been wanting to revisit Fallout 3, and doing this series serves as a perfect way to do it. Do this as more of a trial-run, to see how editting goes, demographics, things I should focus on, etc. Then when I'm comfortable with the technical content creation aspect of it, then I can come back and try to focus on more of the creative side of things. I'm still new at this so I'm trying to get as much under my belt as I can. Thanks for the advice by the way.
---
They shouldn't have implemented such a shot one sided system if they wanted people to pvp. There's a lot of bullshit surrounding workshops as mentioned in this thread. It's awful if you don't like or want to engage in pvp. 
---
Yes, IF the person that first entered the area/triggered the spawn was lvl 50+.(easily achievable in watoga which is a rather high lvl area with not too strong enemies and many pa spawns)
---
Upvoted because some jackass downvoted you. 
---
Thanks for the feedback :)
---
The tip was appreciated
---
thanks, happened across this a few weeks ago and kept forgetting to make a post. I like to think I have a good attention to detail.
---
That's hilarious! 
---
Its good on Melee as it stacks only on single targets,, once you change target it resets, so spraying bullets can hit multiple targets and you Wouldn't benefit as you're constantly resetting.
---
He did mention framerate in his post. It obviously varies between platforms
---
Sure, I can make that my next one, what would you like to see? what areas provide what resources if they're nuked?
---
No, you're not missing anything. There's no way to tell. It's a highly requested update which the community managers have passed on. Fingers crossed. 
---
Holy cow! You found one that gives out food? I thought they never gave out any? Or is it based on high Luck?
---
You can still damage camps, which is stupid. You get an immediate wanted level for damaging a camp, which is also stupid.
---
Really? Idk why people keep downvoting my posts. Is it the way I present something? Or what?
---
Yeah I snagged one from the Converted Munitions Factory last night, first time in FO4 or FO76 and I hit up every one I see, usually only once.
---
Apologies
---
Totally agree
---
I wouldnt mind the guns being nerfed, but for PvP in the true sense, its not good having to wait until someone shoots you before you can retaliate. 
---
Hahaha, I drop my 3 nukes every cooldown, usually do a queen run between the springs drops
---
It's not exactly good feedback. I barely watched the first 30 seconds of the video.
---
It definitely should be stronger. But part of the issue I have is, you don't have to carry ammo and maintenance is a joke. Ranged weapons break too fast and require too much to maintain, especially big guns. Plus the cost of ammo at the vendors is a joke. So we have to craft our own ammo, which means half our game time is spent on maintenance. I guess there is no happy medium there and I couldn't even say how to balance that better, but there is my two cents.
---
I'd drop the game so fast it'd make your head spin...
---
Fuck that reset nonsense... 
---
Bird Bones is better. Not only because with Strange In Numbers does it make you fall with hilarious moon landing level speed, but it completely changes the game in terms of not giving a fuck about when you want to peace out from an encounter. Marsupial on the other hand will get you killed jumping off a damn single story building. 
---
For shits and giggles I had my buddy launch me off the cliff overlooking Watoga that already has a body loaded onto it. Survived a good five hundred foot catapulting. 
---
I have a couple good unarmed weapons, I have a 3 star deathclaw gaunt I don't use, want it?
---
Interesting, must be incredibly rare or perhaps it has a level limit :\\
---
All three melee perks
---
Incisor which pretty much ignores armour 
---
Legendary axe with swing speed or damage buffs
---
chems like psycho or buffout 
---
Melee can completely bypass enemy armour and deal insane damage very quickly to most opponents 
---
That means I‚Äôd have to start a brand new character to find it then. None of my mates play fallout so trading like that isn‚Äôt an option, and I‚Äôd have to hope a random at the station would accept a random invite at some point to do it. Which is a lot of work, but my only option I suppose 
---
Is it really that strong a difference in melee? Would make sense that multiplier would be the same, but it isnt for ranged weapons then.
---
Ill play with ya if you‚Äôre on PS4! I just started playing again and I‚Äôm like level 35 just roaming around the wasteland. 
---
I believe luck does play a factor but isnt required!
---
They'd most likely lose like half their players lol
---
Really? I can't speak for other people at my camp, but when I fast travel to my camp I'm in the exact same spot, facing the same way, etc 
---
I‚Äôve never seen such a game where so many people feel they need to force ‚Äúhelp‚Äù onto new players and get annoyed when it‚Äôs not appreciated.
---
The game is quite forgiving and spoon-feeds new players everything they need, and learning the ropes and finding loot is one of the only rewarding activities.
---
How the hell do i get that dog i need to know
---
what are they trying to teach?
---
Hmm not gonna lie I dont like it.
---
Shit.  Well thanks for the info.  This has been making me insane.
---
It really isn't.  I lucked into a level 45 TSE weapon at level 38... finally made 45 the other day and was like "WTF is the point of this?"  It's like walkin around with God Mod.  WTF were they thinking leaving in both of those effects.
---
They already have lost more than half. 
---
Put the power armors out, take the pieces of the armor, then scrap all the useless empty chassis. Put the armor back into your last chassis
---
I think my main has a 1* quad western I could use for the build. One thing i have read ALOT about a pistol build is the lack of armor penetration. That melee outshines all other builds guns etc. becauss of the incisor perk it has, and rifles having the tank killer perk that causes a PvP pistol build to be inefficient in PvP
---
I‚Äôd say toss them. Makes it easier for them because they don‚Äôt have to individually ban players.
---
Yeah. Unfortunately I really don't see much of a way for this to be corrected without making some group of players unhappy or quitting the game. Maybe raise the max weapon levels and really make the balance between levels a big difference. But I really just think it's fucked at this point. 
---
Or they are like me and want to earn their stuff.
---
I've wrecked a few C.A.M.P.s because the dickhole in question had the audacity to put it on my spot. Totally worth the 500 cap bounty to level some dudes house that is on my junk pile. 
---
So if that was you, sorry bud, stay off my property. 
---
Sure what are the perks?
---
Every time I want a certain suit of PA I have to guess what one. Sometimes I'm lucky and I get the right one, sometimes I have to take them all out to get the right one.
---
For me I have to switch to area if I'm talking with anyone not on my team, and team if I talk with anyone on a team. Auto seems to be borked for me.
---
Based on? 
---
Why not inject it with Karma and see how that goes? Rose would be proud 
---
Oh that's what it was... forgot about that PA with two handed weapons part.
---
Watch Ace, he talks about how he does it with a All Rise, he claims he is unbeatable and he sure looks like it

---
Woooo! So glad!
---
What platform are you on?
---
Bandwagon hate. This game has loads of happy players that re really enjoy it. Being happy doesn't earn clicks or views. Hate does
---
I use it when i want to grief a camp.
---
Get a bounty of 10, let yourself be killed in the middle of the camp,orbital strike called,no more camp and also no more bounty on you.
---
Tremendous post.
---
No problem, add me when you do get on and feel free to pop by anytime you see me on.
---
Probably just some anti-FO76 troll downvoting everything positive here. The same thing happened on the NMS subreddits during the bad early times.
---
I eat up all my inventory if i do that.  I cant store multiples of pieces on the same frame.  It just swapps it in my inventory.
---
Thank you for this.  I was pulling my hair out over this.  I have so many problems with the launcher that I had been running it as admin from the exe.  Turns out, if you don't use the launcher, some of the social options might not work.  So when I tried to start using launcher again it wouldn't work.  Thanks for posting this because if  I hadn't found it, I would not have any hair left, which would be a shame because I have great hair.
---
Now you just need to put that in the form of a pretty chart that a C level executive can understand.
---
I've gotten easily 90-100+ witb green thumb picking practically every fern in the nuked fissure prime (though it can depend on nuke placement of couser).
---
For me, to make ungodly ammounts of ammo (10k 5mm) I hunt enemies for their weapons. With Scrapper perk and a lot of weapons I get a ton of steel. For lead I go to Lucky Hole Mine with Excavator armor and rapid click loot the lead deposits. I end up with 400+ lead ore, which process into 1200 lead scrap (before Super Duper). 
---
***Does 30% more damage to animals*** 
---
I'm level 30 and still using the somerset special level 5 revolver, 50 damage is decent
---
You're someone who can get things done.  I like that. 
---
I think of they added level 60 weapons then added level 140+ mobs making the level 50 weapons really weak compared to the level 60 gear that would fix it ...
---
Oh hmm! I haven't tried it myself, I guess I shouldn't always go by hearsay.
---
Just tested this, Awareness doesn't reflect changes of resistance unfortunately.
---
ive checked every vendors mods and plans for a long time and have never seen it, only marine
---
you only need like 3 or 4 chassis, unless you plan on collecting all 6 types of power armor
---
It had a lot of bugs on release and Bethesda has had some bad press for various things. YouTube streamers are still milking it for every dollar they can because outrage gets views.
---
Yup, I can make the swift mag too. The powerful auto receiver does exist as far as I can gather. This is the information I was given by a very kind individual: 
---
"Including standard (starting) mods, for radium rifle there are: 8 barrels, 7 stocks, 7 magazines, 4 muzzles, 17 receivers, and 9 sights"
---
I've got up to the tuned reciver so far for damage, I'm still looking for the hardened receiver and suppressor. It's not what I'd call a fun adventure but it seems learning these mods has become my Fallout 76. I nearly gave up looking last night but Atom sent me a radium rifle in a loot chest and I knew I should go on. Praise Atom!
---
Why not use both? ;)
---
then i shall continue my syringing! 
---
Scrap all your empty frames, they are essentially worthless.
---
 Yes! Shoot it and hide . No one will know. ;)
---
So you get 2 caps for a 4 star legendary instead of 1?
---
You should be scrapping those too then. You only need 1 set of power armor. You absolutely don't need 5 torsos, 10 legs, and 8 arms or whatever it is you are holding on to. Power armor pieces are super common, not to mention all the permanent respawns in the world so you could quickly grab one if you wanted. 
---
Ahh, ok. Have you guys run into something like the creature I found?
---
As stated before, the existence of the bug in the 1st place IS Bethesda‚Äôs fault. 
---
You CHOICE to hop servers, while OVERWEIGHT, while KNOWING full well what this bug can do, and knowing you would respawn near a FREQUENTLY nuked zone, makes this particular situation YOUR fault.
---
I know I sound like an unsympathetic asshole, sorry for that. You could play the game for 10 years and this situation won‚Äôt happen again. If I wasn‚Äôt so bored at work I wouldn‚Äôt even be arguing with you. But, for fuck sake, don‚Äôt logout/hop while overweight. 
---
Somerset special
---
That will have you set for a while
---
I work in corporate IT, and programming is one of the things I do.  It's actually incredibly tough balancing the little things with the big things.  The big things(ie fixing dupe exploits) are way more important.  You want to fit in the little things, but sometimes that little thing you think will be easy ends up being way harder than anticipated, and/or breaks something else.  Generally you focus on the big things, and scratch something off of the little thing list when you need a break/in between big things.
---
And the little thing list here is quite long, so it's going to take quite a while for them all to get addressed.
---
What I assumed - thank you for the verification 
---
Don't forget to check the grips
---
Acid you can pretty much sell for whatever you want if you find high schoolers dumb and desperate enough
---
Because being angry sells click.
---
Cheaters. Probably 99% of all 2SEs are duped.
---
I really enjoy mine as a crafter/utility player. I also sneak quite a bit. Dropped a few points in rifles, but might swap over to automatics with a sub machine gun or similar for RP purposes. 
---
The main danger is getting swamped, so I play pretty tactically, with mines, nades, and good positioning 
---
XBOX. No one moan 
---
Alot of players have experienced a wide range of issues including completely game breaking ones.
---
Right? 
---
Where were you when ~~diarrhea~~ the nuke first striked ? 
---
I've been one-shotted by this and it was at a distance.
---
I just got railway rifle plan from Harpers vendor and my alt toon was 18th level \*shrugs\*
---
Players buying them for caps or real currency from dupers.
---
Funny that there is a legendary effect that deals 10% more damage to players, which could be 200% more damage and it would still be worse than explosive for almost any weapon.
---
That would be a very simple and easily do-able option. 
---
&gt; You can make fusion cores
---
That's the most pointless use of Flux in the game since it's so easy to find more fusion cores than you can burn even if you live in PA. 
---
Real life luck stat. 
---
As long as pvp is strictly opt out and optional then idc what they do with it.... Right now the only change I care about is that pacifist mode makes your base immune to pvp or free to repair. 
---
TIL I'm no one üòÖ
---
Haters gonna hate.
---
I ran into it for the first time today as well! It was over lvl 50 and something like "vengeful mothman" ... its attacks are persistant and really disorient you so took a while to beat 
---
What does passive have to do with it? That affects YOUR outgoing damage only. As long as PvP has not been initiated in some way, any incoming damage stays the same regardless of your Pacifist settings
---
You can find bos officer underarmour blueprint on railroad in between NAR repair yard and watoga train station.
---
The only one i can use is the raider set.  So I should scrap the X01 arms and helmet, the t51 arms and torso and the few other partial sets before I level enough to use them?
---
They will get phased out naturally since you cant upgrade a weapons level the first level cap increase will make almost all 50 weapons weak in comparison and eventually phase them out with weight and space limitations
---
Maybe I got lucky then, because it just sat still not doing anything even when I attacked it
---
 The reason my X0-1 torso will be level 40 till I get another Jet Pack.
---
It went to the same training camp as ScorchBeast. /S
---
But Microsoft don't offer support because their clients might lose money, they do it because if they don't then *they* will lose money. The same is true of Bethesda, as proven by your 'If you don't like it don't buy it' stance.
---
Why are you focusing on impact to the customer and not impact to the supplier? Software-as-a-service support and SLAs are there for customer retention, not as some sort of bonus to help them not lose money.
---
Thats legit, haven't made my way over yet. I should actually just play the game for a while, huh? Lol
---
For real. It‚Äôs baffling that they seemingly used Fallout 4 to test the settlement mechanic, but there‚Äôs lots of building pieces in that game that weren‚Äôt brought over. The option of doorways just the width of the door without a huge frame would be nice, too. 
---
It shows resistances from a perk card change (tank killer, stabilized). That‚Äôs it. I was hoping it‚Äôd show resistances from weapon changes (piercing/perforating magazines) but it doesn‚Äôt, 
---
Hey man great write up, quick question for you. 
---
I personally love the look of the scout armor, but I‚Äôm running an unarmed power fist build that deals heavily in mutations. I‚Äôm currently using a full set of self crafted level 45 deep pocketed marine assault armor, is it even worth trying to pursue the scout if I already have marine armor? Or are there other benefits to the scout armor I‚Äôm missing? 
---
Thanks! 
---
The same thing happened to me.  I dropped a rifle I didnt want anymore and no bag.  Later I noticed I had 4 power armor chassis in my inventory (instead of 3).  When I checked, it had duplicated an entire set of excavator amour.  I didnt feel right keeping it so I just left it at the edge of a nuke zone.  Thanks for posting, this kind of clears up what I already suspected.
---
Different colors, same model
---
Got one from the flatwoods machine today. 
---
Coming back to this comment just to ask, can you recommend any actually organised "golf raiding" groups, as you put it?
---
I really want to make nuke farming super efficient and run nice with an organised team but it's always just mayhem with randoms. I'm on PC if that helps
---
Tbh i run about even off trades, more often at a loss, and at best i  sit at about 7 - 8k caps max.
---
Not sure how anyone has max caps, I just want to be able to buy the 11k signs, lol
---
Thanks! Doing this asap
---
There‚Äôs two different ones. But yeah, idk
---
I got lucky with buying mods at the Enclave Bunker, 2 jet packs, 2 calibrated shocks, I traded for my TSE Weapons. I did find one tho, off SBQ, the .308 Light Machine Gun. Don‚Äôt use it much because ammo isn‚Äôt as plentiful as 5mm and 50cal. 
---
Yea nah, I'm just gathering information to give to Bethesda at this point. Benefit of him giving his character his actual username.
---
Agreed; that‚Äôs a clean fix after they fix duping.
---
Had to look it up because I am out about... Zealot's is the prefix
---
rip!! I‚Äôm on PS4. well, good luck finding good drops
---
When you die from radiation at the same time you get the mutation, a bug prevents you from actually benefitting from that mutation. It doesn't show up in the mutation list and if you get all other mutations you still won't get the one that's missing from the list.
---
The only fix so far is to get rid of the missing mutation. Radaway until the moniker appears that you've been cured from the mutation (that you don't actually have) then you're free to farm it again.
---
This happened to me with marsupial, I farmed for several days know this had happened to me, read up on it, dumped all my mutations and during the process it said I was cured of marsupial.
---
I mean x01 can easily be crafted once you do most of the main story. Hell I'd craft it for you for free once you hit level 50 if you're on xbox. The other sets you can just find at permanent respawns once you're high enough level. 
---
You'll most likely do the excavator power armor quest st level 25 and then use that until you're 50. That's when you'll choose which main set you want. 
---
Don't go and throw all the stuff away just because I'm telling you too, if you really want it. I'm just saying most power armor has permanent spawns thst you can just google. Right now it sounds like all your armor is just taking up space
---
I had a TS 3 star rifle drop at level 31 from a mutant in Garrahan once, but everything else has been one star and not very good
---
Where's the golf club? Is it the resort? Where all the vendors are!
---
I had to server hop all night one time to get the full T-51b level 50 set. Many hours. I wouldn't be scrapping or throwing it away. By the end of it I had my full set and other almost complete set on my last hop I needed 1 piece and found two sets close to each other with most of the pieces. I took the pieces from the obscure location and put them on the one at the crashed Vertibird, so the next person who was server hopping or stumbled onto it was saved a lot of trouble.
---
Yea, that's not right. I very clearly remember not placing my camp 30 feet past the edge of a cliff.
---
I‚Äôm on xbox
---
My ign is ZoreanderGaming 
---
Your name still appears if the crosshair goes over you, plus you can still notice the blur

Oh I‚Äôm on Xbox but appreciate the offer, I‚Äôll look for it
---
Cry babies love to tell the world how outraged they are.
---
Yeah, the very first time I met Mothman he was lurking on the tracks north of Charleston at night and just stared me down while I panicked and unloaded everything into him.  The second time we met, it was the Vengeful Mothman and he was NOT a happy creature...
---
Keep an eye out for shadowy figures and listen for wings, you'll be seeing Mothy again.
---
The short answer is duping.  Of course not everyone dupes them, and not all of them are duped directly by the person using it, but the vast majority of the ones sold on the secondary market were duped at least once along the line.  
---
The longer answer is there's no natural decay mechanic or way to remove items from circulation.  And in a game where everything is infinitely repairable and infinitely tradable and duping is as blatant as it is in FO76 right now, it's only a matter of time until everyone has one.
---
There was a lot of hate from the very beginning from a lot of people that either never played, or had intended on hating it based on what the game was (multiplayer focused rather than PVP, no server selection, no offline mode, no human NPCs, etc). Honestly most of the hate was utter BS. All the features were fairly well explained from the very beginning and the bugs weren't really any worse than previous Bethesda games (like server disconnects which, while frustrating, really didn't break the game).
---
They definitely made some questionable PR decisions, which the hate for that was just, but the actual game is great. 
---
PSN is Powwhackbang if you guys are looking for some help.  level 45 or so.
---
I've only seen it a handful of times really, man. But the first time I was blown away, so I started doing it myself. We should get a group together, man
---
Someone killed him
---
It's possible to cover the golf club, lodges, train station and the area just behind the safe 'n clean disposal where the sap and bean pods are all at once if you place it well enough.
---
Invisibility only works on other players, enemies see through it, I suppose they smell you. 
---
I have a left and right like that makes me invisible together they are more effective from what I've seen
---
+ str, swing speed, bloodied
---
normally i would agree with you, but in this game the materials that people claim those workshops for are very nearly essential for enjoying the *rest* of the non-PvP aspects of the game, and considering it's just as easy for the aggressor to hop servers as the victim, i really don't think it's completely unthinkable for people to complain about this, because it is a *shit* system, everything about PvP in this game is fucked up and unbalanced and i personally think it needs a serious rework, dedicated PvP/PvE servers (and a server *browser* at all &gt;_&gt;), or just scrap PvP entirely
---
As someone else said the "winner" of a pvp dispute over a workshop has nothing to do with skill or gear, rather it's all about who is the most stubborn (i.e., who has the most time, which some people have precious little of) and that's just a straight up *bad* system and i'm kind of sick of seeing people defend it; it doesn't deserve to be defended, it deserves to be fixed
---
I sometimes have enemies that are stuck and not attacking me. Depending on how tough they are (e.g. how fast I kill them) they can get unstuck by teleporting a short distance which will fix them. 
---
I've never seen a Mothman stuck! I did run into a red eyes vengeful Mothman once at Whitesprings (when the nukes were broken) but I was too weak to kill him. 
---
I saw another red eyes one from far away around level 11 and used my camera to zoom in and take pictures, he poofed away when I got close. This was in the hills northeast of the museum. 
---
There is also an event where if you complete it you will be rewarded with a visit from a Wise Mothman with purple eyes. he sticks around and you can take photos with him. 
---
Oh f\*ck no :O 
---
There is two different places. The golf CLUB where all the ghouls spawn and the RESORT where the vendors are lol people don't get that there are two different places named two different things
---
Do you need to have credit card info on file to buy ATOM stuff? if so, you should go on a spending spree!
---
He spawns at my base sometimes.  As has a "flatwoods monster".  And because it's Bethesda, where they both spawned I also get technical data spawning on the floor that I can't pick up.  Strange.  
---
the comparison is crass but you're essentially saying women shouldn't go out because there are rapists out there.
---
OK, sure. next time I'll think twice about doing something completely un-noteworthy because it may break the game in terrible ways.
---
Tell me about it. But it does add a decent enough amount of caps to the sell price and I can't afford the weight to store extra weapons in my stash. The extra caps at least fund fast travelling.
---
Will do! I missed a nuke and the first Ghoul which crashed me was a 2 stars glowing legendary. No idea why I had my Tesla equipped then. Probably selected the wrong weapon on the wheel. How the heck does this kind of bug happen? Thank you for the answer, I would have struggled to determine what was causing this. 
---
Endangerol barrel for syringer reduces a target's damage def by 25%
---
He‚Äôs wearing PA he‚Äôs a complete noob 
---
That's what I'm getting at. I'm working my way towards 10k caps which I would gladly give for the item I'm requesting. It's honestly the only other weapon I am really after. The huge TSE craze is kinda silly (as I write a post where I list it as an option). It's like if your gear is not TSE or at least have explosive dont bother posting it. I mean I get it, it's the highest output for damage but the single star 2shot weapons, even furious or instigating, when used right can end a scorch beast in about 10 seconds. 
---
Ok cool
---
Lmao couldn‚Äôt have said it better myself 
---
Did you get the ultrice armor
---
I do this.  It helps a bit with high-resistance SBQ's, but isn't enough if there aren't many of you.  
---
Ultracite
---
He doesn't allow to switch in glow sights 3 which I think is a big mistake. No point trying to min max little things when you will be doing a massive 60% less damage in a lot of scenarios
---
Only level 81 here, I found a two shot Gatling gun and an explosive pump action with double ammo capacity, as well as an explosive ultracite laser. I feel truly blessed. TSE almost seems excessive.
---
A thank you for clearing that up
---
yup, b/c people are assholes. Welcome to FO76. 
---
My camp is on a cliff side near almost no resources, but close enough to a couple places that I can loot for a little plastic or steel for armor repair. I doubt anyone else has built there.
---
I‚Äôm kind of amazed they found it. Though one other time some dude with a stealth suit was waiting in my camp for me to come home so he could try to force me to play hide and seek or destroy.
---
What level are you? 
---
This just seems unfair overall lol jetpack, mutations, legendaries, etc he didn't stand a chance. Level 58 is 8 levels into the end game.
---
Does it last more seconds?  And do the mobs stop attacking at all?
---
duping
---
I suggested in the past that Bethesda should put maximums on individual items; e.g., 500 steel scrap (just a random number I used - not suggesting that exact number should be used). Any more than that gets deleted. 
---
You have 100,000 stimpacks?  Yeah...next login those go away.  You know have 200.   
---
Pros:
---
Run speed, light weapons (without perk card), low Vats cost/shot, Vats headshot machine, huge AP pool, black powder pistol
---
Cons:
---
Average damage, slow fire rate for semi (revolvers), ammo burn (automatics)
---
On paper your damage looks like üí©, but you can practically live in Vats and rarely miss. 
---
What do you mean?
---
I wish... doesn't look like it. He probably just spent atom I woulda earned through gameplay in all likelihood.
---
Yeah same.
---
I mean, I get it, but it would be nice if something else could get nuked every now and then. 
---
"Can you make me a laser Gatling gun?"  
---
Me: sure ezpz  
---
"Can you make me a slightly bigger death tambourine?"  
---
Me: nOPE not smart enough
---
Patrol Duty is the one in the airport right?
---
Is this the first time you've played a game with an inventory limit? I'm level 50 and I've never had a problem that wasn't due to my own hoarding
---
On Fallout4 there was a Dogmeat method to duping,,, for me it made wierd stuff happen to that game save,,, i dred to think of the extent it is affecting the game servers internally.
---
There's a museum to the creature in Point Pleasant that's worth visiting. Be sure to look around carefully for a stairway leading down for more mystery.
---
Prison. 
---
Does that mean that chameleon and stealth boy don't prevent mobs from seeing you?
---
Found a 2 shot lever action from farming ghouls at white springs 
---
And you're 100% positive that load of TSE weapons that were randomly given to you weren't duped by the original owners?
---
I've had randoms give me legendaries too, but always low level (matching my own at the time) and never TSE, usually just whatever random effect spawned on that weapon. But I also haven't played in the last 3 weeks since this new duping glitch has become a real problem.
---
The fact that so many have just been handed away to you didn't rouse your suspicion?
---
Pretty sure with how OP TSE is that people wouldn't be handing them away (even low level ones) unless they had a fuck tonne to spare.
---
Yeah... It isn't cheating at all if you let other people do the duping for you and just sit back and reap the rewards.
---
Same thing goes for buying them at vendors (who do you think sold them to the vendor in the first place).
---
But you know, whatever helps you sleep at night.
---
Is there a list of what he can sell and for how much?  
---
Bethesda needs to nerf TSE or better yet eliminate it altogether. A lot of assholes would leave the game and never come back. 
---
Every time someone fucks with me, it's some douche in X01 armor with  a TSE. 
---
It's getting wore and taking the fun out of the game. 
---
Headshots in vats overcomes most of the lack of armor pen. 
---
You're getting downvoted because 400 was definitely too low. 600 should've been the standard. 
---
Storage issues nowadays are more sus... But back during the 400 days that was insanely tight.
---
Gotcha.  I didnt know PA respawned or that you could craft it.   I was a hoarder in the previous fallouts.  Massive workshops displaying full sets of every PA and variant paint schemes.  Having to adjust is difficult for me. 
---
I have heard that it's better to only take the first level of the Slugger perks rather than maxing them all because it's better to have space for other things.
---
I have maxed the "fix your armor and weapons when enemies hit you or you hit them" perks because as a melee my armor tends to break a lot and when my weapons break I'm quickly screwed. 
---
 I also use the life saving perks where it uses Stimpaks if you're about to die. This is helpful again because of how close we get to enemies. 
---
Ones that prevent diseases from critters are also good. Many diseases affect strength and disease cures are pretty rare. I get diseases a lot being close to enemies. 
---
Other than those, I like perks for reducing weight of things or increasing carry weight. 
---
I am still working on my build but will likely get a bunch of mutations, too, with starched genes.
---
Oh yeah, i'm sure selling their infinitely-available top tier weapons for real cash has been an absolute downer. 
---
lmao no it's not illegal. it's against the terms of service. bethesda isn't the US government, as dysfunctional as the company is.
---
You can find them in decent amounts, I made a post awhile back about how you want to let the legendary enemies regain health after they hit the halfway mark because it effects loot drop for some reason. 
---
Bethesda released a live-service game without the proper support infrastructure in place as a shameless Christmas market cash grab. The game would have been better served with 6 more months in development but instead the studio decided that selling a boatload of copies in a broken state with a hilariously priced in-game cash shop was the right move.
---
Off the back of this the rabid fanbase decided that anyone who didn't enjoy the game was either not playing it properly or had been suckered into some insidious conspiracy to lie about how bad the game is in order to generate revenue through reviews.
---
And the Miguel camp Protection hums to himself and wishes that Miguel would be torn apart by wolves so that he could leave that spot.
---
Yeah read about a pistol vat crit build. Pretty much a crit proc machine snd builds the vat crit meter prettt vast.
---
It's been difficult for a lot of people since normally we hoard everything. Just google whatever power armor you're looking for. It's a lot easier to get than you think. It's the fancy mods that can be rare 
---
I'm not sure why, I'm loving it.
---
I have the same questions about Cloaking armor (not Chameleon). It seems completely useless if you just blink into stealth for a few seconds when hit.
---
As with screws, I‚Äôve imagined that you need a specific size of spring only found in certain objects. Screws, you need a size and pitch. Very specific parts needed is the way I‚Äôve justified this in my head, and it‚Äôs pretty legit. Not perfect but a decent enough explanation in a world that respawns items and hordes of enemies appear out of thin air. 
---
There are individual server shitdowns
---
Many implementations of surround sound reserve the center channel specifically for voice or certain things.
---
By "center channel" I mean the actual center channel and not front left/front right at all.
---
Its possible FO76's implementation uses something different than the other games you're playing.
---
I've no idea but it's damn annoying. Took me a long time to work out what was causing it and I was pretty miffed when I worked it out since it was really enjoying that gun.
---
If you have power armour on, put it in third person and charge the gun, that's what made me think to stash of for a while and see if the crashes stopped.
---
Probably just server-specific. My server has been fine and not gone down at all.  Just relog into another server?
---
Those work as long as they haven't noticed you before those trigger. The invisible after melee attack is really just a PVP thing, even though they don't say it that way. 
---
I think you bought the wrong game... You should watch the promotional footage again where players are skipping and dancing to the beach boys with their pet Deathclaw...
---
You blew up a hippy.home.
---
Theres a list floating around that gives a cheap route to travel to hit them all. Whitesprings all shares 200, but the bunker has its own 200
---
I heard this for the first time last night couldn't help but laugh 
---
What happens if you leave it in a public box when the server resets.
---
Stealth Boy seems to be true invisibility, Chameleon is a bit more questionable. It works well on players, at least.
---
There was a lot of hate before launch and during the first few weeks that focused on the bag issue and bugs.
---
But even if you leave aside many bugs in the game you'll find something that is of less quality than other survival/story themed games. They tried to make a game which did everything but did nothing particularly well.
---
Broken economy, buggy servers, boring story, tired game mechanics combine to make a game that no one likes.
---
It makes sense. When you walk around the nuke itself in the red room during the silo run, you're around the same spot on the map as the blast door itself. 
---
You need to pass it to a friend or rejoin the same server and use a world container.  The latter method is a bit more risky though.  To rejoin the same server you need to take a look at other IGNs and join their server (on PC it requires you to add them as a friend first).
---
it oy takes up 10 pounds. that's hardly anything. 
---
Different types of map. The vending machine ones are for a node that gives some mineral resources. Treasure maps you go to the location shown on the map and look for the mound to dig.
---
I always steal everyone's acid, they never lock extractors
---
I had noticed that a while ago and I think I recall reading your post too and was nodding an agreement the whole time lol. 
---
Thx
---
I have gotten then from two different ones...
---
The Race track and power plant
---
Bethesda just messed up. Did you know you can't even buy a copy of the game for a friend on pc?
---
Is this on ps4 can‚Äôt find a world 
---
I might convert to atom if he is crackin down on these dupers 
---
I would agree except something loud like a generator is still quiet when directly in front, which to me indicates that it probably should be coming out the center, yet there's nothing there (just a much quieter sound from the front L/R channels).
---
So u just look at the picture on the ‚Äútreasure map‚Äù and find that area and look around for a mound to ‚Äúexcavate?‚Äù
---
It just doesn't fit sir!
---
Or you could just do this... https://youtu.be/7QGdDZgBjfs
---
lol what 
---
Yes PS4, but am making it back in now.
---
Or Google the solutions. Your choice, but yes.
---
Make sure you have the Stached Genes equipped first.
---
Then follow some guide on youtube and farm for Marsupial.
---
I got mine in 15 minues.
---
This is the one I followed: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzN5TESLFR4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzN5TESLFR4)
---
Bandwagon, bugs &amp; glitches, no NPC's, potato battery servers, stash limit, small visual upgrades, and some just dont like the feel of the game and it's story. 
---
Lol.  Didn‚Äôt know u could.     I like a challenge.   Thanx :) 
---
Trying that, thank you. Never seen this happen with the 5 minute timer except for actual server-wide maintenance.
---
Is there an easier way to access Photo Mode? You mention using a camera, is that a thing in the game?
---
Sometimes my crit fills the meter.. at most it takes 4 shots with a revolver, 5 with a 10mm. Swap to black powder for a critical. KA-fuckin-BOOM!
---
Seriously we took down a total of 10 scotched beasts today. After the first two t remembered I had s Gatling plasma. 
---
When a beast lands, and your just nailing it with the Gatling plasma it‚Äôs health just goes down so fast.
---
This is good, when/if open pvp happens these landmarks become ways to attract pvp. Self made pvp maps, maybe even some ‚Äúcapture‚Äù mechanics, etc etc.
---
Cheers. I have never witnessed that before so had no idea. With the amount of time I spend playing this game I am surprised I have not had it happen before.
---
No, if its using that implementation of surround sound that is exactly what should happen. The center channel will play some environmental sounds at a very reduced volume but its used almost exclusively for voices/dialogue or maybe even sound effects (like navigation menus)
---
Funny implementation for a game with no human NPCs though.
---
In a game studio in Texas there is a world-building team that did an amazing job.
---
Well I know what I'm about to do all I can find are the mods which are nice if you have the materials which I don't 
---
I do. You ain't stealing my acid. 
---
Selling infinite top tier weapons for real cash? Being able to perpetually have the effect of whatever serums you want? Endless availability of caps to buy every possible blueprint? 
---
thathappen 
---
2 handed melee perks of slugger, I have only 2 ranks of each and one 3 ranked and I deal sufficient damage which gives me more room for other perks. Incisor 3 ranks, martial artist rank 3.
---
Radicool in endurance for extra strength when rads affect you and solar powered 3 ranks. That‚Äôs your melee build done.
---
Someone dropped off a legendary death tambo that has like 40% faster speed and it‚Äôs a murderer. Sucks it can‚Äôt be used in power armor. 
---
Anyone know what park cards enhance it? Is it one handed or fist?
---
Gatling plasma with the beam focuser is great but the special effects need to improve across the board because with a weapon that looks like that you would expect bigger orbs of destruction.
---
As a guy who relishes the opportunity to bash whitesprings ghouls heads in with my ghoul slayers tambo, I felt this 
---
Try claiming a bunch of workshops and defend them too. That leaves you with a lot of plans.
---
Lucky you, add a quick nap and some cranberry juice and you have a fat 600xp per bloated glowing one for a quick level up
---
Depends how many glowing blood packs you've used
---
I will thanks for the advice 
---
I'd suggest watching the trade pages way more closely.  I list all original 1-3* weapons and armor and so do others on there!
---
There is, but for some reason (Totally not money) people are repeatedly lying about the game
---
It seems to work, not not very well. I.e. If you're being attacked, they'll keep hitting you. 
---
They'll eventually start shooting / coming to your general area and shooting at you, but not hitting.
---
Honestly, I'll probably ditch it. 
---
Also it doesn't work on players, at least if you're wanted. Even if you're stealthed it shows wanted over you.
---
Yeah so I play on PC with a knockoff XBox 360 controller. For me I press start to view the map and then Y to enter photo mode. 
---
In photo mode you can move the camera the same way you move your character around. This includes up, down, back, forward, etc. So I use it to see things further away by pushing my camera up in the air and then forward as far as it will go. If you reduce the field of view in the camera settings, it will give a zoomed in effect.
---
I just lost my Last Bastion on this. Fuck my life. 
---
Do you fast travel and wait? Or keep fast travelling back and forth?
---
I love the set I have the urban set each piece modded with deep pocketed and polymer and the shielded under armor and it didn't really take that long.  The weight from the armor is actually pretty low for the DR is provides.
---
What‚Äôs even more frustrating? Seeing all these posts about mods getting used for crafting and wondering why people don‚Äôt make sure they have enough steel (or whatever resource) when crafting so they don‚Äôt scrap their mods?
---
Steel is so easy to get. 
---
Yeah I‚Äôve lost lots of mods because of this shit 
---
If you built it it would leave with you. If it‚Äôs in game it would stay for 15-30 min until the server refreshed the container. Then poof.
---
It lasts long enough with the 200% repair with decent usage time and the damage is surprisingly good if you have the two shot version with perks. 
---
You tried
---
Enjoy your tricycle, kiddo
---
What do you all think about this build?
---
[https://odealo.com/articles/fallout-76-the-unstoppable-melee-tank-build-odealo](https://odealo.com/articles/fallout-76-the-unstoppable-melee-tank-build-odealo)
---
That's the worst one 
---
 I was not hunting a wanted. I declined revenge but went back to fight again and he was gone. Then I noticed where he was.
---
 Your people should be wanted after attacking your CAMP and be completely unable to see anyone.
---
Well dialog is dialog regardless of human or super mutants or robot origin, bet that's besides the point. If they're reserving the center for dialog then the front L/R channels should be receiving full levels for anything front center, yet they're not. Anything different would be a pretty moronic design as all front facing audio would be at a reduced level compared to sides/backs.
---
Those better not be female presenting nipples. I‚Äôm calling tumblr.
---
Top 3 reasons:
---
3. It's buggy.
---
2. It's not Fallout 5.
---
1. Youtubers told them not to like it.
---
They stopped as it was the basis of one of the duplication glitches that was way to easy
---
If you‚Äôre playing melee, consider modding your power armor arms with Optimized Bracers, which makes power attacks much cheaper in AP and fusion core usage.
---
I think the last time I killed the queen it only used 1-2 cores for the whole fight (super sledge and Gatling gun).
---
Yep. It says "dirt mound, dig" when you find the mound. Some look like dirt mounds but for others the textures are broken and it will look like flat grass. 
---
Note, you don't need a shovel.
---
I watch it pretty consistently and I keep finding the same weapons or people not accepting caps with inventories full of TSE weapons which whatever. I've got bazaar and market tagged, any other pages to go to? Do you personally or know anyone on PS4 doing what you are doing? 
---
&gt; A proper beta doesnt start 2 weeks pre release, a beta is to fix bugs.
---
That's not the only things a beta does, and those aren't required for a beta. Betas also stress test servers, they help identify issues (Because things can't be instantly fixed, contrary to what moron ten year olds believe), etc
---
Because the supplier really isn't important. Like I said a store might be able to send unsold copies back and individual stores probably didn't order many more past preorders. Online retailers would be hit the hardest but again might be able to send unsold copies back. If you're so unhappy with the game read the terms of service. They might have a way for you to get your money back. It might involve an arbitrator and you being banned but you'll get your money back. You might have to agree to never purchase a Bethesda game again. 
---
As for the customer service you're right. They do it to keep the customer so they buy again. That's not just software. That's business and businesses take holidays off. They may still have customer service offices open, but programmers are most likely off. They've already said they have future updates planned and will be out this month. How is that an issue for you? They're still fixing things. Just not as quick as you want. This is a video game you paid for once. You're not paying monthly and this isn't some software that can cost someone else's business lots of money. It's not running something that is keeping someone alive.  It's a game. Get over it and move on. 
---
I mean the idea is that unarmed is a special type of melee combat for no power armor.  This lets them, "theoretically", balance those weapons differently.
---
The last thing we need is more melee power armor tbh.
---
I'm not concerned about the down voting, I'm not offended lol all I'm saying is 400 isn't a problem if you manage what you need properly. Sure, more is better, I'm not gonna say it's wrong to have more, but the limits were in place to force you to think I'm survival terms. Take what you need, carry the food and aid you need, ammo, etc. There's a money penalty to fast traveling, so it is a driving force to keep your weight limits down. 
---
The previous games in the series, yeah, I stocked up on God knows what and stored everything. Those games also lacked the survival focus that this one has. It's meant to force you to micromanage your inventory. Not the most fun mechanic, but neither is buying a plan and realizing you already learned it.
---
The mechanics work if you let them work, if you go into the mindset of previous entries then yes it's a huge pain in the ass. Bulk and sell what you don't and travel light. Excavator PA for look and scrap runs, trade legendaries that don't compliment your build, scrap weapons you don't need, etc. All I'm saying is that 400 is doable with planning, and 600 is plenty.
---
Fifth.
---
Fifthed?!
---
It really comes down to how they've implemented or tested it. I doubt its a technical fault though, probably just another buggy untested part of the game.
---
You'd hope they include surround balance or surround profiles though so each player can get what they prefer.
---
Seems you had the water in South East Georgia
---
Naked headless scorched girls mmmm
---
Awesome thanx.   Also would u happen to know if there is a brighter or larger headlamp for the excavator PA?
---
They do have a small amount of weight. I recently dropped several thousand and gained a couple pounds of inventory space. 
---
I never go out of my way to find him because his inventory is garbage but when I do find him its random.
---
There's also a Black Cowboy Hat on a skull up on a pole at the upper end of The Freak Show raider camp. Look out for Deathskull Radscorpions if high level players are in the area.
---
Yeah, I know how to use Photo Mode, but I was wondering if there's another, more simplified way to use Photo Mode? Like a hotkey or something?
---
There is a mod for it. I haven't found it yet myself.
---
Boo! Who makes a post like this without testing.
---
Ideally I'm hoping to hear from somebody who has a similar setup and can tell me what they are experiencing.
---
Ok cool.   Thanx again :) 
---
Great idea, ban everyone and if they don't want to start over they *must've* been exploiters anyway..
---
Probably. I would have to Google it myself.
---
Im always up for saturday nights and late friday as well as other times but not as often
---
Near 
---
Regardless of what anyone tries to claim about this being an issue with your internet, it's not. The servers are almost universally unstable and you can lag the server severely by just using a crafting bench for its intended purpose.
---
Suck my cock
---
These don't do anything (right now at least). They are also farm-able by server hopping and picking up one that re-spawns at the Thunder Mountain Power Plant Yard in one of the tents outside (on a table next to a T45 arm piece).
---
So toss it.
---
Did you find the buildings you can walk through and swim through 
---
Sounds good to me! 
---
I honestly prefer to miss the golf club. I find the train of 20 people all trying to get hits then not picking up all the loot tends to put to much load on the server makung it hard to pick flowers.
---
Nuka Dingo if you're on Xbone.
---
Happen to have the link for this. I would love to read the whole thing. I find this interesting. 
---
Every time I'm in there I fight a Wendigo. Apparently the laser grid doors were only meant to keep me out.
---
We had a wendigo at the end when we did the caves.
---
I'm not going to be back online tonight unfortunately. Ill try to get them to you tomorrow if you still need them. 
---
Railroad spike?
---
Any chance you‚Äôd sell the tse lever action? Or trade for something other than Gatling gun?
---
This is the point the creator of this post and many people misconstrue about the negative things people have to say about this game.
---
If it remains buggy, it's going to attract negative commentary indefinitely.
---
It's not up to the playerbase to fix these issues, Bethesda just doesn't care at all and doesn't make any effort to show that they do.
---
Now that‚Äôs a clever idea. 
---
If you need any farmable materials, hit me up! 
---
I found a tse shotgun level 45 from the breach and clear event in the south west.    about an hour or two later i got a TSE dragons breath from the mine event thats right next to whitespring.
---
You already need both sides confirmation. When you offer up an item that's you confirming, you offered it. Then they accept the item at whatever price you listed, that's them confirming.
---
What system are you on? I play on PC are hardly ever have crashes.
---
Filthed?
---
No witch hunting
---
Fast travel and just check along the road. There's a small wooden bridge to the East that I found him stuck on 3 times, so worth just having a look up to there. If he wasn't there I just left the area, did something else and returned after 10-15 minutes.
---
I've seen her scale up to 1k resistances so it is quite significant. Makes me wonder if it stacks and I'll try to test it somehow. Also makes me wonder if perhaps 'Anti-Armor' would infact be better than 'Two-Shot'? I've yet to see Anti-Armor Explosive though!
---
I think he means fast travel reduces CND.
---
I am responsible for myself and what I do, not for what others are doing.  I know people are jerks and do that kind of thing, I however do not. I take a lot of pride in how I play and the fact that I am always trying to help the lower levels.
---
So I sleep just fine thanks. :)
---
When you‚Äôre fighting a scorched beast queen and do a repair on the fly you tend to not check your stash for how much steel you have
---
They have a huge downside. It‚Äôs real easy to kill your self with them. I got a level 20 tse pipe rifle and that thing has killed me like 20 times
---
Don't know what to tell ya... I use market76 the most.  All my 1-3* non TSE are 500 OBO on PC.  You say ppl look for these weapons but many end up vendored or left for noobs because almost nobody buys them from me.  More lately because of the anti-TSE bandwagon I'm guessing.
---
I feel like this is an anti-war game. It makes me want to skip nuclear annihilation, anyhow.
---
Hi! I plan on launching nukes over the next couple of days. I need a team for my rad sponge kick in. Are you still looking for people to play with?
---
&gt;You already need both sides confirmation. When you offer up an item that's you confirming, you offered it. Then they accept the item at whatever price you listed, that's them confirming.
---
Oh, weird it didn't feel that way but that may be the fact that it's still very new to me as it was my first time actually doing it.  Just felt a little clunky to me and a bit hard to understand.  Actually felt a little under pressure during the trade because of it lol!
---
Honestly I would love to see all the hidden and obscure game mechanics, not just damage.
---
Like what is my total AP regen (diminishing returns with some perks stacking).  What is my actual rad resistance (hidden rad bonuses from PA/Hazmat).  A visual indicator of weapon class (10mm smg with no stock is still a rifle).  This would also track down bugs when something is supposed to be a Heavy Weapon for example but perks aren't being applied correctly (last patch broke bear arms and auto grenade launcher).  
---
There is a lot more stuff like that is only currently possible to figure out with a lot of in-game testing/guessing.
---
I‚Äôll be working but I‚Äôll probably find them at the White spring
---
Silo solo you get less robots to destroy than if you're in a group. All you need to a good ammount of healing, enough food and water to last about 2 hours max, decent weapons and armour (PA reccomended). Having the 3 lock picking cards as well as the 3 hacker cards helps a lot as well as having at least 20 circuitry and steel in your stash so you don't have to run around the place to replace the cores needed for the last door.
---
Oh sweet summer child
---
Gather theoretical information. 
---
Share so others can use. 
---
Proceed to time consuming testing. 
---
Post results as they come in. 
---
I didn‚Äôt say ban. Just ignore the idiots after the wipe. People like to pretend they legitimately got their 2SEs. It‚Äôs not hard to spot the duper when buying it off someone for 5K caps and seeing a butt-load of the same item in their inventory. 
---
PA (power armour) is no good for pvp the guy in the video has no idea what he is doing 
---
üò°üò°üò°
---
This seems like a reasonable solution.
---
You can still go in prepared knowing what can happen. I mean how hard is it to have around 50-100 steel in your stash? 
---
It sounds like you accidentally offered something for free since you were unfamiliar with it. Try getting a trusted friend and messing around with the trade screen to get used to it. I have a "shop" and I sell items to at least 30 different people a day. I assure you there is no way to just take items without someone's permission 
---
I love closing the distance between me and them with VATS and making them kill themselves. I got in a fight with a guy at the Charleston Junkyard and he was one shotting me and a random I had teamed up with. All I had to do was stay in passive mode and target him in VATS and pop over to him.
---
Dupers. They are so obnoxiously OP that they are incredibly rare drops (as they absolutely should be).
---
Problem is that everybody has them because of cheaters. They have some serious rebalancing to do if we are to use anything else. I hope they do it.
---
~No~
---
Right what could go wrong 
---
PSN: Pippinramon if anyone is interested in one of the extra weapons I have, let me know. More than glad to share.
---
So Grimmsect, I sleep just fine thanks. :)
---
Nice lol
---
To get an equivalent rr to pa or hazmat you need around 30k rr
---
Ah, much fapping to a certain poster of Debbie, so many years ago.
---
hm
---
But doesn't dropping it put it in a paper bag and after you leave the area the bag is deleted? I always drop it anyway.

---
Well it's a flag field that exists on other vendors. So it should just be as easy as just adding that flag to the vendor (or turning a boolean to true or something). That flag system works just fine elsewhere.
---
Yeah, it's a minor thing, but it's a minor thing that SHOULD be really easy to fix and the method to fix it is already identified. It's like if you have a typo somewhere you'd just go into where ever you set that string and just fix the typo (assuming it's not like a typo on a texture or something in which case hope the original photoshop file with layers exists).
---
Knowing WHY something isn't working can be 90% of the job sometimes in programming. So being able to check off a bug from the list of bugs that easily really feels nice.
---
I wish they would‚Äôve kept the mechanics from fo4 where you could mod each armor piece to the type you wanted. I see no reason for excluding that mechanic when it was already in the game.
---
Same. I always revive a downed player, even the ones that are annoying one shooting everything before anyone else can get a hit. 
---
Use the Phantom Device. You can pop one while detected and in front of the enemy.
---
That only works if you want caps.  If you want to trade for items, you're basically on the honor system.  NEarly any other game with a player-to-player trade interface allows both sides to offer up whatever combination of items and currency they want to trade, then requires confirmation of the trade from both sides.
---
You can 1 shot someone with a lot of weapons that aren't two-shot explosive. The problem is that PVP in general isn't fun. It's no different than two melee characters going at each other, basically first hit wins.
---
It's not that everyone is at max caps (though a lot are) its just that realistically caps are almost useless. Their only single in game benefit is fast traveling and with 1400 a day from vendors even that traveling is "free." 
---
I'd much rather trade for let's say a specific armor piece I need than a few thousand caps. 
---
I have a proposal for you if you're on PC. Let me know if you're interested.
---
This isn‚Äôt how it works. Even if you have plenty of raw resources it will randomly break down whatever junk you have at times anyway. 
---
In a perfect world.
---
*cries in my lvl 100 corner without any TSE guns*
---
Just a heads up, I bought two of those signs for 4k each from players last night (1 for a friend) don't blow 11k at a vendor 
---
Just remember to NOT bother adding automatic style receivers as they get a bad damage nerf.
---
My understanding of tenderizer is that it stacks with each hit. Each rank only gives you an extra 1% damage but also gives a longer duration meaning you'll have a lot more stacks present at any given moment because each stack takes longer to expire
---
I‚Äôll buy them from you for 400 caps or else trade you a two shot LMG lv 25 and a medic‚Äôs black powder rifle level 35 along with 1000 rounds of ammunition for the LMG and 60 rounds for the rifle 
---
No it does not randomly break down. There‚Äôs an order to which it uses first.
---
If your attacking one big boss yes,, mobs (unless your skilled at targeting the same enemy) not so much,,, Anti Armour for mobs is better.
---
Use Psycobuff and AP regen drinks + glowng steak &amp; have optimized bracers to reduce AP power attacks,, and Power Attack with a medium or fast weapon- add in , incisor , all 3 Gladiator perks, blocker , and swing faster, perk cards and you're set up to benefit the most from Furious.
---
It might be less noticeable to a player if they're not set up to use it ?...
---
Rifles are useless to me,,, however i carry a laser pistol as a side arm
---
yea at this point most of them likely originated from just a small number of dupers... i am level 95 and in my entire time playing i've not seen a single weapon with two-shot or exploding, much less one with *both*
---
Do you have a perk equipped that passively damages (like Plague Walker)?
---
Often that is what creates this type of problem. If not, I‚Äôm not sure.
---
Anymore fake posts?
---
Don't charge your shot and then enter VATS. Charge AFTER entering VATS. This is a bug AFAIK.
---
I saw one in the general vicinity of a triangle formed by R+G Station, South Mountain Lookout and Spruce Knob Campground.  The infant was alive, but both it and its parent were being attacked by wolves or a bear or something when I ran up.  I remember it because I'm actually out looking for a megasloth this evening to cook something with its meat.  I remember that the encounter was on a road so it would have been one of the roads in the general area I described.  I ran into an albino deathclaw on one of the roads just a little while ago so I'm wondering if it's random what spawns.  There was also a crown mirelurk queen in a lake in that area in the same session as I originally saw the megasloth, but she isn't there today, just regular mirelurks.
---
I play with 3 real life mates, all trading items and weapons for profit only, we build up quite a nice arsenal by now, its all possible with some fair play and dedication!
---
I do this all the time - so much plant stuff to harvest. And the city/airport areas have the glowing enemies. The robots at Mama's also respawn quickly and drop the same glowing materials as the glowy dudes. I feel it's more stable than WS and none of the endless-robot-respawn server crashing as a result.
---
I like to think the Enclave have the best interest of the people as their ultimate goal. They have to regain their power to then bring the populus to a safe place where law and government rules, rather than raiding and slaughter. 
---
Unfortunately the BOS (especially in 76) seem little more than tech raiders. If you have tech they are taking it from you, even by force if necessary. Also you better have their food tax ready when they next come around or they might start looking at you as the enemy.
---
Level 118 and I have yet not come across a TSE heck all I‚Äôve found was a two shot 10mm sub machine gun 
---
I got two two shot dragons, gave one to a lvl28 (along with a shit ton of ammo, plans, stims, and armor) last night. 
---
Damnit I saw you're on PS4. NEVERMIND!
---
I get that but also disagree a little. Caps are a great way to offer a price for an item that you are not lucky enough to get. Those players then can use them to travel, buy medical supplies, plans mods etc for trading. 
---
Also I'm not talking about a days worth of selling to vendors. I'm willing to pay 10k maybe better for this item I'm after. Surely someone can use that to obtain an armor piece they need while having some left over for what I previously mentioned. 
---
i rarely seeany more than 10 people at once even in nuked golf clubs (might just be luck with servers I guess) so I don't really notice much server lag outside of when the entire golf club spawns reset every now and then and everyone goes nuts for a couple minutes of course.
---
Oh really? I didn't even know you could... How long could u charge your shots while in vats? Gezus I played fallout 4 for 250 hours on a gauss build lol. 
---
Oh okay so that's how it was then.  Where we were trying to trade item for item rather than caps it's like you said, based on an honor system.  Which is exactly why they people I was trying to trade with were freaking out and not trusting me due to the glitch with the random ammo being added.
---
Definitely still think a revised window where any form of trade can be accepted or rejected and if something is changed after one side agrees it would be cancelled.
---
my friend does almost this exact build but uses bloodied weapons and irradiates himself to %20 health, he hits for 1500 base with a mole miner gauntlet hahaha
---
Low level syringers don't take to many resources to make. I managed to learn all the mods fairly quickly without going out of my way to hunt the mats.
---
You can also look at the Cougar Research building, directly south of Morgantown. I've picked up three at a time there. Look on the upper levels.
---
However it works, having large amounts of raw resources does not in any way ensure other junk is ‚Äòsafe‚Äô. I have seen it use random junk and mods over raw multiple times. There may be an order, but it‚Äôs either a random order of which it uses resources, or the order is sorted by other means.
---
Alright Guys Heres the Scoop
---
I would support nerfing them to make them break easier and/or require more/rare materials to repair.  It would actually make sense from a logical standpoint
---
Does that affect how much stable flux you get?
---
You believe what you want 
---
It does, for sure.
---
why ruin the fun for other people? if you don't like it, don't use it.
---
and it doesn't convert all damage to explosive.
---
That makes sense - yeah, I've got all mutations except Herbivore and Grounded. Thanks.
---
No need to believe. Literally seen this happen multiple times. 
---
I‚Äôd heard ‚Äúwhispers‚Äù of this magical drinking fountain. It‚Äôs going to be super helpful ridding myself of the damned glowing pustules plaguing me during my nuked whitesprings escapades. Though before we know it we‚Äôll have to start pain training people outta the way because it won‚Äôt be a little kept secret anymore. 
---
Know issue.
---
It's too late. Balance in Fallout 76 is out the window.
---
They can. You're right that caps could be used as a universal currency but again they have no in game use so a lot of end game players don't need them. If a player has played enough to be selling the weapon you're after, that player most certainly has no need to buy aid or chems in game because they all drop so often. I don't think I've ever been under 50 stims during me 200+ hours. Most plans can be obtained for 1k or less at vendors, which again is a day of vendor selling. And any mods or armor they want, is what they are trying to trade that weapon for.
---
No
---
That issue is with stacking bobble heads and magazines. If you nerf explosive they would still probably be able to get that high but would just take more items. 
---
Eyedea is a legend.  Great quote.
---
How does one manage to keep a mutation?
---
Those are their own plan, and I think it actually is Metal Signs. If I had seen this a few minutes earlier I had a spare set I just got rid of. 
---
4 of my friends quit already, 2 new have started playing.  I don't see as many high levels in my world's but certainly more new players.  So there is certainly some turnover going on.  Could be 2nd run through I suppose.  But don't think so.
---
Uncanny caverns was one of the most disappointing locations I've been to, so much potential, so underdeveloped, maybe that's my fault for building it up in my head but it just looked like it would be special
---
Oh wait...
---
Exactly, why ruin the fun for other people one-shotting every mob before they can even get there? And don't get me started on PvP balance.
---
No, I've seen some MASSIVE merchant trading networks who have multiple alts just to carry sold goods
---
What‚Äôs your illness?
---
I swear the super duper mart in Watoga calls me Susan every time I visit. 
---
Great idea!! Buyers understand you can never change your base location as you will not be able to replace them. 
---
No idea, didn't touch them in FO4!
---
Although it seems you lose Rose's Syringer after the quest and there is no way to craft it again. :(
---
Lol damn okay
---
I thought about doing that, but I didn't wanna restart again :/. Lemme know if you feel it's worth it.
---
Yeah if they could have a area on your pip boy for advanced stats like, AP regen, sprint stamina drain (from end/perks), crit bar per hit (from Luck), item condition bonus, scrap bonus (from Int), sales bonus (from Charisma/perks), bonus exp/caps from group events etc. (from Cha), melee bonus (from Str), accuracy bonus (from Per), sneak bonus (agi/perks), and any other "hidden" stats that would be awesome. Diablo 3 has something similar to this in their details stats menu, for example.
---
More transparency in that space is great for those of us who are into understanding those stats and perks affects on them. For example, its important to know that scrap bonus is a diminishing return on Int: [https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Intelligence](https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Intelligence)
---
Teleport KO, haha thats cool :)
---
Yup.  Players can still grind for mats, chems, and can still create armor, weapons, etc. Then they can try to sell for real-life money or caps.  At least then the players have to ‚Äúplay‚Äù the game rather than duping-while-shitting on the toilet. 
---
Looks great! Really organic, I like the stairs and pathways.
---
They really do need a key ring or something 
---
U gotta destroy bunker buster rocket
---
I have it but as I'm usually overweight and usually melee it's difficult to tell how good it works. I personally think if I could get my weight down, get my AP up, get my AP regen up, etc. it would be awesome.
---
I've had that happen too, mostly with robot NPCs in towns. I think it's somehow linked to the overspawning of NPCs recently
---
All of the pistols are hot garbage for some reason and the only pea that support them are vats related. 
---
They really need their damage per bullet buffed significantly, the fact the 10mm pistol is useless royally pisses me off
---
Check the "Looking for Party" tab for FO76, youll find a lot of people who need help nuking or have nuked prime or whitesprings.
---
That's how I felt! It's so unique looking. Definitely a huge disappointment. 
---
I think everything other then power armor breaks to fast, especially weapons. Without those perks to make them break slower all weapons break way to fast, and when you mod armor it loses max durability, particularly leather armor breaks way to fast 
---
Also I'm not saying no one will take caps. A lot of people do, including me. I have a shop selling mutation serums pretty cheap. I'm just explaining why a lot of other people might not take caps 
---
I got an explosive Gatling gun with 90% reduced weight and explosive handmade rifle since launch. Pretty sure all the 1k damage are duped
---
With chems. Sure. I get it. You‚Äôre just repeating what we all know. I read the same posts you did. 
---
Do you have any authoritative source saying 400RR from armor doesn‚Äôt work? 
---
This would be great 
---
‚ÄúWhy ruin the fun for other people?‚Äù 
---
That‚Äôs the question I have for people who use (likely duped) two shot explosive weapons buffed by all the perks and apparently stacking bobbleheads to kill the queen in less than a minute, or who perhaps murder people with super high explosive slap damage (not sure if that‚Äôs rumor or confirmed). 
---
1. Guy finds TSE shotgun
---
2. Guy Duplicates TSE Shotgun and now has 128 of them.
---
3. Guy offers one on the marketplace for 15,000 caps, Guy2 buys it.
---
4. Guy trades/sells another shotgun to Guy3 ; Guy2 dupes his shotgun
---
5. Guy and Guy2 trade/sell a shotgun on the marketplace ; Guy3 dupes his shotgun
---
6. Add Time  
---
The influx of now thousands of TSE shotguns on the market A) Drives down the market value to as little as 500caps for the a shotgun that was originally sold for 15,000 and B) Allows thousands of players to more easily farm different TSE guns and GodRoll melee, which are then duped as well, lowering their market value.
---
Won‚Äôt they be stored?
---
Sadly explosive damage doesn't work like that or else my demolitions expert would give me double damage.
---
i literally squint at it.  it's so freakn bright!
---
This is so wrong, seems like everyone thinks you can kill the queen with a TSA...
---
I have a max out TSA with maxed demolition perk, i can take down a lv80 in a minute, but i was just on a server with only me lv100 and a lv 62 against the queen,
---
we didn't stand a chance.
---
What you should aim you anger at is the totally insane melee weapons that deals 15-20k of damage...
---
My TSA without using any drugs or sneaking does about 1.7-1.8k of DMG...
---
Butt melee doesn't go "Boom" when it hits, so everyone is looking at the TSA's for being the bad boys, pretty lame...
---
A queen dying has nothing to do with explosive weapons. Hell fastest I've seen queens die is by melee users. A 60nsecond queen is most likely because someone is duping and abusing bobbleheads. 
---
I know this is old but damn it's bad enough that they claim they are allocating memory right now to track items and such but when we lose an item like accidently dropping it and it doesn't show up on the ground or disconnecting your from a empty server during a before you loot legendary items is extremely pissing me off. They are to worried about getting people to buy fashion items. Lost a three stat 2hander that one hit killed almost anything due to the item not spawning on the ground because I hit the r button on keyboard instead of t for perk cards. I quit FO 76 for at least 2 months I think starting as I post this.
---
You can stack bobble-heads? Cool, I've never used one and they are starting to take up space. ;) 
---
When your in edit mode click the camp thing and move it around your base without moving the actual camp site location... It's wonky and random but moving that thing affects where you spawn in, so play around until you get it to spawn you in a good spot then leave it there. 
---
A shitpoast
---
Although rifles do more damage There are advantages to pistols over rifles. Pistols weigh a lot less, use less so and from my experience break less. They are good for vats/gun fu based builds and for people who like lots of spare carry wieght over rifles. 
---
You can acquire a perk called "starched genes" at level 30. At rank 2 it lets you keep mutations, even if you use a RadAway. Moreover, "class freak" perk reduces the negative effects by up to 75%. 
---
Grats!
---
I got one myselfy at only 2 tries running with 17 luck (15 base + full upgraded Vault76 suit)
---
&gt; That's business and businesses take holidays off.
---
Software services don't. Not when they drop a go-live the week before the 'holiday'. Well not if they want to keep their customers.
---
That's how it works, yes. And it depends on how much AP you have too. For example, if you go for low HP build and stack Unyielding armor, you're looking at 300+ AP. So Dodgy stays up quite a while, and helps you survive while you 1-shot things, hopefully without relying on things that drain AP rapidly, like VATS. Or by using things that restore AP rapidly (like Grim Reaper's Sprint and various consummables).
---
It also depends on what's hitting you. If you have a supermutant warlord with a minigun in your face, you'll have a bad time with Dodgy. If on the other hand, something big and scary is about to hit you with a heavy attack, knocking off 30% off of that is really amazing. So it's a tradeoff. 
---
Personally I like it with some builds (like low HP melee build). And I'm not fond of it at all with other builds (anything that relies on VATS). Though it still has a place, even with VATS build. When I get swarmed, I switch from VATS to something close-range for cleanup (Tesla, shotgun, melee, etc), then when it's down to ranged enemies once again, and I'm mostly in cover (so only a few shots hit, and those that do are reduced by Dodgy), the AP drain isn't too terrible. And when it's more or less 1v1 with something really nasty, it's a literal lifesaver.
---
Maybe it's one of the things they'll add content to later
---
What S.P.E.C.A.I.L is it under?
---
You'd need commando perks to work on an auto receiver.  Rifleman only works on semi auto.
---
Hmm not particularly looking for caps at the moment! Feel free to offer though
---
I think you should start a player faction opposite to the responders called the helpersüòÇüòÇ 
---
the same could be said about melee builds. let's nerf everything to the ground until the game is just a borefest, eh?
---
and pvp was never going to work in the first place because of the combat mechanics in Fallout. explosive is just one of the op legendary prefixes, for example.
---
I've said it multiple times by now: officially make workshops pvp arenas and disable legendary prefixes inside of them. this way both pvp and pvers can have their way.
---
Yeah if u have an auto receiver you lose the bonus from rifleman.  You would have to pick up the other perk for automatic rifles.
---
Under Luck 
---
Yes, but sadly the last patch made it so you can't place stuff you don't know :( 
---
The perks specifically say semi automatic rifles. 
---
Thanks
---
Possibly r/Fo76MostWanted
---
Go hardened. Automatic rifle damage is only increased when the commando perk cards are used
---
Yeah that's the one thing that bothers me in-game: toys. I'm exploring finding work benches, guns, chairs on look out positions, beds, all that. Helps me understand who would have lived there before and imagine the scenario.
---
Then I find a corner with a handful of toys. And a baby changing table with letter blocks to learn to spell. Ah fuck. Really young children were here. *Were*.
---
Was the same in FO4 when you'd hear a distress signal of a parent and their child. You'd know already. You'd just know.
---
TSEs can't kill the queen in less than a minute. only if they're buffed to hell by over 100 bobbleheads.
---
so it's on Bethesda, again. should've capped them. but of course they didn't think this far ahead.
---
Duping obv

---
Do you have it painted with an atom store paint? 
---
It will "destroy" the part that is the paint. 
---
As i have not done this personally to know if it will drop it standard or actually just delete it, take the paint off and then drop it.
---
But if it has anything to do with the atom store, it will be deleted upon dropping. (Just unsure if whole thing or just the paint)
---
Radiated areas?
---
I mean, you can. I‚Äôve bought two copies for friends. Just buy a prepaid card, send them the numbers on it, have them register the card, and use that. 
---
Thats... Not an unpopular opinion.. Pretty sure everybody knows Legendary affixes in general do not work with PVP.
---
There's a bunch of weapons found via data-mining pre se that are "present" in the game files but not yet obtainable *(as far as we know)*. My guess is that this weapon is such as well.
---
Explain?  Seriously....why is that a ‚Äúfake‚Äù post?
---
I heard the combat rifle was specifically bugged, and uses Rifleman perks for the automatic receivers. Haven't tested it myself though. 
---
Yup, it‚Äôs painted with camo paint. Makes sense.
---
Get enough to bulk, then scrap the bulk. It takes 10 acid to bulk, but bulked acid breaks down to 15 for a net 5 gain. It'll cost you some plastic but you can create so much acid that way. 
---
Big mcthankies
---
The queen has a 80% resistance to explosives so it's definitely not that killing her in a minute...
---
I mean it's not like steam tho
---
That would depend entirely on the level of logging they've added.
---
Think i am too new to reddit, where do i find that, could you post a link ? :) thanks...
---
This would actually make pistols and 1h melee viable, neato idea.

I killed one called "a vengeful Mothman" or something. I hope they don't drop anything good because mine was unlootable. It left behind and ash pile similar to the piles Tesla rifles sometimes leave. Not sure how many HP it had, but I one-shot it from stealth with a TSE prime gauss
---
lol Reminds me of assholes in Elder Scrolls Online that would exterminate the rare vampire and werewolf spawns, so they could sell the bite and scratch themselves to other players for exorbitant amounts. They could only do it once a week, but still exterminated the mobs every chance they got to keep the supply down.

Selling my shit gives me like 6 caps so I just drop it
---
Can these be done solo? Or do you need a group? The Poseidon plant one has many steps it seems like...
---
I see you finally get it. Exactly, they *should* nerf everything that is unbalanced. The game is already a borefest if all you encounter is people with the same two builds and the same weapons, out of the huge variety this game offers.
---
You see, that's how **balance** works. You nerf things, you buff things; and continue until you find a middle ground.
---
I believe the only fissure that spawns a queen is the one in the lower right. I don't think nuking the others will do anything other than spawn higher level mobs. 
---
Agreed. I have marsupial along with 2 other very cool mutations. Should I risk for more? There are quite a few ones that would significantly impact my character negatively if I acquired them and I don't want to rng for the ones I got all over again. 
---
You're right aid or chems was a bad example. I guess my point is the market seems to be heavily weighed down by people who are max on caps, need only one item because they have every other hot market item (and probably multiples or can make another of them) and when the items they want shows they snatch it and hold it ransom for the next 3* they dont have. 
---
Also, I am an endgame player. Been playing since launch lvl 140 and have had good drops. I've traded some, have some left I would trade, but I still am no where near the max cap mark because I dont dupe the hot TSE gun everyone wants and sell it to 6 people in one day. 
---
Being lvl 140 there are certain things I am after. Certain things I could care less about and see only one way to obtain them realistically since my drop luck is...well non existent most of the time. Like for instance the X01 Targeting HUD. I cannot get that to pop for the life of me. I've seen everything else but that. That's where caps seem viable. Say I give someone twice what they paid the vendor for it, 3x, maybe more? 
---
So maybe there needs to be special events where you need to pay caps to enter. Say a Coliseum where you fight waves of legendaries. People would have a reason to use caps then. 
---
Thanks for the discussion. 
---
Explosive modifier on Tesla causes it not to arc.  Still a cool gun, but yeah.
---
The one I killed dropped a plan for some armor I think it was
---
Why not?
---
This should be PvP Gunfights in Fallout haha...

This should be Melee Duels in Fallout ... EPIC.

---
PvP and Legendary bonuses in pvp need an Overhaul. 
---
I want Swashbuckling EPIC fights not happy slap one shot BS ...
---
Because you think this much mad shit can't happen to me? Im curious to see if anyone else has ever had their power armor change like that.
---
That‚Äôs lame
---
Thais for the quick feedback!
---
I know that. Im just wondering if there is any difference between nuking e.g whitespring and nuking a non-prime site.
---
Wish I read that before making my post, as I‚Äôm quickly learned that my assumptions were incorrect. Though I still think explosive legendary allows you to increase your damage a bit too much in proportion to other legendaries.  
---
No, you get 1 regardless of CND, provided it has not become inert
---
Because he cant believe so much bad shit can happen to one person in a single day.
---
So lots of perks are just swap in as needed, you probably know that. For instance I run a 2h build and subsist on dog food but I don't leave it equipped all the time. 
---
Pick lock is kinda useless imo, I leave perception at 1 and have no problem getting through the game or nuke silos. Keep it if you really want to explore every nook and cranny but locked container loot doesn't seem substantially better than unlocked containers. Glow sight is situational but I leave one rank equipped since nothing else seems to go with my build.
---
 I use slugger 3 rather than blocker, one shoting mobs prevents them from hurting me and nothing is really going to hit you so hard that you can't spam stims and be fine. 
---
Rejuvenated is useful, in end I like radicool but if you don't plan on having some rads solar powered is situationally good, otherwise chem fiend is fantastic. It affects stims and radaway too, so even if you're not a chem head it can be nice to have.
---
Tenderizer is very strong and worth considering over suppressor. Tenderizer is multiplicative with your other damage perks whereas most are additive. 
---
Field surgeon makes diluted stims strong. To capitalize you can equip chemist and super duper when diluting stims to get more than you'll need.
---
The further over max condition a weapon is the more damage it does, same for armor and dr. Grab weapon artisan and fix it good and swap them in on repairs for this reason.
---
White Knight is worthwhile in agility. It is a total bummer to have to repair armor all the time.
---
One rank (or more) in the two luck perks that makes equipment repair itself is great. Again repairs can be a downer and it's not easy to keep all the mats you need to repair everything on hand all the time.
---
...or you don't and just let people enjoy a game that is 99% solo to begin with.
---
&gt;let's nerf Crissaegrim in SotN, it's too OP!
---
yeah, no. just create pvp-centric areas and be done with it.
---
Yeah they're too strong even outside of PVP. I don't understand the fun of one shotting everything in sight, it must become boring after a while as there's no challenge. If they aren't nerfed, eventually everyone will own one and PVP will be even more of a mess.
---
panusha - PC
---
My friends list has been wiped after the game crashed. I have restarted the game multiple times and it is still blank.
---
...protest signs. Can't forget the important one.
---
Thanks, this is a very useful set of insights.
---
I see, that sucks. :(
---
Sorry, I don't even know what a prime site is. Is that just a descriptor of a good place to nuke or are there "prime" sites on the map? 
---
Agreed, without testing on another player it will be hard to determine the difference between standard armor pen, improved and superior.
---
Thanks 
---
It has flaws. Nothing remotely like the reviews out there when it was released.   I paid full price, and the only time I regretted it was the messups in beta because I couldn't play.  I have over 100 hours and feel like they are doing an ok job in improving the game.   I think as the game continues, it will get better and better.
---
TLDR  I have not played the same game all the youtubers and hate mongers played.  I would suggest it if you liked FO4.
---
I was planning on using them on the X-01 for the defenses of the X-01 on top of the extra +100 weight allowing for a bit more flexibility in what I carry with me into any active combat zones. Other than that I have a lv45 set of Excavators with the Calibrated Shocks on both legs and when glitched, gives me 575 Carry weight which is mainly more ideal for gathering a bunch of random loot to turn around and sell while making fast traveling possible. Other than that I only have 265 Carry weight in the X-01, so even moving at a decent speed (bar sprinting and fast traveling) I'm a little too limited on carry weight, esp considering I have a handful of explosives and heavy guns on me with a melee weapon for backup.
---
For the time being I just switch perks around (which takes longer than it should honestly, we need to have Perk Sets to switch to that doesn't take 2-3 minutes to scroll through the list looking for the right perks) to reduce weight and bump up carry weight in order to fast travel, and only use my dmg perks when actually getting near a combat zone like a Blast Zone or the back end of Glassed Caverns.
---
"Just ignore the idiots who say they will quit after the wipe"
---
Alright, I'll just toss 250 hours down the drain then
---
Demo expert does in fact buff your explosive weapon damage.  No comment on OP's misguided post.
---
6 caps x 100s upon 100s = lot-o-caps (and, bonus, no longer being overweight)
---
I‚Äôm on PS anyway. 
---
I know it does. But double it? Nah.
---
I had my excavator helmet get randomly eaten while I was doing the mistress of mystery quest line and was putting the veil on.  I crashed, came back in, and the helmet was just gone.
---
Or they do and actually make their **online game** balanced. 
---
I'm sorry that all you can think of is "plz dont nurf muh funz!!11" but there are other 23 people on your servers, kiddo.
---
They will do something about these builds in time, don't worry. I look forward to see you crying over here when that happens.
---
I only care about theory-crafted builds and base building so for me this game is amazing. As long as you know what you want out of this game and what it has to offer, you shouldn't be disappointed. 
---
There are fissure sites, and there is fissure site prime, which spawns a scorchbeast queen and starts the scorched earth event if you nuke it. Here non-prime is just referring to all of the regular fissure sites
---
I had the same. In a mining tunnel near prime fissure. Went inside and a headless, naked, female scorched attacked me.
---
i'm just a lowly peasant!
---
This is true can confirm. Combat rifle powerful automatic receiver is buffed by rifleman cards not commando. I think some of the combat rifle auto receivers work normally but the highest damage receiver doesn‚Äôt. Assault rifles and handmades work normally as well
---
I think the only excuse there is for unarmed weapons not being usable in power armor is that there are severe clipping issues depending on the weapon.  I believe this is the case from Fallout 4 mods that allow unarmed to be used in power armor.
---
But it's silly that this is a limitation in the first place, rather than adjusting unarmed weapons to visually fit along with power armor, they completely removed the ability.  It's just nonsense, because you can use tiny weapons like knives and handguns with the huge hands of power armor, but unarmed weapons are a visual stretch? I don't buy it.
---
UNarmed needs to be power armor compatible, otherwise it's just an inferior version of melee.  At least if it can use power armor, there is some wiggle room (it's probably still inferior regardless), but seriously, it needs to be compatible.
---
it does show resistance changes from anti armor weapons
---
This comment right here, Overseer.
---
Prime sites are locations on the map marked with a symbol of a circle with cracks in it, every single one is called "fissure site" but there's a unique one called "fissure site prime" which spawns a scorchbeast queen when nuked.
---
That's why you get both. And speed demon. I would never fast travel again. 
---
Honestly I think the only thing is you will loot slightly more ultracite. Nuking an area turns all the mining nodes into ultracite, and the ones around fissure sites are decaying ultracite veins, meaning they disappear over time. I would assume nuking them turns them into regular ultracite veins that don't decay
---
yeah, create pvp-centric areas like I said. no reason to be an asshole and spoil it for everyone like you suggested.
---
ok weird findings.
---
If I fast travel to my camp, it spawns me at this one spot on top of the road.
---
If I fast travel to my camp, while at my camp or a friends camp, it puts me on top of the actual camp placed location(quite a bit away from the road spawn)
---
 quest shouldn't require a shovel if grabbing treasure chests don't
---
There is way, way too much attention on TSE by redditors playing fo76.  Common wisdom is to dogpile her with melee in game, not spam TSE as it's actually not that effective in comparison.  I am getting so tired of people seeing TSE guns in game the first time, coming on reddit to see other people's posts about them, and then saying they are the bane of the game when they're a symptom of much bigger issues they're ignoring.
---
Don't worry. It took a while, but I've managed to get back into the kinds of games I've worked on in the past. Took a good few years for sure, though. Like, maybe 8-10. I still tend to be overly aware of what's going on under the hood, but I can have fun.
---
Ty! 
---
It wouldn't be that bad of a deal if it wasn't for the calibrated shocks that's not an easy find.
---
Combined with the perk that‚Äôs let‚Äôs you go back to undetected (quick escape?) I believe it has some has some use as I‚Äôve had myself go undetected again when the cloaking has kicked in.
---
But if an enemy is melee hitting me, only shooting
---
No I understand it. I'd love to have an item somebody wants but like I've been saying if it isn't 3*TSE nobody cares, and with armor its hit or miss. Maybe I need to bite the bullet and offer my 3* armor I use as a trade for what I'm after. I'm just stubborn and dont want to give up hope that the price I'd be willing to pay for a gun could net someone their armor piece they seek with some change left to fast travel and such. 
---
Got mine at the watoga vendor
---
Explosive removes any special projectiles and apparently also any special effects caused by it. For example, an explosive gatling plasma shoots explosions just like a regular minigun would, not balls of plasma
---
Ya man taken way to soon 
---
You probably joined a prime event with a op melee build. Melee can take queen much faster then explosive build can. If you have 10x people blasting her with duped tse weapons then yeah shell die quick as well.
---
Vast majority of the time I go without, but I keep a set in inventory in case I want to jump off a ridiculous height instead of finding the proper way down. Last time I used it in battle was a mythic deathclaw in a tiny cave where there wasn‚Äôt room for my usual hidey dodgy bits... most battles outside of nuke zones challenging but doable.
---
YMMV though, each to their own play style, other words of disclaimering.
---
The enclave quests are the best way to get them
---
Yeah it didn't sound right but I went with it anyway.
---
Have you watched the video? I run a VATS build with gauss too. AP cost and regen is fine. I don't run this exact build but a hybrid one with shotgun enforcer and glowing sight 
---
Balancing a game when there are 24 players together in one server is hardly being an asshole. Damn, I'd say it's desirable.
---
Not everything is about PvP. You can see plenty of posts from people telling their experiences with TSE users in nuke zones, SQB, Golf Club, etc.
---
Found the right answer
---
I got a 50 cap bounty today while in pacifist mode. They hit me and my reactive plates mod killed them. 
---
I imagine they had really high damage and/or super low health in order to do so.
---
Request sent
---
 The power fist was a late addition to [*Fallout*](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout).  Balancing for various forms of combat went on until very late in the  game, when it became clear that characters specializing in unarmed  combat couldn't keep up with the damage output necessary to finish  certain battles near the climax; even when scoring critical hits,  unarmed attacks rarely penetrated armor or did enough damage to keep the  [Vault Dweller](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Vault_Dweller)  competitive. Various "unarmed" weapons were added as a result, but  initially only the brass knuckles and spiked knuckles were included. **The  power fist was included as a final upgrade, a natural addition to** [**power armor**](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Power_armor_(Fallout))**,  and a thematic tie-in to the power-assisted hand-to-hand combat  portrayed in some dystopian futures of science fiction, such as** ***Warhammer 40,000*****.** 
---
It is actually on a load screen message, but it doesn't tell you where. I thought it was probably just a bug.
---
Tag your console, I'm sure people will make offers
---
I'm level 50 and I got a two shot gatling laser from shotesprings farming at level 20+ 
---
Are you on xbox by any chance 
---
The modifiers as stated do what they say they'll do when I apply the perks.  I'm confused, but it's all good GL man.
---
because they can only deal slap damage to you when you are in passive mode, the damage to you can only be done so slowly that you can always stimpack yourself if you want and have situations like the thread starter, where someone with two shot explosives couldnt kill him after 20 minutes of trying
---
Only thing mysterious about the mysterious stranger is what he actually does.  He'll spawn in for me and just walk around.  Once in a while he might raise his gun to shoot but usually by then whatever I'm attacking is dead.  It's neat to spawn him but essentially useless.
---
ferns at prime for violet. trees with sap along the back side of whitesprings for cobalt. Both in one run I have no idea
---
Lol well never know.  I wasn't there :P but yeah, to me trading isn't a big part of the game.  I stash a few good things for when vendors come out but that's about it xD
---
It's actually crap. The amount of bugs is *unreal*. It is perfectly normal to experience 3-5 bugs within 10 mins of playing. Some are minor (vendor showing 0 caps, when in reality he has 200). Some are fairly major (you start taking damage, even though nothing is attacking you, and it never stops, the only way to fix it is to leave the game). 
---
The game's core design is 100% random numbers, which is as idiotic as it gets. Like certain crafting plans are heavily level-gated. Good example being Handmade rifle plans, up to lvl 19 certain vendors sell them. As soon as you hit 20, they disappear. You *can* still get them by doing certain events, but again it's 100% random, I did that specific event 8 times, and didn't get those plans. Legendary weapons and armors come with 1-3 perks each, and these are, again, 100% random. Meaning you can collect 1,000 legendaries, and all of them will be garbage, just because you got bad RNG. And RNG has no memory. So the next 1,000 can be just as bad. Where games like Diablo 3 have reforging, The Division has a recalibration station, Elder Scrolls Online has a transmutation station, etc., which allow you to take a "mostly good" item and make it great, this game has nothing like it. Even the perk (talents) packs you get for free every 5 levels are random. One of my characters got some really amazing perks very easily because of this, and another got crap 10 times in a row, which made the character far more unpleasant to play than the other one, because it was missing quality of life stuff the first one had.
---
On top of all this, the developers are completely hands-off when it comes to people duping items, cheating, or otherwise abusing the game and other players. They try to fix the exploits in patches, but don't come after the abusing players. So for 2 months now it's been exploiters' paradise, and so far there's no indication this is going to change. People are advertising selling good weapons for real money, and nothing happens to them. People are selling good weapons for real money *on EBay*, and nothing is happening to them either. No bans, no nothing.
---
TL:DR - If you can, wait. In 3-6 months it'll be clearer which way the game is headed. It's either going to be Mass Effect Andromeda, or it's going to be No Man's Sky. 
---
Ps4 hugostiglitz42 I would be happy to team up with you. I'm a health care provider and have friends with aspergers.
---
Oh yeah it's great.  Get marsupial they say. You'll be able to cross Appalachia faster they say.  My ass I say.  
---
On my way to Grafton and there's a bit of a cliff, before I'd just walk around but now I've got to spend 20-30 seconds trying to jump it, step back try again, scoot down a bit and try again etc etc until I give up and walk around, SMH.  
---
Sneaking seems to take you out of combat with it and you can trade with it again. 
---
Source: i ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù shot it
---
then there'd be no reason to farm the golf course in the first place. there goes your end game content.
---
what about snipers? pretty much every other builds outpaces them in farming the golf course. should we kneecap everyone else so they can have their share as well?
---
you mmo fiends came out of the woodwork but the majority of the playerbase still plays solo and doesn't really give a shit about balance.
---
Care to explain why do u need thousands of steel daily? And how you farm it? You seem very good at it, enlightened one
---
Were there only mods? Like do plans to make them yourself not exist? 
---
If on xbox all i need is the mats and ill build you a set
---
This post again? It's simple. Bulking only saves weight for lead and aluminum. Stop. Put away the graph, no need for complex discussions that mandate a TL;DR
---
And bulking junk moves your mods ahead of your junk in order of consumption when you craft. DO NOT BULK JUNK unless you're selling, or it's lead/aluminum.  
---
As it stands, I set any item I want to trade for double it's value, and tell them to set theirs for the same price
---
If you're on pc, i can build it for just the mats as well.
---
Its an Xbox feature lmao. If you need someone to play with my GT is ZilchNix  
---
While it's true about the Queen having some higher resistance towards explosives. it would be wrong to not take the entire game into consideration and not just hick-up on one point regarding TSE damage output.   
---
I can't see how the amount of damage some TSE weapons does is considered working properly *(some melee % damage stacking as well is incorrect, easy to prove by just using a calculator -- explosive is hard since there's no true numbers)*.  
---
However, if it is correct and working as intended. Well, I have a hard time to see the game move forward with future challenging content and/or add new interesting affixes.  
---
It's fun to be strong. But there's a difference in being strong *(min maxing*) and being a god *(picking up one item)*.
---
This. I recently acquired a death tambo and man do I love it. But, you know, can't use it with my PA. Da fuck. 
---
Was never said by Fisto
---
Yup dealing with the same bug in Charleston landfill!
---
Just gone back, no it doesn‚Äôt sadly! But I‚Äôll go check out the locations now and see what I find.
---
Wait, where do you Go for cheap stimpacks?
---
I Kung lao the shit of fools.
---
more damage the lower your health, paired with unyielding can get like 15 extra strength 
---
My old base was next to Solomon's pond but I moved it within two days after two scorchbeasts attacked and I needed a lead extractor
---
Yay, data! Thanks. 5 seconds can be a lot in battle.
---
I know. I made the graph because someone just an hour before tried to make a graph that had wrong info. I've tried to just tell people only lead and aluminum but they don't believe me when I try because I don't present the evidence. I mean I agree with you completely, just some people are too stubborn to admit they're wrong.
---
I just want to stop people spreading wrong info about this since we've known this LITERALLY since beta and it hasn't changed.
---
Great build sits so well in the landscape.  Liked the vid lots.
---
Yep, this sub has a task force full of volunteers ready to deflect this game‚Äôs issues onto other customers rather than Bethesda itself. They often happen to be the same people who look down upon others who reached endgame quickly or leveled too fast ‚Äî I got into with some guy in another thread for accusing one guy of using an unknown WC exploit because he mentioned he had 150k lbs of scrap steel on that character, oblivious that there isn‚Äôt any type of weight restriction on characters then accused of cheating because he was level 300+ (guy mentioned he played 500 hours... which, I don‚Äôt even).
---
I think this is a lost cause trying to talk some sense into people. The victim mentality is pretty annoying to deal with as well.
---
I haven‚Äôt tried print screen but window capture works for me. It‚Äôs ctrl+alt+print screen. You‚Äôll probably have to paste the screenie somewhere though. I usually throw it right into discord. 
---
Not sure how or why this is marked NSFW I mean I would totally use this as my background at work no prob....
---
 Yeah. I could stack maybe 5 explosive. Just playing the game. ;)
---
What? Are you even thinking about what you type or...? So the whole purpose of grinding in this game is to get a TSE? That's it? Damn, there goes your endgame content.
---
I see you don't get it. It's not about making every single build do the same damage. It's about *making them viable*, and not way behind two **clearly overpowered builds**. Balance 101.
---
MMO fiends? üòÇüòÇüòÇ I've been playing single player games since before you learned not to eat crayons.
---
"The economy" 
---
Spoiler for you, Bethesda don't give a fuck about the economy lol
---
Another thing to consider is that Rad-X removes your mutation effects while you are under its influence. Once Rad-X wears off, mutation effects return.
---
I love that perk, but only when I‚Äôm solo. It doesn‚Äôt make sense to use it in a group. 
---
??
---
Not at all. I was just sad we couldn't trade modding each other rifles. I have the mods you want, you have the mods I want.
---
Yeah. I spend my time upping my perk cards so not a total loss. 
---
I have picked them up before. I‚Äôm sure you did the same. 
---
Toasty !!
---
The Xbox desktop app can access your screenshots as well.
---
How unfortunate. One would assume that jumping explosions would be God mode, heck, even keeping the arcing and having one explosion where the shot was placed would make me happy.
---
I'm a total geek for the energy weapons in fallout. I hope they get fixed.
---
Take my advice and rename the video, because you're not going to get much positive feedback on the Fallout 76 Sub by linking a video talking about how much is wrong with it lol
---
Is this the same EVE Online where one giant alliance pretty much rules the entire server and bullies any and all the smaller alliances every chance it gets? The same giant alliance that is pretty much in cohoots with the game developers and where the official player's "elected" council of represenatives is filled with their own members/allies? Where PVP between alliances is something that is planned out to the exact date/time so that the fleets can meet to battle? That very same EVE Online?
---
Accidentally got this mutation by walking a lil too close to a nuked Whitesprings; my level 22 is having the time of their life
---
I doubt you‚Äôll be getting to higher places than I can with marsupial and a jetpack
---
i bought some from a Whitesprings vendor earlier today.
---
Weapon Artisan level 3 puts it at 200%. About 4 cores before it breaks. Without the extra, it really is too fast, but that gun is also really badass. Just dont pray and spray haha
---
It's not difficult, time consuming maybe, but there was a mod for Fallout 4 that defined what mod stats for weapons and armor actually did rather than the vague descriptor of "superior" or something similar. 
---
It would be very appreciated if Bethesda tweaked the stat system to be more descriptive, numerics would be far more useful than "better" or "exceptional".
---
That's an interesting find... if it's indeed the cause, then I'm glad it's solvable, will definitely keep that in mind, maybe test it out to confirm it.
---
Thanks for the reply!
---
Go back to destiny. Goddamn that game was ruined because all the fun was nerfed out of it please the retarded pvp players. Stop asking for damn nerfs before you ruin fallout as well. If you want balanced pvp go play fucking black ops 4.
---
How do explosive weapons not tear themselves apart quickly?  I have a quad ammo plasma that will break after 2 full clips.   If they broke quicker i think it would balance them a bit.   I play with a friend that has an explosive shotgun and makes traveling with him tough because i get no exp unless he lets me tag things.   Kind of insulting since i just haven't had as good luck on my weapon drops. 
---
I wouldn't use the pain train perk.  If u sprint near a friendly like a bot in white spring it'll turn them all hostile.
---
Rank 3 
---
balance only matters in mmos. it's hardly an issue in a game that's mostly singleplayer oriented. and you grind to get legendaries, and seeing as how the vast majority is completely useless, yeah, I'd say you do it to get two-shots, explosives, bloodied, assassin's/sentinel's. why do you farm? because it's fun to do repetitive tasks ad-nauseam?
---
and you'll never achieve balance. how are snipers supposed to compete with other builds when farming?
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
Remember where you found them?
---
Also willing to purchase if anyone has an extra set on PS4...
---
This is where I got this
---
Reminds me of the pre nerf conference call from borderlands 2.
---
Server hop at forward station delta...
---
Invest in getting bird bones, no more impact landing from a standard height marsupial jump
---
Plasma is a beast. I honestly want to know why the laser exists when its so overpowered by the plasma.
---
I also want to know what the point of a minigun is when the gatling gun is far superior in every way.
---
Yeah, you find or buy the bulk screws. Kinda lame we can't bulk em... 
---
Ive seen it before not sure about details though
---
For the legendary effect yeah, 50% if I recall. I just wish there was a way to figure out the % for the magazine mods to see if they are worth it or not.
---
People have been complaining about this. Seems having more only increases storage, but not rate of creation.
---
I've only ever found explosive. Never a two shot. TBH I'd probably fall asleep with a TSE. Explosive alone already feels like I'm cheating.
---
Ah, well, I‚Äôm XB1 so that wouldn‚Äôt have worked anyway. But I got them doing a Defend Berkley Springs workshop mission. 
---
You don't really join any faction in a traditional sense... But either way you're free to do all the faction quests without repercussions. 
---
I always have a minimum of 5 luck solely for those perks
---
Its cheap... I've made a couple sets of full x-01 pa make sure you have the perk that reduces pa mats when crafting. 
---
Except for scorchbeasts. 
---
Post on fo76market, you can usually buy it there
---
I would assume the lesson they teach is that the ground is their turf and they don‚Äôt take kindly to intruders.
---
You'll need to 'join' each faction in turn as you progress through the main questline.  Interactions with other faction representatives after that is pretty much all player roleplay at the moment. 
---
You da real MVP.
---
Stop the #fakenews
---
The problem is, loot from legendary enemies will be better than quest rewards.

Learning from other successful games means that when things break, you can't use the excuse your doing something no one has done before.

Pretty sure all the healing glitches are latency, even the original explosive weapon damage healing issue.  I have a feeling the just hacked out a solution explicitly to fix explosive weapons but other systems still have the latency issues.
---
V.A.T.S missing at 95% is the server having a different hit calculation than your client.
---
Stealth heals are the server not thinking you are stealthed when your client does.
---
First melee swings doing no damage because your client doesn't know quite where the mob is yet.  Its not in range even though the client thinks it is.
---
You‚Äôre not wrong. FO76 is about the least RPG game Bethesda has ever made
---
Solo - Its... questionable. The general story is fine and all. But you're increasingly going to run into enemy encounters really designed more for groups, and putting together your kit is much easier with more people each getting loot from everything, and levelling up fastr/having more caps because you get a shared reward when team mates compelte quests (also each member can share a perk among the team, which can be used for a lot of things.)
---
As the story goes, its more in line with Subnautica or Bioshock. Rather then the grand faction battles/intrigues that have been the staple of the modern era fallouts, you're more unravelling the post-mortem on what happened to Appalachia rather then integrating yourself into events (you do eventually get to take action at the very end). Its more atmospheric and generally a bit bleak then a lot of driving narrative and character interaction (there are characters with stories, but you're by and large coming by them in logs and terminals. There are a handful of living robots, but still no dialogue trees to them.
---
Yeah. The hellbats don't give a damn.
---
The only explosive weapon I have is a cryolator...I didn't even know it could be lol
---
ive only heard of the regular Faschnacht man mask, but this sounds interesting. even the wiki doesnt know [https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Faschnacht+Second+Man+Mask](https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Faschnacht+Second+Man+Mask)
---
I made this post over a month ago when the info was new. Typing numbers isn't evidence. Let stupid people be stupid. This place is already the same dozen posts filling every other box. Some of them just need to be put to bed.
---
I think you are bit lost here, lone wanderer.
---
This *is* an online game. I'm sorry to break it to you, but this isn't single player anymore, friend. What other people do affects you one way or the other, as much as you like to stick your head in the sand.
---
If you are playing this game just to get those things, I'm expecting you to die of boredom in a month and we will see you over here writting one of those goodbye letters people seem to like so much.
---
Snipers can stand from a distance and start picking mobs while they drink a Nuka-Cola, knowing that they will be completely safe. It has its pros and its cons, like every build should have. Not just pros, like these two builds we are mentioning. Balance.
---
But let's use your argument with an analogy. Should we let dupers keep doing their thing, without bothering them? I mean, why ruin their fun, right? This is a mostly solo game after all, no? Why should we care about people duping?
---
Let me know the next time you plan to eat out a ghoul, there could be money in recording that
---
I just fucking ate the glowing resin!
---
You're supposed to fill the cache with a ton of stuff for him to look through, then run away and nuke the area 
---
It's the Ak 47 of fallout,love the chopper.
---
There is.
---
I think it's "Pneumatic bracers" or some such, but in fallout 4 it raised your unarmed skill by a factor of like 15 points or something *per equipped mod*. This is on top of the strength boost PA gave you.
---
There's also the rusty bracers which cause bleeding, tesla which does pretty high energy damage, optimized bracers which reduce AP costs for heavy attacks. 
---
That being said, I wish these mods visibly affected the armor. Rusty should add rusty blades/spikes to your PA gauntlets, tesla should put a tesla coil/hotwire on them, pneumatic should put a hydraulic system or just a straight up larger forearm on.
---
For whatever reason, it didn‚Äôt care what weapon I used for the kill as long as I switched to the sword right after. Discovered on accident with some button mashing, but whatever gets the job done. 
---
I've got marsupial, speed demon and talons and use fist weapons.  Jumping from rooftop to rooftop to punch a ghoul in the face and I seriously think I'm playing Dying Light sometimes.
---
It's true the spawn locations are in the broken display cases. I've been spending almost 12 hours with little to no luck. I have an extra torso and wetsuit plans to trade for the limbs. Foden333 on pc. 
---
well to be fair the combat knife doesn't have to fit around your 1 ^1/2 foot thick wrist.
---
That may be so but I'll have a lv 50 somerset special and daisycutter.  I'll take guaranteed stuff over random junk at white springs while on my way to dropping nukes with that character.
---
There are no real factions in this game.
---
i wondered the same thing!
---
Now all I can think about is a deathclaw dealing with the DMV bot alongside 3 other vault dwellers. 
---
it's a fist weapon.
---
It's not ancient if it is still a problem. Bethesda has yet to adequately comment or act on the duping and imbalance situation and they've already basically dropped the ball because the game economy/balance is fucked.
---
Because they've done nothing adequate so far it just means when they do something it'll have to be a massive change which pisses off non-dupers a lot more than it pisses off dupers.
---
This is why people are still talking about it. Sure, they probably don't have any idea of how fucked things will be if Bethesda ever fixes it, but people are angry because several of the game's central features are broken and every day brings with it new issues because of it.
---
PUT THE MONEY! IN THE BAG!
---
Ok...so if I have Pacifist on all the time, I cannot hurt ANY player, regardless of whether they are on my team or not?
---
Sometimes I see someone being mobbed by ghouls/mole rats/etc  but I'm hesistant to help cause I don't want a stray bullet to him then and become Wanted. 
---
I was told that I should avoid shooting back at someone who has intentionally attacked or killed me. Especially if they are working in a team. But, if I'm in Pacifist mode so I cannot damage them no matter how many times I shoot them?
---
Is the Open sign available as well?
---
Much appreciated!
---
Yeah no way I‚Äôm gonna risk trying to get rid of any. Played with marsupial for the first time today and don‚Äôt ever want to play without it. Adrenal reaction is great too, guess I‚Äôll just keep trying for twisted muscles and more
---
More like of you don't publicly punish this, every Company thinks it's OK to do.
---
I can post a picture when I get home 
---
Yep, you can shoot anything you can target in VATs. Go on. 
---
From my understanding it's because of SONY. Supposedly (I heard this from Reddit) SONY requires that a players "gamertag" or what have you, must be visible at all times. I would assume to allow you to report them when they start being jerks.
---
This has been a feature since New Vegas hasn't it?
---
Yeah the railway rifle fires railroad spikes. You can shoot one into another one and make platforms you can stand on.
---
What exactly did you adjust to make the game "call home more easily"?
---
I'm happy to test whatever you changed on my own setup and post the results.
---
Nothing beats the feeling of skeet shooting a grenade and killing everything on the roof above you. 
---
I've played the game for over 200 hours. I'm about level 100 and have started a 2nd character. At times I dislike some design choices, or lack thereof. But on the other hand, they have done so much right with the game, the design, the art, so many things are perfect. It would be great if everything was perfect, including server and client stability, some minor bugs fixed, etc. Overall it's a great game and it has so much potential. I just hope that potential isn't wasted. I hope they have the right people and the will to make it the best it can be, and don't make it worse through "fixing" and nerfing fun things that don't need to be fixed or nerfed. If people enjoy doing something in the game, even if it's a glitch, even if it's exploiting something unintended, if people are playing and enjoying the game they don't need to get overzealous about fixing things that don't effect anyone or anything. Reducing rewards because people are farming and found an easy way to do something isn't going to keep people staying around playing on a pointless treadmill. There need to be options for many different playstyles.
---
OMG THANK YOU THANK  YOU THANK YOU.   I was so freaking mad because of the music.   I have had the 2 copies of a game running in the past with other games but didn't think of it this time.
---
D
---
 Oh I'm sure but I could go buy that with a little RHG dancing. Just backing up that being able to jump on the roof is endless fun. Finally found a use for mines, I just drop em' through holes in the roof. ;)

thats the point of those guns though!

Sure is. Now that I've seen your post I'm gonna go make a post about it üôÑ
---
Worth every dollar get it while its cheap price my man you wont regret it :).
---
Even better, all the ‚Äúclaim workshop/defend workshop‚Äù events give the loot table, so you can do whichever one is your preferred. Kill everything, claim it, wait a minute and you‚Äôll get a defense, finish that and you‚Äôve got two guaranteed plans and a handful of caps. Server hop, you‚Äôll pop in at the same workshop, repeat. Easy to farm those plans that way. 
---
My bad. Fixed it
---
Kk joining
---
What about the rest of the perks?
---
It's not the AP cost and regen, it's that VATS doesn't work properly with a gauss rifle and it's a lot better aimed manually. Don't need to watch the video, I've played gauss for the last 250+ hours of gameplay. Didn't watch the video because of a lot a things in the text that stood out as being bad. For example, it's supposed to be an endgame build but isn't built for nuke zones which are the only end game areas. I wouldn't trust any "end game" build that doesn't have rad sponge and ghoulish when grouped. This is pretty standard
---
That‚Äôs awesome! Especially at your level!
---
Someone who played it can enlighten us.
---
Probably would require a crazy amount of modification to the engine, but I'm totally in.
---
I had one at Whitesprings that was alive and ‚Äòtalking‚Äô but floating up through the roof and then below the floor. 
---
Lvl 50 perfect storm is probably hawt
---
Highjacking this, auto weapons in general see to not last long at all. Im going for the same build and its sad to see that this is an issue. Noted I have an auto pistol build in the works; high agility is amazing, but all pistols seem to act like gunsmith does not apply to them (atleast the auto ones). Confirmed Pipe pistols without the "Licensed plumber" last almost as long as the 10mm or laser pistol with level 3 gunsmith equiped
---
I also found some dupers shortly after this in moonshiners shack. Threw a baseball grenade at them and ran away from a level 84 (I'm only 20) dude in power armor and ended up quitting because I he was certainly out for blood hahahahah
---
Axplosive?
---
Don't forget to add the platform! :)
---
I'm glad someone said it.
---
The rum is apparently mediocre at best (I'll you know for sure if mine ever ARRIVES), so that's not a strong argument either (I know you weren't making the argument).
---
A spring is just a coiled steel string. Screws and gears are just machined steel.
---
I just wanted Rust with Fallout shit in it.
---
Fair enough, although Bethesda plans to add groupcentric features and content.
---
For the sake of an argument let us assume you are correct. Then there is little to no reason to play FO76 for the majority of people, because their are better singleplayer games available.
---
Additionally I would argue, that there are other mmo-oriented variables involved than just groupplay vs. solo. Personally I can endure playing solo in a MMOG perfectly fine, but loath singleplayer games at all. Probably I am a bit odd in this regard.
---
However, I would further assume, that players behaviour and grouping sociability changes as the game progresses. Most buyers never played a MMOG before and the game itself does not make grouping a necessity for content right now. In that sense my topic might not matter right now, but it definitely will in the future.
---
Amen
---
Equips Baseball Bat.
---
Asks friend to throw baseball grenade.
---
I have to try that so much.
---
It would of been funnier if it said ‚ÄúTo protect and serve.‚Äù
---
My friend is currently doing a Vegas playthrough and yes you can
---
One of my six chassis does that. I can't rez it and I don't know why, and there's no way to see how it differs from my other chassis, no way to report the bug in-game, allegedly no tools for support to look at my inventory if I do report it, etc. My other five chassis rez fine.
---
I first noticed a couple days ago and have switched servers many times since, and the chassis has gone back/forth between my stash/inventory a few times.
---
Hehehehe but dragons dont throw down acid üò∂
---
I have a 2 shot plasma Gatling and it does trash for damage. What perks should I be using?
---
Well, not like cap cheap, I mean like crafting them cheap.
---
How is this witch hunting? Unless he‚Äôs edited the post then he hasn‚Äôt posted a name or any info that can be used to hunt or harass the guy here. This just seems like the dude venting. 
---
cobalt i got away with 32 raw from nuking between the farm east of WV lumber co. and the lodge to the east of the farm.  (il edit location names in when my game loads)
---
i also heard good things for cobalt near the pumpkin house in the mire, i have no firsthand experience there though.
---
I can confirm that Mr Fisto reacts very well to my "charm" 
---
Stealthboy doesn‚Äôt work on scorchbeasts?
---
yes, along with 20 RadX (they stack), could not beat the perks
---
I think it works for anyone that isn't on your team
---
I just wait for someone to shoot me then eviscerate them 
---
AI vendor-bots confirmed
---
PVP isn't fun at all because it heavily favors the one who fires second and has no pay off
---
I hope they buff it up to more of what an mg42 should be
---
Apparently they do. Maybe not all but some do. Bethesda took off get over it. As for raw food and starving kids in Africa I'm not eating raw food.  They can if they want but I'm sending it back and probably going somewhere else. But back to the game. It's a game. Get over it and yourself.  Not every issue would be fixed by now anyway.  
---
Whitesprings have Cobalt near the trees at the Enclave Service Entrance. Look for the big blue sap on the trees and the little blue ferns that grow around. There is also trees to the right of the main entrance if you are coming from the train station.
---
Violet can be found at the main fissure site by going to most groups of trees and you get them from the ferns on the ground. Always big groups of them around and are easy to find (as in they are just found at base of trees groups so it's easy to know where to look but they have no obvious colour to them). 
---
Always use green thumb perk (perception) when collecting them to get twice as much.
---
While most people are farming kills I am merely skipping through the meadows picking flowers (they are easy to pick and sell for a lot of caps even in their unstable form, just need to offload them before the expire).
---
Camden Park
---
I use batteries included alongside MSW5 in INT so I can carry all the power cores I want instead of using the perk to make u use less no energy when sprinting. Perception doesn't have a lot of good skills for melee but you can pick up glow sighted for extra dmg against glowing enemies(helpful for farming ghouls in a blast zone).
---
Where is that on the map?
---
Or give you seizures with their nonstop sound wave attacks
---
As far as I know, they despawn if you travel away.
---
I've held this opinion for a while, I hope it's not unpopular.
---
Bethesda seems to have forgotten how their perks interact and realized that if you were going to be realistically able to kill the SBQ, you'd need something that on average can do like 1k damage a shot, enter the TSE. 
---
Well.
---
The most health you can have with perks alone is 365 (max rank lifegiver and 15 Endurance), and having 1000 DR would reduce a 1000 damage TSE shot down to...500. Since you can only level up three SPECIAL attributes to max, maxing out Endurance (Arguably the weakest PVP tree because most of the perks deal with survival and have minimal increases to DR when they don't) isn't viable because someone with, say Maxed Perception, Luck, and Intelligence will always kill you faster than you kill them. Since there's no legendary effects that really counter explosives or damage against players that is actually effective (assassin's does nothing to stop you from dying because almost every weapon type has an armor pen perk so it just makes up for the DR loss but you still die to twice your health in one shot damage) or endurance perks that do that, you're kinda fucked.
---
 But at the same time you need a way to deal that damage to effectively kill SBQ's potential 1 mil effective HP or you'd never be able to do it in the 30 minutes with one or two weapons due to weapon breakage.
---
A good fix? Add legendary effects to armors that counter explosive damage, or add legendary power armor effects (the DR stack of PA + Assassins might help). Or, even better...add Endurance cards that are actually good at making you tanky because without them like...whoop, dying to every TSE because you couldn't face tank the first hit. 
---
I'm currently making my in depth review of Fallout 76 and I talk about this as one of the biggest problems with the game (behind World Permanence cause you know,[ "Rebuild America"](https://youtu.be/M9FGaan35s0?t=115) isn't possible if everything you do goes away when you log off). I'm hoping that the mid January patch helps with the new game mode...but honestly a lot of these problems are core to the game and need some massive overhauls in order to fix. 
---
Weird flex, but ok.
---
I'm also curious about that... At least all the stuff that is unique to him. 
---
I got the powered doors and the disco ball but I'm not sure what else he can spawn since I've only seen him a couple times. 
---
Not a great placement on that Nuke. Should have had Drop Site V9 just outside the zone to provide a rad-free combat site.
---
Search this Sub for further details.  Lots of posts on this.
---
What do you mean by the service entrance? The whitespring bunker?
---
While not fancy, mine is in the lake bed area near Harpers Ferry. Easy build spots and zero enemy interactions. While way at the edge, far to the right where the two train tracks merge is better for really being hidden. Although, it‚Äôs kind of a pain to build there effectively.
---
Didnt known that was a thing, that is hilarious. Got to love the internet :P
---
10 mm pistol does more damage than one of the most devastating weapons of WW2.  
---
It‚Äôs just silly.
---
Do you have any non-PA armor parts that reduce weapon weight?
---
Check your armor, might have something reducing weight. 
---
Bloodied boxing gloves: Balboa's Savior.
---
My guess is legendary armor that reduces the weight of certain things, those don't apply when you're in power armor. 
---
This is a mechanical carried over from FO4. With FO4, you could put out other containers that was not linked to your main stash box and hence, prevent auto dismantling of parts for construction. 
---
Word. I didn‚Äôt pick the site for the last one. I have this one though
---
It does. If it didn't explode when you simply drop. 
---
I held off on that mission on my main but till after 50 and it is fun.  It's not the strongest but it does melt some high lv enemies in a clip or so
---
Or the other way around.
---
I kinda want to get a mic so I can sneak up behind somebody in my full skeleton outfit, wait for them to turn around, and "'sup?". XD
---
I'll assume your questions are sincere, even given the end of your post.
---
&gt; Care to explain why do u need thousands of steel daily?
---
I wouldn't say I **need** anything, though scrap can be turned into he occasional easy level, even level 500+. I primarily keep all Junk in case it ever becomes useful for something, there's no reason not to store it, since I would be putting stuff on my mule anyway.
---
&gt; And how you farm it?
---
When Farming (which is basically all I do), it's about as fast to just loot everything that drops and then scrap it at the workbenches found in basically all locations I XP Farm at, when at the end of each section. Around 500 Steel/hr. I don't loot in the locations that don't have convenient workbenches for scrapping. [This](https://youtu.be/gr6p6L4Z17Q) is most of the locations I use if you're interested.
---
how you get this 
---
I usually place the shovel into the nearby cash register.
---
And then we fix the scorch and they drop the new DLC with NPCs :D
---
Will do. Probably should have done that before posting
---
Except when the turrets attract all the enemies away from you and you don't get the exp for them. 
---
The guys that set the camps up there are actually the worst.
---
That's an amazing idea. But I want them to at least fix the damn numpad doors first. 
---
I've been pretty lucky with finding Flamer plans in safes. I think I've found it twice in the safe near the Harpers Ferry vendor (second floor of the half destroyed building next to him).
---
Depends what you want your build to be 
---
I think that might be it, thanks! 
---
light or ultra light mod for combat armor?
---
Assassins is worth way more 
---
Unless I missed it, you should post your gamertag. I would love to have someone else find me a T-51b left arm and right leg.
---
Ah cool, didn't realize there was a previous one. I'm in-world and will be waiting for the drop.
---
of course it has flaws but the core of the game is great i know you will love it.
---
What are your feelings? Do you feel inclined to buy it seems as though you do.
---
If you are keen on it then i suggest get it as you wont be let down its not a game like No mans Sky was back in the day it actually plays well and i love it.
---
So my Vote is YES buy buy buy and enjoy hope to see you in WV.
---
I know that you get 4 star legendary weapons by modifying your 3 star legendary weapons 
---
Most likely hacks. In the last few days a lot of weird stuff has been reported.
---
My brother got it from a friend. He said something about Helvetia, but I didn't see any there when I checked today
---
We‚Äôll see some changes like this eventually.  They can‚Äôt do everything at once.
---
Why are you browsing this sub then?
---
Yes
---
I am not. I'd already have the gun I'm after if I was. 
---
Okay this is such a relief, thank you! 
---
Lessons to be had here: stash junk often, be careful with explosive weapons, and drop a tester bullet to be sure you get a bag on the ground before dropping anything important.
---
Grouped in a nuke zone you should always be sharing this
---
The real problem is that the PVP mechanics in this game are fucking trash, and it thus make the PVP aspect of workshops equally trash.
---
Having some asshole call you the n-word while walking up and one shotting you from behind with a TSE, and then verbally abusing you constantly on the respawns when you come back and blow him away with your own TSE 30 seconds later is pretty much the bottom of the barrel for fun PVP experiences in gaming.
---
People wouldn't complain about it if it wasn't so awful and often toxic.
---
Step #1: demote whom ever set the stats for weapons.
---
Step #2: hire someone who is familiar with firearms to work out a set of comparative stats.
---
Step #3: bitch smack everyone who complains that "it's just a game".
---
Step #4: bitch smack everyone who complains that weapons now do too much damage.
---
Step #5: double all energy weapon damage and halve all energy defense.
---
Why upvote? just post on the bethesda boards...
---
I'd rather have a disease in this game because I have plague walker 
---
I'm not on very often, and I'm only level 17, I think, but if you want to add me, my PS4 screenname is KiraRavenLupin. (I'm not too variant in account names.) I don't do mic talking, myself, but if you see me in a server, get on mic, and let me know you saw me on Reddit, I'll be happy to team up and help out as much as I can. :)
---
 hell no
---
Those things are blind already. They see your sound...or their sound on you...whatever. 
---
Can I share the perk forever? also, what all do I need to share it? 
---
Fair enough. I was going to try and help you out :/ good luck finding it
---
dis man speaks da troof
---
Sorry depends on how far through the Enclave missions you are if it shows up in your map yet. If you don't have it then the same area I mention but just north of the main Whitesprings bunker entrance.
---
I've played legitimately every fallout game and can say I've never actively been encumbered and I would carry alot of stuff
---
Awww, I wanted a furious drill. :_(
---
Meanwhile the only hidden stat I'm worried about is armor and not saying what kind it is so I don't have to check by weight and resistance. 
---
That would be great thanks :D

---
Name it Vera.
---
Alot of ppl are having alot of problems with it. Like red dead 2 I didn't really have many problems with it but I've seen the bugs it has I understand why people are annoying with it. But this game it is just everyone's a hater.
---
Any spot to look at in particular? 
---
Good call. Added! 
---
You're also missing the elephant in the room: the mechanics and balance for PVP are absolute trash. You tried PVP'ing when both sides have TSE weapons? It's exactly as awful as you'd imagine. At least it doesn't cost you much in ammo since fights are over in miliseconds.
---
shit if it's in the skyrim code i don't see why not
---
someone in one of my groups and i both just traded wins until we both got it. 
---
or if you dont wanna be bored for half an hour you could always server hop and hunt bounties.  i send the (wanted) person a message that im only achievement hunting and didn't touch their bag and most times they are cool about it
---
Nah, Voice chat is kinda a no go zone until people stop having open mics with terrible quality...like they added the push to talk function for a reason, I don't want to sit there and listen to you mouth breathe into the mic while the server is doing SBQ, and it's even more annoying when people rage thinking that you can't hear them. I was doing Uranium fever and some guy got pissed I was using a non-TSE shotgun (not even close to oneshotting I'm a Heavy Weapons spec character) and started screaming about "THIS IS A MELEE EVENT FUCKIN ASSHOLE" and like, it instantly made me reconsider having voice on.
---
You need 3 points of charisma for every 1 perk point you share. Effects that boost your charisma count towards this. When you go into your perks while grouped you get an option to share.
---
I picture him with a top hat and a monocle.
---
Wait...I just assumed gender :(
---
Thanks man. Again thanks for the discussion. Hope there are no hard feelings with the little bits we disagreed on, although I dont think we really did just had different ways of seeing the same thing. 
---
I've actually commented on multiple posts of a TSE with reload speed pump on xbox saying I wished it was ps4. Oh well. I really dont care about the TSE as long as its exploding. I'd rather have something rare too and not the quad explosive with dam resist pump that's floating around the ps4 market. I guess till I find it I'll be happy with my 3* combat non explosive with vats multipliers. 
---
A friend gave me an explosive assault rifle, and I immediately replaced the 2 shot I had looted a few days earlier, the 2 shot was near unusable.
---
I believe there already is a mod for armour to reduce explosive damage. Padded I think? I‚Äôll have to double check. I remember seeing one of the mods I learn for my metal chest. 
---
Not even close.  
---

Thank you all, see you in Appalachia!

They are sold by the production vendor. 
---
Ah yeah I think I might‚Äôve bought them
---
There is an underwater section in the mine that uranium fever happens in.  I didn't get to explore it much as I didn't have aquaboy yet but I may go back and check it out later
---
Very odd
---
But.....wait.... the other guy still has a point, you dont have to have passive mode on in order to receive slap damage. You just dont attack them back. Like he said passive mode only effects your damage. You take slap damage no matter what mode you're In.   
---
Enjoy the game friend. How many times do we have to read I like this game or don't understand why people hate on it. Let's move on and talk gameplay or exploration. We already knew Fallout had issues, right? I want to read interesting things on Fo76 or how they plan to fix it. Recommendations on how to make it better are worthy of a post. 
---
....Bethesda you still owe those people better bags and the rest of us, a better online experience.
---
I forgot about that!
---
Three charisma points for each point of the perk you're sharing, you can share it as long as you're on the server. Whenever one of your team takes rads, everyone else will have theirs reduced.
---
Given the wiki doesn't eve have a photo of it, that would make sense
---
I play on PS4 with a headset, if I talk can non headset people hear me? But cannot respond...
---
Your concerns are a priority for Bethesda right now. They are reworking that. Of course that does not mean, that it will be well done, but it will change.
---
You are very welcome. But personally I am more worried about the upcoming player interaction while doing PVE.
---
Many FO76 players are original singleplayers and their wishes and imaginations align with that naturally.
---
Bethesda has no previous MMO experience and  Zenimax does not seem to help them out much with game design choices.
---
By no means I want to imply, that I ate wisdom spoonwise, but as it stands right now a lot singleplayers adress their wishes to Bethesda. I am all in for testing and experimenting, but a lot of stuff has been done and tried by other MMOG and we should learn from them. It is just risky, when singleplayersa on all sides try to build something, which they only heard of in theory without previous experience. Ecspecially cause FO76 cannot take much more detours.
---
Looks awesome, partner! Nice work.
---
Right?

This is true, I needed crystal for cryo ammo so my buddy took a bunch of workshops with crystal and then logged out so I could collect the crystal later. I never stepped foot in any of the workshops until I went to collect.
---
K thx man
---
I'd suggest, when you want to launch it, find some of your closest friends in game, find a low level server and launch it wherever you want. So that you won't have high lvl players tell you "but SQB best loot, wasted nuke".
---
Oh and have one of them screenshot when your name appears.
---
I kid you not, it took me 18 hours of server hopping to get a full set of urban polymer deep pocketed scout armor. The hardest to find were the limb mods. I found 11 extra deep pocketed chest mods in the amount of time it took me to get 2 arm and 2 leg deep pocketed mods. 
---
If you nuke the Scorched Beast Queen there are plenty of mutated ferns around her spawn.
---
Perfect then buff that instead of nerfing gun
---
Everyone says Helvetia but I've scoured that play top to bottom and server hopped so many times.  
---
If someone can actually provide concrete evidence like the one at Fort Defiance as an example.
---
One of the biggest reasons I stopped playing. My experience has been terrible due to bugs and my disagreement with many of the design choices, but the inability to use fist weapons in power armor was one of the final straws.
---
As a disclaimer, I had no idea it wasn't possible in FO4 either. I just know someone would bring it up if I don't put this in. 
---
Its a multiplayer game without text chat;)
---
Using the Tesla gun can sometimes make corpses unlootable or disappear when they turn to dust. 
---
Excavator PA.
---
Some can, we ran into someone the other day who had chat on but their mic was broken. Try saying something like "jump up and down if you can hear me" and they can use emotes to talk to you üòä
---
Do I have to be in a team to share? Can I just solo share it to myself? 
---
&gt;This is an online game.
---
tell that to the majority of the playerbase. people play Fo76 in spite of it being online, not because of it. Bethesda is aiming for a non-existent public, give it another month and everyone but solo players will be gone.
---
&gt;If you are playing this game just to get those things,
---
why do you play it? serious question, there's nothing to do except farm.
---
&gt;Snipers can stand from a distance and start picking mobs while they drink a Nuka-Cola,
---
and maybe hitting 1 out of 50 mobs, while literally every other build bum rushes the ghouls inside the golf house. balance, right?
---
&gt;But let's use your argument with an analogy. Should we let dupers keep doing their thing, without bothering them? I mean, why ruin their fun, right? This is a mostly solo game after all, no? Why should we care about people duping?
---
if it doesn't affect the servers, yeah. people lock legendaries all the time in Fo4.
---
Just test it and see how many caps you get if you pick up one and turn it in bs 2. I‚Äôve seen multiple claims about the 2 thing but it definitely will only list one as being in your inventory. Honestly I have no clue. I only turn in one and I‚Äôve gotten everything you can currently get afaik from just single turn ins
---
Lucky. Hole. Mine. Hundreds of lead for one run with excav armour. 
---
Im not sayings its not good for that as well, but i use it regularly, and i generally shoot for solid sturdy consecutive hits
---
Frankly this seems like an unread forum but here I am again to provide some feedback. This game is a lot of fun and I greatly look forward to new quest content. Ive put in hundreds of hours already and definitely have been recommending this game to friends. Right now though, I dont have much reason to keep playing unfortunately. I have people I play with online and I enjoyed helping them with quests. Because of the way balancing works, I was often spawning level 60+ guys on their quests, forcing them to rely on me. That cost them a decent amount of XP on their own quests. We started exploring commonly undiscovered locations instead, but more and more they're only interested in nuke zones. If one drops while we're exploring or even mid event it completely derails the session. I enjoy the nuke mechanic as well, but it's a very dry hack and slash/run and gun experience with all game breaking mechanics on full display. People flying through the air with Tesla rifles and the potential for many legendary weapons is way more enticing than rummaging through far flung locations. Yes it's up to the player to choose their own balance between the looting and killing in a post-F4 game, but the appeal in this feels lopsided. Maybe consider increasing legendaries outside of nukes, or decreasing them inside? I feel strongly this culture around the endgame has impacted the longevity of the game for me personally. 
---
On a separate note, it might be an exaggeration to say everyone has a two shot explosive weapon and marsupial, but the majority of endgame players do. Fighting these people is really lame, impossible even unless you arm yourself with the same game breaking items. That removes any challenge. It's forcing an environment where the only real reason to keep playing is to challenge each other with these 1200+damage per shot weapons that are overkill in any situation. The endgame is not fun for a vanilla console Fallout player, it's been perfected so the most toxic players are the ones who flourish in the late game. Having a minor role playing element to your character is not an option, if you want to be able to defend yourself you need to be a superhero. Running away from fights against much lower level characters because I've tried to avoid the game breaking elements, after putting in so much time and legitimate effort into the game, is heartbreaking and makes me not want to play. Anyone who is 50+ should have a chance in a fight, weapons that can one shot dedicated players on or out of combat are unbalanced and have no place. 
---
Last thing we noticed was that being in a team prevents surrounding players from hearing you. Roll up to a claimed bench to help defend it? You look like a group of attackers and no one can talk to you unless they join your team. Even your friends. Why? Let me talk to the assholes who are tracking me across the map with their TSE weapons. Leave communications open to everyone when in a team.
---
What a useless review. Please just add more quest stuff soon. And get rid of two shot and explosive effects, or don't, I might not be the sort of player you're shooting to please anymore. I still log on to build a camp every now and then, but that's not what I think of when I hear Fallout.
---
Combat and Marine armor are the most balanced, resistance-wise. Trapper also has rad resist and looks rather badass, it's all up to your playstyle really.
---
Finding the power armor would be interesting. Quite a challenge and quite a price. Unless you have something of equal value 
---
It's amazing to see people opting for different builds rather than the most optimal. I'm glad to hear your story.
---
I‚Äôve put mine on the roof before but I would also like to know what the field of view is 
---
One of my buddies sneaks up on me lol! I can't figure out how to do push to talk and my mute button is broken so I stay in area chat if I'm not on a team. I was giggling to myself at a silly robot and he snuck up behind me and scared me lol.
---
Goon on ya mate, you‚Äôre doing better than me. I‚Äôm level 49 and still shove my tail between my legs and run if I‚Äôm not near Watoga or Whitesprings. 
---
I‚Äôm level 105 and still rocking some leather armour.
---
I‚Äôm stealth sniper though so I do it for the legendary effects (chameleon)
---
Lvl 500+? Guess you you confirmed my suspicion of farming infinit trap disarms and abusing negative weight  the way. Also 500 steel per hour would add up to 5k steel daily with your routine. That's 250 weight even with bulking from steel alone that your just hoarding. Sorry but 5k is way past the point of useful, let alone daily. So either your making up numbers or boasting beyond reality
---
Explosive damage is not the best against bosses.  I usually swap from my explosive shotgun  to my handmade for single tough enemies.
---
Well, yeah, you need to have a teammate to share it. That's the whole meaning of 'sharing'.
---
Dense.
---
Exploding cars don‚Äôt touch me now but I don‚Äôt know how it does against TSE weapons
---
&gt; They can if they want but I'm sending it back and probably going somewhere else. 
---
Wow, get over it. It's not like they are keeping someone alive.
---
Once the fix drops I will farm my life away for a anti armor something something chainsaw for my melee toon &lt;3
---
Thanks! Getting it to work with the rocks was a pain in the ass sometimes lol.
---
It's because if you go there in a group, literally 50 - 80 ghouls and wendigos spawn.
---
\*Reading through just minding my own business... 
---
\*Hmm, pretty good points OP not unreasonable...
---
\*Possible solutions, hmm.. okay let's see what kind of ideas OP has...
---
\*Not bad, hold the fuu...  "This alone would be a big upgrade, particularly if it gives players a full understanding of CAMP gains as they level up." 
---
"players a full understanding of CAMP gains as they level up." 
---
"CAMP GAINS AS THEY LEVEL UP."
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
That's it, you lost me, CAMP budget doesn't change, yes there are a million bugs out there and seemingly more popping up every day, but budget does not change ever period. 
---
That's.... A lot of budget spent for what can be built with quite a bit less.
---
I like how you made this a PSA as if this is some absolute truth. No, I won't be turning voice chat on because you found out you don't think it's that bad. 
---
He's back on Shoddycast. Apparently he runs it now, but I could be wrong.
---
I would hit them as they came out. I got experience and the drops. I have seen another post about it causing lag but I didn‚Äôt see it. I must have been lucky. 
---
Assassin Sentinel is god mode in pvp. Sentinel is pvp gear... You get what im trying to say.
---
Where the hell is the tldr you promised in your title?
---
Would be cool to have a community event to kill a certain number of scorched leading up to the event...."The scorched war"
---
I've gotten 2 pies now! As far as I know it's just random but I got one at Flatwoods and the other at Cow Spots 
---
I figured as much, Just wanted to be sure. 
---
its actually worth less, for some reason
---
&gt;but it definitely will in the future.
---
eh. Bethesda *may* turn this mess around but never so impressively that mmo players will come rushing in. it'll always be solo players that keep it alive.
---
my impression is that the team behind it has no idea what they're doing and is just desperately trying to keep people interested into the game. it's a tough position because, the moment they stop focusing on online features, the game has no reason to be always-online anymore.
---
I don't know what they're doing or what they plan on doing, but it's asinine to focus on a playerbase that's a minority.
---
I spent a large amount of time setting up my current base in one of the pylons so it looks like it is resting on the trusses. Built the stairs up, and the walls and then found that the roof is "outside of buildable area" So now I have an open air base.
---
My buddy got one one night, nearly blew my ear drums off yelling with excitement. Didnt believe him to this day but now.......well i guess ive been proven wrong
---
Hmm, okay. I will just have to test it myself if I can manage to find a mine.
---
You can make a laser gun if you have a laser gun plan. Genius would be making a gun with no plans, otherwise you're just following Ikea instructions on how to make a gun. You can't make a bed without your Ikea instructions, and you can't make a gun without them either.
---
At best your character is literate, and someone wrote really good plans.
---
What would be best for a melee build? Don‚Äôt care for rad protection.
---
So you guys can fuck it all up again?
---
Go to hell, I‚Äôd rather join the scorched
---
I know I‚Äôm late but is this still an option? 300 for a wetsuit?
---
I'd be happy with a keypad pylon that doesn't have a switch on it that let's anyone bypass the keypad....
---
Didnt mean actually use the perk mysterious stranger. Was. Meaning having the apperance of the mysterious stranger. 
---
Excavator &amp; X-01 PA need it. A lot for the Ex and iirc 20 for the lvl 50 X-01 (only the arms require it)
---
Having read the write up that the guy who  included PA hidden perk is equivalent to 33,000 stacked chem radaway, I‚Äôm not convinced he did the armor hard yards, and I‚Äôm not convinced that rad-x‚Äôs stack just because the UI says they do. 
---
Lots of stats in the game have a displayed stat and a hidden real stat - fire rate for example. And what may be the case is that despite rad-x‚Äôs showing as though they stack, they actually don‚Äôt. 
---
And even if they do, I‚Äôd still like to know what particular armor items I need to be on the lookout for so I can bag them and stash them for when ever in the future we get given something that gives the magic hidden perk while in unpowered armor. 
---
I know. I'm not so much upset by any one event. It's all of it stacked together in a matter of 20 minutes or so.
---
Lake Eloise for a lot of Cobalt Flux. Just my quick addition to this post. Probably have some Violet there too.
---
You'll find one. A lot of people have them. Idk the ps4 market but I still see the posts everyday
---
This is a horrifyingly long post for me.
---
Remember where that door is? I came out it, but cant remember how to go back in...

This is a huge deal. Especially because it's the users account name. All they need is our password and the account is theirs.

**Blackwater Mine.** The Mole Miners there have assault rifles, missile launchers, and shotguns, and you can also scrap power armor that spawns there. While you're getting steel you can also grab fusion cores, missiles, glowing meat, and do the Uranium Fever quest for legendary gear if you want. Otherwise you needn't even go into the mine; just killing the mole miners outside nets a good amount of loot for the time it takes. All the workbenches you might want to use are there too.
---
**Eastern Regional Penitentiary.** Good for:

* lead: [can chimes](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a1obrv/need_ammolead_with_3_easy_steps_you_can_have_more/)

* plastic: laser rifles on Super Mutants outside and in the prison yard (for shotgun shells and bulk junk)
---
* steel: kill and loot Scorched/Super Mutants outside, inside, and in the prison yard
---
* [weapon plans](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a0wh9v/penitentiary_has_high_drop_rate_of_weapon_plans/)

The title is the TLDR.
---
Me too. Just looking for the outlier. I'm on the market more than I should be haha 
---
I don't know if you know this or not, but if you revive with Quack Surgeon the players are under the influence of the alcohol as if they had drank it.
---
Ok I'm tracking now.

They might be immune but they sure know how to lay it on with their...soothing...voice...
---
You gain fast health regeneration when not in combat.
---
Nope.  I placed my camp way high up a slanted tree, and the ground level was out of bounds.  The green area marker showed the whole area as possible to build, so its deceptive.
---
I have this issue on my multi monitor system, but not on my gaming laptop. I generally quit to desktop and restart each hop for reduced frustration. 
---
I tried that the other day, my friends and I were so excited and losing it. They all fast traveled over to help aaaaand then we found out we could do fuck all up there.
---
Thanks Todd.
---
For real? Nice 1
---
Well considering the largest alliance in the game holds just shy of a third the active player base(which is huge btw) that still leaves 20k member unassociated with them. And considering the size of the universe in game that still leave enough free territory to keep the situation from reaching the magnitude you've described. Planned battles do happen, but plenty of random interaction combat keeps things fresh. 
---
There‚Äôs a box up on the defence rampart opposite side of the power armor station, there‚Äôs usually always there for me... if it‚Äôs not the plan you want just switch to a new server üëç how I got mine oh and BOS under armor spawns there too
---
   
---
returns 50% of the damage melee 
---
Eh, I mean, more games show this too. Also, you can look up ‚Äúrecently played with‚Äù and see people‚Äôs PSN or gamer tags. I play MH:W and it shows the PSN on there. You could argue that I could take your reddit by just getting your password too.
---
~~Thanks for this~~ Thank you for this.
---
Sorry, to revive this after so long, but did you even figure out a solution?  The same thing happened to me today (someone else completed my quest)
---
That and the damn center screen quest completion cartoon. Pops up all too often when I'm in a close quarter fire fight and provides amazing cover for my enemies.
---
Thats the one, I am also unsure how it stacks up vs tes or even just explosive weapons seeing how hard core they stack with the demo perk. 
---
It gets annhialated but can be rebuilt
---
I have a Two shot laser gatling and it just doesn't do good damage and breaks sooo fast... Its bs and I love my gatling gun.... But there's no point.
---
I'd love to see a damage and duribiality buff
---
Great stuff! I was building a tank/melea and stumbled across this and it convinced me to add points into Luck and Charisma instead of maxing S E A with the rest in Int.
---
Any new recommendations since posting this?
---
Also, on the Portable Power perk - is this even necessary given that power armour weighs nothing when you're wearing it on a chasis?
---
Guess im not the only one who slept during screw making class back in Vault-Tec University üòìüòìüòì
---
If the explosive gatling laser I got today got deleted I would probably delete the game 
---
If it says it wields black titanium as scrap it is an excavator mod for sure.
---
That‚Äôs a fuckin great idea
---
thanks 
---
thats what it sounded like but it never actually works
---
The vast majority of those items are just a single variable indicating if you possess it or not. 
---

Legendary BOS heavy combat. I'm an unarmed melee build.
---
I really agree with #1, but I'm on the fence about #1, and I really think #1 is just not realistic. #1 on the other hand is intriguing at the very least. 
---
Right!
---
I think I had best luck at Harpers Ferry. Though I did have to server hop a lot. I eventually got the last Calibrated Shock after I hadn't server hopped for a while and just randomly went one day to check it out.
---
Decreased intelligence I believe
---
Haha, you should have read the entire thing-- or maybe you skipped over parts?
---
It's been semi-confirmed (i.e. confirmed by a bunch of people but not with like, video evidence) that the \~budget cost of each decor placed\~ decreases as you level. 
---
So the idea is that your actual budget bar won't get any bigger, but because of the decreased item cost you can actually build a bigger place as you level up by blowing up your old camp and scrapping any decor. In other words, what once cost something like 2 points per placement at level 20, might cost 1 point per placement at level 50. 
---
It's confusing and kind of a stupid way to handle things, yep. But I'm personally convinced this is how it works because aside from the claims and explanations I've read online, my own brother blew up his place and rebuilt at 50 and he said that he noticed a definite increase in how many objects he could place, plus this idea has also been evidenced by the easily observed size distinction between CAMPs of high and low level players. 
---
So I'm open to being proven wrong on this point, but I have enough evidence to comfortably state that it works this way. ;)
---
I‚Äôve had good luck getting him to spawn at the Berkeley Springs workshop. That one is nice because the road bisects the workshop so you really can‚Äôt miss hearing him. I‚Äôll be in the middle of a defend event and I‚Äôll hear is happy chatter about moo moo. He joins in the fight too! And never dies. Sadly though moo moo does.
---
No no. I only want TWO shot Explosive weapons gone, due to their game breaking combination. Explosive is fine {Granted it needs to remove perks increasing it's damage} as is two shot, just not together.
---
Did not know this, but now I wonder if anyone I revived did lmao
---
Yeah they like getting a broken product and praising it.
---
How in the lords name did you those 2x1 stairs to stack? I just rage quit after two hours. 
---
I think he asks if something "special" happens, as if nuking somewhere else spawns something different, like Fissure Site Prime spawns a SQB. He asks if for example nuking the Deathclaw Island spawns something like a Deathclaw Claw Queen, and as far as I know, no other place spawns something unique except for Fissure Site Prime.
---
Just find the three groups of trees near fissure sight prime and collect the ground foilage.
---
Alright I‚Äôll have to try that place out
---
I one shot a player long before I had an explosive weapon... Pvp's a joke. 
---
Grafton Vendors usually carry Raider and Excavator mods a good bit.
---
I'm not particularly built for it, but it's something I'm going to pay attention to. Particularly with real raids coming
---
Ok thx
---
To each their own, you totally don't have to. üòÉ
---
I was sharing because I have found many people are nervous about using it, and wanted to let them know it hasn't been that bad.
---
PSA the way I was using it is to raise awareness of something, as in the first sentence of the Wikipedia article on it:
---
"A¬†public service announcement¬†(PSA), or¬†public service ad, is a message in the public interest disseminated without charge, with the objective of raising awareness of, and changing public attitudes and behavior towards, a social issue." 
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_service_announcement
---
As we know from things like the "this is your brain on drugs" ads, they don't necessarily have to be 100 percent unbiased, and may be a bit sensationalized. 
---
Sorry if I rubbed you the wrong way.
---
Depends entirely on your build (outside of the two shot explosive weapons).
---
I find lever action with anti-armour (+50% armour penetration) annihilates anything from stealth and if it‚Äôs a head a shot everything but scorch beasts and mirelurk queens from non stealth.  
---
So anti armour is great on any weapon (as more damage goes straight to their health).
---
So any anti-armour legendary for your build will be good.  Melee has perks that give insane amounts of anti armour and others have perk buffs too.
---
My build has nearly 100% armour penetration through perks, legendary stats and receiver type.  
---
Dying light is a damn fun game and I am looking forward to Dying light 2 coming either this year or next.
---
Though the climbing is something I've always wanted in Fallout, it's a skill or mutation that makes sense and just like you can take mighty leaps from roof to roof to slay a ghoul. I too should be able to run up a wall like spider man and shot them in the back of the head!
---
:P
---
Bad ass
---
It actually does nothing. It's a known bug. The only useful mod for the syringer does nothing.
---
I got the plans.. I will be on in like 20 mins. Message me gt themisterphenix 
---
That‚Äôs reasonable, but they could atleast show the name too or something. There‚Äôs really no point in naming your character, other than differentiating save files. Besides, I thought reporting someone isn‚Äôt really done by copying down a gamer tag (assuming that‚Äôs why they want it displayed?) it‚Äôs usually done by going to the ‚Äúrecently played with‚Äù tab then ‚Äúreport‚Äù. But maybe I‚Äôm wrong 
---
Source on "real raids coming"? Did I miss something?
---
I do not follow. Please elaborate. I'm curious now.

I have the mask, still need a screenshot or something?

Great and likewise!

I‚Äôm mountain time. 
---
If someone else tagged it the body/meat or metal pile won‚Äôt despawn.

It also sometimes just glitches.

Op, try blowing it out of the way using a grenade for now.
---
You‚Äôre right though, we should be able to scrap them ala FO4 scrap that settlement mod.
---
No worries, Roll Tide
---
I really have no idea why it's a thing. All I know is that I read it on here that it was on SONY's side.
---
Yeah, for this reason I always drop something dumb, check for the bag, then transfer items into the bag. I have lost a lot of 1* legendaries trying to drop bags for other players. :(
---
I‚Äôll buy the two shot lmg, how much? I‚Äôll be on in an hour 
---
I feel your pain. Did the same thing with a 3* .50 Cal
---
I help all the time. Most do. Not sure where the rumors started
---
I found plans if you need them
---
I have had the exact same experience! 4 days to download the beta, 2 days to download the first patch, and now I can play for a solid 8-10 hours without a disconnect. On PS4 in Canada.
---
I think it's possible that the wording means different armour penetration value increments for different weapons like it does for the mods with easily measurable values (range and ammo capacity). Range can jump from a small increase with "improved" to around double with "superior". Ammo capacity with drum magazines (superior) can be several times that of an "improved" clip. It would be nice to have some detailed form of combat logging to be able to parse and get some solid numbers.
---
I calculated the Perforating Magazine mod ("superior penetration") on the handmade rifle as 40% armor penetration. Otherwise, no idea.
---
Note that the text is not necessarily related to the effects. This is particularly obvious with the Western Revolver, where the damage text on the receiver mods is obviously garbage.
---
you ever pee in the toilet and not flush just to flex on dehydrated niggas?
---
X-01 power armor
---
Gotcha. Someone commented that Xbox does it too though. I assume stuff like Steam does too
---
I only recently found out about it. A person I play with frequently, requires reviving. I took quack surgeon to save myself some stimpacks. Turns out...my partner doesn't like waking up intoxicated.
---
rofl, point taken, I've changed it to '1' and '1b' for solutions. 
---
I considered doing something like 'problem 1, solution to problem 1', but I really wanted to list all the issues linearly, so readers/Bethesda can get the full weight of the various problems affecting CAMP building. Plus I know some folks have no interest in reading arbitrary, personal solutions to global problems. ;)
---
I think the secret is to take it slowl and make sure you understand what you are agreeing to.  I've been playing solo for over 250 hours and made my first trade a few days ago.  I was buying a plan for 2000 caps and saw it in his inventory and saw the option to request it so I did.  Then the option changed to "Offer", so I hit it and put in 2000 caps.  Turns out I was offering to sell him some useless note for 2000 caps, but he didn't bite :).  Then I saw he had set the price on the plan and when I cursored over it I got the option to "Buy".
---
I've done a few more trades since then, and I just take it slow and wait for them to do what they need to.
---
Thank you for telling me this, I‚Äôll edit to include!
---
hey so while I sort of agree with you, I'm still downvoting you because you pretty much did nothing but sling unwarranted insults at a guy who was doing nothing of the sort.
---
don't be a shitbag

Because people are entitled, and bandwagon hatred of something is ‚Äúcool.‚Äù It also creates click bait, and that creates revenue. Devs don‚Äôt owe us anything. They were paid for their work, wether it‚Äôs good or bad. Just like a carpenter, a mechanic, or a groundskeeper. Wether the work was good or bad you still have to pay for that service, and if you want that service ‚Äúfixed‚Äù because it wasn‚Äôt to your standard, you will have to pay more. You could go out tomorrow and buy a $40,000 truck only to find out there is a recall on a part, or the part could fail all together which in turn requires more money and time for repairs. I think the same could be applied to game development. Our time, money, and patience will make this game better and many games to come.   Nothing is perfect obviously, and the perfect game doesn‚Äôt exist. If it did we would have no other games and no other new creative ideas. With that being said I enjoy this game a lot. I spent countless hours playing, and I enjoy getting lost in that world and making my own adventure. Some people need their hands held, or told what to do, or where to go. This game has plenty of story if you want it, and anyone complains about no npc‚Äôs missed the biggest story point of all. We are the npc‚Äôs! We are the humans that will rebuild America! No Mans Sky suffered a similar fate when it was released, time went on, devs never gave up, and it was again reviewed to be something great. I have faith in this game, and the company. I look forward to the further development of this game.

The Brotherhood sends their regards. Ad Victoriam, bitch.

Repairing things in the wild (uranium fever extractors) DO NOT tell you how they are getting the steel.  It only says: 10 steel repair?  Ok/cancel.   Also the game priotizes scrapping mods BEFORE bulk steel which makes zero sense.  
---
IMHO the best way to stop these threads and stop me from reliving the scrapping of my shocks and jetpack is to fix the damn issue. 
---
sadly 2 shot weapons lose accuracy out the wang, but they're still fun to use if you're not using them long range.
---
I play on Xbox and can confirm that gamertag are displayed. I would assume that Beth programmed it the same across all platforms to make it consistent.
---
And with no permanent but isolated storage to keep it out of inventory, you have no choice unless you're monitoring your resources down to the nth degree
---
Has showed up for me 3 times, all different versions of mothman, all in random locations. 2 times it fled and the third I killed it and got some useless loot. That's about it.
---
I seem to have this happen most often in Watoga, as soon as i turn a corner and see a robot it dies occasionally with no other players visible on the map nearby. Also simultaneous when there are a few on screen so it's not some guardian sniper :( This also happened to me near top of the world while i was fighting a scorched on the road and got closer it dropped dead and the area spawned in some super mutants instead. Maybe has to do with crossing a marker for spawns removing whatever was there previously. 
---
I too am in Canada and don‚Äôt get many disconnects. I wonder if, given our much smaller population than the US, our servers just have a lighter load and/or a smaller chance of having a duper on them.
---
I run quack surgeon in nuke zones because it's funny to think that we're all dying and getting drunk while fighting a giant bat or irradiated zombies.
---
Weird. Hope they change it.
---
Tried it when I was level 17ish. Saw my first level 55+ scorched and noped tf out. Being swarmed by enemies double your level sucks extra when you‚Äôre confined in a tunnel
---
Lmao
---
CAMP goes boom boom then bye bye :(
---
war it is then, ill be sure to send my condolences to your next of kin
---
Similar for me with Charleston Landfill. Graham walks all the way into the workshop and hangs out for a bit, talks to himself, then leaves. I‚Äôve seen him there multiple times. 
---
 But he didn't study how to make his bed? Smh
---
Fair enough. I might have been a little harsh. But yeah, it does rub me the wrong way, sadly. I absolutely can't deal with people, so I don't like reading or hearing stuff about it not being so bad, because that's going to vary wildly from person to person. 
---
Something in the Midwest with radtwisters. 
---
well atleast i know now
---
I've done pretty extensive testing and I've come to the conclusion it literally serves no purpose other then allowing you(and everyone else) to open a garage door then have it close automatically after a few seconds. But yeah, you could remove the keypad and just make the switch do the same thing. 
---
If they ever get around to it, they should change that and also add a toggleable version. 
---
It happens if people are doing the XP glitch.
---
Does it really matter as long as their targeting is broken?
---
Scared the crap out of me the first time, when it just randomly jumped in front of my face lol.
---
I had to do port forwarding on my router. There's no specific settings in the game or the launcher itself to adjust for your network, that I could find. But once I used the ports listed on the Bethesda site, the game became much more steady and less prone to crashing.
---

---
What level are the enemies you're facing? The problem with Whitesprings is high level players always hang out there so you might be fighting enemies that shouldn't be there for you. Maybe try watching the map for when no high level players are nearby and then ft there and try it.
---
I like it. Maybe some toilet paper.
---
Can't tell you how refreshing it is seeing someone play support while she's flying rather than just sitting there with a melee weapon out waiting. Thanks for helping keep the ranged fight going. If my team runs into you during a queen fight we'll bring more booze to pay you back. PS4
---
Jumping around Whitespring. Can‚Äôt touch me, ghouls!
---
Would be nice if when you finished looting all the ferns you popped open the map to show where you are, just saying.
---
Otherwise great video.
---
Noice!
---
Wait to do the mistress of mysteries missions til higher level the weapon created from it is scaled so itll be better higher up
---
I read most of everything up to that point. Intently read the first few points about how exactly the settlement system, if you want to call it that,  has changed between the two games, then just enough to understand the points for the rest. And I did read enough to understand what the solutions were, but when I saw that I just stopped and had to comment :P
---
I actually did some of my own testing for this awhile ago, posted it here on the sub and everything. If you want a link to the post I can do that, otherwise here is all the data I provided. 
---
Just a quick preface, the pics are from a level 21 character and a level 76 character. They are separate characters. I then leveled the 76 to 100 and replaced my CAMP down (shown in video). In all iterations I used the same simple build, parts are listed with the pic album, and the process I used for each is demonstrated in the video.

Also, I know vid isn't the best quality, I'm not experienced in doing video at all. I have a 21x9 monitor and couldn't change that either, so the quality turned out not the best. 
---
To my knowledge any PA mod without a model name in it is An excavator mod. Threw me off the first time also. 
---
Well considering stuff can spawn in your camp or your turrets don‚Äôt detect it until it‚Äôs in your camp you want it to have a clear Line of fire to everywhere in your camp in its aiming arc.
---
As long as it‚Äôs placed on the edge of its tower it should be able to fire at anything below it on that edge, so on a corner makes that two edges.
---
As I said though this assumes they do their job for once 
---
No shit. Live free or die!
---
This is exactly why I stopped, or at least a big part. Started up a new modded FO4 playthrough and haven‚Äôt looked back 
---
We‚Äòre facing 62 level beefy ass scorched, so you‚Äòre prolly right
---
Could we get all the stuff for it then put it together when we‚Äòre higher?
---
Abnormal flex but alright
---
Shoot a grenade with a grenade launcher 
---
If you can find a server that doesn‚Äôt have any high lvl players there. Also you will have to run in and out no Lilly gagging. I would drop all your stuff in storage it may take a few try‚Äôs to find a solid path.
---
I find this happens only at yhe wrong times like when im giving. Ive dropped 1000+ 5.56 ammo and it all disappeared 
---
Why not!
---
dude ill give it to you for 200 Im just trying to get rid of it tbh.
---
That might work idk lol i did the missions around lev 110
---
I get so excited when I get an assasins weapon and then look at it for 10% damage
---
That would be a nice free fast travel for those of us who play alone and can't warp to friends' camps!
---
And One? As in "So klingt liebe?" Yes, I would have also assumed the intersection between those who know Fallout and And One is zero, unless German as well!
---
My main build is unarmed, low health rad rat. But it's iterchangable with shotguns or heavys
---
Ah okay, I understand your point now. I would support either the two legendary effects being blocked from happening on the same weapon together or perhaps randomly assigning any TSE weapons currently in the game to be two shot or just explosive 
---
What I'm wondering is if the Weapon Artisan perk is bugged or not. If you repair the Chainsaw or the Ripper (have not tried yet with a Mr Handy Buzz Saw) beyond 100%, then their damage drastically increases.... at least percentage-wise. The Chainsaw goes from doing 2 damage to doing 12 damage (500% increase), and the Ripper goes from 5 to 31 (520% increase). If those values are true, then this Furious Ripper I just got is insane--with the the mod which adds bleed damage it would melt just about anything. And it does, at least small stuff like ghouls.... need to test on a Scorchbeast Queen that isn't being butt-fucked by 20 people at once.
---
They stack DAMAGE. It‚Äôs insane. That‚Äôs why people are duping so many bobble heads, people are getting to 50k+ damage on handmades and shit 
---
My camp is built running alongside a cliff with the entry up top. I was hoping to get all the way to the ground so I could enter even when I spawned at the base of the cliff, but my lower limit is about two stories too high.
---
I guess I could place my camp somewhere on the cliff face instead.
---
Axing the real questions 
---
You can upgrade it at 35 and 45 if you get it early. No reason to wait, just go when It's empty.
---
That was my life until about 30. Now i am a leper, constantly living with some awful condition, hoarding the few cures i find for when i get the really bad diseases... like herpes.
---
Naming my medic Dr Bojangles just seems silly now.
---
Was me during first fight. You do it enough and you see what the fights are lacking and adapt and overcome. XB1 :(
---
If you are facing  the entrance to the church in flatwood, there's a weapons bench located at the house directly next door, on the righthand side, just sitting on the front porch. 
---
And of course there's also one located and the overseers camp. 
---
Plans for it, or mods?
---
Hi! I saw plans meny times plans for metal armor in Crafton station vendor. Just do cople server hoping
---
Yea those are the guys that are there when high level players go, you can try and go when there's no high levels nearby. You should probably be facing level 20-40 guys there, not the 60s. Sometimes when I go there it's all level 20 ghouls and that's how I know a lower level player was there recently.
---
Usually that's an ez server crash, nice
---
Low health high damage 
---
Alice in Wonderland reference? Mad Hatter's tea party?
---
Materials and the plans.
---
ESO does this, and I think it gives you the option as to which you'll see more prominently when another character's names show up.
---
Having played since beta, it has shown 3 for me as well 
---
It's very possible to be legit. I'm not 400+ but I do have a level 151, 101 and 89 and even I spend a ton of time dicking around now, if I was full on grind mode like when I was on my now 151 I could have a combined of somewhere around 500 no doubt.
---
Don't know sorry, but I would try using something like radx to suppress the mutation effects in the hope that they might reset to normal when it wears off
---
Nice, I‚Äôll give that a go :D
---
Sigh.
---
I'm going to bed.
---
You can buy them off Ebay now, so yeah...
---
Yeah as mentioned you can craft them again at higher levels. Just do not sell or lose the original version. Once you‚Äôve lost it you cannot recreate it at a higher level.
---
He's under your "kill cryptids" challenge for atoms. He likes to teleport away. Got him the second time through vats. He poofed and I guess I did too and smacked him dead.
---
Yep
---
I did that when I was your level but had ghouls wiping me out, not scorched. I basically sneak till I get to the bushes in front of the building with the sword. Then hopped on the bushes and hopped to the top of the van. From here I was able to take out all the ghouls that were demolishing me before. 
---
I did my first scorchbeast around your level but I wasn't as cheerful about it lol. Went through all my ammo, stimpacks and broke a bunch of weapons. I was pretty cranky after it dropped basically nothing.
---
Ok cool. 
---
Hmmm I'll try. Just spent a few thousand buying these, and now they don't work... really sucks. Buying a handicap lol. 
---
Happened to me just an hour ago. A lvl 100 running around in whitesprings killed me 3-4 times. Never turned pacifist mode off and wondered who he is and why he can kill me, he wasnt even shown as an enemy
---
You can do what I did, take the path on the back side of the house to the side entrance, and lure them out to the assaultrons and sentry bots at the side entrance of the golf course. It might take a couple runs but it worked for me.
---
That‚Äôs so bizarre. On par for this game I suppose. Thanks! 
---
Yea that really sucks. Good luck
---
Pretty much anything that reduces range for shotguns = bad.
---
I would love to do this. I typically C. A. M. P near existing settlements, so I typically dump freebies into a chest or mailbox along a well travelled road...  But that's not permanent
---
It‚Äôs voodoo mask, cool!!
---
Ah
---
The Vengeful Mothman is sent to test the strength of wastelanders, only the strong will survive in this new world. His sacrifice is to help you to find the true path to enlightenment. 
---
Keep an eye out at the Lightview Lighthouse (near vault 76) to complete the The Path to Enlightenment event to receive true wisdom from the Wise Mothman. Praise be.
---
If you want to learn more about our organisation we will be door knocking at camps to hand out pamphlets about or lord and savior (lol).
---
Yep, I knew that. Go on.
---
I totally agree, I wouldn't care so much if I didn't waste an hour on something hard then get disconnected &amp; have to start all over again. 
---
So what did you find? I looked at the pics but I'm not sure what to make of them (I'm a little buzzed, haha). It sounds like you're arguing that decor budget never changes in any way, but then even if my brother somehow got it wrong along with the other posters, how do you explain that some people post budget-capped camps that are small-medium in size, while others post similarly detailed budget-capped camps that are 4-5 floors large?
---
It just doesn't make any sense to me. There seems to be \~something\~ affecting how big our places get!
---
You can never complain about a nuke you didn't launch. 
---
What platform are you on? If PC I can jump on and give you an escort
---
Honestly I enjoy the game quite a bit myself, but I‚Äôm really sick of all the dupers ruining the game. Stopped playing until it gets fixed (or doesn‚Äôt)
---
Long story short without getting into detail:
---
The PvP sucks, there's no progression in it, no goals no depth it's one shot or get one shorted.
---
There's no end game and no story, kill the queen which is godly buggy, does she even drop loot yet?  
---
The game is clearly just a mod of fallout 4, it should have just been an expansion pack.
---
The loot system is horrible, there's no survival or fear of anything.  It's way to easy.
---
Of course without getting into detail that's kinda sums it up.  You can disagree with this sure but these are facts based on what consumers want.  They expect more, not a low quality game like this from Bethesda 
---
This might also be a good time to warn folk that it is a terrible idea to throw a grenade towards an enemy turret that has you in its line of sight. Got killed twice yesterday by the lv40 machinegun turrets in the harper ferry armoury when the grenades I threw were shot and exploded the second they left my hand.
---
well sometimes you want to trade with a budd but that dude in the pic is clear duper
---
Handmade is what I am maining atm, the balance seems good 20 rounds + superior ap vs 35 rounds + improved ap. I just wish I knew what that value was :) I guess in the end it's safe to say that at least it is working and improves ammo economy to some degree so I will like stick to the perforating magazine.
---
I‚Äôm broke now because I bought a rifle. Thanks though. 
---
I have a two shot revolver (3 star), two shot Tesla rifle and two shot Gatling plasma. 
---
The only explosive I have is a double handmade. I also have a bloodied and a quad handmade but no other effects. 
---
Other notable are a vampires cryolator with 25% faster fire rate and a two shot missile launcher that I gave away. Oh and a vampires auto grenade launcher that I‚Äôve also given away.
---
&gt; Just spent a few thousand buying these
---
Do you have carn or herb?  There is a bug with serums and both of those mutations.
---
I apreciate that! We‚Äòre on PS4 unfortuantely cause I‚Äòd love the help
---
Cryo is very useful for the scorch queen,, it helps the Melee players have more time to damage her on the ground , thats a keeper that weapon :)
---
Behemoths have a car door strapped to one of their forearms like a shield in FO3.
---
It's called the Converted Munitions factory. Top of the map, just off route 98 northwest of the Red Rocket Megastop.
---
What deep pocket plans do you have (for which armour set I mean)?
---
You're so right man. Very important.
---
Thanks again, added!
---
Uhh no if I hired a contractor for their service and they didn't provide what they advertised or did what they were paid to do they would redo it or get sued and lose.  Bethesda offered a quality game and didnt deliver.  People payed for an in-depth game, not a glitchy mod of fallout 4
---
Or a notepad with less than desirable WPM's while struggling to spell big words.
---
Last night I was farming nuked Whitesprings (also not mine) and saw another person higher level than me (I was 92, he was 112) soloing. I asked him if he wanted to join up, told him I had Rad Sponge, and was sharing it. Met up with another loner (123), and added him, too. I also had Team Medic up.  
---
I'm freshly mutated. I have Marsupial, Speed Demon, Bird Bones, Scaly Skin, Grounded, and Healing Factor. Every time I saw one of them getting low health, I'd stimpak myself, healing them, though thanks to Healing Factor I pretty much stayed at 100%.
---
Np. Sorry I couldn't help. Good luck and hope you get it done
---
Why would you buy a gun for real money in FO:76?
---
It was an issue yesterday along with flashing graphics. 
---
In the middle of play servers were taken down. 
---
In game audio has been problematic for me often. 
---
I actually had great luck getting Grahm while hopping for the responder vendor bot - he spawns/patrols frequently on the road across the southern bridge from the station you run across to try to get the responder vendor bot to spawn. It‚Äôs basically two with one stone as you can hop for both, I got Grahm my first hop and then a few times later, then got the responder vendor bot about 6 hops in. 
---
You don't even know how hard I had to fight the urge to post a link to "Purple Squirt" here.

Turrets are Vault Dwellers using VATS. New theory emerges.

I'm over 100 and I also avoid SBs unless there's other mobs/robots shooting it, otherwise they're just a waste of time and bullets. I agree that they're way too annoying to fight most of the time.
---
I have NO idea. You'd have to ask the people buying them off of ebay. I think it's a horrible investment. I mean fuck, they could spend that money on some AMD stock and turn profit this year. Set up bonds or even start a IRA.
---
But you know. Priorities, lol.
---
That's it right there
---
Dont even bother with stimpaks at that level. Just use food and healing salve.
---
Dude really knows his shit
---
That bug got fixed a patch or two ago 
---
they announced new vaults coming when they brought nukes back online for more end game content and I misremembered this article and player speculation that new vaults equals end game raids.

It's a known bug if you have that perk equipped and you're not in a party you only have negative effects from mutations
---
Yeah but that's armor. Maybe the rear door of the APC tanks? 
---
Oh that's funny. I have met that dog but I never thought of moving my camp to him. Lol.
---
That cured it for me, thanks doc!
---
Ghouls gone wild.
---
For YOU.  All of the above only is true, FOR YOU.  Don't presume to speak for what other people find meaningful.
---
Look at the video I linked, it's a video of **me** from December 20th, in the video you can see me at level 333-&gt;334. The video is literally titled "333-&gt;334". I suppose I created a time machine to go into the past and abuse an exploit now? lol
---
I'm over 600 hours total in '76, the video shows me doing a level in around an hour, and it wasn't exactly a 'good' hour either, since I didn't have party xp, only 5 INT and  no nuke zone. You do the maths of what level I'm "supposed" to be in 600 hours.
---
It's pretty pathetic to accuse me of being a cheater when I've literally uploaded a video of me since the exploit was patched with around half of the xp I have now.
---
Mhm
---
Another thing, how come these things use plastic to bulk yet are clearly in cardboard boxes? 
---
Ridiculous. 
---
In one of the maintenance areas you can actually find the bot they decommissioned because of that.
---
I like to do a lot of trading in the markets. It gives you incentive to just wander about and find items. 
---
Agreed.  Spelling out what I think you mean: ‚ÄúLight‚Äù vs ‚ÄúMedium‚Äù vs ‚ÄúHeavy‚Äù don‚Äôt show up in the armor piece‚Äôs stats anywhere.  Only ‚ÄúSturdy‚Äù and ‚ÄúHeavy‚Äù show up, but only in the title and only if the armor piece has no other modifiers.
---
Why do you even need that? 
---
I'm really hoping they do!
---
Where did you find or get it?
---
I got my shocks at Welch.
---
Find all the cryptids, kill an epic behemoth, find all the dead vault dwellers, find the undetonated nuke and cut the right wire. Idk. 
---
I found one in Harpers ferry.  Bonus limb damage too.
---
Things like TSE shotguns seem to one shot anything, I fail to see how in the long run that wont be nerfed by Bethesda
---
Ah, didn't realize.  Thanks.
---
O have had this happen. To resolve it it remove the card and add it back on if you don‚Äôt have another that you want to use when solo. Has fixed it every time for me. 
---
I list my karma syringer after the quest with rose. Is there any way to craft a new one or find one?
---
I have two characters for a combined level 140 and have never used power armor. I solo silos with no problem and can also do nuke zones by myself (hazmat suit). If you know what you‚Äôre doing and have a solid build/weapons then there‚Äôs no enemy in the game that is a problem.
---
Can anyone still in the vault confirm whether our bed was made or not?!  We woke up from a bender, left the vault, but did we take the knowledge with us to make our beds when we left?
---
But the brotherhood gave me speedy receiver 
---
Can confirm pumpkin house. Corn=cobalt.
---
My friends all take a turn trying for the pie every time we come across a Port-a-Diner. 2 nights in a row we all stare in shock as the same friend gets the pie with us all watching. Nice job catching video of it, I'll have to record our next pie attempt in case.
---
One of the many traditional fallout points that has kinda lost its importance. Along with lockpicking &amp; hacking. 
---
Light and heavy metal armor are different types, but the same mods apply to both, just like light vs heavy leather.
---
I've never seen sturdy or heavy metal armor plans at a vendor, so it's either missing from the lists or heavily level-capped. In the long run it doesn't matter because you can unlock everything by scrapping light arms.
---
Ah could be tho. Thanks for sharing. No need to apologise.
---
I've had bags vanish this way. I focus the camera on my leg, drop something dumb, see if the bag appears, then without closing the pip boy drop what I wanted. Worked so far.
---
And what evidence have u got to show that increasing both radius and budget by 25% to 50% wont have a detrimental effect on the servers and other players experience, when taking into consideration the various hardware configurations. 
---
Its easy to throw around percentages, but before any kind of increase is approved, they will have to test what effects it will have, I will say tho that the current budget is most likely a very conservative value that gives them some wiggle room to increase in the future if need be.
---
Where are people selling flux for 200? I need in on that. I have 1000s
---
You have to be out of combat... so if you sneak, you can‚Äôt be shown as ‚Äúdetected‚Äù at all, once you are out of combat it will refresh your entire health bar in about 5 seconds.
---
Id say check this list out, there are a lot of misc/side quests you might still have to discover.
---
[http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout\_76\_quests](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout_76_quests)
---
Otherwise, its now farming for better weapons, doing Daily/Weekly challenges, completeing Events/Daily Quests, and working on your CAMP/collections.
---
We should be expecting the first DLC in a couple of weeks
---
Yeah I was super disappointed that Tesla hands disnt make my PA all electricy.  I don't even use unarmed, I was just hoping for visuals
---
Maybe they should just add a limit to how much you can carry so you can't add to your inventory if you are over the limit unless it's by quest reward and just be done with it.
---
Thanks for this! Do you know if it includes the fire barrel or this in another plan. I‚Äôve been looking for those for a while. Cheers!
---
That's why the buff the mod that stops the damage from explosive. the issue is the explosion not the shotgun. If the shotgun is one shotting with only two shot then learn the jump and move backwards. Nerfing anything in a video game never leads to anything good. It only makes the game more boring and slow. Destiny 2 had a serious issue where at launch they "balanced" the game. All they did was nerf everything and that made everyone leave the game. Fo76 has enough issues without nerfing the damage and fun of these games.
---
I wish I could spend it, but I'm afraid of buying plans I already know.
---
We could play together. My username is Daddy\_D-12..Jokes aside though. I'm level 26
---
Yes, it lags the trade because it has to communicate with the fucking server, therefore the server is lagging to calculate the trade process itself. The other process are OK because they're using different resources.
---
There wasn't at launch, best thing they have added so far lol. Day one was awful, nothing but people breathing, sniffing, and coughing in there mic so everyone ended up turning it off.
---
I meant just for the people trading, yes. I guess it wasn't clear enough, lol
---
Well I don't have the perk.... any other perk. 
---
Aw man that sucks. I don‚Äôt think I have seen a heavy metal drop since level 20. It‚Äôs a shame I was hoping to turn the legendary metal stuff I have to heavy. 
---
Yeah!!! I'm not German (unless you count "my ancestors moved from Germany 3-4 generations ago), but I fell in love with the old school EBM &amp; industrial sound when I was a kid. Eventually started learning German, ended up taking 4 years of it in college, really love quite a bit about the language, culture, and people. 
---
I realize now that a lot of EBM is pretty silly (and not as "hardcore" or "angry" as my untrained ears originally heard it) but that makes me love it even more. 
---
Does this stack with each piece?
---
Yeah I don't know why people are having disconnects but I'm glad I'm not
---
The only time I ever found him was during a defend event at this workshop! My VATs targeted Chally as he was walking by.
---
I don't. Bird Bones and Adrenal

Well this way I can finally personally attest to "these numbers are right". I've seen people try to shoot down people with the argument "have you tested it yourself" and such. This way I can say I know 100% for a fact these numbers are right; I personally transcribed them and they fit with what I've heard.
---
Welcome brother Sugoisucc, the all knowing mothman has chosen you.
---
-- Also a side note this is the second first mothman sighting post I have seen in the 15 minutes. Must be a busy mothman day today :P
---
Farm your finished gear set and alternate perk loadouts. I'd recommend a perk set for solo, group and in and out of nuke zones. Have you killed the queen yet? If not, launch another nuke on prime and kill her. You could also focus on collecting plans for your camp and getting hard to find mods for your PA
---
yup, hopefully some other radium weirdos on our respective platforms will see this and we'll have some buddies. If I ever find any other PS4 players who want mods I can do, I'll deffo offer to do them.
---
 
---
Yeah, that's what I meant
---
Yeah I figured as much. I have a few legendary weapons and other odd valuables, but to save time how about you tell me the ballpark your fee would be and go from there?
---
I also enjoy exploring and picking up whatever I find along the way but those two pieces vex me. 
---
You‚Äôd be surprised partner. I had my house built just over a year ago, and the cabinets were literally falling off the walls. So I‚Äôve had to pay more to have it corrected. What I‚Äôm saying is you can pay for literally anything and not know the condition it will be in when you get it. So do you pay more to fix it, or do you return it? Maybe it‚Äôs a new pair of headphones, or a laptop, or a game that you thought would be good and it sucked (not to expectation). So basically I‚Äôm saying if the consumer hates it return it, and don‚Äôt hate on the people that do enjoy it. It‚Äôs just not for everyone, and nothing ever is. But hate breeds hate and the gaming community is already a toxic place full of angry entitled people and animosity. 
---
Does it change the Scorched Earth Event in anyway?
---
Launch a nuke from each silo (though spoiler, they are all the same, which  is a missed opportunity to have required different damage types or techniques for each, too bad).  But the best thing I've found to do is, team up and have fun with other people doing their quests.  Also, whatever your build is, try something different.  If you've always used weapon X, aim for the complete opposite to see what it's like.  
---
It has been patched since release? It wasn't at the end of December because it was holidays nothing gets patched at that time in the year.
---
The damage on the plasma Gatling seems fine to me, it has a comparable DPS to the 50 cal machine gun, but the durability definitely needs a buff, probably doubling durability would be good.
---
I completely understand. Honestly, had this game come out about 6 years ago when I was still working in retail/food service I would be like "hell to the no, I just want to be alone now thanks". And as an introvert, I definitely have periods of time like that still.
---
Enjoy the game solo! I know I totally have as well.
---
Also interested in the LMG, can offer caps or mutation serums :P
---
These 2 plus healing factor makes me feel like a post apocalypse Superman
---
Never drop anything you don't mind losing. Hell, sometimes the items don't drop they just vanish. 
---
I was gonna start up an altso I can trade with the though of having 800-2000lbs of stuff with the perks on him but honestly this makes me not even want to bother trading. 
---
I can't compete in game with a trader that just pills items out his butt and doesn't even bother with weight limits.
---
Just ask the Japanese folks, they ought to know
---
Does this work for PS4? If so, how?
---
My game has been freezing and disconnecting and blue screening tonight more so than all of last week combined... Idk what's going on
---
Are you suggesting an... Oakenshield?
---
I'm on PS4 btw
---
Day after is Australia Day..please don't add anything in Atom store for it though lol. Too much cringe involved with Australian stereotypes
---
Just another bad mechanic
---
My surrounds works funny. There is definitely activity from the center speaker, but it's not very good tat directional sound. I've been going Xbone-&gt;HDMI-&gt;TV-&gt;SPDIF-&gt;Receiver to minimize lag. I'm going to try Xbone-&gt;HDMI-&gt;Receiver-&gt;HDMI-&gt;TV at some point to see if it improves the multichannel audio.
---
Agreed
---
Sell it for $10
---
How can you say Wallace is charm immune with that *soothing voice*?
---
Kriger san my cherry blossoms are wilting!
---
I have all the heavy weapon perks and these weapons really do suck.  A big ass heavy laser weapon shouldn't do negligible damage, especially if your heavy gunner perks are all maxed out. 
---
This improved somewhat with one of the patches, but not enough. And they break really fast. Believe it or not, the gunsmith perk does actually work on these weapons too. 
---
Gunsmith maxed out means a Gatling laser will wear out in 5 minutes instead of one minute.  If that's an exaggeration, it isn't by much.  
---
Get rid of them they are for players who do not want a challenge and they cut the life of this game off at the head
---
I don't care about all that but at least make it a square about 95% of the items I place are all square not round. So the base area being a circle is just annoying
---
I ran into a swarm of level 1 mosquitos.  I'm level 13, and it took a good 5 minutes to kill them as they would constant regen.
---
I made the mistake of using an automatic, and after they took damage, they'd just go back to 100% health.  I had to bludgeon them and even then if I didn't get lucky to reduce their health by 50% on the first hit, they'd go back to 100%.  Seems the trick is to 'hurt' them first, let them buzz about for a bit, then kill them.  Hurting things too fast too hard just resets them to 100%.
---
I did get 13 of my rounds back, which is... crap. and kind of weird to get some of your ammo back after a fight.
---
Any Power Armour mod that doesn't have a prefix name on it (like T60 reactive plates or X01 reactive plates etc) is for the Excavator power armour. I only found that out recently...
---
Mine spawns me outside my build area, so I'm really doubting it as well. 
---
Been stuck there myself for at least a month. Numerous tickets opened, their response is that they're aware. Nothing to do but wait for a patch. Or start a new character, I guess. 
---
Yeah it happens all the time! It reminds me of the days of oblivion where the hands and feet would fall slower than the rest.
---
*"That's a lotta damage!!"* \-Phil Swift 
---
do you have an explosive weapon? you could test it by shooting at your feet 
---
I mean shit I've personally built large multi story buildings with capped budgets:[https://imgur.com/a/eDrw4pF](https://imgur.com/a/eDrw4pF)
---
as well as fair sized spread out multi-building mini towns:[https://imgur.com/a/rNeJuQk](https://imgur.com/a/rNeJuQk)
---
It all depends on what you want to do with your budget, I would argue that it's decently generous in it's current state. I doubt everyone has a problem with it, just the people who really like to build, which is pretty unfair to them. I would like to see them increase the physical size, area, as well as the budget size too. 
---
The conclusion of what I did however was that budget does not change. You can see that not only with separate characters, different levels, and leveling then replacing (updating) CAMP, none of it changed how much I could build. 
---
Every time I used the exact same items, then built the exact same number of turrets, and each time my build was exactly 100% of my budget. You should honestly test it out yourself if you're really curious. You have to scrap literally everything first to see if you have a bugged CAMP, I make sure to zero out my CAMP before I build each time, then use the same simple structure. Building that little 4x4 brought me to 11% each time, then the 9 turrets took up the other 89% to total 100%. 
---
Goodto know
---
I use a controller too so it might me the same for you. Hold R1 for grenade, then press L1 to enter VATS and lock on it and then spam R2 to shoot at it. Might take a few shots because of accuracy. If you have a critical it might hit it regardless of accuracy, I haven't tried.
---
Just make it so only the owner can toggle switch. When switch is on the keypad toggles power, when switch is off the keypad "bursts" power.
---
K.
---
Is the new PvP mode faction based? I was hoping it was, but didn't think we had those details yet
---
I just had it happen with level 1 mosquitos or whatever they are called.
---
Same with components for stable fluxes that get scrapped. 
---
they increased stash size from 400 to 600, I have no evidence or statistics to rebut your argument, its a request, its easy to be critical of other people instead of going out and offering suggestions. Hiding behind a critique of what was said instead of engaging in actual discussion about the topic.
---
Yet you didnt have to do Item repair in FO4 either, they're game mechanics taht are used for a reason. STABILITY
---
did they give you x-01?
---
Not a problem when you're 10 feet in the air out of reach when you shoot 
---
Legendary drills do drop, but are still level locked, chainsaws don't drop as loot legendary or otherwise, only found on the ground
---
Is full assasins/sentinal combat armor able tank a few hits with a TSE? Any videos floating around?  
---
Praise be the Mothman!! The Mothman shan't like thy sins! Mothman will have his revenge!! Mothman be praised!!!!!
---
Todd God.
---
Noo 
---
Yeah I‚Äôm into that. How many caps?
---
At the Whitesprings yeah.  The others were programmed that way by the survivors.
---
It will be a great day whenever they get around to fix it.  Crap like this just makes it bad for everyone.  Walking anywhere near this dragged the game to a crawl.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/3xe99SN](https://imgur.com/a/3xe99SN)
---
Maybe just block him in-game.
---
1000 atoms
---
Log out and re log. That's the only thing that fixed it for me. 
---
I did
---
Anti-armor, furious, vampiric(or assassin if you wanna use it other players)
---
I take it you haven't played TES Skyrim?
---
Damage in general, you can be shotted by many things. I could understand you are a complete glass cannon build, but then you have things like Sentinel armor what completely breaks pvp. Ill go play Rust for pvp, I doubt this game will ever be even remotely competitive.  
---
It wasn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs the same bed as the modern bed, which is a mess
---
Also furious and vampiric only work with the power attack and not the ripping attack, try bloodied, mutants etc
---
i shall sacrifice the BoS to our lord, brethren 
---
You are absolutely spot on, as I was playing the other night I completed the mission I was currently on, opened my map to fast travel back to camp, I see someone there and I think to myself will I arrive to find my stuff smashed? As I appear I see a lvl 15 poking around looking at the stash box and harvesting my purified water, which is no problems, so I call out "hey dude, how are you going?" to which I got the reply "I'm not a dude, I am a girl". and for the rest of night we beat shit up, so much fun.
---
Agreed on all points. I have the TSE version of all my guns but I don't use them because they trivialize every aspect of the game.
---
If the legendary affects aren't adjusted for the PvP update however, I absolutely will pull them out of storage to level the playing field.
---
Actually another point to keep in mind (came up in another post) is that the Exavator mods dont have the prefix name of them. Normally the vendor sells PA mods they have the prefix of the suit that work on- like T-60 Stealthboy or X01 jetpack etc.
---
So say you were looking for calibrated shocks for the exavator armour,  it wont show up in the vendor list Exavator calibrated shocks it will just show up as Calibrated shocks, explosive vents, targeting hub etc.
---
I did them all solo. They are fine to do solo as long as you have the full hour (i.e., don‚Äôt try to start one on your own if the countdown timer started before you got there.)  And if you get there and the enemies are way too high level for you just abandon the idea for a while or server hop. For me the easiest one was Poseidon. I‚Äôve done that one a few times and occasionally a random person walking by will join in and help out.
---
i have infact done the path to Enlightenment and taken some Pictures. he because of that my favorite cryptid
---
Yah I have figured that out but it is pretty weird y it doesn‚Äôt just say it like the rest of them
---
PM me. 
---
Buy mr fuzzy tokens or god tier legendaries. Right now that's really the only way of keeping caps since the limit is pretty much nothing. Serum recipes are great too, they're worth thousands of caps and weigh only .25
---
There we go.  Mystery solved, our dweller straight up doesn't know how to make a bed.
---
Will a google form work?
---
Can we make it so that you cannot spawn into a Nuke zone?  I was disconnected while out of my power armor and when i came back to the game later on I spawned in and was in an active nuke zone.  By the time the game fully loaded i died from RADS.
---
Imagine finding this on the first corpse outside the vault, sweet Jesus.
---
Why do you have to be melee to farm? Personally if I want to farm whitespring I'll nuke it first so your turrets don't affect me, but I do think if you can't farm without turrets that negatively affect other people's farming, you should probably try somewhere else unless you're ok with people thinking you're a dick
---
Nice build, where is this location?
---
Just fyi. Decided to trade for plan. Clearly labeled combat armor yet taught dense for marine armor.
---
If you have speed demon, its a deal.
---
 heavy metal for the DR. Heavy combat with BoS for a better balance. 
---
If you click on it the components will probably say Black Titanium, so Excavator power armor. 
---
Does Zealot work against SB's?  Thats the only LMG I've ran into.
---
It's insane the power of those guns. I have a one shot explosive assault rifle - which turned out to be what I stuck with until endgame - and it hits for 223. A 50 Cal that hits for 153 a shot? Holy shit, that's broken as fuck.
---
this is a great comment, like bread and baloney! shapes should match, great call!
---
I brought my first few thinking that they just worked on anything if it didn't have the name in the front :P
---
They should add the ability to offhand with one-handed weapons since they're inferior to 2 handed with how the armor system works. Right now there is no reason for the 2 types of melee to be split up into 2 different perks.  
---
Yeah at 32 my base was destroyed by a level 140 for no reason. He also didn‚Äôt get a wanted rating. Bugged game is buggy and some people are just assholes when there is no end game.
---
I didn‚Äôt attack him, I play with pacifist mode on.
---
Besides Fissure Prime and Whitespring, experiment with other locations to Nuke and see what happens?
---
Have only seen one other place nuked when server hoping, the Nuke Mesh Depot (Top left of map).
---
But haven't been there to see what changes it has.
---
I have my camp right up the road from sunshine an he comes by to hand quite often.
---
I just beat this quest tonight and Rose‚Äôs Syringer disappeared. Maybe the weapon was never supposed to be permanent? And now they‚Äôre getting rid of them?
---
Yeah mine disappeared on completion tonight. 
---
&lt;3
---
Using this on a Lv.1 character will confuse the hell out of people!
---
I wondered when division 2 was coming out. I liked the first game
---
I think the cylinder has a maximum and minimum elevation based on the initial elevation of your camp placement. 
---
Lol my tactic to this is to run up close the back door and gun the place down 
---
There‚Äôs a mutation that gives 100 energy resistance. Personally I use all metal armor because I feel energy damage is weak and never have an issue. Assaultrons are probably the only enemy that you need to worry about with energy damage but I have ways of disabling them quickly.
---
Yea, taking it slow is definitely key.  But when it comes to item for item rather than trading for caps it gets a bit tricky it seems.  You have to rely on trusting the other player which for my situation was the problem.  They didn't know me so therefor didn't trust me either lol.
---
In the end all was well.  Instead of trading I dropped the item they wanted and they did the same - though they ended up losing the items they dropped as they fell through the floor...They were kind enough to still try and make up items I could use and we all went about our day.
---
But the whole trusting others to do the right thing is too risky in a day where there are a lot of toxic players out there and wouldn't think twice about scamming others.
---
It took me a couple minutes to find it, but ty. 
---
To clarify, it's down stairs by the backdoor along the long, trophy hallyway. 
---
Lol
---
It already has Rusty Knuckles and other unarmed mods.
---
Lol funny one, guess I'm the only one who finds it annoying the foundations have to be placed akwardly due to the circle shape.
---
Updoots.
---
Lol I should've been more specific my bad. But there is always a black cowboy hat there. At least for me.
---
I have no problem needing TSE. But how easily people forget how the meta was melee before TSE was widely distributed. 
---
We are going to need to nerf both or it's just going to return to charging at one another with hammers and 2 shooting one another.
---
Well I've seen circle shaped baloney do want sure how to take this
---
Minimum, 1200 probably. Maybe as high as 1800 caps depending on how long it takes. Very unpredictable spawns on stuff like that
---
1) then why play it, there is other titles out there, you want god mode go play FO4? or NV?
---
2) those players im pretty sure go against the terms and services agreement but I dont know
---
3)But if everyone hates them,
---
Someone could easily buy that off for 1k caps or more 
---
No it's all good, just wanted to save the next person a couple minutes. Just due to the risk of someone new walking up and respawning the entire clubhouse, lol.
---
Just make sure you learn the plan if you don‚Äôt get fusion. It won‚Äôt reward you a plan you already know.
---
I got lucky and scored a fusion on my first time completing it. Completed it to 100%. Not sure if that has any relevance.
---
Every time I run into that guy he‚Äôs got nothing that‚Äôs any good.  
---
It‚Äôs hilarious!
---
I'm pretty sure you don't get in game chat if you're in a party. I've noticed you will be able to see the speaker next to their name but I haven't heard anything from them unless I drop from the party.
---
I don't have problems with turrets as long as you're actively there and not just killing mobs afk.
---
I'm melee and just stand inside by the bottom of the stairs, so when everything respawns they group to me. If others are around they can blast away while I block the door, keeping them bunched up for easy kills to share.
---
Which is what some people are saying we should do. Ridiculous 
---
Speaking of someone buying it, do you play on xbox?
---
I'm Central but I don't keep normal human hours. I might be on at 3 AM or I might be on in the middle of the day. LOL
---
Was a problem when tse's were going for 60k+
---
I have two overlooking a cliff and they constantly target the mutants that show up. No light hooked up assisting either. 
---
Ah yea lol also along that trophy wall there is a bobble head on one of the shelfs behind a picture frame, and above that shelf there are 2 baseball bats if your looking for a bats to use or scrap!
---
Horribly gamebreaking for PvP, would have been an amazing addition to 4 but doesn't belong here IMO. I get why it's so common though
---
You‚Äôre only getting a 30% increase in damage, which is still crap.  The two shot explosive is nothing exceptional.  Dump it or store it and hope they properly buff the damage.
---
Ok thanks for the info I guess I'll wait. Where is the brotherhood quest begin I guess I can do that.
---
Right behind you. Just need the 20 kills and 20 revives
---
I‚Äôm stealth rifle with zero damage protection and manage to farm Whitesprings without turrets. 
---
I'll take one. I'll add your GT
---
Op for leveling a char. That thing will sell for a fair bit I bet
---
I wish I knew this before I got stuck with it at low level
---
Bro agreed they fuck the server up on top of the economy just rubbing salt in the wound
---
The revives seemed hardest. Kills were easier imo 
---
There isn‚Äôt much of an end-game so you will just have to wait for now. You could farm the SBQ I guess but that gets old pretty quickly. It looks like they are adding raid type activities soon and that could be fun. You could farm caps and materials and expand your camp building options if you like doing that kind of thing. Building is one of my favorite things to do. 
---
I do! But it‚Äôs not for sale!
---
I want mole stuff. Who needs Cult of the Mothman when you have Cult of the Mole. 
---
*Not officially recognized*
---
Damnnn i tried! üòÇ

baloney is round, bread is square
---
The scorchbeast seizure attack will trigger grenades. Don't throw grenades at scorchbeasts that have sighted you.
---
I absolutely love it,  but I wish it were something I could trigger by holding instead of tapping. There have been a handful of times where it's inconvenienced me,  especially trying to enter train carts or any slightly high entrances.
---
I can't say how exactly it works in Fo76 but in Fo4 the luck stat did in fact play a part, along with the number of times you have tried to get a pie. This means that no matter the luck, given enough attempts you would eventually get one. [Here is the formula](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Port-A-Diner) used to decide if you get one or not.
---
It‚Äôs fallout dude
---
If only wendigo slayer had been there
---
Is there a good list somewhere of the sidequests that drop legendary items? I think I must've done one recently and got a weightless MIRV "Daisycutter" I think it was? I'm lvl 68 now and seemed to have skipped many of the cool quests/legendary weapons from them..
---
The one at whitesprings station or inside whitesprings?
---
I bought a mic specifically for this game but i almost never use it. I play in my livingroom (controller on PC hooked up to my tv) and usually have my 2 year old running around screaming at the top of his lungs.
---
Plus, the couple times i did talk to someone my 13 yo daughter told me i was lame. 
---
First off, grats mate! 
---
As for silos, I don't know why but since game has launch people would talk about doing silos solo as if they were tuned for a party. I think this makes people think they are going to be this epic battle which they are clearly not. Anyone who can't easily clear a nuke silo solo would be a burden in a queen fight.
---

---
They make square processed cuts off ham thank you tastes like hell though
---
You can make a radio out of coconuts, but you can‚Äôt... wait, I‚Äôm thinking of Gilligan‚Äôs Island.
---
Pull out your weapon and no landing cooldown
---
I totally agree!  
---
I've been fairly lucky as a mostly Order of Mysteries person because there are things like the Unstoppables posters with the Mistress in them, fancy stuff like you find in Riverside Manor, etc. But some stuff to make secret rooms that open with the Veil would be cool!
---
Yes I do (I have plans and they are cheap for me to make). I wont be online right now as i live in a different timezone and am not at home but add me as a friend and will see if you are online next (will send you a PM).
---
Thebleedingred, I have another level 50 LMG with a legendary effect you can have for free if you want it (I dont remember the affect but its not two shot). 
---
What platform you on? I'd gladly help you finish that part if you need help with it.
---
I think gatling laser needs a buff for sure. Plasma buff would be nice but I think it'd be way better if they just left the damage alone and increased durability by (and I'm not joking, I think this is fair because it's THAT ass) 100%.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox but I‚Äôm not on just now 
---
I'm talking more PVE, when dungeons and more end game content comes out people will be breezing through it if they have these god like explosive weapons.
---
What if your bread was a small circle your baloney a largish square, that's an annoying sandwich to make
---
Using power creep to fix power creep is a horrid balancing. TSE is broken. There's nothing complicated about it. And it has nothing to do with pvp but the ability to roflstomp literally EVERY fucking thing in the game. 
---
1 TSE damage can easily override perks, chems, foods with normal weapons COMBINED... thrice. 
---
Yup. "Dat fat bounty" isnt so appealing either. 
---
When i bought this game I was sold PvP. You log on, workshops are unclaimed, no one uses the pvp radio, theres nowhere to go PvP. Now i am bored. 
---
I grind for 800 caps just so i can go lose them being a shitty raider. More than half the people i see wont even fight back. 
---
The PvP players need to be pointed in some direction.
---
Nerfing your game into oblivion has been proven to be worse idea. Look at launch destiny 2 is all I have to say to prove that.
---
Hmm I dunno, it's a tough one. I understand you've done some testing on the numbers and I can't offer any counterpoints in a similar context, but I'm still not convinced it never changes. 
---
Example, I built and capped my place with about a 4 tile 2 floor house at level 10, while my level 30 place is easily 3x larger and more detailed AND has a Brahmin pen (which soaks up a lot of budget...). So I'm not sure how that works. Another anomaly is that I actually tested and saw a building bar increase at \~one\~ point during leveling: When I was level 19 I had a capped base, went out and got level 20, came back and had about a half an inch free space on my building bar. Mind you, I've checked numerous times since then and never seen another increase, so it's possible that some bug was happening. 
---
I do plan on checking this out more though. I'm level 40 now and haven't rebuilt since 30, so I just need to blow everything up and then rebuild. I'll also try again at 50 and see what happens. One dude who posted in another thread claimed that he rebuilt at 50 to noticeable change, and then trashed it again at 100 and was able to go even bigger. 
---
Which is why it's ridiculously good. You'll never ever need Stimpaks ever again. 
---
"But what about reviving people?" 
---
Get Quack Surgeon (Revive people by using Alcohol). Done. 
---
"But what about healing mid-combat?" 
---
Stock up on Nuka-Colas, optionally get Cola Nut (Double the healing and affect to thirst meter, Tripled when ranked up) and 3* Thru-Hiker (Reduce food and drink weights by 90%)
---
If you need a good grinding spot for Nuka-Colas go to the TNT Dome 3 bunker (where the plans for the Nuka-Cola paint are). If you're lucky you can get up to 5 at once, otherwise there's usually about 2 or 3 lying around. Server-hop, rinse and repeat
---
Please let me know if it works. Then test with other grenades.
---
Is the level of the weapon based on your level when you start the quest, or when you finish it? 
---
That is their problem though. If they want to one shot everything then let them. If it is PVE then it will not affect you especially in a dungeon. You want to have a harder time then use a weaker weapon. Don't force someone else to play your playstyle. If someone wants to one tap everything and feel like a god then let them.
---
Haha, this is so cool. I haven't kept up with anything techno/EDM/EBM or industrial since the late 90s/early 00s, so this actually got me listening to other And One songs and I like them. My husband is German, so we heard that song while over there visiting family, and both loved it - it reminded us of stuff from our younger years we loved. I'm also of German ancestry, studied German for years, then studied and worked there. I know Germans play Fallout too, but feel it is a step to far to run around looking for other German speakers, ha. I'll add you in game, my account name is Marie!
---
Ohhh we are kindred spirits I feel lol
---
I wasnt even being critical, ive seen a lot of people suggest increases, but with no real supporting argument to go with it, and I wanted to share what Bethesda have to consider when it comes to increasing values (its not simply increase and go, but there are reasons for why values are set the way they are). And I even stated at the end, that the current values are conservative, hence you will likely see an increase at some point, so i am infact supportive of the idea, but wish people would think about it more before requesting blind numbers. 
---
So I dont really see why I was downvoted for my comment as I dont feel I said anything invalid or critical, just providing another view point.
---
ATF OPEN THE DOOR!

---
This is a common bug, sometimes melee hits just don't register. Hoping Bethesda fixes this in a future patch.
---
shit?
---
For steel you head to top of the world. You loot the can chimes an ski stuff around plus killing stuff usually super mutants there for their weapons to scrap. Relog an repeat. I get about 1000 steel for 15min of relogging an collecting.

Same, I'm currently grinding through a new account trying my best to avoid side quests. At the same time, I'm also traveling to vendors for level locked plans. I finally got the Handmade Gun Plan today üò≠üëå
---
No nerd rage? Low health and unarmed is like two pees and a pod 
---
Mine disappeared completely
---
 It's found at fort defiance in the area filled with ghouls. 
---
except the robots in the fallout universe can clearly have personalities and most games have several robots with personalities.
---
then your using pickle loaf!
---
I *believe* its when you finish it. God I really hope so, because my alt character would have been a complete waste of time otherwise.
---
You just made me wonder if they can be hacked with the perk.  Hacking is just charming the computer.
---
Global chat connects all of us using the mod and we use it to trade and chat all hours of the day. Incase thats more your thing not just a group thing.
---
I almost always have at least 3 workshops
---
All energy weapons are too weak. They badly need buffs. 
---
I tried to charm them with my .50 cal, but apparently Bethesda decided that would be too much freedom
---
One of the few I've actually stored JIC.
---
Hey dude thanks for the reply.  
---
3k is totally fair.  Im online rn.  
---
ign is samplexample
---
Sadly, this just happened to me with a 3* explosive shotgun. It pissed me off so much I called it a night. 
---
Almost as nice as Minecraft 
---
They missed a great opportunity to make robotic expert more desirable. Make Grahm charisma and robots intelligence. 
---
Any real testing as to whether a mod increases chance? Or is it anecdotal. One at a time feels like a better chance. But I can never get a straight answer on it.
---
PRAISE TALOS!
---
Oh I don't know maybe the part where it says in plain fucking English "Learn Plan" on the tooltip and I'm done with you now, just remembering you exist is lowering my IQ
---
Thanks! I hope they fix the bullets one too, it's pretty funny to line up a perfect shot and watch it ricochet off a rock in the corner of the screen. lol
---
Hahaha shit I‚Äôm probably on some watchlist now 
---
Truly heartwarming. Thank you for sharing what an impact the game has had on you and your son.
---
So you're telling me I should risk my junk just to see if this stupid thing works? 
---
*Deal*
---
I saw it on the windy road east of whitespring once. It actually has text on it saying an image file is missing or something
---
At the moment there is no decisions or consequences in this game so go nuts.
---
I am a firebreather responder, a raider with all keys, a enclave general, a head mistress of the the Order of Mystery, a citizen of the free states, a member of the brotherhood of steel and a high priest of the Cult of the Mothman (I made that last one up).
---
Goes really good on your resume when applying for jobs in the wasteland along with your soldiers certificate and DMV license :P
---
I was considering it, but I just couldn‚Äôt get it to fit with the theme of the build. I figure between sneak bonus, gunfoo, adrenaline and VATS crits I should be fine without it. I‚Äôll probably try to make an alt build taking advantage of nerd rage some other time.
---
Everyone calls me ma'am.
---
Please join me, ArcherJG, running some queens 
---
Quack Surgeon is a god send at times.. I like to revive people.. but I also like my precious stims.. 
---
It's southeast of the Emmett Mountain Disposal Site, which is East of Whitespring Resort in Savage Divide. Hold on and I'll get a screenshot.
---
&gt; and don‚Äôt hate on the people that do enjoy it.
---
Except those people that 'enjoy' it are the people paying good money to a contractor who can't even attach a cabinet, so they then go on and provide the same shit service again and again since they keep getting paid for it.
---
Cool, I will see you around!!
---
Its 2019, the robots dont want to assume.
---
Ok cool, my camp is near there anyway. 
---
I'm already 75% through it, and only didn't finish because it was late and I was tired. Might have to delay it now and see how it goes. 
---
Absolutely brilliant  
---
**BUT YOU DIDN'T TAKE A PHOTO**
---
I did not down vote you, I engaged in a point rebuttal. I do not support down voting. People should be free to have opinions, and speak their mind. Despite our view points and means of expressing them may differ. We should be allotted the ability to express it. I Do thank you for your insight, despite how I took it as a critique of the idea. 
---
To address your specific point, I do understand there is a difference between a storage size and a camp size/ area increase. As well as I acknowledge that it could cause adverse effects to balance and game stability and mechanics, but I still request it be something they look into. If it lacks feasibility so be it, but it never hurts to look, explore, experiment and discuss.
---
All I do is wait for the kills, get the loot, keep what I need for sniper stuff, put the rest in a dropped bag so everyone benefits. My turrets kill, I collect, everyone wins... cause I drop a lot of stuff...
---
Odd normally it saves your spot in a crash and while on a team, so long as it lets you join as team.  Thanks for reminding me though I need to go farm 7 more nuke cards for tomorrow. 
---
Be warned if you do farm this location, gear here caps at Lv 35 and Lv 40.
---
I would love this. Also armour that has car license plates. It's on a lot of the advertisement material for pretty much every fallout game, but never actually makes it in. 
---
Big reason I stripped my full mutation build to be more selective. Plaguewalker is a lonely life. I'm a fan of pacifying a group of bunnies or frogs. I cant handle surprise deaths, and I cant seem to stay disease free.
---
I swear stocking antibiotics is the true end game. I feel like all of us are constantly shitting to death and we aren't talking about it.
---
Daisy cutter is one of the better rewards. The watoga saboteur quest that rewards All Rise is likely the best, perfect storm is good too, but not the most impressive of legendary weapons because 10mm isn‚Äôt quite as easy to come by as .45. Most of the named items are just one star legendaries. 
---
Max out tenderizer under charisma and you need action boy if your running a vats build IMO
---
Psh, and y'all wonder why the game is laggy. 
---
Totally kidding - this was super cool! Thanks for recording it. :)
---
Plans
---
What does that have to do with your sad/creepy comment?
---
Im hoping people drop some quests to avoid in this thread. Otherwise you're really on past experience, youtube, or looking though this list to manually find legendary weapons and the quest they're tied to.
---
http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout_76_weapons
---
Why downvote hmmm?...
---
What could possibly be wrong with letting people know that we have our clan mod now....
---
To piss my wife off I say crazy shit to/around Alexa; she swears I'm on some list by now.
---
Yes level not high enough, but good spot for xp
---
We need to talk about this sandwich obsession
---
Even with the ravenous duping I'm not sure if you will be able to get one for 4000
---
First off all code pieces must be different and there are more steps between getting the pieces and launching a nuke because u actually have to figure out the code which is a lengthy process ive heard. Your best and quickest bet is to just look up this weeks codes when you get there.
---
Make a option to belt feed it and use a bipod, then we would be talking
---
Lol, 13-18 year olds think everything‚Äôs lame. The main thing that stops me from using the microphone is I don‚Äôt want to pause the tv show I‚Äôm watching and I know it‚Äôd be annoying. 
---
Just to add this... Unarmed melee one shotting Scorchbeasts https://youtu.be/X2K371IeSrA
---
It does, SBQ is harder to kill with all the server lag
---
Thank you for the comprehensive breakdown. I see how you were boosting your stats with perks - it makes more sense of what I should be doing.
---
Cheers mate! 
---
Ahh, that makes sense. All weapons I found were 35. Funny enough, I was idly sitting near the bridge and caught the speed demon mutation. First actually useful mutation I‚Äôve had
---
Do you know where to find the candles by any chance? Ive got the fire barrel and oil lamppost but not the hand oil lamp 
---
Idk why bt I only take pics of game flaws. Missing sections like this, floating rocks, floating doghouse with elephant picture in it, stupid shit 
---
For anyone that wants to play: I have a problem with social anxiety, I never want to bother anyone, probably the reason I don‚Äôt have anyone to play with lol. If you you see me on, send me a party request! 
---
You could say he knows his shit.
---
Oh shit, that little the only mission I've even bothered to start in days, and I'm only lvl 16ish. Yet another sign that I should just focus on the main story and level up some more.
---
Yup. Hopefully future updates allow for level 50+ weapons and armor drops. 
---
I've had the same camp items stored an built with them from lvl 45-200. I've NEVER been able to add anything else. Budget does NOT increase as you level.
---
Are lvl50 weapons the highest in the game?
---
There should be a report option or a way to flag users for exploits
---
I got it as a reward for One Silent Night at Sons of  Dane compound at level 189. Anythings possible of Bethesda doesn't hate you üò≠üò© 
---
If you're under lvl 30, you can get rid of 400 rads with nuka grape which is sold at whitesprings for 35 caps.
---
Inside, one of the boutique shops. 
---
I was having trouble fitting in action boy so I went with grim reaper‚Äôs sprint instead, should I try to make the room for it? And for tenderizer, is 2% more damage for 5 more seconds worth the 2 extra points needed to max out the card?
---
Word
---
The oil lamp and candles is in the antique lights plan for around 250 caps. It‚Äôs located at the whitespring to the right of the store with all the workbenches in it. 
---
A really annoying part of the game, yes.
---
It bothers the hell outta me haha
---
The issue is, the stuff you drop is the stuff everyone will probably drop. People who are farming are there for a chance to get the stuff that has less than 1% chance of dropping and that's the stuff that nobody will drop. People who are there for XP don't get that either because your turrets have killed everything.
---
Flux farming is easy, you look for a guy that's walking really really slowly, kill him.. take his bag and log out.
---
Scottish Holiday?
---
Lived in Scotland all my life, never had a holiday on that day or heard it spoken about as such... and fuck kilts.
---
I.e. Stop spamming clicking everything just to get the interface away. The earth will still exist even after you lose 1 second waiting for UI. 
---
Yeah, seriously.
---
Sadly you cant u.u
---
This. We keep Propaganda Flyers from the commie bots for this. 
---
Drop the flyer, make sure the bag is there, then click on the bag and transfer into it (not dropping any items after the flyer, because if you drop additional items after exiting the pip boy, the bag moves)
---
Also you don't need screws to build armour but when it needs repairing suddenly it needs like a 100 screws to fix it
---
I don't believe it. DC Universe online only shows character names above the head IIRC, though you can view a person's profile from that name to see their PSN.
---
it'd probably be easier to reverse Beth's servers when private ones become available and fix 76.
---
Shit, the number one annoyance throughout every Fallout game from 1 forward is that you can't pickup the armor the enemy is wearing. Back in one you have to kill a bunch of enemies with metal armor at a low level and you can't loot it off them.
---
You made a new account for that, huh? 
---
Yes. 
---
for fucks sake explosive shotguns should not be the litmus by which you measure the strength of weapons in this game
---
Wait, what? 
---
I'm prone to migraines once in a while but I never really had any sorta trigger that was related to colors. Could you explain?
---
I‚Äôve been down in a silo before but was disconnected and said eff it. My question was if he has say 4 codes and I have 4. Yes each different. Can we do it together or does one person need all 8 
---
I fought her for the first time last night. All my rifles were busted by the end and I was meleeing her with my 3 star switchlade with 40% faster swing speed 
---
More than enough üò≠üôèüèº
---
Even worse is when they use pump shotguns and the gun is in two floating pieces
---
nope first post tho
---
Hey look guys, he said that funny phrase again! 
---
I'd assume it's going to be the lightest pistol you can get (10mm or .38 pipe), with the fastest, lightest receiver, short/stub barrel, reflex sight, and hopefully the faster critical build and/or reduced vats cost legendaries.
---
Use it with speed demon and you're really in for a treat
---
Oh. So *that's* how I lost my T51 bright head lamp mod...
---
That's a good point here's hoping some modder gets an idea when that comes out :D
---
nah. figure it out through experimentation
---
Happened to me. Wasnt sure how but I was digging in my inventory the other day an was like why do I have an extra frame? Threw it down an it was a 2nd ultracite. Sold it..
---
I don't think I've put 7600 hours into all of the fallouts collectively, and I've played them A LOT. What a ridiculous achievement. 
---
The claim is that you have to scrap all of your items to notice a difference. The idea is that as you level up your character the budget cost of items decreases (rather than your budget increasing), which means storing and putting down the same, already-purchased items changes nothing.
---
If you end up deleting all of your stuff and rebuilding, and you see no difference, feel free to let me know-- I'm going to do the same with my place this week. I just needed to farm enough resources for the rebuild.
---
Pc
---
Just head on over and start shooting and getting in the way of their plans. They'll leave if bet. 
---
Looks really good mate. Shame to move it. Thanks for sharing
---
Do you want a server crash? Because that's how you get a server crash. Lol nice though!
---
Then tell Bethesda to make it difficult for players to put a base so close to a farm spot, I only got the idea when I saw someone else do it. Anyways I have since moved it, Got bored with it in that spot. Got what I needed and moved on.
---
Im not 100% sure but I didnt have all 8 when I went down. I would assume if your actually going to try and solve the code than all 8 would have to be in one persons inventory.
---
Someone care to take a pic or several? Perhaps a minimap/guide of sorts?
---
The Fusion Core machines are a joke, but sometimes if i need Acid or Uranium or something I'll keep a power plant open for a couple of hours. Feels like a public service. Tho I'm not sure how many people know about / take advantage of the juiced-up power boxes at the surrounding workshops.
---
That's a totally fair assessment, I can't force you to believe anything. 
---
I honestly thought it increased with leveling before people asked me to prove it myself. I initially found an article online that had no evidence, and that's what people wanted. So I ended up doing this test initially just to find out whether it did change or not and documenting it for proof. From what my results show, nothing changed, and since I was the one doing the test I can't really argue with it because I know it's valid.
---
The mini-town build was at level 135. I mean I could re-do my test again just to add another data point to see if anything magically changes after 35 levels, but if there is no difference between 21 and 100, I don't see there being one between 100-135, especially considering it feels like Bethesda wasn't expecting people to be in the multiple hundreds yet, just assuming that since they have been implementing multiple xp nerfs even though nobody wants/asked for them. 
---
Pretty ironic lol
---
They said in the noclip documentary that it was pretty difficult to make the game MP, since the world was previously tied to the 1 character (which they dubbed Atlas, from Greek mythology).
---
Guess it doesn‚Äôt factor in the 7600 hours of play time xD
---
I run a unarmed build as well. I can't tell you how many times I hit something with a power attack taking out 90% of it's health and just move on to the next guy hearing the kill behind me a second later. So I think it's worth it. I feel like gun Fu is more for a gun build. There's no reason you can't just get the cards as you level and swap out to see what works best for you. 
---
Its already in Fallout 4, I don't see why they cant port it. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Yeah, that's a good idea. Stick with that. 
---
I tried evetything on lowest, but stutter is still there.
---
T clarify, unequip starvhed genes before farming. Equip to shower and unequip to farm again.
---
VATS teleporting?
---
It's mostly how BRIGHT it is. Very bright lights often trigger migraines for me. The green there is so freaking reflective, it burns through my eyes and into my brain. The first time I found that area, I already had a migraine brewing. The brightness was like firing nails into my eye sockets, and that brewing migraine came on like a freight train.
---
Other migraine triggers for me include weather changes, stress, menstruation, constant extreme noise, wrong sleeping positions (sometimes I don't realize I slept wrong until after I woke up), and any sort of blunt force trauma to the head (even something as simple as accidentally bumping my head on something). Also if a butterfly farted in Africa. LOL Seriously, sometimes it seems like these things come out of nowhere.
---
But yeah. That much brightness is horrible for me. Doesn't help that I'm playing on a 55" television. ;)
---
While I don't agree with your condescending attitude maybe I worded that poorly thank you for the constructive criticism 
---
My copy of RD2 is still mostly unplayed. However, I have been noticing my annoyance level starting to rise with the server issues (xbox). I used to shrug it off, but now, my shoulders hurt. We'll see in the upcoming patch if it gets better. If not, may have to see how the "westerners" are faring. 
---
Sir, I have a *cunning plan* 
---
If I launched the nuke, Orbital Strike every base I see stealing my kills. If you launch it, I'll stand out back and get shots on legendaries and farm that way.  
---
Nice tip. I find explosive weapons weak after watching this though. https://youtu.be/X2K371IeSrA
---
I am re rolling tired of killing myself on my explosive shotgun. Lol. 
---
I think no sane person would get that. 
---
I mean fo76bazaar
---
I don‚Äôt know about the whole Black Knight machine gun, but I‚Äôve come across several ‚Äúlight machine guns‚Äù that take 308.  They don‚Äôt do much DPS for a round of that caliber, so I stick with my sniper rifle.
---
Thanks a bunch dude!
---
So wholesome üíú
---
It would be great to have some kind of map indicator showing what workshops are currently affected by a running power plant buff. It's not clear which workshops are in range of a given plant. The map is where players plan activities from, the place is huge; it's not reasonable to expect anyone to hoof it or pay for fast travel to random workshops just to see if the power box is juiced. It makes having the plant running incidental.
---
Having a more obvious and visual tie to the plant's status on the map would provide incentive to go complete the Powering Up events. I feel like very few of them attract any players, and I'm guessing that once folks get the Fusion Generator they stop. If they even know about the Fusion Gen.
---
Power Plants are the largest "affects the rest of the players on this server" effect outside the nukes themselves. They might even be the only thing. Giving them more visibility would probably increase player engagement with them, with each other, and with the workshops in general.
---
Of course we have to stop disconnecting every half hour first :P
---
You're showing your age. A lot of these kids here...well, never mind. 
---
Oh, Farah too for that matter. 
---
Given enough time, some one will get it eventually, it translates roughly into 316~ days of continuous play.
---
Okay so grab a furious weapon go to said dupers and wreck their day, if lucky take their shit. But just so you know the consortiums do not stack 3 people they have a lone guy at a weapons bench near a world stash then if you look around you will just see some guy within 30-45 second run of the place. That is the mule so the duper drops the mule goes and grabs shit and calls it good.  (sorry for spilling the beans to the dupers but man it is obvious and I killed one of your mules and took the world stash at that train yard THANKS!!!)   
---
Of interesting note, this method does not seem to put strain on the server compared to the teeny bop youtubers that huddle and fuck the server up since they honestly don't care nor have the decorum to cheat politely.   
---
I am not saying dupers are good, but if you are going to do it at least be kind to others and not fuck up their day.   
---
As for a fix I was hoping but man they fucked it up big time , they hotfixed on the 2nd and they seemed like they tried to patch the dupe but it was more like they licked the wound and it is still bleeding. I am sure they will fix it, and I am sure other dupes will still be around but if it doesn't hit youtube things should be good.   
---
As for the economy, technically dupers are healthy as it moves the game around people are still out farming like mad some are after pieces that dupers do not have, just know if someone is willing to give you every god weapon 25k in caps super rare plans and the like all for 1 weapon that person is a duper or part of a duping group.    
---
(also make sure to get everything up front as some dupers are less then trustworthy if you see a quad expo +1 perception handmade on xbox odds are it is duped)  
---
TL;DR it is the fucking asshole kids on the weekend fucking it all up.   
---
Obvious duper?
---
Had the same issue, only way I fixed it was moving camp again then relog.
---
Same! I‚Äôve had this technical data at the base of my stairs for a while now. I figured out I can still hit it to move it, which is strange.
---
Oh, I guess I didn't see that interview I'll look it up thanks, man!
---
This was unexpected...
---
I thought people would be over the moon like myself...
---
Take strange in numbers off. 
---
Easy end game content is going to turn certain players off the game, this content is usually meant to be difficult in a way that challenges gamers. I'm certainly not trying to shoe horn other players into playing my play style I'm simply saying that these weapons are broken, and players who use them are leagues above people who don't. With their ability to one shot bloated glowing ones in nuke zones (denying others xp), a gripe that many players on this sub have. These weapons have also made fights like the scorch beast queen trivial at best, which when people get bored they turn to griefing other players. 
---
Yes, dense is a good PVP option however that requires you to know the modification for all your pieces of armour. If you have a mismatch of legendary armour this can become a complicated process of finding plans or scrapping armour to just get this modification. 
---
Players who are new to the game are also at a disadvantage getting rolled by griefers with explosive weapons destroying their base and stealing their loot. Yes I am also aware that this is part of the game, however this doesn't give them a chance to defend themselves very well when there's no opportunity for counter play or defense (Refer to the numerous complaints about it on this sub). 
---
Make a post on r/fo76bazaar
---
You will find one muuuch less than 4k caps... But yes, post in the fo76bazaar and you will have one in 5 minutes. 
---
Just like the old Transformers cartoon.
---
Yeah confused me too. But if I hit an enemy to low enough health and back away it will die without me hitting it again. Not sure if that is intended or not.
---
Awesome, thanks so much for your feedback. I'll probably move those Perception points to luck and get the chance to repair weapon/armor. I think I'll have to test out Rejuv a bit and see if it's something I want to swap out. I just figured the extra AP regen would be really beneficial, however, I do like the idea of radicool/solar powered. Do you think the idea of a dog food based healing build is worthwhile to pursue, or should I just stick with stims? If I were to add white knight, what would you suggest removing?  Marathoner?
---
This has happened several times. Sometimes it works (I've completed it once on one character), sometimes you just find a broken generator that displays the E) REPAIR mouseover but does nothing and is not interactive. 
---
I can't figure out anything consistent on when it works vs. when it's toast.
---
I am not really sure that would accomplish what you think it will. When not running around with legendary weapons it already takes quite a while to kill stuff. Especially for all the casual playing people that do not minmax their build. So it is even more tedious if you are not already on high end equip (and remember - high level players spawn a lot of mobs on the way, making it then impossible for low level players in areas like "top of the mountain").  
---
You also mean that shooting things should heal them and then i need to use another weapon? If the other breaks mid fight i then just run? Yeah - Sounds like a good idea. /s I can get behind enemies that are "immune" to explosive damage, but shooting stuff should result in them dying eventually. Or you need to revamp the whole system and introduce a proper "elemental" system.  
---
Here is a thought: Fix the duping and ban the people that were doing it. Make the difference of Legendary Mods (TS and E in particular) to regular weapons smaller, or make them obtainable by other means than pure luck (i.e. each event gives you an event voucher and you can get a legendary mod for 250 or so). I don't see a reason why someone dedicating 100s of hours should not be able to aquire a specific weapon (though that may be the case with vaults soon). Then give enemies a smidge more HP but more importantly: Make them actually fun to play against. Have them keep a little more distance, let them jump behind stuff, do more than straight running towards you, have them intentionally flank you, vary their attack patterns, etc. 
---
Not sure since I don‚Äôt own marine fully modded. Just add all the pieces defense and see if they are greater then 265 def res 175 eng res. Total weight is 17. No hidden benefits 
---
How much for the two shot pump shotgun?
---
Maybe try limiting the cores on your CPU. Could be the problem, not sure though because I only use a quad core.
---
Hey what are you talking about just look at Karen and plankton how do you think they are together
---
Does it destroy the jetpack mod?? I thought it just didn't paint it
---
Did you find one? I kept going from the BOS crash site in Watoga to all the combat outposts in the Bog and eventually found the elusive piece I needed.
---
I haven‚Äôt used my 60 in a while‚Äîif you‚Äôre struggling to find the piece you can have mine.
---
*Holds a jimmy johns and a subway sandwich*
---
Never!
---
This is A-NUMBER-1 of Fallout 76 etiquette!
---
Share the love, dudes. You literally lose nothing by lettering everyone get a chance to loot. I've gotten items out of this when they decide to drop whatever they looted, so even though that's a small chance and completely up to the other player it ONLY TO YOUR ADVANTAGE to let more people get in on the legendary kill.
---
PSA AND WARNING: MODS GET SCRAPPED FOR STEEL. DO NOT STORE LONG-TERM, USE IMMEDIATELY
---
Yes, they get scrapped \*before\* "bulk" steel items. They also get scrapped before many Junk items.
---
Keep scrapped, loose Steel scrap in your stash at all times.
---
No luck :( been doing it almost all day 
---
I have found an explosive 10mm when I was around lvl 20, and then at lvl 40 I had an explosive shot gun fall off a legendary during an event.  No duping or ebay buying, just good luck I guess. 
---
Youd have to ask them, everyone has their reasons
---
It hides players from you when you are wanted
---
You need to clear your bounty. Can't see players with a bounty. Just stack your junk and go to a popular area
---
What do I do?
---
Dont even get me started on the ignition cores
---
This is excellent. Thanks!
---
One that you seem to be missing is "Plan: Water Filter" (which, despite its name, has the recipe icon).
---
Find someone to kill you, so it goes away
---
K thanks
---
Yessir
---
Yea not too sure what bethesda was thinking when they decided to mix PvP and Legendaries together. There's just no real way to balance legendaries in a PvP environment. Legendaries are perfectly fine in a PvE scenario but as soon as you have to go up against someone that has a TSE weapon, the balance gets thrown completely out of whack. IMO Legendary weapons should NOT be allowed in PvP and only regular weapon with no special abilities. With the removal of ridiculously overpowered weapons, the PvP might actually be slightly interesting, instead of this boring 1-hit meta bullshit. 
---
I'm not completely familiar with all the mods available, but Brotherhood of Steel modded combat armor is quite good. You can find pieces on a particular dead NPC or learn the BoS mod by scrapping combat armor.
---
As long as you are wanted, you won't see them. You'll just server hop when someone gets close. Gives them a sporting chance.
---
I actually just recently learned painting armor prevents you from trading/selling those armor pieces. 
---
No. It considers the existing paint a "mod" in the warning message. It's very poor design, but you are safe to repaint without killing the real mods on your PA.
---
Just because we're horribly mutated from the radiation and irreparably mental from all the cannibalism and murder doesn't mean we can't act civilized.

Well you've definitely made me more skeptical haha. I don't doubt the accuracy of what you saw, I just wonder if there are confounding variables (or even bugs) involved.
---
What I plan to do is delete every item in my CAMP, right from the world (so no stored space involved at any step). I was also thinking of rebuilding solely through direct placement, so not using any blueprints, as my place is pretty easy to recall item to item. I figure that would be the most thorough way I can test, as I don't fully trust the post-launch implemented budget % we see on the UI lol.
---
If after I do all that I'm unable to build any more than my camp currently has... I'll be 95% convinced you're right and that camp size never changes. Though even then I'll be baffled by what seems to be obvious variation among capped builds. xD
---
Wait to get blasted I guess. 
---
Man when TF are they gonna add a chat feature?
---
I can't even get my mic to work anymore, so I can't communicate at all beyond the dumbass emotes.
---
PvP mechanics in this game are garbage. TSE guns that can one shot a player in full level 50 PA kind of precludes any possibility of a balanced and enjoyable PvP environment.
---
Have I defended workshops? Sure. Usually I don‚Äôt though. The stuff I get from one isn‚Äôt going to be anything I can‚Äôt more effectively get by other means; not even Grafton. I typically make it difficult to impossible to initiate a steal without having bounty as a deterrent, and sometimes use that bounty as means to initiate PvP before they step into the circle IF I choose to defend. 
---
I‚Äôve found many times that people attacking workshops don‚Äôt even want the workshop they just want to bait you into giving up your caps.
---
Taking and defending workshops is typically not worth the resources involved as the workshop isn‚Äôt going to produce an equivalent amount of resources quicker than you could to get them elsewhere. Anything a workshop can produce can be farmed more quickly somewhere else. 
---
What if I told you...  
---
*Morpheus meme*  
---
People are selling these guns and sometimes literally throwing them on the ground.
---
I don't know what scorch beat queen you are fighting but whenever i fight her even with multiple tse guns she still takes close to the full 30 minutes to beat. End game content is meant to be challenging yes but not impossible. This is also fallout not any other game. This game has always made the player overpowered by the end game. Power armor is literally a walking tank suit. They have a gun that shoots nukes. This isn't any other game this game you are meant to be overpowered by the end. Even with the TSE effect in play you can't one shot players who don't slap you back. Play smart if your enemy is higher level than you and has a better gun than you don't fire back and allow full damage. Slap damage with a Two shot explosive is still weak and barely hurts you all. Even accounting for that out of the over 100 hours i have played this game i have been attacked once. This games pvp isn't worth nerfing the fun out of the pve in any way shape or form because it is practically nonexistent and bethesdas philosphy of add more hp to make a boss stronger makes  it so that even going up against the scorch beast queen with a two shot explosive still takes a really long time and doesn't invalidate the end game content at all. Especially when you consider that this game endgame content is a joke because the end game bosses don't do more damage and don't have better attacks. All the endgame bosses have going for them is that they have more hp.
---
I know one if the travelling bots you can force to spawn in by going to the edge if two areas forcing the other to reload which forces the bot to spawn. Hoping someone figures out how to do that with grahm 
---
My husband just bought me fo76 and tonight was my first night playing. I haven‚Äôt really had too many encounters with other players but some higher level players went by and just let me be. Was worried I would be attacked but haven‚Äôt run into that yet. 
---
It lasts for 3 hours then goes away
---
She's all grown up!! \*sniffles and wipes a proud tear\*
---
Joking aside, I'm glad you've had a positive experience, and I'm glad I could be a part of that. Cheers to more late nights and stealth kitten painting placements in friendly camps!
---
Okay? So it is a lvl 1 they drop a lot off the lvl 4 doe in whitesprings when it is legendary. Same with 3 star level 1 wood pieces.  Shit is common and garbage.  
---
15 Hacking...you can sometimes be able to reset your tries or at least remove some dud words. Look for an open bracket then a closed bracket. At the open side, click on it. You should see results. So look for something like this (stuff here) or {stuff here} or &lt;stuff here&gt;. I played other fallouts and just now learned of this. 
---
Or an option to not log me in to any server where my camp cannot be placed. 
---
Fuckin hell, that‚Äôs brilliant.
---
All hail Atom, bask in his mighty glow!
---
Its one of the very first missions the game throws at you so it's a very easy mistake to make. You should be fine with all other quests though because there aren't that many quest items.
---
All Rise is another really good quest reward but it's a really late mission for the BoS and people are usually over 50 when they get it. 
---
Explosives Weps (or even just vats crit weapons) would have killed that SB way before him, since it was flying around taking no dmg for a while.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs just bleed damage and not tenderizer. Tenderizer might be boost it a bit but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not the cause. Your weapon might cause it or if you have the talons mutation then that would be it.
---
I put my friends onto it after playing solo since beta. They wouldn‚Äôt even try with free beta keys because the internet hate-hype was so crazy. But one friend finally gave it a try on-sale. He loved it too. Then another friend and another. There are six of us playing nearly every day now. 
---
I never found the bugs to be game ruining but I get the annoyance. It has some mid-sized glitch/bug problems and a bunch of user-friendly mistakes. Patches are improving things. 
---
I tell people that the game has no training wheels. If you don‚Äôt know Fallout you might struggle at low levels. If you *love* Fallout you might struggle with the NPC and story differences. Combine confusion with some frustration and people will storm off I think. 
---
But give this game a chance and some patience for ongoing growing pains and you will be rewarded with patches and improvements on what is already a great game. 
---
Ouch, how do people keep accidentally dropping items instead of inspecting them?
---
Nowhere is friendly if you‚Äôre THE man
---
Morgantown is a good alternative for ghouls but after 3 nukes and seeing no 2\* or 3\* legendaries i stopped trying unless i was more interested in flux farming. The town has the full spread of flux colors where Whitesprings is missing violet. Also the packs are more spread out with only the Responder tent camp near the university, and the Red Rocket having a large-ish spawn. 
---
Pressed R instead of X ;(
---
I was gonna hold on to mine and give it away but ended up selling it to a Vendor, so hopefully someone else got it in the end
---
:O
---
Man now I have to test this and see if I'm wasting my perk points lol. Seems like it would be good for team play if it stacks shared with each member of your team. 
---
Damnn 
---
You get free materials from the workshop, which also has a budget. 
---
That's a solid idea dude!
---
You seem fun.
---
I can confirm this a true. It‚Äôs just warning you that it will destroy the mod in that slot, so if you have another paint on it will destroy it. 
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure there is. I think I had some before I went to Marine. It has ultra light. I use deep pocket though as it gives more carryweight.
---
Explosive Handmade, explosive assault rifle, explosive pipe rifle,  explosive gatling gun, etc. are all better than energy weapons.
---
Or if we could see how much damage we are dealing? Maybe build it in to the Awarness perk?
---
This is my first fallout and the vagueness is insane
---
I launch the nuke and I see that shit. I go launch launch a second and break the farm.  If it is my nuke and you are playing the race game you will lose as I do not loot nor care I will literally one shot everything and for good measure chuck nuka grenades which kills everything in a bubble and just run the whole circle.  
---
Not my nuke I sit back unequip damage perks and whip out a normie 50 cal to ping everything so i can get some loot and exp.   
---
To break the golf house from spawning make sure to miss half that little road on the map and boom no more spawns.   
---
\~ Have fun and good luck
---
Yeah totally dude
---
HAHA AS A HUMAN I HAD A GOOD LAUGH IN MY &lt;food-processing-unit&gt; ABOUT THIS. OF COURSE YOU CAN charm.EXE A ROBOT FOOLISH MEAT
---
Well, I have sympathy for you, if you did indeed work and earn/find all that you lost. 
---
If your a duper, well we will just leave that understood yet unsaid. 
---
I don‚Äôt really see the point of you keeping all those, or even how you would manage to store them but to each their own of course. 
---
Omg a system that shows you quick stats, like how many workshops are owned, how many bounties are currently on, and if there's a nuke zone active (open mouth drool)..
---
I play as a raider and love PvP so this type of feature would up my PvP time by bucket loads. Like PvP yourself and play on Xbox one? Check my bio and shoot me a message to get down. 
---
No resource extractor though?
---
Your future is a nuclear explosion on the Poseidon oil rig triggered by my great-great-great grandfather, an illiterate desert savage with a pronounced sagittal crest.
---
One hundred percent amazing for team play, that and strange in numbers are the cards I always share when doing the SBQ event with a team but yeah let me know what you find out with your test.
---
I doubt it would've let you take it though. If you run to junk quickly that you've recently looted, it will come up with the prompt to take it, but it won't do anything. Same with can chimes..you get the disarmed prompt, but it doesn't work and they disappear a few seconds later
---
Dude, it‚Äôs a valentine quote
---
The title didn't live up to the hype. 
---
I've got an anti-armor explosive pipe gun
---
Future reference for hitting a robot at the White Spring Resort, you can simply head inside the resort where the shops are located. The hostility ends and you'll be free to fast travel to camp/friends. 
---
Get out of my swamp 
---
Just check harpers until you find calibrated shocks that give black titanium when scrapped. Those are the ones.
---
This should help some.

[List of Plans](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aa3n8x/we_are_creating_a_where_do_i_get_that_list_of_all/)
---
This literally breaks the game and you posted how to do it in detail. Next time please don‚Äôt post the details. Now more and more people will exploit this 
---
Was at harpers at 25 in the beta and with my second character when I got the game its not a high lvl zone really.
---
I think you're thinking about it from a single player fallout perspective, yes I agree at the end of those games you were a god of the wasteland and could do whatever you wanted with these insane weapons. 
---
The fact still stands that this isn't a single player game, it's online multiplayer with 24 other players in your game. Yes it'd be fun to be a god of the wasteland however the developers need to account what is going to be fun and fair for everyone playing.
---
One known bug is apparently if you register the excavator power armor (finishing the quest) without having gone to the terminal to learn the plans by that point, you could end up not being able to learn the plans.  One way this could happen is if you got the original excavator pieces as a gift.
---
Encountered Graham along the road in Flatwoods. I walked along with him for awhile... he was listing types of meat...
---
I don't think the handmade plan is buyable at 27 if that's why you're there
---
Sadly the only way to make pistols viable, rofl.
---
I play as a raider and love PvP so being able to steel a PA would be the ultimate heist. 
---
Trying to pull these off would up my PvP time by bucket loads. Like PvP yourself and play on Xbox one? Check my bio and shoot me a message to challenge me. 
---
Worst feeling in 76 :(
---
Got it today. Made leveling up from 67-69 really scary as I had never picked up Starched Genes yet. I ran around with 50-75% Rads for far too long. 
---
165, but I don't think that would matter if let's say he had an explosive shotgun and I didn't. He would kill me as easy as I killed him. 
---
i earned myself 2se weapon. but this is cryolator, sadly.
---
I don't really care about most resources. I've got a water purifier but that's it. 
---
I'm not even sure how they work, honestly, either. The only one I've got available at that camp is fertilizer.
---
That sounds like a fantastic bit of youtube gold man. 
---
I dont even think u can hurt eachother if you're on a team. But Ok cool cuz me n my friend have been lately doing  bareknuckle brawls on random roads in our underwear and we've been killing eachother hopin to eventually get the trophy. 
---
I see what he's saying. You can built that tall all around the camp location. So it's more that the build area is shaped like a tin can. :)
---
Asking the important questions.
---
 Plus never do this on my first character and haven‚Äôt started the free states stuff on my second yet
---
Also hoping randoms come across the brawls. Bets are welcome
---
Log in and log out.
---
If they doesn‚Äôt fix it maybe try unequipping then requipping class freak?
---
I was wondering why I was so heavy until I noticed 50 missles
---
Congrats on pressing W.
---
It's absolutely bonkers that I can build a fusion generator,  exact copies of fire axes and firearms,  create functioning parts to power armor, yet I can't make a bow.  I can't build a forge to make screws or master sword smithing.  I don't know why it bugs me so much.
---
That is the reason. Didn‚Äôt find the gun, but holy shit this guy has a lot of plans
---
I see your level 27 trip and raise you my level 12 trip
---
(No joke I seriously went there as a level 12 in hopes of getting the handmade plans. It didn't work. And for bonus points I did the secret quest for the Nuka-Cola paint when I was just level 9. I died 0 times while making the journey across the map, 3 times while in Cranberry bog and another 1 time while in the Cola Plant)
---
For the points it costs, definitely. The first point in each of the gun perks provides +10%, while the additional two points only provide 5% each. Those first three points are worth as much as the next 6. Bloody mess gives +15% on all damage for 3 points. Demolition expert boosts explosive damage 100% which is not insignificant on TSE weapons. 
---
How is this not flagged as spam yet? 
---
Do we even have mods?
---
Yes i am thinking of it in a single player perspective because that is what fallout is. A single player video game franchise. After the failure that is fallout 76 is long dead and offline fallout will still be a single player game. This is an experiment by Bethesda game studios. The people who play this game are fallout fans and the casuals that an online fallout attracted. 
---
It‚Äôs a easy fix IMO. Reduce demolition expert to 50% extra damage, replace either 2 shot or explosive with a random effect on pre existing TSE weapons, and change explosive to a major (?) legendary effect.
---
I don‚Äôt know if number 2 is possible though. Do any of you computer savvy know if it‚Äôs possible?
---
HAIL SABAN! 
---
Hmmm...how does item for item work?  Do you request their item and then they set the offer price to be your item, at which point you can "buy" it?
---
I've read that if you lose your dropped items, you can move a little bit and drop something else and your bag should appear with everything in it.  It sounds like the safest way is to drop a trivial item first and make sure your bag appears, them dropping more items will add to it. 
---
I think it's a little easier to trust people from the Marketplace Reddit where you can see that they have traded before and sorta want to keep their reputatio clean.  Still, I put my only valuable item, a TSE Handmade, in my stash before doing any trading.
---
Shhhhh! You're giving a way all of our Mysteries!
---
So an OP legendary effect that is only common because of farming and duplication? That doesn't make your point any better.  
---
Nerf the explosive legendary effect.
---
Good Call, thank you.
---
Unpopular opinion? Have you just never been here?
---
and there in lies the problem, with the game and with the world today, complacency.
---
For me it was Annie Lennox
---
   Whitesprings spawns higher level fauna and irradiated flora for nearly an hour after the red radiation ring disssapates. 
---
   You can get a mutation(disease?) Called toxic cloud that kills things around you.
---
I want to thank you so much for this information. I feel like someone told me about it back in the BETA but I forgot about it until you said something. That is so damn helpful for nuke runs when you're out of water and full of rad worms!!! Very very helpful 
---
That‚Äôs what it looks like in game?! 
---
Fuck yes. So glad I bought it. First thing I‚Äôve spent atoms on.
---
There was a video on the sub a few days ago. You place the first one then have to build (stack) 2 metal beams on top of it, then remove the bottom beam leaving the second floating in air. Snap the second set of stairs to the floating beam.
---
Repeat as high as you want. If you look at the pic, you'll see the beam at the top of the steps. 
---
I was pvping with a random player and eventually they switched server and I did the thing any annoying person would do. I followed them. I knew where there base was from the last server and I showed up. He was on the map but I couldnt see him in game. And I could see a set of power armor in his workbench so I went up to it and it had the option to take it. So i took it but I couldnt take its left leg so I took it all but that and i recieved a party chat invite (xbox) and he was watching me walk up and take it and asked if i could give it back.
---
It turns out you cant give away power armor or even drop power armor that has atomic shop paints on them. So i had to strip them off to actually drop them for him. I also couldnt traide traide GB him because i couldnt see him.
---
Oh for sure. He was on his way out anyways. I was grasping at straws at that point lol
---
Level 23 with a one shot explosive western. One pistol perk for +10% and I kill lvl 60 white spring ghouls in a few hits. 
---
It's not about budget it's about aesthetic. Yeah there's compact ways to do this. Overall it's like 15% so nothing crazy
---
Cool. Thanks for the tip!!!
---
It happened again to him tonight.  This time no one was around and I was in the same room when it happened watching him play.  He had his marksman sniper rifle on the quick switch menu and his pole hook for melee.  He was using his pole hook for a little while, then switched to his gun and after awhile died.  He spawned again and a few minutes into the game brought up his quick switch menu to switch weapons and his axe was missing from the menu. Brought up his inventory and the pole hook was gone.   I just searched through the forums and have seen others report disappearing weapons also.  I am going to assume this is a bug of some sort.   So given what I witnessed I am going to assume what he had happen the other night it was the same deal and it had nothing to do with trading.  It's pretty hard to accidentally drop a weapon on the xbox, the PC is another story from what I see when lookin into this.  When you bring up perks on PC version it sounds like it is very easy to accidentally drop a weapon.  Even read something about a mod to avoid this situation.
---
Recommended he not play for now.
---
I crash every time I try to play Scorchbeast Queen. Really sucks to be booted to desktop for trying to play the game. Also, the adding teammates thing rarely helps. 
---
Don't be platformist, this happens on PC also. Roleplaying is basically useless in this game, so is immersion.
---
Gatling plasma is extremely strong.
---
Laser is indeed rather lackluster and not worth bothering with
---
Item for item works off trust by setting the items up for 0 caps and hoping they stick to their word and do the same for the item they said they'd trade u.
---
That's why I think a better system should be put in place where there is an approval on both sides like how it is in other games.
---
Haha, yeah, I didnt realize at first yours was following you around like that. I'll I love glitches like that
---
Ahh you're right.  Just applied it and it was cammo, not pure green
---
My brother, level 97, buddy Alex level 87 and me level 146 were at a silo and I accidentally downed myself with my TSE gun at an assaultron that ran in infront of me, this random level 55 or so go I didn't even know was in there ran through a dozen robots just to revive me. I threw up a heart and quickly went back to doing the objectives. Never really seen a toxic player yet, personally
---
Where did you read this? As far as Im aware Beth havent confirmed anything
---
Also max stacks for everything but bullets.
---
When your power armor is on a station, while you're crafting, someone else can walk up and take whatever they want off of it.
---
This is a known bug.
---
Be careful.
---
Cool! Very cool! Maybe Bethesda will build a decent game around it!
---
Did you delete it
---
&gt; 2 - With the numbers of players in that area at that time, you honestly think you are going to know exactly who is going to chuck a half dozen orbital strike beacons into your shack?  
---
It's called being Wanted after you decided to touch someone's shack. Which means you will die without having to be slapped first. So yes, you get your orbital strike off but you can't hide from the label stapled to your forehead.  
---
&gt; 4 - Are you seriously defending folks who move their camp into the zone to deny people the chance to kill bloated ghouls and get legendary items? Because thats whats being talked about here. Folks who drop their camp right next to the spawn areas just to get the ghouls to go that way. Usually without being present. Like I said.. trolls and/or inexperienced.  
---
You're no more, nor no less, entitled to the ghouls. My reaction though is more towards people thinking they're going to take matters into their own hands and attack people who for good or ill have legit put their camps where they did. Especially high level players picking on, as you put it yourself,  inexperienced players. If this game is the Wild Wild West where people can bang up someone's shit because they feel entitled to something someone else already has then when they put that target that says "I'm a shithead" on the map for everyone to see then bing, bang, boom, off with their head.  
---
I think a better way to handle this entire situation is to make those ghouls always spawn at level 1-5 and let people forget the whole course exists except for camp spots not crowded in weeds that clip through buildings.  
---
But the best part of this argument is the fact that lazy assholes want to farm the golf course and are pissed that other lazy assholes set up camp to more efficiently farm the golf course. It's literally one self-entitled lazy asshole being a dick to another self-entitled lazy asshole.
---
Well...
---
During a trade the other day for a weapon I found a guy hanging out in Raider Armor (I wear Raider Power armor and raider armor) who wanted to RP the Thug life...
---
So I hooked him up with a full set of heavy raider weightless armor..
---
Doing things like that every couple days is only possible with insane numbers of stuff
---
It's not just scorched.
---
I had one visit my mountaintop house and walk around. I took down my lamposts after that.
---
Hey, I have my CAMP set up near there, partially because of how much I love finding these unmarked locations (and partially because theres a crystal deposit nearby and I need my cryo cells). It is also worth mentioning that theres a building not too far down one slope that is filled to the brim with safes, and some pretty nice loot is available if youve got decent picklock
---
Do keep rejuvenated, that one is good. You're exactly right about the ap regen. More power attacks with the right weapon is great. Dog food healing could work, you would probably want either perks or armor that reduces the weight though if you're going to carry a large quantity. Neither stims or dog food are hard to come by. Just grab can do in the luck tree and swap it in when you get low. You'll also find coffee this way, which basically gives you infinite ap for a short time. More power attacks.
---
Marathoner is ok but it's kinda situational, basically my opening is to sprint power attack at things and they die in one hit, but the sprinting part of that doesn't take enough ap to prevent me from killing things. You should be fine too with your agility score that high. However (and this is a big however) marathoner is just so fantastic if you plan on doing cap stash runs. Not everyone does, but I do and marathoner can really help get your time down. Outside of that though, I just don't find myself sprinting everywhere. So yeah, probably marathoner or sneak. I use sneak myself but I'm wondering if you got the stealth boy mod for your power armor if you'd even need it. Play around with it I guess and see what you like.
---
Blackbird paint was a limited-time offer on the atom store for 1800 atoms.
---
That's the armor you saw.
---
Wow I thought this was a myth. There were a lot of posts about the about the same time as the fake "forced trade" exploit and I figured this was bull shit also. Hope it gets fixed. Would be awful to lose pieces with expensive mods.
---
I see this thing all the time, cursor says you can enter or remove pieces, never been able to.
---
I thought that was proven false?
---
R/weirdflexbutok
---
Hahaha yes! I can't wait!
---
I had a level 43 Vengeful Mothman today.  Do you have lamposts too?  
---
I was waiting for someone to say it.
---
even if it takes a powered press or something I'd go ok that at least makes some sense 
---
also why can't we make mortars with range?
---
This is true. That man knew his way around 88 keys like few others.

---
&gt; Recommended he not play for now.
---
I tested with 2 separate accounts (did not try this on unknowing people)  and 100% of the time I could ask for a trade (he would ignore it) and if I pressed the right joystick button two times,  I would see his complete inventory and I could look through everything and it would say waiting for player ABC above the inventory window.  I can even take a screenshot if you want to see it.  I have not confirmed it works on anyone else though.
---
Is this what you experienced? 
---
Also I posted below, I will paste it here also.. it happened again to him today and I no longer think it was trading related.
---

Codes have been useless since like day 3 of this game sadly.

The same people each week get the pieces within 10 minutes and they‚Äôre the same people who brute force the codes
---
Higher Charisma gives you a small caps-price boost, coupled with Hard Bargain perk, you can gain a decent amount of extra caps for your sales.

Conversely, the vendor is broke as a joke before you finish selling stuff though....

Ahhhh okay, well that makes sense. Thanks for clearing that up

It would be nice if the scorched earth had some kind of level requirement to keep low levels from coming in amd making it much harder to kill the queen.  Also, some way to rank the players that are battling the queen by informing us after its over as to who did the most damage to the queen and having a special reward for the top ranking player. It doesnt seem fair that a lvl 30 player can join the event, hide in a building after getting a few hits on the queen and still get rewarded the same as the other players that do all the work. Just a thought, but obviously i would rather not lag or crash out of the server in the middle of the event either, so would rather you guys prioritize fixing those issues first. On a side note, it would be nice to be able to save your spot in the server for a few minutes so that when you are in the middle of an event and crash and/or lag out you could join right back in without having to go through the queue that may or may not let you join back to finish your event.

Where did you find the helmet plans?

76 is a typical Bethesda game from my experience with Elder Scrolls and FO4. Great game that still needs some tweaking. Server disconnects, some bugs, and the occasional mob that A) wont die or B) rapid fire spams you into oblivion give it our beloved oppertunities to yell at Beth. On the other hand the game play is solid, the lore is everything you could ask for, and there is flexibility to play your way and have fun. Well worth the purchase in my opinion.

And to be fair the knife would be really like a toothpick thanks to your oversized robot metal hands, I dont think it will be easy to get a proper grip
---
Drop 'em.
---
Oh, so like reloading a "cell"? I'll look into it more and see if it helps when I run into him again.
---
I really just hope Chally isn't being cut, because it makes Grahm way more delightful (and her lamp makes him easier to see in the dark!)
---
If you do get the handmade plan, please let everyone know on here. So much dodgy info on level requirements for that plan.
---
A tse plasma gat is beautiful tho
---
Well. I just realized they are diamonded and I can‚Äôt drop them. Oh well
---
I got one out of the tool box near the terminal in the Flatwoods Agricultural Center.  It's the one in the basement you have to use to finish the event.
---
Regarding the power armor. What you can do is take the pieces off enter the frame to claim it. Then exit the frame and put the pieces back on. Wait for 2 mins and the frame will automatically recalled to your inventory and all will only weigh a total of 10lbs. You can then store this in your stach.
---
X**-**Box
---
That's great news!
---
Fun fact: there actually IS a Carbon coating paint job coming soon 
---
I like to wait for someone to claim one. Espically low levels and contest it just so I can fight them and steal there junk. Super fun
---
is the paintjob exclusive to it? or can you apply to other miniguns?
---
got an explosive one that's missing some gold.
---
Lol for real? Which pic? Just curious. 
---
Does the fire damage stack?  It seemed like it didn't for me, and because I had a lower level weapon a sold it.  Did i do a dumb?
---
Even if its a visual strech nothing that "Plans: PA Power fist/Spiked/Deathclaw/Megasloth clawed, etc" wouldn't fix, so far the unarmed extra damage mods are useless
---
Lol, u have anger management issues . Like I said, I got bored and moved it
---
I'm using no legendary armor, and so far i can survive any TSE 1-3 shots.
---
If you have butcher's bounty I heard it drops meat. Have not tested myself. 
---
I have been hearing nothing but good things about this mod.  
---
Would it have been awesome if this was native from the very start?  Sure!
---
But the fact we have it now through volunteer modders, is nothing short of awesome.  I for one am thankful for the opportunity to communicate more effectively than before.  
---
Honestly, I'm not sure if I will switch to a sneak style gameplay. I figured it would be worth it for the extra damage but I haven't been playing that way thus far so it may end up not fitting my play style.
---
IDK about a proper grip, but that knife isn't coming out of a grip powered by hydraulics.
---
At the point the weapon is being used by a PA user, I imagine most of the damage from being hit is blunt force. The object being sharp is just a bonus lol
---
Ahhh, got it.  So it isn't really item for item, it's two sales.  Sounds like the suggestion in an earlier post is a good one, each side sets the price high.  On one of my trades, though, the other guy said the max price is 5000 caps so he had to trust me to buy some bubblegum for another 5000.

It doesn't go up.  This video shows that you have the budget for a camp consisting of nothing but 10 turrets at level 6 and the same budget for 10 turrets at level 48.  I'm not crazy about the way he did it at level 48, but I think it still clearly shows that -IF- the budget goes up it's such a tiny insignificant amount that it doesn't matter.

Just cause you like being OP is not a reason to not nerf an obvious balance problem. And ‚Äúother games that nerfed their game and only made it worse‚Äù is a matter of opinion and matter of execution. Bungie were heavy handed and lacked finesse with their balancing decisions, that‚Äôs a Bungie/Destiny issue, not a ‚Äúnerfs r bad‚Äù problem.
---
The first time I saw that laser grid in the Mistress of Mystery storyline, I was so surprised that I gasped. They were so new and unexpected and visually interesting. 
---
That experience would've been vitiated if I'd seen them in another player's base. They become a little more common as you progress through the game. But I think it's worth keeping certain things kinda rare so that they're surprising and interesting when players first come upon them. 
---
I have yet to find a video of a ranged guy out playing this guys melee builds he has videos showing him killing SB queen in under a minute. So I think I'll stick with my slow reroll to this build. Also no more ammo farming with his build. So tired of lead steel plastic and gunpowder farming for hours to just get a few hours of gameplay. One night I farm. One night I play. Then farm. Etc. To hell with any ranged build until ammo amounts / cost to craft is improved. 
---
Thank you both!
---
I've only ever found it between 15 to 20. No higher
---
Not a glitch, nuke stuff stays for about 15-30 mins once the nuke effects wear off in the game
---
You really think Bethesda of all companies knows how be subtle in a nerf?
---
I have an explosive gatling laser that I enjoy using, but even with the explosive damage it still feels lack luster and the damage seems to be trickling rather than God tier. It also will break from about 5 or so cores so that's another issue.
---
Thank you for enjoying it!
---
level 38 is too high. i'm done playing for the night but if you don't have one yet by tomorrow morning pm me, i've got 1 or 2 left.

Well that sucks. It would be nice to have a juicy steak daily for the rest of my adventures. Looks like it will be canned dog food and mole rat chunks for me.

Yeah but the point is that using boxing gloves and knuckles in PA is silly but it also is true with almost 90% of weapons, I dont know how can you pull the trigger of a western revolver with your big thick metal hands

I‚Äôve stared at your question for awhile wondering how detailed of an answer I should give. I don‚Äôt want to bore you. Mom has rheumatoid arthritis and osteoporosis. I have heart problems and as of last year, I share the same rheumatologist as mom. 
---
&gt; That's why the buff the mod that stops the damage from explosive.
---
You have just made grenades and missiles useless with your proposed change. Plus now everyone is forced to equip this mod to avoid being one shot by an OP weapon, rendering all the other mods useless as well.
---
That balances nothing.
---
It's *supposed* to drop with the paint on it, but apparently due to a bug it never has the paint if you pick it up. It will only spawn via world drops by killing minigun-using enemies.
---
As much and as good quality as possible!

they only show up in the menu if you've planted on a resource anyway.

they're nice to have but i've never found them worth sacrificing an awesome spot for.

I've only heard of people getting it at those levels too which is why I'd be interested in hearing about someone getting it at a higher level.

These are the kind of posts that need more upvotes. Not people's made up stories, or gripes about gameplay.

thank

As far as I'm aware, paint plans don't exist for moment (or sombody hasn't found them yet). Which is a shame if yiu ask me cause a golden minigun that shoots exploding bullets sounds really badass

‚ÄúBeing OP‚Äù is not a play style. Jesus you‚Äôre full of half assed ideas.

This is a wild ride of emotions now, it'll be nice to spice up my armor eventually

Why does this sound like an attempt at an in game date?

I don‚Äôt have data but it‚Äôs noticeably faster regeneration when you add ap regen legendary armor on top of action boy.

Dense chest mod. It greatly reduces explosive damage. Padded is the weaker version. Use this knowledge wisely.

Looks super dope wish my place looked like that

It flew away when I tried to kill it. I think I spent too long trying to get the perfect pic with it.

I got kicked right before the queen died, this fucking game

The nuke lasts two hours then the effect stays another 30ish minutes.sounds like it had just been nuked recently when you disconnected.
---
But allow us one name change if it happens. I just input a bunch of random letters for my character since I knew it didn't matter.

Most people with that many TSE are dupers. They get something decently valuable, dupe the hell out of it and sell it to players. They then use the insane caps they get to outbid anyone on TSE they don't have, dupe it when they get it, and then rinse and repeat ad infinitum. 
---
tbh you won't need the extra damage. A 1-star instigating weapon would work fine against 90% of the enemies in the game. Once you get yourself better gear there's not really anything challenging to do. I basically only use sneak attacks against the scorch beast queen because she has so much HP it actually matters.

i think this might be the first camp i've seen that i genuinely love! really fantastic use of the terrain. if you're on PC and have any build budget left, lemme come demolish that budget and decorate the shit out of it.

The nuke happened over two hours ago and it disconnected and I‚Äôve rejoined three separate times to test it out and the legendary bloated ghouls keep coming.

For me it's the bottom right of the map 60% of the time

Oh I see. I misunderstood. I thought you were saying you could use vats to *throw* a grenade at a target, not shoot one out of the air.

If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.

Orbital strikes are more fun :)
---
No I'm scared this game will pull a destiny and destroy what little fun is in the game by nerfing into the ground because a vocal minority cried out
---
From what I've seen people just combine it with marsupial, jump crazy high into the sky and then shoot down at targets
---
It's infinitely easier to just buy the plans from another player. Probably cost you 1200 or so caps which is 600 more than from the vendor. Go to one of the market subs and ask. Also, you can get the plans from penitentiary patrol mission pretty easily at any level.
---
I agree, I would also like to see a way to give gifts to others via some kind of mail system. 
---
It would help with trading issues, it would allow you to "mail" newbies stuff when you see them on the map, and it would help with giving stuff between servers, dealing with weird time zones, etc.
---
And, you could prank people by sending them a couple of tons of stuff and forcing them to be over encumbered when they log in. üòÇ
---
Same here. It bothers me to, the mechanics on this one is messed up basically its random loot I understand it for containers and others..., but I think it be more sensible if the enemy would drop the same weapon they r attacking you. (Obviously one that matches ur existing lvl)
---
Not creepy at all, nope.
---
part of why people claim that heavy energy guns are trash is because most of them run electrically grounded. even with class freak (at the time of posting) it appears to not lower the penalty of electrically grounded's energy damage reduction.
---
if i recall correctly it is a -50% damage penalty to energy guns, with class freak it should be about -12.5% damage reduction. however since class freak does not want to work right with it the damage penalty remains at the max
---
They will destroy themselves when the next code cycle starts.
---
Both sets of power armor might have belonged to the guy. I think if you place more than one on the ground, one of the 2 becomes available to anyone else

Yeah those are guaranteed to be duped weapons. Don't know why you're proud to have let others do your cheating for you.

Go to your challenges and theres an achievement for hours played.

Right and I paid good money for it just as everyone else did. Only in this scenario I paid my $60 and happy with it, and the $60 never changes unless I spend more on atoms or something. But the point is I spent $60, they recognize it needs to be fixed, and they are working to fix it. And much like construction it isn‚Äôt always fixed in a day, and in this case it will take some time. It would be a totally different story if I bought the game, it was horrible, and they decided to never support it. At the end of the day I paid $60 flat for something that will evolve and continue to be supported and in many ways fixed, with no extra charge, or sweat off my brow. How many other things can you pay for in this world, for one flat rate, that will continue to receive maintenance? Could you imagine buying a house or a car for one price, and one price only, that has its own maintenance and upkeep? Mind you this isn‚Äôt including auxiliary items. I paid one price and they will continue to work on it. I think it‚Äôs fair for $60. I could‚Äôve easily spent that on beer that would be gone a lot sooner than the hours I‚Äôve accumulated playing a game that I enjoy. But hey beer and games, why not have both!
---
Oh, no.. not that.  I accidentally responded to your post I meant to respond to the first one in this that was talking specifically about his mods getting scrapped.  Yours is I am guessing a bug.  Curious what platform you are on?  I had happened apon your post when I was searching the other day.. My son had a weapon disappear on him  on xbox the other night, after he explained to me what lead up to it, I was wondering if it was from someone stealing it from a trade.  No one seems to think that is possible, and after witnessing it happen to him myself today/tonight I think it is a bug.  If a weapon can just vanish I don't see why it could not happen to anything else in your inventory like you had happen.
---
I have since searched the forums here and found some other posts of people saying things just disappeared.  It does not seem to be wide spread but I think most believe someone just accidentally drops the item.  And I even wonder if others that believe they have had something stolen from them, if it is not just the game dropping an item of theirs.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/actdor/anything_solid_yet_on_the_stealing_of_items_from/
---
Yeah, that works great outdoors. Marsupial is useful in general anyway. But a big part of the game loop is indoor stuff where things come at you pretty close. The explosive pumps with maxed explosives perks have a crazy lethal zone for the user.
---
The problem is, if you're like most junk collectors, you bulk your junk and for some reason the game thinks bulk junk shouldn't take precedence over mods. I shouldn't have to break down bulk junk manually when repairing or crafting just to protect my more. It's ludicrous to think that's acceptable.
---
It's more of a pain finding the ingredients then the actual item with search.....I have 3 disease cure receipes and antibiotics which is way better, never have ingredients
---
doesn‚Äôt matter if I or you think they can or not. Best practices for game design in this situation calls for a nerf. I‚Äôve seen shit nerfed for being a fraction of OP as explosive legendaries are. It‚Äôs inevitable change is coming. 
---
Yeah that would be good. Or maybe one name-change a week?

That's totally wicked.  how did you manage to sync 3 at once?

Only time I have ever disconnected was when I tried the carry weight exploit. Once I stopped doing it and then it was patched I haven't disconnected/crashed once. Except when I close the game the program still crashes for me when I exit to desktop but that's whatever I guess.
---
You know that faction play is coming, right?
---
Ok, yes for the armor, not the accessories, like calibrated shocks. Entirely separate, got the X-01 plans after finish the enclave quest line. 
---
Haven‚Äôt launched a nuke yet though, does that change what you can buy in the enclave armory?
---
I just want a Quad double barrel for this reason üò≠ also for Bethesda to put some other GD perks in the second tier, the only perks worth a damn in that tier are +50% VATS crit damage and explosive, and I'm not a VATS build. 
---
If you put all that effort into setting up a nice pen and draining your camps budget to welcome the poor thing into your life, just to slaughter him for a steak, you've got bigger problems to deal with 
---
Thank you!
---
Yeah it only seems to work on standard ballistic weapons, so all pistol and rifles of the solid pewpew variety. One of the Science cards makes reference to better durability for things you craft but none have Gunsmiths mention of reduced wear and tear.
---
For all those reasons I'm sticking with the Gatling Gun, good damage, decent rate of fire if you tap at the right timing and it almost never breaks or needs reloading.
---
I believe they have stated many times they have no way of identifying who dupes. 
---
You‚Äôre right! üò≠üò≠
---
Aw man... not the way...
---
You can. I grabbed all the parts and didn't finish until lvl 60 something. All my stuff was high leveled. 
---
&gt; vocal minority
---
In your opinion. And if being OP, bouncing around one shotting everything is the only ‚Äúlittle fun‚Äù you‚Äôre having with FO76, maybe your problem is that this just isn‚Äôt your kind of game.
---
Maybe its the world loves to tell crybabies how terrible it is. And the crybabies attempt to turn the table around since 2018, it is not them who are crazy, it is the world.
---
I just use melee + frags indoors. Need an instigating hammer or similar. But yeah, a quad shotty would be amazing. Honestly, the whole legendary system is a mess. There are only a handful of ultra rare configurations worth anything, and most of the armor is useless end game.
---
Too bad? Name checks out.

---
I have a lvl 3 sitting in the Watoga train station. Hoofed it straight from the vault. He leveled just past Whitesprings. I haven't figured out what to do with him yet.
---
Everything except melee and explosive shotguns os a joke at higher levels because enemies are bullet sponges so of you try to kill something with a normal weapon it takes soooo many bullets, so melee is a better choice overall because deals more dmg and you don't need bullets so it also helps carry weight. Like for real Bethesda really needs to rebalance the weapons
---
Not WV, but further down HWY 64. When the ambulance outdoor sounds play at dusk I'm constantly checking to see if my windows are open.

You're a little late there pal. And hehe haha I get it my name fits my laziness man you must've went to clown college for that one
---
Since beta you can be one shotted by any shit tier melee weapon. Only diference now is that ranged can do It too. Before the 2 shot weapons ranged was easy picks for melee, they would brush the low shot dmg and destroy you with a melee weapon.
---
All hail the Molotov. These will get you team invites with my usual crew as they tag everything without throwing corpses around. And you can help but feel awesome smashing ghouls with a hammer while surrounded by fire.

It changes the theme of the game from rugged wasteland with lost tech. to teenage mutant ninja turtles.
---
Yeah, super cool.
---
Faction based? They changed that when they copied the Nov 27th inside the vault lol. Now it just  says PvP
---
Gilded? Wait. Is there more gilded stuff? 
---
Bruh those aren‚Äôt necessarily dupers. They were selling mutations at a pretty low reasonable price. Most dupers use a very low lvl alt and lag out the server, while reconnecting and connecting back in 
---
That's funny you should say that because the other night my posts trying to recruit people for the scorchbeast queen kept getting downvoted. Like someone's mad we're trying to have fun together lol
---
But I also wanted to say I ran into a scorched mothman once. Orange eyes. Disappointed on how fast he died. The fight techniques are amazing but they didn't make them very strong. They should really buff all the cryptids in my opinion. The first wendigo I ran across was terrifying now they're annoying.
---
I forgot to mention you will need to either farm or invest in a gun that can handle scorchbeasts though. It's kinda rough to deal with them without help if you run 2h. The queen is easy since other players are there to help ground her, but the normal scorchbeasts are like server hop material if they attack your base before you can get a decent legendary gun
---
It sounds like a issue with the favorites tab. I'm on my phone and unable to reread the OP, but if I remember correctly the first incident also involved the favorites tab. I'll see if somethings going on there as well.

You can eventually get access to a vendor that will sell you serums for mutations, but they're pretty expensive.

It‚Äôs all about the supes. 
---
I had a hard time with this area, too. Some tips if you want them:
---
\- Dying isn't so bad if you don't care about your junk. It's OK to die repeatedly and just keep running back in and fighting more. There isn't much of a consequence to it except lost time running back. I died probably 10-20 times clearing out all of the resorts/hotels/etc around this area at level 20-25 or so. üòÇ
---
\- Melee helps (higher damage), as does sneaking (2.0x damage) up to individual guys. 
---
\- It's OK to just run or sneak up to the thing your quest marker is giving you as fast as you can, and then boogie to the next one.
---
\- Get on area chat and ask if any high levels hanging out are willing to let you tag enemies and help clear it out so you can finish the quests. 
---
\- Leveling up a little more first could help. (Hint: You may want to wait until level 50 to totally finish the quest anyway, so that the unique weapon it gives you is fully leveled up to level 50). For me, exploring all of the areas in the Forest, Grafton/Toxic Valley, and the Ash Heap before going on to the Raiders quest line really helped. 
---
\- Near one of the buildings, in a sort of flea market setup, there is a wooden fighting arena that has Raider Power Armor inside. Power armor should help you not die so much. If nobody else is in this specific area, it should spawn with level 15 pieces on it.
---
Yes. Prime recievers are mods that can be put on a weapon and makes it do the same amount of damage as hardened receiver. It also makes the weapon do extra damage to scorched and scorch beasts but changes the ammo type to ultracite ammo. 
---
Am I in a minority? I listen to the classical radio cause it only has one song I don‚Äôt like.

For me it's definitely "Sixteen Tons", but I totally appreciate a bunch of other ones.

Hello Novotny999 Can i ask you to do that data mining thing again?  I would ask to see if its possible to get the Casual Linings through the Treasure maps....  Or, if they fixed it and made it a drop for specific events....
---
Right. You learn the plans for the mods by scrapping the armor piece. when you need to clean out junk make some legs and scrap them. it is a low chance but it is doable. I have learned a couple mods that way.1
---

also he said " Any girls that cuss like a sailor I want to be your fo76 buddy and you need to add me".
---
Come on man.
---
OH. Thanks, good tip!
---
The wrong button?!?! That‚Äôs brutal. But yeah. This glitch sucks. 
---
like 500 caps dude im willing to be charitable 
---
If you get the serum recipes, the most difficult to get ingredient is 1 flux. Might just be selling them for cheap.
---
Hey man, thanks for posting, I had a blast. 
---
which im saying the level 11 SHOULD have to have to encounter the level 68s if he's in the higher level zones. just cuz you can't rush through the quest doesnt mean we need it to be fixed. there's tons of other things to do, there's no reason to rush the main quest. there is a beginning area for a reason. part of the fun is when shit hits the fan and you work your way out of a bad situation. i dont think there is a problem with encountering an area thats too hard for you at your current level. if anything it adds some challenge. the game is way to easy once you hit like level 30 and above    
---
They are average IF you don't have the grounded mutation. The perk that reduces its effect doesn't work.
---
Maybe my biggest little complaint. Really would like an option to also turn off names in game for those who wish to deepen their immersion further. Fingers crossed for the future, I‚Äôd like to play on a private server where no one can see names at all. 
---
If you do mod a weapon to use ultracite ammo instead of regular ammo can it be changed back later?
---
I read somewhere that somebody couldn't change it back but I havent confirmed it. If anyone has the answer please let me know before I made any changes to my guns. Thanks.
---
There is something called 'trading' and as I stated I can craft serums which is a quite profitable business. If you had check my post history it would be obvious. I bought a lot of junk, fluxes, aso too. Go figure why...     
---
     
---
But yeah, it's easy to shout 'duper' when you see someone who has items you want. Also I'm used to being accussed as 'duper'  - mostly from dupers who think they can get or lend some of the weapons I offer at a cheap price.       
---
      
---
Thing is - I do background checks for trades and always decline if I see something suspicious. And you know what? I wouldn't trade with you because of 2 of your submissions. But we're on different platforms anyway.
---
I'm against this idea. The social system already allows friends to join any game you are in, and fast travel to you. How the hell are you going to know who the fuck is showing up at your base?
---
Do you have diseases that affect your carry weight?
---
Way to be consistent Bethesda. 
---
Voice of Set and Blade of Bastet, upgradable as you level up. Others, not so much.
---
Unfortunately you lose all those bonuses in power armor, but useful outside of it. 
---
That looks so cool!!
---
/r/woosh
---
LOL I just realized I have bird bones I‚Äôm assuming that must be it?
---
And yet a Stimpak still costs 79 caps
---
Anything that affects your strength also affects carry weight. So that means either debuffs or buffs.
---
Alcohol and food can give you buffs etc.
---
Check your Effects screen see if you have any active
---
They need to add a Martinsburg DLC with crackhouse vaults and something that shoots used hypodermic needles. 
---
Serums as stated in text &amp; comments. Actually a really profitable business, especially if you had stated early.
---
I've got a video about 15 minutes long just sitting on my pc which includes me just picking up the pieces off the power armor frame. I should upload it sooner or later.
---
Thanks! We had a lot of fun terrorizing the residents of Appalachia for their caps 
---
Some guns can be changed if they have other options besides the standard and prime reciever. Some can‚Äôt, like the .50 cal machine gun because it originally has no other option besides standard 
---
The PSN/gamer tag could be displayed under the character name, and also your social tab could show the PSN/Gamertags. 
---
You‚Äôre so enthusiastic, it‚Äôs infectious! 
---
Joined a server with heavy lag all Whitespring turned Into nukatown but with no nuke effects just ‚Äúflora‚Äù ‚Äúfauna‚Äù with 4 high level 100 just milking the glowing ghouls unfortunately outta all legendary stuff nothing with over 2 stars :(
---
Do you have the class freak perk maxed and equipped?
---
Yup. In ESO you can set character name to show or GT. It gets kind of weird cause I use character names and the default is GT, so when I call someone by their character name in chat no one knows who tf I'm talking to, and if someone else uses their GT I have no idea who they're talking about. 
---
I believe the small water purifier doesn‚Äôt need a water source, just electricity.
---
You don‚Äôt need them to nuke just nuke card and code ?
---
Vats criticals will like bring it to 1 shot if you hit the head 
---
What system are you guys mainly on? Or is it more of a coalition of cross-system likeminded individuals?
---
agreed
---
I feel like a smart idea would be to skew the matchmaking to put you in an instance with people reasonably close to your level. Or have the option to spawn in such an instance instead of the current seemingly whatever logic they have.
---
You are not wrong. I have been through there plenty of times to gladly never stay. On the bright side, at least the torndown buildings and trash-laden streets feel like home.
---
I dont have it equipped. My carry weight now went back to 190 after curing bird bones but it usd to be 205?
---
Oh so maybe you‚Äôd have to introduce yourself over mic or something? That would be interesting if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre suggesting.
---
I turn off every radio that I find.
---
Yeah and if you get a fusion generator from Powering Up Poseidon event you can plant lots of those purifiers at a workshop to get a lot more water production than is available at camp.
---
Yeah, mutation serums are just one flux and some low-value scrap once you have the recipe. Some people just farmed a lot of queens.
---
it was probably a rolling pin
---
&gt; t but at least make it a square about 95% of the items I place are a
---
Or allow Gray Zones where you can have up to 20% of an object outside of it.
---
Was actually just browsing my feed..
---
Says you. My money is on nocturnal armor.
---
Ciphering is incredibly convoluted, so it would be awesome to have an in game (lore) alternative to nukacrypt. Perhaps it will be usable after a forthcoming update.
---
I‚Äôm from WV! 
---
Did you place it by pressing the a button, or the X button? 
---
When you have plans for mutations the serums are actually surprisingly cheap to make. Flux is probably the thing that stands out for most people but it only needs 1 and I spend the majority of my time harvesting and making flux during a nuked zone so I have have quite a lot.
---
I have made free serums for a bunch of people. I paid for all of my serums from the Enclave bunker (except the first one I caught naturally and in got 1 serum from a SBQ) so I know how hard it can be to get them and I like giving it to others as it makes the game a lot more fun.
---
If they ever add the player vendor items I will definatley put up some cheap serums to sell too.
---
Yea as long as you know the code to the silo and have a key card you can launch
---
Yeh its also why you rately if any see anyone shooting one, bar the gattlings.
---
We are faring the same game is very broke. Quests broke, currency broke.. so many bugs that even the roaches are offended. I have launched nukes on the golf course it was relatively fun. After third nue getting bored so bomb flatwoods do for a chuckle... and then realize... nothing more to do sadly  :(  i loved fallout 4 not so much love for this one
---
What r u selling the grognak axes at
---
My favorite part was, when I loaded into another session, my health bar was 75% rads. T'was not before I crashed.
---
It's like getting kicked to the ground then spit on.
---
Well, simply saying that's what you should do isn't ridiculous. That's actually the only way to combat the issue. The ridiculous part, if you insist there has to be one, would be the simple fact that this is a thing to begin with.
---
I have to take a break to listen when 'Dark As A Dungeon' comes on. That's one hell of a song.
---
It's lame. Not nearly as good as Whitespring.
---
Becouse every time you try to repair something you lose atleast one screw. That is mechanists rule #3.
---
I just sold the instigating one to a vendor lmao. Well I paid 2500 for the other one so I'd kind if like 3k
---
Not a good nuke spor, not worth it at all
---
Do scorched earth a few times, do side quests, explore the wasteland, use the treasure maps, nuke toxic valley farms to gain some flux, and then wait for new content
---
Ikr but when you spend 10hrs sometimes trying to find one- yeh the caps is justified
---
I never said I was proud, I just refuse to let someone make me feel bad for some thing that is out of my control. As I said earlier I am only in control of MY actions. No negative comments is going to change that.  
---
15-19.
---
Hence the "extremely" but I understand your point. And agree
---
I like the high tension of a surprise interaction. Granted in this game compared to other survival games the stakes simply are no where near as high so the thrill won‚Äôt be matched. Still, only learning Simone‚Äôs voice and a name to match to it is the way to go imo. Wayyyy more fun.
---
I‚Äôve logged off now because I got demoralized, but I placed it using the drop button, I think it‚Äôs the X button but I‚Äôm not sure. I‚Äôve been playing for a week now almost every day and I‚Äôve pressed the same button every time. 
---
The lead extractor spot directly west of Top of the World is prime real estate. I've got all the lead to feed my guns for days, and since it's fairly central on the map it's cut down my fast travel costs significantly. Plenty of space for crops and buildings, too.
---
That's fair but I only got 2.3k lol, might have some items to trade the difference if ur up for it
---
Finding the Small Water Purifier plan can be a pain. I found one in the Charleston DMV Overseer‚Äôs chest, but I think it's random. It only stores 2 PW at a time, so you‚Äôll need a few. 
---
I hope so ... I'd never seen anything like it in the almost 300 hours I've played ... was alittle confused when I hovered over it 
---
That's the issue, I believe. Don't drop it, but place it using the A button. It will recall to your inventory even if you crash that way. 
---
Miguel used to be laid back, but these days hes just... intense. It never gets old! Unlike Miguel's decomposing remains. 
---
Explosive shotgun should fire a single **explosive slug** instead of a dozen explosive pellets.
---
It is level based. The actual maximum budget does not change but the items you make ends up being slightly cheaper every level so you can make more of items the higher your level.
---
This is based on information from some time ago so please correct me if I am wrong.
---
I think the explosive damage being better on the floor has something to do with the range of the shotgun, it probobly scales down as you get further if you hit them directly but doesnt if you hit the ground
---
I'll take your 2.3k my stash is crazy full and I've been making a killing in trades today 
---
isnt it in the safe zone?
---
Yeah, I accidentally posted in the middle of typing it out.
---
wow I found all the BOS after like 10 jumps.
---
Oh, you just game me a thought.  I'd love to weild a giant claymore while wearing power armor.
---
I‚Äôll do that from now on but I have to rebuild my suit now including the mods? That sucks. 
---
If you have butcher's bounty it does work.  
---
Kill the cow, search it, store the wheel barrow the cow comes with and then place it again.  If you store it quick enough you shouldn't have to repair it and you get a fresh cow when you place it. Repeat as needed.
---
I'd grow a few razorgrain on the side just in case though.  Shit happens.
---
I'll buy any extra I see  =)
---
Caught at putting [some love](http://i.imgur.com/xvfNqqT.jpg) in the serum business? Yeah, I'm guilty.     
---
Also just checked your post history: May consider start trading to get things you want instead of throwing around toxic acussions everywhere.
---
Also want any free junk, I killed this guy at his workshop a few mins ago and he dropped an absurd 300 lbs of scrap
---
Ign insanebuddha
---
Also medium generator and small water purifier. 
---
Sure and thanks man my ingame name is Werewolfgus
---
Yes, unless you get super lucky and can log back into the server you were on. Might still be there, unless someone has found it. 
---
I love this so much! I'm 42, my husband 38, and our son is 15. He plays with us occasionally, but we play with his friends often. I love when he gets on and plays with us though. Except for the time he spawned in next to me and shot me, lol. I love Fallout, and this game is so much fun. Thanks for sharing your story. 
---
Ah, so if you change the receiver to prime, it ONLY uses the new ammo. Is that any harder to craft?
---
I'm probably on my second and third plan of several items because there's no way to tell if we've already bought the plans listed for sale.
---
I'll be a few mins to my stash I'm walking all this junk to my camp across the map
---
Ok, thanks for responding, I really appreciate it. 
---
Got one off a plain old Scorchbeast once. Only time I've seen it. Sad that it got scrapped for more stash space. It sure did look pretty cool.
---
&gt;When a beast lands,
---
Yeah when they do, you can one shot them with TSE shotgun, few strikes with whatever melee wep, you can kill it easily. BUT those bastards never lands!
---
I've got maxes out pack rat if that'll help
---
No problem, sorry for your loss. 
---
I see your a man of class..
---
i ask again..  how is it awful game design , when the design of the game wants you to team up? isn't that the point of a cooperative multiplayer (primarily) PVE game?
---
I've noticed my carry weight fluctuates too, but I've noticed for me it's more due to a bug. I'm fairly certain it's some of my armour prefixes that reduce item weight not working - When I relog naked then throw my armour on, it all works perfectly. Only get this bug when I log on with my armour equipped.
---
need stable flux to craft the ammo. depends on what gun for what flux is needed
---
I have, PC user, it stops being available after you complete the early quests at the airport I believe.
---
This can be hugely abused and is best if reported to Bethesda as the container can reset, thus you can have a huge amount of stims if you don't complete those early quests.
---
Had to google it after reading this. I still dont get why you want this for, the damage still looks pretty poor.
---
Is this just for the bling? :P
---
I'm pretty close now 
---
Thank god it is. We'd have so many camps with turrets just everywhere if it wasn't.
---
They‚Äôd really diversify the good options
---
I would like to see DPS and on my charracter i would like to see armor penetration, crit damage, etc.
---
Kk cool man and thanks
---
2 high schools for plastic then fire station and motel for lead. Generally you will get enough aluminium for shot guns shells. Use the perk that increases ammo and chance of double craft and usually only do a run every 3-4 days. 
---
The second one I saw was, the first was not. 
---
I set out across the map for the handmade plans at level 13 on the grounds that I'd probably be level 15 by the time I got to Watoga. Didn't quite work out because I was just hiding from most stuff.
---
Died twice. Once to max-level Whitesprings ghouls when I thought I was safe, opened the pipboy to drink something and got trapped in a corner. Once when I lost my sense of direction in a ditch and wandered too close to the Watoga assaultrons.
---
It might have been dropped rather than placed
---
I have legit never before seen so many players exclaim GLITCH in any game I have ever played before. And Ive played a few.
---
Plans don't unlock until 15. 15-20. That's when I made my trip with a 15 alt. 3 server hops and I had them. Btw, you could always just team with someone and instantly fast travel. You'll need someone to help you transfer them anyway.
---
Awesome, thank you much.
---
That's not very Country Roads of you
---
But how will hackers brute-force my password if they can't see my account name?
---
What if you brought an enemy to the gun and he picked it up?
---
Sounds like you guys agree plague walker can cause problems, not just with this vendor bot.  But does it cause problems elsewhere *even if you have no diseases*?  That‚Äôs messed up.
---
Sorry, I'm just a Major Smartass ;)
---
But then I can‚Äôt recreate the Portal Turret song!
---
In 2019 we already making the subject of gender more confusing. So I can imagine 2120 it must be very confusing 
---
Check out [this website as well](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks), it's got an awesome FO76 character planner that I use to plan out builds.
---
It even displays a "leveling path" that show when you should take perks from level 1-52, and also tells you what level you need to reach to be able to acquire all your chosen perks.
---
Silence is my jam!
---
Where do you start the quest
---
You just happen to have 3 TSE weapons. 
---
Maybe they're not charm immune.
---
Maybe the Railroad is right.
---
I doubt dupers would set up like that. Sounds like a legit seller
---
Where am I wrong? The problem is the OP weapons that people exploited into existence, not gatling energy weapons being underpowered.
---
I'm level 47, finished the main quest a while ago
---
That's interesting. I had less than 100gb free on my drive when I installed the game and have 34gb remaining space now and it doesn't give me that message when the updates come out.
---
It‚Äôs all high rate of fire weapons, not just the energy ones. Miniguns will go just as fast.
---
Lol, everyone is always asking about the Blackbird paint job. 
---
It was a limited time paint job.
---
Trading subs, discord or other communities. 3 Weeks ago 1-2k per serum was common but prices dropped and now it's more like 250-750.
---
System?
---
You guys made their scorchbeast queen kill a lot harder than it needed to be. Expect a lot of hate if you try to leech queen kills
---
Honestly the last couple days have been really bad, from being stuck in the eternal load screen (of course while doing an event) server disconnects, game freezing, issues with FPS in nuke farming and the good old buzz and reset (which only happens on Bethesda games for me)
---
The sad thing is I really want to enjoy this game there‚Äôs so much potential but when you see scorched carrying guns that are broken, parts and pieces sitting in odd positions it screams that quality control is sitting at the bottom of a deep woods outhouse 
---
I know what you mean by the time i get back from finding them they have spoiled 
---
I too enjoy seeing the opossums running around west virginia
---
Thats why you do not wear power armor and shot nuke with prime fisure site on edge of blast zone.
---
I already have 4 recipes from Queens they are stupid cheap to make, and super dupper procs makes it even cheaper. In fact 500 is a bit to high for my blood I sell for 250 and 300 caps ( I always run low on violet so I need to make some profit if I am supplying) you supply it is a free service, I don't even keep the super dupper procs unless you tell me to keep it as a tip.   
---
True, but if you're a bit of a tight-a then this is the next best solution.
---
Or are you feeling lucky? F. Going through countless server hops at the prison only to get the quest and get some other drop.
---
Turn on passive under options 
---
It's also supposed to drop the shielded raider underarmor plans.
---
I can't even get a drop with all the teams of TSE carrying people running around murdering everything. It's getting to be even more unplayable. If it's an area or an event where a 3 star will be, that's where they are one shotting everything in site before you can even get a hit in. 
---
Don't expect others to care about you or not take advantage of situations
---
Put yourself on pacifist mode
---
Its because the plans dont spawn until you are lvl15? Afaik.
---
If you group with them yes otherwise it goes unowned and someone has to pay to claim it. All that you had there will still be there though. 
---
Old post, but If you want to recreate the look, just wear a gas mask and a combat armor helmet, ta-da!
---
If he's planning on farming them and selling them it may be worth it ( doubt it though) but you can earn the difference of 600 caps a LOT quicker than levelling an alt all the way to 15
---
I accidentally sold or destroyed my voice of set, so no upgrading it for me  
---
Not sure about that but i can tell you that anything you build on one stays there until the last person leaves that map and the server deletes it. Ive come up to dozens of functional turrets and defenses before already built.
---
So basically if you log out everything you built stays until the next person comes along and all they gotta do is pay the caps to claim it
---
I'm looking to buy an explosives pistol, shotgun or handmade 
---
Why would you want a Death Tambo? Might as well go with a Deathclaw Gauntlet or Power Fist.
---
Level 45 and 50. Some armor and weapons are topped out af 45, some at 50. 
---
The farmers? They're frustrating sometimes. I try to stay away from groups bc of that (also bc I main a double barrel explosive but not two shot and I don't wanna get wanted). 
---
You also get a new random plan every time you take a workshop and each time you defend a workshop.
---
It gets harder the more people who show up. It's not your fault, it's poor game design, but players get very shitty about it. A lot of the time it fails when you get a few low levels there
---
I don't think that would have made it harder. The extra 4 people are just extra fire power and more importantly extra targets for the enemies.
---
Although the extra damage would be almost inconvenient it would not make the fight harder for others.
---
Invite someone to a group and log off, it will go to them. 
---
~~First time trying this~~ Def not the first time trying this.
---
With a Weapon Artisan 3 repaired 50 cal and gunsmith maxed, I can shoot around 10 mags (2500 rounds) before it breaks. 
---
It depends on a lot on the weapon and the mods that are equipped. Take special care with weapons that have a bunch of mod slots like the 10mm, as many mods reduce max durability, and if you stack 5 or more of them you can end up with a gun that will break in half the time or less. 
---
I hopped into a game with some guys but I'll add you and we can play sometime for sure 
---
Use Syringer to lower def is your really that pissed about it
---
Thanks for all of the answers. I was actually looking for the same thing but I wasnt checking at the Grafton vendor.
---
That's lag. The client side spawned enemies before the information came from server side that another player already killed those enemies, or that you cleared that area in a previous session and the respawn timer hasn't expired yet for the area to repopulate. You can sometimes kill an enemy before they drop dead and their inventory will be emptied when the server side information makes it back that they should not have been alive.
---
I'm like batman in a sense on this game. Starting about level 30 or so I'd drop in on low levels huddled in places I know are swarming with enemies.... either I was alone or traveling with a friend. We would swoop in, crush some skulls, we would get thumbs up and stuff. 
---
Now that I'm higher level i still keep an eye out for them, and also ensure they're free of griefers.
---
Difficulty scales on numbers. Usually you can carry a few lowbies, but people get shitty about it. Especially those who've failed a lot because if lowbies groups joining in
---
Ok thats what i have been doing the last couple of times .. Hope i made some random gamers happy 
---
I'll take the two shot. PM me for username.
---
I probably could have dozens because I heard offers like 'I give you a TSE xyz for 3-10 serums' way too often. But there's a reason I declined every single one of those. Dupers ruin the serum business because serums for 250 or less are below production costs.
---
Appreciate that, thank you. 
---
Multiple projectile weapons showing "_x_" for damage rather than just "_" was cool, too.
---
Can u join and come to me I'm rebuildingnmy camp 
---
Turn on pacifist, that is your lesson you learned today.   
---
Also going to the queen that low is dirty and you should feel bad knowing that you and your buddies made her harder and longer to kill thus wasting ammo and time of other players and odds are they felt justified killing you for your mistake.    
---
[http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fever\_blossom\_(Fallout\_76)](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fever_blossom_(Fallout_76))
---
as wiki says and picture shows, just found it there ty whoever updated wiki you're a GOD
---
Similar to mine.  I‚Äôd probably got a bit less in endurance.   To me it seems a mostly throw away stat as it is.  Probably sink those points into luck for better crit skills
---
Apparently grilled radstag is 20+ carry weight? Nice
---
Only the Atom store paint. If you want to sell or trade it just paint to back to it's normal colour.
---
This thread right here. The comments are gold mine
---
Sure
---
hiya! im Arctiblaine and i don't mind being your friend. 
---
Amen to that. Learned this the hard way when some punk turned around and killed me at 1/4 health with full rads. Then proceeded to take all my stuff that I happened to be hauling around because I was crafting when the nuke launched.
---
Just shoot me a friend request 
---
You need assasin and sentinal on all of your armor
---
I‚Äôm considering switching the concrete floor to hardwood but I‚Äôm not sure if that would match the garage vibe.. I still need o buy the Power Armor Atom shop statue, too. It would be nice if there was a Nuka Girl thumbs up sign like the Vault Girl one I could replace it with.
---
It doesn't bother me personally. Just giving him the facts. It's not his fault, the game doesn't explain how it works.
---
As far as i can tell any minigun can spawn as gilded. I had a scorched run around with it near prime fissure (near the starcamp south of it) and the gun in the bos camp can also spawn gilded.
---
Its like a shiny pokemon.
---
voice chat bad. either voice chat is on and all game audio is muted by 99% or voice chat is off and I can actually hear the game.
---
I‚Äôm going to have to expirment with this. Thank you for letting me know.
---
Thanks! Literally walk by that place all the time when farming Whitesprings and never knew...
---
You can get it from the eastern regional penitentiary event with no level restriction.
---
My camp on the 6th green, I normally nuke it so no one nukes my camp by mistake, then the farmers farm while I nuke the queen twice makes simple queen kills. 
---
There‚Äôs a lookout to the right of the resort I love to go there 
---
i been getting alot of game freeze and disconnect from server ever since the last patch or hot fix and then i get ingame my sound is mute and only to fix this go to voice chat and switch to team and go be to none to fix it i am on xbox one
---
My husband and I dropped our first nuke tonight, I had five codes and he had three (not counting duplicates), and we both got credit for completing the quest. 
---
This. I save mine specifically for Queen killing. Finally got the Prime receiver for it, and the damage it dishes out is overwhelming, did about 1/4 of her health by myself, even having only 2 cores available. 
---
I am! 
---
No they didn‚Äôt. He‚Äôs talking out his ass.
---
Is ur ingame name the same as ur reddit?
---
I did not know this, Thank you for telling me! 
---
Can confirm on all counts, had enough to craft 4 stable flux, ended up with 7. If you can't craft any flux the raw is good vendor food.
---
&gt;Make them actually fun to play against. Have them keep a little more distance, let them jump behind stuff, do more than straight running towards you, have them intentionally flank you, vary their attack patterns, etc.
---
Love this idea the most! This is what I'm hoping for, making battles a little more fun; especially useful for high-level areas where those decked out with high-level gear are given a bit more challenge. Otherwise most (not all) peeps after reaching levels 50+ will have little motivation to continue playing; I've already lost a few friends on here that have given up playing due to repetition and no challenge in fights; even with the Queen.
---
Around beckwith farm there a ledge there i put my camp. Built it 3 stories and even better view from it 
---
You can just craft another one.
---
Nocturnal WOOD armor is best armor. 
---
I take 6 two shot 50 cals, one dropped for me the others I bought way early on for dirt cheap. If I am grouped with my friends I don't break one if it is a PuG queen I can break all 6 and my back trying to carry.   
---
However on the note of laser weapons, my legendary ultractie laser pistol lasts a very long time, the ultra gatling laser does not.  Gatling plasma also seem to last a lot longer than the gatling lasers now that I think about it but not as long as minigun.
---
But we didn't know that, that's the thing
---
No worries. It's not really much of an issue since they fixed explosive weapons, but it still pisses some people off
---
Action Boy doesn't work in power armor fyi.
---
Someone gets it 
---
I play in pacifist mode and use a super sledge and just run into the middle of the melee. Tap as many glowing ghouls as possible and just keep running. I won‚Äôt get ‚Äúwanted‚Äù status but those TSe farmers had better turn on pacifist. 
---
Sorry I'm an idiot it says ur offline
---
Right where the nuke lands
---
...but can't mix concrete mix with water without expensive plans. 
---
I'm online its bugged lol
---
You should have had pacifist on and honestly you should have been a higher level, I doubt you contributed much toward the fight 
---
Same problem in FO4. Energy weapons lost a lot of what made them unique in FONV (espeically with the mod system letting you replicate big magazines at the drop of a hat for any weapon) and heavy weapons like the minigun get screwed over by the defense system because the actual damage per bullet is so low. No armor pierce effect like in NV to help mitigate that at all, so it ends up being heavy garbage.
---
So all of the heated water in Iceland gives you the runs lol
---
I got one once, it was a level 30 so i scrapped it. Was hoping i might unlock the paint that way.
---
I never thought about the 'Good with Salt' perk with Flux, that makes that perk so much more useful to me (I have the carnival mutation and the butcher bounty perk so I just eat whatever is around on the spot so it has never been useful to me).
---
Sounds like buffs have you taken any chems?
---
New issue I encountered yesterday playing my level 54 character. I went to a vendor and the legendary descriptions didn't match the listed effects. I bought one of them (auto stim marine leg that instead shows/adds +1 INT instead of auto stim effect) and the mismatched description/effect persisted through sessions. Today in a new session I encountered more mismatched descriptons/effects at another vendor. It seems to effect mostly the higher level (3 star+) items. I also came across a legendary level 16 Super Mutant that didn't drop a legendary item in the same session today, which was a first. Also for the past two days my load screens are garbled. I had the launcher check my game files just now so we'll see if it fixes any of it. Last time when I had a bunch of weird problems that fixed it so fingers crossed.
---
Honestly I feel pretty bad for that bot, and try to explode miguels limbs when I see him.
---
There needs to a "versus" portion for it to be PvP. Getting instagibbed from a TSE or even multiple TSE has no versus. Yes I can TSE back but then it comes down to twitch aiming an trigger response time with instagibbing. Still not fun.
---
And again it is the game system siding with those who wish to force PvP on others. There are times an places where PvP could be good clean fun, especially if they introduced a balance to it but there is no real balance in the PvP, and worse the resource gain from workshops means I should spend my time elsewhere for greater gain. 
---
HES AGREEING WITH YOU MORON! He just made an absurdist style joke to help further your point. Either that, or he disagrees with you but he just said something so outlandish that your initial argument looks better by comparison.
---
 Either way, stop arguing with him! you've won, you've done it, you've got the medal, a winner is you! Arguing now only makes your point worse.
---
Instant downvote for spreading fake News. 
---
Even if we don't take tse weapons in consideration, badly balanced weapons still remain badly balanced. Even with perks most heavy and automatic guns are not worth it because other ballistic guns and melee are MUCH more efficient. And yes, I tried to use all types of weapons with all the perks they require - most heavy guns are still shitty even with perks. Devs need to fix damage per point of durability ratio to make automatic heavies at least as viable as much more common rifles and hammers.
---
 "Any of you fucking pricks move, and I'll execute every last one of you!"
---
Eh, there are a couple legendaries from the story that can be level locked, too. All Rise is a lightweight super sledge from the mayor for a day quest in watoga. And black diamond is a +1 str ski sword from one of the early rose quests from top of the world. And I think one of the earliest story missions gives you that 44 with armor penetration. 
---
Apparently it was from the grilled radstag I ate? 20+ carry weight for like 30 minutes I didn‚Äôt realize till I looked directly
---
No. 16 tons is clearly the winner.
---
Also, if you hear someone wandering the wasteland singing 16 tons along with the radio (mic on, of course), it‚Äôs probably me.
---
I think it's one of the plans you automatically learn when you first take a workshop
---
Lol I leveled a character to 15 just to get the handmade plans for me and my friends that level locked stuff drives me nuts.
---
Wait, this bug is STILL around?! Hasn‚Äôt it been a thing since day one? I know Bethesda is really screwing the proverbial pooch at the moment, but damn. 
---
I use it a lot. Combined with action boy and I‚Äôm up to 3 pieces of armor with AP regen it‚Äôs getting better. I only use it when I don‚Äôt need AP for vats. Which is pretty much just shooting stuff out of the air. 
---
So question. If you already got the mission but did not completed it yet.
---
Does the level cap triggers at the end or at the beginning of a mission?
---
The queens' health scales with the number of players in the event area. Having a number of lowbies in the area can wreck the balance, because the queens' health gets a buff but there's no extra damage output. 
---
The players were probably already frustrated that you were there, especially the player that launched the nuke. You then mistakenly hit them, and subsequently got murdered. 
---
Honestly, stay away from the Queen until you can do a good amount of damage. In nuke zones or high level areas with other players, use pacifist mode so this doesn't happen again. Tell your friends, too. 
---
Hmm, I haven't really noticed that. That would be frustrating if you were trying to listen to a holotape and your buddies wouldn't shut up, or if "Sixteen Tons" came on and you couldn't hear it (üòÅ), or if you missed the sound of a Super Mutant Suicider, or an officer, or another enemy warning sound.
---
I keep my subtitles on, because I have some problems hearing things sometimes anyway, and that helps with holotapes (exit your Pip Boy to see the subtitles along the bottom of the screen) and what robots say.
---
Text chat should help out a lot of people who are on the fence, if they ever implement it!
---
The beauty of cut content in a game that‚Äôs supposed to go on for years?  They can go back and reactivate it.
---
The only thing I fear dying from anymore is my own explosive pump shotgun... I hold my breath when shooting over/through railing, lol!
---
Hello! Feel free to add me and stop by whenever you see me on üòÅ
---
I am always up for random adventures (especially exploring)!
---
MrSharkBone on Xbox one, if y‚Äôall are on it feel free to add me and I‚Äôd gladly help.
---
100+ DMG rocket propelled sledge should be considered contributing 
---
Cannot give anything definitive as I'm at work but I know Sturdy Combat Armor with the BOS Mod + Ultralight build and the weightless prefix all weighs 0 while my Heavy combat armor weights \~1LB with ultralight and weightless. The hunt for a 0 weight suit continues. Sadly i do not have Ultralight build mods for the other types I've found with the weightless prefix to try. Still 193/232 for no carry weight is a nice bit of defense.
---
Okay, thanks! 
---
Tesla seems to last a good amount of time on semi and shotgun the auto chews its up though...thats not what bothers me though wish perks actually worked for them.
---
Funny you say this, today I was clearing space in my stash and had 1k+ rounds of .38. I dont need it, so I thought I'd be helpful and travel to the vault and drop them outside for a newbie to grab up. I had just finished dropping them and was walking away when a lv. 123 spawned in and took them. I was like "really dude?" What could u possibly need .38 for at that lvl
---
Just play the game, there's only one quest legendary worth having and chances are you'll be close to 50 by the time you do it if you aren't rushing.
---
PSA: Meat piles from other peoples kills in a nuke zone will also give hardened mass and other mats for crafting the flux. So if you are late to the party or accidentally scrap your hardened mass then you can grab more even when there's nothing left to kill.
---
Me too, also glad it wasn't me. :0)
---
Only the Harper's ferry merchant is level locked. Being a high level doesn't preclude you from getting plans at others but it might still be easier if you're not fyi
---
Me too, I bought a death claw claw hoping to put it on my deathclaw hand as a secondary.
---
I don't think I'm going to be using it for... Well, a while.
---
Push to talk is great. It just isn't intuitive for new players. I often run up to new players who don't respond, and tell them what the default push to talk key is (Caps Lock), and which point some of them respond. I just wish more players were mic'd up or actually bothered with voice chat as it's the only form of communication we have other than a very slim selection of emotes.
---
Though there was this one time I happened to run across this one guy before push to talk was introduced. He obviously had his mic on and was not on a headphone. He was talking to his gf when I ran by and said "Hi, how are you?". His gf asked him in an accusing tone who he was talking to and he quickly, in a panicked tone, responded that he had the window open and it was people outside. At which point I see him running away from me to avoid further conversation and admitting to his gf he was actually playing a game while talking with her :'D
---
&gt; And much like construction it isn‚Äôt always fixed in a day, and in this case it will take some time. 
---
Ah yes, the good old guys give them time it's only been (a day/a week/a month). Major issues still exist from launch. Hell major issues exist from Fallout 4 and that came out 3 years ago. So are you giving them 3 years leeway to fix it?
---
Don‚Äôt worry about it. I‚Äôm pretty sure you can find it in Vendors too. You‚Äôll also find better legendaries by then anyways.
---
It is. Everyone saying it is not worth, are fking fakers. You can shoot nuke to land like on 5% of that island, it is mostly in safezone.
---
they are in the game, it's just that nobody cares.
---
although I'd bet interest on bleed/poison is gonna spike once everybody has assassin's/sentinel's
---
To give you an example of end game weapon damage, my TSE prime gauss does 1750 damage with bonus damage to scorched (including queen). Plus 25%damage from chems.
---
‚ÄúThey just don‚Äôt have the technology yet‚Äù - said the lobotomized fools.
---
How is that fun? 
---
Again take it as a lesson learned. It may not be fair to you but many players including myself dislike leeches. You should have known the Queen is endgame and is for those at endgame. Now if you have never ever played a single video game without an endgame or bosses I could forgive that degree of ignorance.    
---
But at some point logic and common sense should have kicked in and said oh shit wrong place for us to be look at this level 95 monster.   
---
As for pacifist, had you used the help menu or even played around or was just curious how PvP works that includes reading the on screen tooltips you would have known about pacifist.   
---
Honestly people like you is why I like doing her in my group of 4-5 she is dead before it can finish saying Death From Above completed. Then watch all the people zoning in and looking around like WTF.  I spend my days looking for plans and since I am down to two off a vendor and the rest off the queen I need to run them as fast as possible. I also always make sure to drop my excess plans in cash registers now normally at charleston to help or be a nice surprise for someone.  
---
The has happened to me other places as well. 
---
I'm not arguing to win. I'm arguing because I enjoy the agony of discourse.
---
Curious! I have lampposts around my base and I‚Äôve only seen him at dusk/in the dark.
---
It's all based on perspective, the higher levels were probably doing at least 6-8 times your dps and they don't have to wait for it to land before doing damage if they had ranged builds. And if they were doing melee builds, they were probably hitting for 6k (I think that's the damage of melee builds atm?) a swing. You'll barely notice 100 damage on the Scorchbeast Queen.
---
Yep, I notice that often. Even from the non-nuked versions there.
---
Did you check your roof 
---
Just wait until your first Flatwoods Alien. Hope you have some Stimpacks on you for that fight.
---
When I repair things, I have leftover parts. What did I do wrong?
---
You really do? By how much do caps improve? I've only got a level one perk card that improves prices and they're still shit, was looking at my 70 inert flux's value and I was thinking to myself how much caps I'll get when selling it but the prtotectron thought it was only worth 2 caps -_-
---

---
A few tweaks. Gunsmith because heavy weapons tend to break fast.
---
With ghoulish I rarely need stimpacks in a nuke zone. Also handy for farming mutations.
---
Superduper helps with everything. So does chemist (but I forgot to add that one in) 
---
Part of the reason I don't care is because my stash is basically full already, I don't really have room for more resources. And I don't make my own ammo because it's goddamn everywhere.
---
in all my enclave hoping i never found good x01 mods but i did see like 2-3 different serum recipes that i didn't bother to buy :D 
---
I use the +2 int to counter my marsupial, as I only run a 50% class freak for how my build is.  Otherwise maybe recon? or the living targets one? 
---
Super duper.
---
Damn dude, that stuff is stellar. I hope some day we'll be able to design like that! A big thing limiting us is our lack of blueprints.
---
I just got a furious one.   Saving it for the king in belly of the beast.   Really wish they had more damage AND durability.
---
It only spawns one deathclaw...
---
Definitely not that great. 
---
Handed out 2 Level 20 brotherhood snipers with 75 .308 ammo for each.  2 players were getting slammed with mole rats and figure this would help so crafted em 2.  Also handed out a level 10 Metal armor I created for a guy playing on his own.
---
I thought they all required a Voice of Set as part of the materials for it.
---
It looks like one of the camps that exists as part of the game's landscape which must've taken you one hell of a lot of planning and building to make work. 
---
Beats the hell out of my 3 storey brick block of flats, that's certain üòÖ
---
They do. You need the original to craft another one. 
---
I have not seen any plasma infused or cyro weapons in the game. I hope they add them in a future dlc so it makes the guns have a bit more variety. 
---
This story is just full of shit lmfao.
---
How is it compared to pistols, cuz I don't feel very powerful with pistols
---
Don‚Äôt make the mistake of assuming most people 150+ automatically go buy duped items. 
---
If they were to fix the Targeting HUD, I'd like it The Most.
---
I've been doing this since launch (inviting randoms before logging off), but after working great for awhile, I've not had anyone accept the team invites for a good two weeks. Not a single one.
---
A few days ago, I was actually co-operating with a guy but not in team with him, both of us using mics, sent him an invite after we parted ways and I was logging off but he still refused. Since I had seen his CAMP, I went to him in person and said 'Im logging, want the workshops?' and he took them.. if I had some way of telling folks WHY im inviting them to team, it would be easier to be a benefactor :)
---
Police Academy movies?
---
Oh trust me, most of my camps look like that too :b But this area really inspired me to want to do more. Sometimes you really just gotta sit down and put in the hours and just think about it.
---
Or don't cause it's not necessary at all, nothing wrong with a cozy little compact home either.
---
YO' all dwellers in da house! Every single one of you that own a self found TSE weapon rise your hand please !
---
What's wrong with it right now?
---
Did it actually crash the server?
---
Report your local dupers to the IRS lol
---
I might well give it a try next weekend. My camp is south-east of the ATLAS observatory and build smack in the middle of an area of road. Still puzzles me how the Scorched keep finding it. Not nearly as much as I was confused and terrified when I went to hunt a Mirelurk Queen and was met by it- and THREE Scorchbeasts. Not my happiest moment.
---
does it stop explosive shotgun? 
---
They really should just make an exception for the lowest level one, it's not like you can upgrade to it.
---
Preaching to the choir my friend. 
---
yes, you can make the ground level out of bounds, its about 3.5 stories below and above where you place your actual CAMP device
---
im saying its not a sphere since the height/depth limit is uniform around the circle, it is a cylinder
---
Pistols are very powerful if you are going for a vats build, if you build your character properly, you can fill your crit meter in three shots
---
I'd love a hand scanner door.
---
And FFS can we get a fix for the floating error message on bases?  No matter how simple I build every time I move "cannot place, is floating".
---
A scorch is coming right at you with which appears to be wielding a fire axe.  you kicked his ass with your big iron and when you looted him, he only had a... switch knife.
---
Playing with people makes more or tougher enemies spawn so that might help with getting xp. Also higher tier enemies, based on their prefix like feral&lt;charred&lt;glowing, give different xp.
---
You're missing the part where the energy weapons can also have the same legendary effects, and that was assumed in the comparison.
---
Oooo where is this located??
---
Only works Intermittently right now.
---
I just grinded at Whitesprings golf course. Especially during nuke events there. Just gotta get a hazmat suit
---
someone give me the discord link please 
---
Go to whitesprings and tag some ghouls. Have a higher level finish them off and you‚Äôll get to level 50 in no time 
---
yeah once I made the discovery of -50 fall damage legendaries I put my home base on top of senaca rocks 
---
Ooo - do you happen to still know where that is by any chance?
---
I hate it.  I'd love to store up a few mods but it's 100% pointless.
---
Go craft some ammo, GOODBYE all mods.  I didn't even bottom out my steel, had 100 left.
---
Oh no! Uranium Fever is really stressful. It popped when I was exploring the mine for the first time alone around level 20, and suddenly the whole mine is full of level 40 Glowing Mole Miners by the dozens. I died about 10 times. It's not really fun for people if someone doesn't really want to work together. Plus, I imagine a lot of 76 players are fans of older Fallout games, used to playing alone, and might not be totally up to speed on the conventions and etiquette of multiplayer.
---
I am so sorry for anyone who I bothered before my buddy and I realized that my mute button doesn't work. üòÇ
---
There definitely seem to be some oddities with team vs. area vs. auto. What I've noticed is:
---
\- If everyone you want to talk to wants to talk to each other, they all have to be using the same setting (Team/Area), or Auto. 
---
\- Auto doesn't really seem to Auto right. I still have to manually switch to whatever people who walk up are using in order to talk to them. For example, if I'm on Team, I can only hear my team (if they're on Team) and have to switch to Area to hear anyone else.
---
\- Area's area is actually pretty small (we noticed if we were on either end of the Thunder Mountain Power Plant, we couldn't hear each other on Area).
---
I have Googled around but can't seem to figure out how to use push to talk. All I'm getting are old articles saying that it's not a thing. Is it a button on the headset itself or a button on the keyboard on PC? It didn't say in the controls or anything in the settings menu in game, and I couldn't reset the key binding (at least from what I could find).
---
Wait, is my mic mute the Push to Talk? So I need to have Push to Talk on for my mic mute button to work? WOW, if that's it I feel dumb!!
---
Based on the wiki and personal experience none of the effects are in the game. Minus incendiary because of the perfect storm. 
---
Hey, is there any chance you still have that explosive suppressors? I think it'd be a good support gun for my medic friend.
---
Disliked every fucking YouTube videos promoting dupe glitches. If the Blizzard Diablo community can do it to Diablo Immortal, we can do it too. Fuck these dupers!
---
ahh i see, should i go for the recon one then? if i switch from my sighted weapon will an enemy still be highlighted?
---
I've got my fingers crossed hoping civilization comes full circle and gender assumption is okay in 2077.
---
Good for you man, fuck these guys. This is a game. Not a jobsite.
---
Nice! I think i am going to give this a whirl then. Thanks for all the feed back guys! 
---
+karma
---
Title Gore + TL;DR
---
"Rose Sucks"
---
I agree, I wouldn't protest a little more damage but it's a pretty strong choice to melt a little SB health. Durability is bad even starting at 200%. Plasma flamethrower though, my new best friend.
---
Heavy guns put out a lot of good burst DPS at range when compared to normal rifles of comparable level, and the downside to balance that is that they are not as sustainable through multiple engagements. That's on purpose. You aren't supposed to use heavy weapons exclusively unless you really double down and get a bunch of lightweight ones I guess. That is the strategy I've heard from people who have successful min-maxed heavy gunners. They use multiple heavy weapons and swap them out when they break.  I have a gatling plasma cannon.  It tears shit up at medium range, especially if I practice good fire control and feather the trigger rather than spraying and praying.
---
Plasma cores are basically free to craft and needing to repair the gun is the only real limiting factor on it's use.
---
Depends.  Do you like to use your AP for bashing/power attacks/bash/jetpacks? If so, it's not. 
---
Otherwise it totally is. 
---
There are both of those in game. 
---
Sit at whitesprings for a while.
---
Shoot every ghoul you can, not to kill, just to hit, then run towards the friendly robots and let them kill the ghouls.
---
Alternatively, do the same but through run the car park and blow up the cars, killing your self but the ghouls to (don‚Äôt have any junk on you if doing this).
---
Repeat a few times, you can either wait until another player comes along and the ghouls respawn due to that or server hop.
---
Could also try robot hunting on watoga, especially if you‚Äôve finished the mayor for a day quest as the robots will be friendly u til you shoot them individually 
---
Moth_person_. We're not savages
---
Maaaaaaaaa‚Äôaaaaaaam anyone else come across that robot
---
*cough* recoil *cough*
---
I'll suggest this to the team. Thanks Jamesp
---
Funny enough, it was during B.E.T.A. when I grabbed one at level 10.
---
You haven‚Äôt seen many legendaries then.
---
This is a list of links to comments made by Bethesda employees in this thread:

This is a bot providing a service. If you have any questions, please [contact the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ffo76).[](#AUTOGEN_TSBREPLIEDBOT)
---
I've got a level 30 vampiric 38. automatic rifle that I get 3 or 4 crits out of an entire magazine that rips through lower level enemies. I usually hold onto this whenever I go into the forest.
---
I crashed today right as I was farming legendaries and a decent one happened to drop. Before I could pick it up: "Disconnected from Server". 
---
This post cracked me up :'D
---
I swear to god I haven‚Äôt seen them, I honestly don‚Äôt know if they exist in fo76
---
Okay, first of all you need Cheat Engine loaded up and installed. Having it running in the background triggers a server-side switch that will make this process easier. It helps (But isn't required) to have a 'lag switch' that will let you force a disconnect.
---
Then you have to craft a huge number of items - around 300 or so. The server will limit you to 250, so you can get around this by handing off some to a friend. Once you've made the 300 items, store them in an object in the world. Then quickly take them and place the item you want to dupe in the container, and hit your lag switch. When you disconnect and log back in, you'll have both the 300 items AND the item you put in the container - but a duplicate of the item will be in the container.
---
Just posting this to spread awareness so a Bethesda staff catches this:
---
I'm totally estimating but you get like 15-20% of the value instead of 1% lol
---
This is a horrifying concept really. Imagine you're a slave forever, and completely aware of the fact with no diminishing of your mental faculties - no mental blocks keeping you unaware. It's a miracle they're not all like "Mr. Fluffy," chained eternally to Miguel's corpse - bitter, acerbic and more than a little insane.
---
I feel for you, a lvl 227 should know better than to pick on low lvl ppl. That to me is just bullying. All these players had to do was send u an in game asking u to drop out of red zone due to difficulty. Not all players are arseholes. I‚Äôm 90+ and no way in hell would I do that to you or another low lvl.
---
Don't spill it plz
---
Current duplication method I am aware of:
---
She is actually my favorite npc, not there is a lot of competition since there are only like 5 with an actual personality. I think its because her voice actor sounds so much like Rainbow Dash from My Little Pony. Every time she threatens to rip my guts out I picture this blue Pegasus from my kids favorite show saying it.
---
I think there is a seed, either character based or server based...
---
I've got a couple friends that nearly every time they go to white springs they pull close to a dozen 2 shot weapons, and up to half of them TSE's.. And I'm level 297 and I've not pulled a single..
---
So back to the "seed" theory..
---
Tonight farming a new spot I pulled a dozen anti-armor weapons, literally every weapon I pulled was anti-armor, radium rifle, batons (two of them) walking cane, combat rifle, everything... 
---
So if you logged in, with a good seed, and farm for 3 hours, I can totally see the average person walking away with insane loot.
---
Which is?
---
I've never encountered a full server in my nearly 200hrs playing on the PC. Either we don't have as many people playing, or we just have more servers....
---
Current Duplication Method I am aware of:
---
&gt;While with explosive shotguns you can almost 1 shot everything in the game, the energy gatling weapons almost do nothing and break after you kill 5 regular monsters only, even with the repair perk activated!
---
That's from the OP. Nice try, but you can play again next time.
---
Gorgeous camp, well done good sir! If anyone needs any camp plans I have a bunch of extras on Xbox. 
---
Sharing this thread with the team. Thank you mate! Have a fantastic day everyone.
---
I've heard the Cryolator is one of the best available, the drift on full auto is very minor..
---
Yeah I just checked in the wiki. They don‚Äôt exist in fo76. http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects
---
The fuck is a cheat engine?
---
I have target HUD on my excavator thats the red outline right? and yeah if so it is  janky,though it also works for my teammates it throws them off like wtf why do I see them outlined.
---
Then you either didn‚Äôt think very hard or don‚Äôt know shit about how the game works.
---
The fight gets exponentially harder for each player that arrives in the area and tags the queen with a shot.
---
So having a level 8 in there with their hunting rifle or whatever puts them at a bad defection by itself, let alone that OP wouldn‚Äôt have been able to inflict enough damage to cover the cost of himself being there let alone his friends.
---
That said it was shitty to kill you and take your loot ASSUMING you actually stayed and fought and didn‚Äôt just cower and hide 
---
For those of you debating between herbivore and carnivore.  I have the herbivore mutation.  I still keep a few ribeyes on me - the +20 lb carry limit still triggers, even though it doesn‚Äôt grant healing or hunger relief.   That makes the choice obvious for me! 
---
Have you not found plasma cores or cryo ammo in ammo boxes? They are in game, just uncommon. 
---
Idk why, but whenever i tried to setup a trade including military paint, OP never replied.
---
Agreed that plainly discussing it is the only way Bethesda is going to fix it.
---
That's my favorite along with the Top of the World vendor. "...think of *meeeeeee.*"
---
Appreciate it. Thanks for the info!
---
Thanks for the info. Appreciate it.
---
Also having this issue... Do any of you know for sure if your power armor set was duped or not? If it has a atomic paint on it? An atomic paint you don't have unlocked on it?

Haha yes, I‚Äôve already found out, (This post was made a month ago) and I‚Äôm the one who updated the wiki, so thanks!
---
Hahaha! 
---
I agree, talking to random folks is fun. 
---
They definitely need to have a note under Push to Talk in the settings that tells you the default button, and/or show it in Controls where all the buttons are described. 
---
I can't figure out push to talk, so I've been broadcasting my giggles to the wasteland for the last week. I play on PC with an Xbox 360 controller (I know it's kind of odd, but I played 3 and NV on an Xbox 360 and it just feels right to me now for Fallout - plus with my broken foot, sitting up at a desk isn't comfy). 
---
When you use a controller, all the keyboard and mouse input is disabled in-game, so Caps Lock won't work for me. My headset has a mute button, but it doesn't seem to work. I wonder if the mute button only works if Push to Talk is on? And I'll switch it on to "push", and off to mute myself?
---
Have a look around, Ma‚Äôaaaaaaaam
---
Full assassins will give -40% damage from players and the sentinal‚Äôs part will give -75% damage while standing still, use the torso mod to reduce incoming explosives damage, and they wont one shot you, using melee it might be difficult to take advantage of the sentinal‚Äôs part but depending on where you are at, you could outplay them and kill them
---
I know those exist, I‚Äôm talking about the legendary effects that add on too the weapon. Like incendiary... come on mate, you gotta Bare with me.
---
It's for the PC, like a debugger tool for your videogame software. I'm not too knowledgable on the matter since I play Xbox One.
---
yikes, is recon a better choice then? Just concerned that it only works when my sighted weapon is on hand
---
Well we already know this isn't primarily Bethesda's fault but the hackers and dupers. And making a shit post isn't going to make it any better. 
---
Go to a Tinker's Bench and make some ammo instead, faster and easier.
---
Well I guess you haven‚Äôt played the game enough lol http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects
---
You don't have to install cheat engine, once you have 300 boards just make your friend trade you anything for more than 0 caps and you'll be disconnected.
---
Ah fair enough, im a console pleb as well so its news to me
---
Whitesprings is filled with personality
---
No but I will.
---
I think you're mistaking the post. For example. A Cryo combat shotgun. Not the cryolator. Or a plasma infused 10mm. Not the plasma rifle.
---
Cheat engine is a program you can run that lets you play with and modify parts of a game that is running.
---
So if Mario has 6 lives, you could change it to be 500 (as a simple example).
---
Many games and anticheat services detect cheat engine or rather cheat engine actually being used and ban users for it.
---
Valve has a slightly different approach than most and bans users an undetermined amount of time after they're detected cheating. This means cheaters have a hard time knowing what exactly caused their account to be flagged for cheating.
---
Definitely hear you on this one mate. This is a known issue and the dev team is currently investigating it.
---
Okay, I'll stop trying to help if you take it as hostility.  O.o
---
Specifically a single "Legendary Super Mutant Primus" will spawn in an area and immediately run away. Had one spawn near Watoga and immediately attempted sprinting across the Bog to god know where, another in Harper's Ferry that would simply run around the town avoiding all conflict with me.
---
Even after completing "Mayor for a Day", some robots in Watoga will sometimes aggro on the player. Namely the ones that spawn around Vendor Bot Pheonix.
---
The Fissure Site immediately west of Creekside Sundew Grove will sometimes spawn an absurd amount of Scorchbeasts, reported seeing up to 5 at a time. Personally have seen 3 spawn from this Fissure at most, don't know if this is intended or not.
---
Yes, fucking exactly. Maybe he just always says ma'am. 
---
Thinks game doesnt have ncp‚Äôs: complains
---
Game having some npc‚Äôs: complains
---
As someone on disability, I know that feels. If you're on PS4, feel free to add me: TheGreatBatrus. I'm on for 10-12+ hours a day. We could keep each other company. =)
---
i love that one
---
So the current duping method is basically taking advantage of server sync issues? I honestly thought it was just a numbers game. Quite interesting to hear.
---
Interesting...
---
Sorry, was completely confused. 
---
Well I got schooled 
---
This is unbelievable 
---
Might be far enough to day they will fix it but they have tried 5 times not and its still the same method changed a bit 
---
R/woooosh
---
Cool, thanks
---
If that is the case it sounds like either Marine or Sturdy combat would be best choice.
---
This is truly sad. This game has RMT. I‚Äôm dead üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I don't want to spoil it, but uhhh...towards the end of the quest you will find out more about Miss Nanny Rose's back story if you read between the lines.
---
Honestly, I think "no human NPCs" is going to be short lived. The other vaults, for one thing. Proximity to DC and known living humans, another. 
---
r/woooosh
---
I think mutations in general are pretty cool. I never played around with traits, but I'd like to see more added. 
---
spoilars ! go find out ;)
---
Lesson learned. Lucky hole every time ammo is needed.
---
I'm aiming for 50
---
The game doesn't know either. I'm pretty sure my main guy has the female voice. I made him during BETA. It's pretty funny when I fall or take damage.
---
Some call me Maaaaaaaaa'am
---
100% agree but i know ill always be hidden bc of being greifed once before
---
Fast travel to events.  I've started doing this and went from lvl 21 to 33 in a couple of days.  I have 5k+ caps and usually get what I paid to travel back by completing the event.  Some random legendary loot is nice too.  
---
Agreed, would buy this if I saw it for sale.
---
Whitesprings can have a lot of cobalt depending on where the nuke fell. There are a few silt bean/neutron pods just down the hill from the west end of the "Artisan Shops" along the north road thru whitesprings. Further west on that same road where the locked houses end you can find a couple more. If the Fluxed plants go further west check outside the fence going towards Safe 'n Clean disposal for the Neutron pods, and sap on the trees. Between the Whitesprings service entrance and the station on both sides of the road as far south as the Whitesprings bunker will also have more. There are 2 spawns of Bomb Berries near the shack for the Driving Range just down the hill from the swimming pool area.  Whitesprings has a few map markers to help orient my directions one looks like a golf hole with a flag and is located between the clubhouse and the pool, the Whitesprings Resort is the massive main building, the service entrance is on the back(west) side of the main building, the Bunker is just south of the service entrance, and the station across the street to the west.
---
Charleston can produce a lot from all the bloodleaf in the washed out areas or Morgantown along the river. These are rarely nuked due to low loot rewards.
---
As others have mentioned nukes around fissure site prime you just need to check the ferns around the trees for Violet. 
---
Where is the location of your base? And can you do a video walkthrough?
---
I will be sure to include this in future posts, thanks!
---
I worked hard on my camp. Its a shame that no one sees it. As long as there is an option for hiding it there shouldn't be to much trouble until someone wants to go and wreck a camp or two for fun. 
---
Yeh right. So you lost some junk and now you want someone to lose their job....perspective...
---
When you highlight an item you are not wearing/equiped it puts ++ &amp; -- next to the stats that are different. If there is no difference there are no ++ or --. 
---
That helps with choosing.
---
Well I had just launched a nuke, so I'm guessing someone had been invited and queued in so when I left, they joined. Sucks, but I still got back in. I've been farming it for like 3 hours now. 
---
I noticed the sketchbooks look like mockups. Are you doing the journal digitally?
---
Thanks for the updated data!! I bulked aluminum and lead about an hour ago and confirmed the data you posted. Thanks for feeding up stash space!!!
---
There is a dev room that has everything in it. It is a physical in game location. I have yet to see anyone on the PS4 or Xbox get into it though. I suppose it is possible. I know the general location of it as it was confirmed by three people now on PC.   
---
Don't ask I am not going to help someone cheat, my curiosity and questions were answered and I am now fine with that.  
---
300 hours in and you don‚Äôt have the ammosmith perk? Lies
---
I like the idea, if it's also paired with non-PVP servers, as well as the ability to choose a server where your camp area isn't already claimed.
---
I have a really good little spot now, and I don't want anyone to steal it üòÇ I would also be very, very sad if anyone ever griefed it, I spent several hours on it.
---
Well, you ever notice that beside each items stats on the right when you hover over them, that there's little pluses and minuses? That means it's either better in that stat or worse.
---
Ay, Bethesda made bases destructible to prevent greifing, but instead made it the way people do the greifing. 
---
Have well over 200+ hours as well and have only found 1 two-shot gauss rifle and an explosive .44 magnum. I'm fairly certain most of the tse weapons I see people running around with are duped. 
---
FYI, check both. The station, and the one near the mayors office.
---
If you're on ps4 and need help getting through a mission or anything hmu. Psn is the same as this.
---
I'm looking at your 140 pounds of inert flux and thinking I'd nearly pay to not have to carry it.
---
I paint the images on paper and scan them, then digitally add them onto the mock up. Then doodle on it with my tablet. So.. kinda. Sorta. Partly.  The paintings are all on paper somewhere now though.
---
Oh. Oh yeah. Yeah, I'm like 99% sure the same thing has happened to me, but not all the time. My guy is from the BETA too. I wonder if it's a known bug ...
---
Who the fuck said I dont? 
---
Luck?  Karma?   I finally saw them again at Watoga‚Äîwith Phoenix‚Äîtonight, and I am level 88.  So they‚Äôre not level-limited.  
---
Damn, I would if I hadn't just nuked whitesprings! I just farmed it for like 3 hours, I'm tapped out of resources
---
Damn, I‚Äôve got 2 extra wetsuit plans but I‚Äôm on PC
---
It happened to me, when I finally got on the SBQ wasn't dead yet, she had only gone through one heal, but I got 0 loot from her when she did die even though I dumped a ton of ammo/damage into her.
---
One of the shortcomings of the current system is it doesn't tell stuff like armor piercing, ammo capacity etc.
---
Interesting point. Maybe move vendor perks to intelligence?
---
*cough hear that bethesda
---
I love this idea, a fun alternate to the syringer.  I love utility-focused weapons, and would certainly carry a Crossbow if I could shoot AoE charges primed with Rad Away, healing, debuffs on enemies such as flashbang to reduce accuracy.  Great post!
---
Do any rifle perks count towards the xbow?
---
The part about the slugger perks, if you want to max damage output then you will want all of them ranked to the max, that extra damage is useful against enemies that have a lot of health, and against the scorchbeast queen, it is good to have the most dps possible, people dont use them all because in a lot of pve situations, the extra damage doesnt make a difference (no need for extra damage if you are already one shoting a lot of things or if it doesnt turn your two hits to kill into one hit to kill)
---
Dude, that's exactly what I was thinking. 
---
I did some testing just to verify they were different(they are), but I didn‚Äôt bother trying to figure out the math to find exact percentages
---
/r/totallynotrobots 
---
I want someone to die fuckhole.
---
Wow, dude I server hopped for over 60+ hours at whitesprings. I can't enter the bunker anymore because I get PTSD when I see it. But I only manage to see &amp; buy 3 recipes myself. Without my friends who helped me jumping I would have never gotten them all.
---
Well I am no game developer, and I‚Äôm assuming you are not one either, but I would take a guess that a game this big, with as many internal systems it has, and players it needs to support, the issues will take a considerable amount of time to fix. Which is fine, and I‚Äôll wait, because I have seen it at it‚Äôs worst during launch. I know it can only get better. But I don‚Äôt expect it, nor do I demand it to be done immediately. The game doesn‚Äôt owe me anything, and could‚Äôve been scrapped the minute people were complaining about it, therefore I don‚Äôt feel entitled like most. In fact it has given me more of the franchise that I enjoy. Why does this mentality only exist with games? I‚Äôve seen several terrible movies, and heard many terrible albums, that I‚Äôve paid good money for, by artists that are very respectable. But if they are bad I don‚Äôt sit around all day fuming about how it was bad. At least the game can be fixed, you can‚Äôt fix a bad movie, or song. Do you tweet your favorite musician and tell them why their song sucks and what they should do to change it? Do you make sub Reddit‚Äôs about Jackson Pollock and how his art could be done by a three year old? It‚Äôs all a form of art, therefore it‚Äôs up for debate, and not meant for everyone. Lastly I wasn‚Äôt happy with my cabinets (not shelves), and this situation is different because I had a say in the blueprint, I had a say in how I wanted my expectations to be materialized, and I had to put money forward for a service to my specific vision. Then it was wrong and in turn had to pay more to fix it. So it‚Äôs not like they are charging us more to fix it. Game devs ( Bethesda in particular) never asked for anyone‚Äôs input, and wasn‚Äôt making one thing for one specific person. They were making the game regardless, and maybe you spent money on it, or maybe you never played it at all. At the end of the day...flat rate for something that will continue to evolve and grow for no extra cost. 
---
You also won't have 300 boards after duping, maximum of 254/255 (ths limit), sometimes you can get left with 30 boards, sometimea with 90, it is tied to how often is your progress saved, which can be changed through .ini files, probably.
---
They just look phenomenal. Can‚Äôt wait to see the rest! 
---
I looooove this. Start a fo 76 web comic lmao xD
---
There are A LOT of servers. Think about it....max 24 people or whatever per server, it's not like there are less than 100 people playing. Most likely they are big servers that fit multiple little servers, who the hell knows, but there sure are a lot of them. I've only ever encountered the full message when I am trying to join a server with a friend.
---
Recon only works sighted, the other options are :  
---
Sensor Array - +2 Perception
---
VATS Matrix Overlay - Increases Vats hit by 10%
---
Internal Database - +2 Intelligence  
---
I prefer Database and if I could ever find the plans or a mod for my T-51b I would happy as that PA would be finished off. 
---
Yeah but they are one dimensional. They have a few lines but you never really interact with them. Rose is one of the few they you actually get to know and learn how they think and feel. 
---
This is why a text chat would be incredibly beneficial in this game *sighs*
---
As it is, not many people use the text chat mod.
---
Your post just illustrates how poor workshops are. 
---
In the same amount of time you could have picked up a couple of gym weights and scrapped a hunting rifle or two and made 3x that ammo. Especially if you have the 80%+ ammo Perk and  Super Duper. I'm rolling in 5mm and have never needed to take over the munitions factory. 
---
I like the Hornwright Digger AI that unlocks the mother lode events after you help her
---
I play with my Dad too. We are worlds different in the way we play; I'm a crazy lady, and he's very very cautious. I love it even if we're just hanging out at his camp. High five, Vault Dad! Can't wait to launch a nuke with my Dad. 
---
Imo being griefed by getting trapped in another persons base is a worse alternative
---
not trading my jet pack for anything, lol
---
&gt; ga
---
What? The entire game is a buggy, incomplete and unbalanced mess even if you ignore dupers.
---
I don‚Äôt atm but I find it again semi-often so it‚Äôs got to be a farming location for me 
---
Nice!  I'm level 26 and ventured east tonight and did uncanny caverns, but once I saw the scorch beast flying around, decided it was time to turn around.  Will try and make it to Harper's next time.  I must say, it really blows only having 2 faction vendors in the west side.  They really need to either up the cap limit or not have every vendor of the same faction drop to zero caps at the same time because I'm still walking around encumbered every time I play, checking the different train stations, waiting for the damn caps to reset.
---
Well. I actually have a Fallout webcomic though [https://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/deathclaw-desu-ga/list?title\_no=82535](https://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/deathclaw-desu-ga/list?title_no=82535)
---
Just don't use it solo and you should be fine my dude
---
Am i supposed to un-MIRV the Daisycutter? I compared it against a normal Fat Man today and was definitely unimpressed with Daisy... 
---
Found a herd of devolved radstag in just the right cluster, dropped a MIRV..... they all survived... I'm DemolitionsExpert5...
---
It's weird when people buy things when the seller has an infinite supply...
---
How is it not their fault? They could at least acknowledge it.  This is poor planning and worse adaptability to cheating methods easily learned and executed. The evil dupers did not force Bethesda into releasing an unfinished, buggy, unstable game - and I say this as someone who loves playing fo76 despite that! 
---
There's no light...
---
I mean... if you scroll down to the comments you'll see that there's split opinion in response to the video, and the person who made the video acknowledges that the experiment isn't exhaustive and 'this calls for further testing'.
---
Some people have made the argument that the budget cost of crafting decreases, but this doesn't necessarily mean all items are evenly affected. It's possible that turrets and crops and crafting benches don't adjust because they're high value (crops, crafting benches) and high performance impact (turrets). Maybe Bethesda doesn't want us ever using a lot of those. So what we need is for someone to basically mass produce a variety of objects across different level ranges, including floors, walls, furniture, decorative pieces, instruments, etc.
---
But all that aside... . The bottom line for me is that the system is opaque and there are a lot of opinions coming in citing different evidence. So I'd really prefer direct feedback from Bethesda on this one. They made the game, they know exactly how it works and what might be idiosyncratic or even a bug. 
---
I don't think it's too much to ask considering that video exploring the issue was made two or three weeks ago and has almost 20,000 views. It's clearly on people's minds. :P
---
Until Bethesda buffs or reworks any other nuke area on the map... Whitespring or Prime are the only two places worth nuking.
---
The only exception is flux farm, but that's not what you're after.
---
Hopefully the new update will bring us a way to properly play as a raider rather than just someone who kicks down kid's sandcastles
---
True enough.
---
Hi there, just curious on your train of thought. What do the developers have to do with real money sales of in-game weapons?
---
&gt; Well I am no game developer
---
You should just stop there. Because everything after that reads exactly like a naive teenager. Or someone with no object permanence. Who thinks the game just appeared out of thin air broken at launch. What about the months and months of development, testing and QA before that? Why do they get a pass on apparently not bothering to check the game before selling it just because you don't seem to be able to look back into the past before it hit the shelves?
---
&gt;But I don‚Äôt expect it, nor do I demand it to be done immediately.
---
Like this. Imagine not expecting a working game at launch.
---
What he said.
---
From the company that said canvas bags couldn't be made?
---
Bethesda is full of liars. They lied before release and they lie after release.
---
The stash size is an obvious artificial difficulty put in the game otherwise you could just pick up EVERYTHING, set up your CAMP and never need to go hunting again.
---
Not sure. I have Push-to-Talk disabled so I constantly mute my mic with the physical button it comes with when I don't want my background (ie: rl conversations) broadcasted ig. Seems to work just fine since no one has ever been able to hear me when I have it muted. Can only assume maybe your mute button is broken?
---
It's so limited though. Being able to see the actual stats side by side is a million times better.
---
Please site reference because I did PSN plus is a copy and past from the terms of service. 
---
If you‚Äôre got to spit shit out like an NPC  have a little meat to your argument. 
---
I guess if you really wanted super mutants hit up at the NIRA West-Tek area maybe squeeze in Emmet mountain.   
---
Mole miners is ash heap so nuke welch I guess or Mt Blair area maybe.   
---
Honestly if not farming the queen or dropping on springs or nuking players camps for fun I go after certain fluxes and drop where I will get the most or the best yields. 
---
It's against the terms of service for every game but still happens. 
---
The best you can do is report it to the developers where you see it happening. 
---
You can easily server hop if you want that workshop. Poor guy was probably just shitting
---
Nice to see someone just admit this and move on, +karma to you my dude.
---
Watoga high school and monster mash are great as well. It's for higher level players...I just ran it at level 107 and it was a breeze. Remember trying in my 40's and it wasn't super easy. Don't forget about the cat house above Bolton golf course either. I am able to loot it every 24 to 48 hours and get a hefty supply of plastic after I drop the cat bowls.
---
Grahm thinks otherwise. 
---
How is that scummy? They captured the workshop, no one intervened and they just simply took advantage of something the game implemented. Besides, Bethesda clearly knows people are doing this. Im sure if it was a huge problem they would‚Äôve fixed it 
---
I am level 103 now and still get Assassin's Rolling Pins.  I started respecing my character to take points from STR and focus them into Luck for a Auto-rifle style build and as my luck was going up (currently 9) I got my very first Medic 10 MM auto Pistol.   So after 200 hours, I was unable to get some of the good stuff until I raised my luck.
---
I'm willing to bet your buddy has high luck.   I still have never found a two shot, so we will see what happens once I get my luck to 15.
---
I have a 10mm machine gun that does fire damage and that worked like a charm. Even if he jumps, he still takes fire damage for a few seconds.
---
Like, this game isnt new at this point. HOW is this game THIS shitty? Between this error and "connection failed: times out while waiting for server to respond" I'm fucking done
---
Garbage game is garbage. And it's clear Bethesda gives no fucks about it 
---
Don‚Äôt worry about that one. It looks cool with the fire effect but honestly? In terms of actual performance, it‚Äôs not very useful. Fire damage doesn‚Äôt stack and that gun spits about 6 bullets a second, each one doing more damage than the entire fire DoT. So the fire DoT is really just a pretty visual; the damage boost is VERY minor. 
---
Other quest rewards are nice to wait for though-
---
The worst is the Somerset special. Lots of people get that one as a level 5 gun, and it‚Äôs a legendary pistol (pretty rare to begin with) with armor piercing (very valuable on pistols as they don‚Äôt have any other way of getting it). 
---
Other good-ish ones are All Rise (good chance you‚Äôll be near/beyond 50 when you do that quest), daisycutter (nice if you aren‚Äôt a heavy weapon spec but want to carry a nuke) and Bunker Buster (really only nice if you ARE heavy weapon+explosive spec as it comes with targeting comp already installed. As best as I can tell the bonus damage does virtually nothing)
---
I have friends who could build and program a computer from scratch but can't figure out how to make cookies without burning them.  Don't question things.
---
This isn't what you mean, but the syringer does have some effects not available in other weapons, including the ever useful Endangerol shots!
---
This happens in every loot based MP game.
---
I used to be able to kill the bots with impunity and they would not attack me.  Well yesterday they started fighting back...
---
I just cannot resist the extra words in the name like "Legendary"
---
So odd. The headset is new. Could be a drivers thing or something I guess.
---
Not legitimately obtainable right now.
---
I remember this happening when I was levelling. Only thing I can think of is some mods are level locked ans don't show up until you meet the reqs. Complete guess mind you
---
The other day, this level 80something player invited to team up with him in the red zone. I was like a level 13 at the time. I ignored his request because I know that area is not level 13 friendly. So Im thinking the dude just wanted to get a few laughs seeing a low level get annihilated. 
---
Yeah remove melee if you remove TSE from weapons lol
---
I have a bug where my compass is frequently wrong. 
---
Says im heading South. Check map. I ran 3 minutes west.  
---
Drives me nuts. This is the most ignorant thing for me.  I end up running circles around places im trying to get to. 
---
What's your GT I'm level 103 and can show you around the game if you want
---
Um.. No, can't say that we have those here quite yet.   
---
I'm not being hostile. You were just wrong.
---
At least for .308 and shotgun, it's fluorescent flux which is easiest to collect and pairs great with WS farming.  
---
Great 
---
Yeh cept im not posting it here for copycats and I dont dupe and know precisley how to crash a server through several methods. Lucky I dont do that and once I figured out these methods I did some research- some are well known others 0 info out there.
---
One involves the tinkers bench so your advice is ironic. 
---
It is 100% Bethesda's fault.
---
Fact is if this company was brick and mortars like a department store, you can bet that they would need to employ security.
---
Not advocating any violence but this company and like many others today get away with daylight robbery.
---
Dont get me wrong, im used to Bethesda bugs and I have a high level of patience. Others not so much.
---
At least make it an option.....
---
Like you should be able to make it hidden or visible. But the camps cant get raided...
---
Either free or cost like 6 caps universally...   Itd be cheaper to travel throughout the wasteland. And I'd love to see other camps
---
Gatling Plasma has insane damage, durability needs a buff though.
---
But yea Gatling Laser needs a major damage buff.
---
I turn on every radio I find. :)
---
XBone: Puppetmaster355
---
Will you be on in 6-7 hours?
---
Sorry... if u fast travel to that camp you cant raid it   
---
How is your carry weight for a heavy gunner without any of the carry weight perk? As a fellow heavy gunner, if you didn't have either the Bear Arm, Bandolier,  Ordnance Express, Batteries Included or another weight perks equipped how are you not encumbered all the time from carrying guns, ammo, fusion cores or Stimpacks etc?
---
I use the X01 suite with 2x Calibrated Shocks (+100 carry weight) and max Strength with carry weight perks assigned and I still struggle with it.
---
As a side note I do love using the Pain Train perk. As another person commented the Action Boy and Marathon Runner perk either don't work or they don't work well enough to notice when you are in your power armor. 
---
Which weapons are you using specifically?
---
Sorry I seem to have confused the issue a bit by discussing a couple of topics here.   The first paragraph,  I was inferring to use radaway to remove the Twisted Muscles.  BTW, I succeeded in removing it and then immediately got it back.. and removed it again. 
---
The second paragraph was just a side discussion to highlight the differences between Rad-X and the diluted form.
---
Wasn't Blizzard cool with it for a little while?
---
 Come to Jenny's place where there are instruments, amenities, a 4 man tent with beds and deals to be made. Raiders got to get down too.

No extra mobs...

Almost no legendary mobs...

I am on PS4 but I can‚Äôt use a mic (SO is sleeping). I like doing story missions solo but if you wanna grind events or this god damn nightmare of a golf course sometime I‚Äôd be down lol.

Get the beam focuser and rifled barrel for the Gatling Plasma and if becomes really accurate.

Sadly noobs come on reddit and so many posts talk about dupers like it's mccarthy era all over again.  A DUPER STOLE MY BABY!!!!
---
It will. It'll be glorious. To ruin everybodies day with TSE weapons and their bases. The Raiders will truly own Appalachia 
---
how do you even add people on PC?
---
I can't for the life of me figure out how to add friends in Bethesda client 
---
Woah well I don't want to be a stickler but this issue is close to my heart. Well programmed, entertaining personalities =/= the ability to be manipulated via charisma. I guess there *was* President Eden from 3. Hmm...
---
Were you part of that group that was in the double nuke zone at that event? I showed up and was the guy spraying everything with their gatling laser. 
---
Tales tell of lvl 100+ receiving handmade plan from patrol duty event
---
At least in most other games you can't infinitely clone whatever you're selling for real money in 5 minutes

I used to find a bunch at the medical center in Charleston. But lately I've been getting so damn many from events, which also have the benefit of giving good exp and plans.
---
That‚Äôs happened to me... I had a workshop, I had to use the toilet, I checked the map, no one was around. No one had been around for a while, the whole time I had it. I ran to the bathroom, did my business, and as I was finishing up, I could hear my controller vibrating. I ran to see what was happening and some guy over twice my level killed me in 3 hits with a fucking super sledge. So I spawned, ran back to get my stuff, and he killed me again as soon as I walked in the door. That guy was pure scum to me. 
---
He prolly was a nice person helping u to lvl up. Not all ppl are aresholes üòè
---
Yeah, but the main personality in The Sink in the Big MT is very apologetic about it.
---
Nope, none become available. They only become available if your drop, not place (I‚Äôve verified with placing 8 at once, no one could touch them. Make a great wall, actually, if you want to troll someone, but it only lasts 2 minutes)
---
So how does any of that read duper? Why are you guys so quick to assume everyone who has something decent is a duper. 
---
Is it because hes selling serums  for 500 caps? That's actually an expensive price right now so I'm not sure if you think that's why. Is it because 3 people were in a camp together? Maybe friends hanging out. I just don't understand 
---
I wouldnt bet on it. By the time we get to fallout 4 we cant even assume people are real humans.
---
I was never really one to need npc's or anything like that to keep me company.
---
The lore makes sense to me- apocalyptic event wioes out the population.
---
200 yrs later the scorched obvs got eleminated and the world moves on.
---
Bloodied. 
---
Eh golf club is a 30 minute respawn too, what happens is people force a spawn by logging out and back in. It causes the location to spawn everything again, that way there's something for the new player loading up. If you have a buddy the spawns are almost limitless anywhere
---
It sucks anyway. The blade is great.
---
Did you get it figured out yet ?
---
I really cant believe how quick all these people assume everyone is a duper. Like is a player had literally 1 rare item, they must be a duper. I don't get it
---
Sure sure. I'm talking about your standard protectron/handy model robots. Obviously shit from that DLC or president Eden from 3 don't count.
---
Thanks, aware, I have two accounts making it easier :)
---
Didn't work effectively at top of the world, respawned were erratic and would often be partial..
---
Looks like I am going to be spending some time in Grafton then :P
---
Really appreciate the responses!!
---
I have a speedy bloodied Gatling gun and its better than my two shot minigun in every way.
---
Melee involves much more greater risk, plus require more movement to get to the mobs.
---
I am not a melee build and think the TSE should not be on par with melee since the melee have limits, they should be a little ahead in damage.
---
The VATS on melee should be changed IMO.   Perhaps the vats gives +crit chance and +limb damage instead of the teleport thing.
---
Hm, what places would you suggest for flux farming? Whitesprings for yellow I know, haha
---
It engages PvP as well. So scrap &amp; store your junk before you screw around at a bench.
---
They are nice for low levels. I used to take a bench first thing when i logged on before level 50. For the survival stuff. Purified water, food, stimpacks etc. 
---
I'd probably ruin it if i join, I'll just fly around and one shot everything, I only die if I shoot something too close to me or in high level PvP that I wasn't prepared for.
---
If you have to pay cash for a common weapon you are doing something wrong. Hell between me and my friends we could spend a day duping and hand them all out for free and kill the xbox market.  Hell the duped items I have liberated from world stashes I hand out for free. So so so so so so so many TSE handmades and shottys handed out.   
---
Not to mention the 10s of thousands of treasure maps which may weigh zero but having more than 1k of each causes you to DC a lot so most of those got lost into the world just couldn't stand the DCs.   
---
You can get Thistle from the palace.  (Not whitesprings).
---
Also with the mirelurks, I have gotten the shells from them and those do the same things.  Ghost versions.  So I tend to not pick up body parts from mirelurks now.
---
If you're on PC, I haven't done that quest on either of my high level characters, if you want I can do it then trade ya.
---
Sounds like a griefers dream. All locations to hit laid out in front of them. It could end up in madness, but still a damn good idea
---
I can help doing story missions. The golf course is a lot easier when it's not nuked(as long as you stay away from the clubhouse) and I usually get about the same amount of legendaries so we could try that too. I'm at work now but I'm usually on in about 6 hours or 8-9 hours after that. Add me and you can join me or I'll join you when we're on at the same time.
---
You can't.
---
No, because I work for a big tech company and I realize that all sorts of nonsense can cause stuff to slow down. 
---
I would rather they take their time making a good update, than push a buggy one.
---
I did that already.
---
Humans do what they want.
---
That's for legendary weapons, of course.
---
I just got my first 3* TSE at about level 160. It is a gatling gun and I'm very excited to have it. Before that I only had 2 other weapons with explosive bullets. A junkies radium rifle w/ explosive and an instigating combat rifle. Never used the radium and minor use of the combat rifle. This afternoon I plan on wrecking with the gatling gun when I get a chance to get on.
---
What I have figured out is when I am on my Luck based 15 char with boosted Luck to 25+ the weapon drops are 1x weapon that's random at 150% to 200%, one weapon they were holding thats broken (if they hit you hit it) and a third weapon drop that if not spammed on pick up will disappear and on the disappearing act the entire loot table will change unless you grab any item as soon as your cursor touches the corpse. Very strange. 
---
NO
---
I think they changed it to where everything respawns when someone joins the server and fast travels to whitesprings
---
He probably dropped instead of placed
---
Your ridiculous post that demanded the someone‚Äôs firstborn because you can‚Äôt adjust your shitty play style gave it away.
---
So many things about this game make no logical sense. Like there's a series of robots you speak to and give certain things to let you launch a nuke. That's silly. 
---
I logged off for the night lets meet up tomorrow 
---
Fake news. It removes the paint mod, not your other mods. 
---
Hmm think someone should document all the guaranteed legendary spawns, it's what made the golf club so good, it's has a guaranteed spawn in regular, which makes it better while nuked. Pretty sure it used to have two
---
Also it was the holidays. People are not robota
---
I started doing this after reading that post.
---
I rather have them put out a good update aswell, but there's literally been 0 words from Bethesda on what their plans are this month. Kinda worries me as the game needs a update, all we've heard are that they're teasing about the Vaults and PvP faction stuff &amp; Player Vending but that was in December, but there's been nothing since then and they even made a post about being more open with communications. Maybe I should just wait a bit more but the game needs all the content it can get right, coming from somebody with 400~ hours in the game.
---
I‚Äôm searching ya name but nothing is popping up
---
Yeah I'm hoping eventually we get a worthwhile spot in each zone. That'd be pretty neat
---
Yep. I did actually find 1 rolling pin that was a normal one, around the Pleasant Valley or whatever its called in NW corner of map.   That is the only one I ever found.   I literally have found about 5-6 three star rolling pins and even more 1-2 star ones.   None of mine had any sort of good abilities except one which was mutant slaying rolling pin.
---
However, I started trading other points to go for luck instead and have noticed better items started dropping.  I was 5 luck before and now have 9 luck.   I plan on going to 15 after adjusting my current build.
---
Thanks for the data.
---
Not sure if Action boy is really useful with this information. You get an increase of 10 AP per second to 14 AP per second by using 3 SPECIAL points. 
---
I think I'll just invest them to a better use from now on.
---
Mirv mod is very inaccurate and greatly reduces the explosive radius of each projectile.
---
While the Mirv mod does do more damage if you can hit the enemy with each explosive piece, the normal nuke is far more accurate and easier to hit the target with the giant explosive radius it makes. 
---
Exactly, it was the holidays. Everyone needs a break after a hard thanksgiving.

Check this out. Right Outside the Harper's Ferry Vendor I build my camp beside the makeshift hut that's 2 stories and it's by the trains. You have access to 5 levels from the river to the bas of the cliff at its highest and you can still build up 3 more floors. I just found this out a few weeks back. I told a few people and then all a sudden it was becoming hard for my camping spot to even be placed in any world due to so many people camping there. 1 out of 10 times I'd actually have my camp spawn. Currently looking for another spot. :)
---
Just need people to play with hey
---
Uhm did you just assume I'm human
---
Sure, I agree with your ability to become invisible.  But I have not seen anything about players able to 1 shot another player yet.   I have seem claims but no proof.
---
Let me get back to you on that one. I have a spot cobbleton farms I want to try as it has a huge amount of various crops and plants. Otherwise Harpers is decent, white is good for cobalt yellow cake  and a touch of crimson on the outskirts train station side and the fluorescent from the raydadendron (sp?) Prime is good for violet I normally walk out with 60-70 now when I do a fast sweep. Morgantown for cobalt also but I feel shitty nuking there if lowbies are there questing. I am a petty asshole but I do not want to ruin someones fun for my greed. Though I will nuke the fuck out of your camp if you mess with me or if someone places like an asshole at whitesprings to stop 3-4 other camps from going up.   
---
So yeah I will try and remember to post back to tell you if cobbleton is worthwhile. 
---
[Push to Talk is the final keybind option on PC](https://i.imgur.com/HJfiapX.png). It isn't necessarily something hard to figure out how to use, change the setting to use push to talk on voice then hold the button down when talking. If you are ever unsure of if you are actually talking or not, switch to third person and talk, a speaker icon will appear above your head. 
---
Uranium Fever is stressful when you first encounter it, but this guy obviously knew how the event works and still complained. Stress I can forgive, someone complaining about hit tagging with a ranged weapon for what they deem as a "melee only event" ...Nah, that's some straight up social blindness right there. 
---
Etiquette is etiquette, sperging out at someone because you don't know fundamental concepts of how the game works (So long as you land damage on an enemy, you get loot even if someone else kills it) is far from that. He wasn't talking to anyone except his wife, who he annoyingly screamed at while seemingly deepthroating his shitty "PC GAMING HEADSET" mic, so I really doubt he thought he was in another voice channel, he simply thought that the mic was off when it wasn't and was dumb enough to stay in non-push to talk mode. 
---
I cannot stress enough that if you have a terrible mic, you should really turn on push to talk, it is "etiquette" but it's also just kinda common knowledge of any online game. The only people I ever see using open shitty quality mics are either socially unaware of the taboo or socially incapable of understanding why it's annoying. This isn't endemic of the Fallout community, it's just something I've noticed since day 1 of the game. People don't think about how their fan blowing into the mic might actually annoy anyone else, and they leave it on. It only takes one guy with an open mic to create the phenomenon and in places where a ton of people generally gather, that frequency goes up. 
---
&gt; it would not make the fight harder for others.
---
you couldn't be more wrong.  
---
Encounter it on Xbox surprisingly often when playing with my friends...
---
I get that, but having the live service based on a weekly update schedule &amp; making a post about open communications and then not following through is not the best idea, but then again Bethesda doesn't have the best track record. I just want this game to succeed but it's hard when they don't provide anything to look forwards too.
---
This reminds me of the super smash Bros New Year's reddit post that was like, "Nintendo said Super Smash Bros Ultimate was coming in 2019. It's been 2019 for minutes now, where is it!"
---
I got mine from patrol duty at 100+
---
Awesome sarcasm... after you fix the strike-through..

Prim Slimm seems to have a lot of personality.

And Handys are sometimes able to address you by name. I named my character Ryan Reynolds and the Handys in the vault called me Mr Reynolds 
---
I could stop there, but I won‚Äôt. And those are fair points that I too could have found on a click bait YouTube channel or some shill game rates site. Testing is testing and I‚Äôm sure it was done to some degree. With any test there is the potential for unforeseen results, that‚Äôs why it is called a test, partner. Or it would just be called perfection all the time if we always knew the outcome. Sure BETA is a form of testing, but servers can only be tested to the amount of people that have access to them. So unless you can test to the amount of people that will potentially play that game you won‚Äôt know the true limits of your hardware. Honestly I‚Äôve only ever been disconnected 3 times with over 60 hours of game play. I‚Äôve been disconnected from any Call of Duty, Battlefield, or GTA game than I care to keep track. So in my experience it‚Äôs not that bad. And glitches have been around since Marrowind, Oblivion, FO3, FO4, and dare I say Skyrim? In a way it‚Äôs part of the charm and it still sells games. Skyrim is one of the worst offenders and has sold multiple copies on multiple platforms in single homes. Elder Scrolls Online was hot garbage when it was released, and now it‚Äôs a decent game. No Mans Sky was literally one of the worst games on release day, but they came back, and actually reviewed quite well, and it‚Äôs a better game now. This will be no different. Obviously with no help from you or people like you. Much like your reddit account, you contribute nothing, observe, run your mouth, and expect something in return. Naive teenager SMH

Doesn‚Äôt matter man just need people to play with

I wanted to go there on vacation one year but ground harnesses are expensive

I've had this quite a few times when using the 2x1 stairs. If I use the iron post trick to try to get those stairs to stack, it happens nearly every time.
---
What time zone are you in
---
I thought that was the case when I first got the gane so I named my guy "Crack Head Ned" and was going to role play as a crach head hooked on chems, but after I found out its just our gamertags it ruined the fun and I stoped roleplaying.
---
I can't find your name either

This man defends the duper‚Äôs! He‚Äôs in league with the devil! BURN HIM! I mean, errr, BAN HIIIIIM!!!!

You see how I used the word mean there? That‚Äôs how I meant it when I wrote ‚Äúyou mean folks‚Äù, not like ‚Äúyou nasty folks‚Äù.
---
I was just winding this kid up. It‚Äôs a problem that does need addressing though, but the burden falls on Beth to patch the holes. 
---
Also, no I don‚Äôt see the double standard. Even in the context of a joke, double standard implies I‚Äôm somehow in breach of ethical conduct if I‚Äôm targeting those who ARE (in breach of ethical conduct) with potential bans.
---
The multiplayer context of the game means using exploits or ‚Äúcheats‚Äù puts you at an unfair advantage over those who don‚Äôt do that. Fight the urge, crap on those who can‚Äôt. That‚Äôs the human way dude! 
---
I have the BOS Heavy Combat Armor and it is not nearly as good as Studded Heavy Leather really.
---
I believe BOS Heavy Combat Armor has 40 and 30 for the resists.
---
Studded Leather has 33/66 for resists.   7 points lower on physical but twice the energy resists.
---
But yes, BOS is supposed to have +rad resists, but seems that does not work.  At least was not working for me anyway, unless it was hidden adjustment.
---
Welch station usually has excavator mods
---
I must admit I‚Äôm one of those people. I like nice but tend not to bother when it‚Äôs usually just getting yelled at by prepubescent boys that think they are edgy for being racist.
---
You had an excellent shot angle for that clip!
---
as far as i can tell it is an issue with electrically grounded not working properly with class freak
---
Especially armor penetration, its really important to figure out max damage potential.
---
text chat would be rad
---
Not really what I'm trying to say, all I want from Bethesda is some communications on what their plans are.
---
Add me CommunistRaptor lvl 79 sniper build with a bullet farm in my basement 
---
Sentry crickets sound like a fun fight üòÇ

Bubbles in My Beer is really catchy, alcohol abuse aside.
---
YAAASSS!
---
You need someone new to join the area. Or it could have been a nuke that bugged it, if there is a bloated ghoul in the little pool house/shop thing by the golf club it is a bad nuke.   
---
It is also a good thing to learn if you want to be an asshole to people, it is the raider way.   
---
The games already been put into maintenance mode. Dont expect anything more then keeping the server lights on for as long as people keep buying Atom Items
---
Well that is what Rusty Knuckles mod is for...
---
So don‚Äôt buy em.
---
They can still enjoy the hols, as they should. But communication can still be forthcoming, I'd appreciate even a quick post telling us to hang in there, they are working on it.
---
Yesterday I ran into a blood bug named legs. I thought it was my concentrated fire at first but nope. 
---
They told us we're getting an update this month with a new PvP mode and camp vendors
---
This guy nukes
---
Found a lvl 5 two shot 10mm pistol. So you could say I‚Äôm kinda bad ass.

So if you want to give someone a workshop do the team invites otherwise stuff like this happens :P

Until they explode like a sentry bot, which they did.

(Not at home so I can't check) Wasn't that on the first of the month? Honestly alot of problems would just go away or subside if they had a community agent whos entire job was to keep us in the loop. Granted I can see why they probably don't want to do that. Poor guy would be flamed to hell and back XD
---
It's been a week since the last article describing what they were working on, the one before that was on the 19th, and the article before that was the 4th. Expect another article, statement, or update around that time span
---
I have kind of expected the patch they talked about to be at the end of Jan.  They seem to be adding things last minute so I don't mind the extra weeks to get it close to right by this games current standard. 
---
These are awesome...well done!
---
That must have been terrifying, just trying to collect their loot, then Bang your on the floor and crippled 
---
Lol. Widower now. 
---
Ho boy, we're here mocking people for snapping after being called the wrong thing their whole life again, are we?
---
Added a friend, spawned him in fast traveled him over, nothing. Was about to hop on here and say "nah guys" 10 seconds later I died from being over run lmao thanks for the advice!!!
---
We got an article talking about updates on the 1st tho. That's a week
---
The holidays have been over. And people work holidays all the time 
---
You may want to put what system.  Also I know I don't have powered doors, had grahm 3 times today and none on him. Metal doors maybe, I'm on xbox.

I've found plenty of super mutants that died with a self-destruct sequence like a mister gutsy
---
fashion &gt; all
---
for the 2 minutes you get to fire it
---
OK, cool, I will give it a shot next time. I appreciate the help and thoughts.
---
I agree, I can see how these things would be annoying. I would hope that someone would tell me if I'm being annoying, even if it's just a hint, like "weird, do you hear that really loud blowing air noise?" / "oh shit, my fan is pointed right at my mic!" 
---
I have a Turtle Beach X12 which is "old" now, but it was in the box never used since I bought it new in 2014 and just pulled it out for this game. I don't think it's too bad sounding, but I'm not sure how to tell. It has something where I can hear myself talking into my own ears with my headphone output, which helps me kinda monitor loud noises.
---
Hmm, maybe they should have some kinda mini tutorial for newbies in game on the settings for mics.
---
&gt; Testing is testing and I‚Äôm sure it was done to some degree. With any test there is the potential for unforeseen results, that‚Äôs why it is called a test, partner. Or it would just be called perfection all the time if we always knew the outcome. Sure BETA is a form of testing, but servers can only be tested to the amount of people that have access to them. So unless you can test to the amount of people that will potentially play that game you won‚Äôt know the true limits of your hardware.
---
Yes it's called stress testing and you don't need a live playerbase to do it.
---
&gt;And glitches have been around since Marrowind, Oblivion, FO3, FO4, and dare I say Skyrim? In a way it‚Äôs part of the charm and it still sells games.
---
Sure spells good news for people expecting FO76 to be fixed.
---
&gt;Elder Scrolls Online was hot garbage when it was released, and now it‚Äôs a decent game. No Mans Sky was literally one of the worst games on release day, but they came back, and actually reviewed quite well, and it‚Äôs a better game now.
---
So you are prepared to give them years beyond release to sort it out?
---
&gt;Much like your reddit account, you contribute nothing, observe, run your mouth, and expect something in return.
---
The only thing I expect is for people who don't work in software development to act like making a functional release is some arcane secret that no one has figured out. Here's a tip, it isn't. Bethesda are just historically shit at it and for some reason people who have given them money find it acceptable.
---
This is so cool! Thank you for sharing!
---
Look for the ingredients:
---
- Steel: Raider PA
---
- Black Titaniun: Excavator PA 
---
- Ultracite: Ultracite PA (obviously)
---
All three PA models have mods without prefix. Guess, in Fallout 4 it was easy because it always meant Raider PA. But in Fallout 76 they implemented Excavator and Ultracite and here‚Äòs the mess. Just like a indie-mod-team in a hurry.
---
Must make Blue Steel face while shooting....
---
Just because hate boners want that to happen doesn't mean it will. ESO wasn't put in maintenance mode, so this won't be. You don't have to worry this game isn't going anywhere
---
Hunting rifle does shamefully not have a legendary counter part
---
In a karmaless world where all the evil comes from within, I appreciate the sentiment lol
---
No words on update but they have time putting atom shop content
---
They should allow an extra MOD slot for power armor arms that turns them into unarmed weapons when you're not holding a weapon. Like built in weapons. Anything from spikes/blades to powerfists. Even built in range weapons could be cool and interesting 
---
Nope. Come across Ultracite and Raider PA mods too without prefix. It‚Äôs all about the ingredients. 
---
He's right
---
Not really, considering they told us a long time ago that there is going to be an update on the 15th and even told us the main fixes that will be included...
---
Like when people buy ATOMs?
---
They might not be pretending, you can turn off voice chat entirely in the settings. I had it that way for a while in the beginning.
---
Do you honestly think it hasn't been fixed because they are unaware of how it's done? Or do you think they are living under a rock about their own game and are unaware of the problem? The theory of "the more we fuck the game the quicker it will be fixed" is only applicable if it's something that is less known. All you're doing is continuing to fuck the game even more for no benefit. There's a lot of new players since Xmas on this sub recently. I'm sure some of them would actively seek out a way to cheat, but I'd like to think that most won't and you've just taught them how.
---
Now that's the way to do a camp tour. Well-produced. The camp itself is excellent as well!
---
Bloodied is one of the "chase" effects, so I would suggest that one. But for a 1 star secondary if you can get an Instigating that is best
---
See with the survival aspect of the game I was going to grow crops and sell purified water, until I realized the only storage was the stash book and I just didn‚Äôt have room
---
As stated MANY TIMES since weeks that Is not correct. Raider PA and Ultracite came along also without prefix.
---
You're talking like this is a new thing lol
---
I looked through your album and laughed out loud at "Jesus godray workbench".
---
Sorry. I‚Äôm a Jerry Irby, Nails in my Coffin guy all the way.
---
Bright Headlamp
---
He was sneaking up on you the whole time. Chameleon!
---
Could you send me a link to this? 
---
i‚Äôm on xbox and thanks for linking the post ! but i do think it‚Äôs a bug too which really sucks, it made me take a break from the game until they update it some more. but yeah i‚Äôve never went into a trade menu with another player just simply logged on and many of my things were missing from the stash 
---
Nope. 
---
They did give an update. Next update is on Jan 15th and they revealed some things in the update already.
---
HOLD UP i found two of them at the clubhouse, unless they were bag drops.
---
Black Diamond is better IMO if you are not a melee-focused build.   the +1 strength = +5 lbs, as well as extra melee damage.
---
The weight of the Black Diamond is 3.3 (modded), so not only is it effectively 0 weight, but also reduces overall weight by 1.7 lbs just be having it.
---
Mine does 112 base dmg and swings much faster than the sledge.   Helps when trying to stagger those mobs.
---
They should also not suck damage-wise but thats how it is.
---
Oh, that's would be really confusing then.
---
I thought I had seen raider PA mods but in all honestly I only shop for X01 PA mods in bunker so I proabably wouldn't have noticed anyway.
---
Thanks for the heads up.
---
If that‚Äôs the case, are unnamed mods for ultracite PA mods identifiable based on being scrappable for ultracite? Makes sense to me. 
---
What‚Äôs the pay? Is there a medical plan? I‚Äôll do it, nothing you fuckers say bothers me! 
---
Was working on getting an explosive build going and pumping points into demolitions expert. Is this now the only perk that buffs grenade launcher damage? What other perks should I be looking at besides ordnance to lower the weight of all these 40mms
---
I'll friend you, and if you're on 2-4 hours before when you made this post originally (time zones are fucky, it's 2:30am for me) I'll drop ya a newbie care package.

Once you figure out what kind of weapons you're gonna use (either type or what kind of ammo they take) leave a comment here and I'll build ya something nice. 
---
Hush, do you want them to nerf it?
---
_thats alotta damage! _
---
Workshops are the pvp areas of the game. Besides that, Prickett's Fort, and Monster Mash, I guess are the only 3 pvp activities. Come out with the presidential event already
---
i think it's really stupid that you cannot upgrade guns in this game.
---
If it's anything like "the blade of bastet" you can modify it to a Higher level.
---
Ammo stash should have it‚Äôs own separate stash box and weight on top of being able to sell and scrap it. Nuff said.
---
I guess so. 
---
Supply evidence, since they already have future patches planned. 
---
Its not so much that I wanted the workshop as much as it is that he was sitting there getting materials while other players were (hopefully) running around and working for them. Just didnt sit right with me.
---
Im also fairly certain he wasnt just dropping a log, I sat and watched him for 5 minutes or so before shooting him, and even after shooting him, he still didnt respawn for quite awhile after, but I dont know how long it takes this guy to crap.
---
NWS just did ü§ôüèΩ
---
Could you provide a link to this statement? I've seen nothing about a update on the 15th.
---
If it‚Äôs all just shit and gets you all up in a tizzy, why do you troll so hard in a FO76 sub intended for tasteful feedback and shared experiences? Odds are you are one of the click bait IGN shills that haven‚Äôt even played it. Considering how you say it‚Äôs such shit, why would you continue to buy their products? Which again leads me to think you haven‚Äôt even played it. 
---
Idk about the pay or medical plans but I do believe we aren't allowed to cuss. You gotta be family friendly. Afraid that your application has been denied lol
---
AEDT 
---
You can also buy hem off Grahm at any level. Just Rng if he has them for sale or not.
---
i wish they would remove durability like in skyrim and fallout4.
---
you already have a depleting resource (ammo)
---
this is like spells in RPGs both having an obscene mana cost + long cooldown.
---
do one, not both.
---
Right?  Just like when the Institute was duping people.
---
plasma and energy arent the only weapons who break fast. miniguns are in an even worse state.
---
I dont think Bethesda had the idea of people sitting still without competition to earn materials. Workshops always were intended as PvP zones, and in a way, thats exactly what happened.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/6Gmr5HkkEgOY2k8qyey4M8/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-december-19-2018
---
It only says mid january here, but I'm pretty sure at some point in some post they gave a specific date of jan 15th. That would be a tuesday, which is when they usually put out updates
---
Also if you want to get technical they did actually release word on an update on the very first day of the year
---
Need some sort of white flag emote, for defeated players. Want e it about indicating you just wish to collect your junk, if the victorious player hasn't taken it already
---
If you mod DaisyCutter and put the standard barrel back on it, the weight drops from 6.0 lbs to 2.0 lbs as well.  I aim very badly with that MIRV unless I am up high, so it works well for me.
---
The *seller* might have an infinite supply, but not the people buying them. *Until they themselves start duping it ofc.*  
---
Infinite supply just lowers prices. Even without duping, there'd still be people buying and selling.
---
Their lvl...
---
That would probably get a "Huh" and subsequent "WTF!?!" as I blew up.
---
Triple scorchbeasts like that
---
fucking remove weapon durability already.
---
I'm in CST in the US it like 2AM here 
---
MIRV mod its a little deceiving.  The damage listed is for each small explosion it does.  
---
Also removing the MIRV in favor of the standard barrel brings the weight down to 2.0.   So do that and be impressed again.
---
I understand the frustration. I guess I'm just used to things taking a while where I work, so I am a little desensitized to how long the update process can take. 
---
I don't work on games, but I do work on a giant piece of...software, essentially?...that gets updated multiple times a week. We have plans (internally) about what we're going to do with it for the next several years, plans which have been leaked to the public. So now the public is expecting these things right-now-please. 
---
Unfortunately, our weekly maintenance, testing, and "keeping up with changes" updates eat up quite a bit of time, mostly because of a bunch of essentially bureaucratic "handshakes" that have to happen between various teams. This includes ridiculous levels of secrecy, where teams play a giant game of "telephone" to test various parts without knowing all of it, in some attempt to avoid leaks and media frenzy due to our rabid fan base.
---
This means that an update (that took the lowest-level "pawns" 20 minutes to make) regularly take 2 weeks to fully push through, to ensure it's not breaking anything for all of the other components and teams that their update interacts with.
---
Like I said, I don't work on games, or for Bethesda of course, but it might help kinda put it in perspective.
---
I, too, am really excited for updates. :) but I feel like this already came out relatively soon after the last Fallout, compared to previous ones, so I'm pretty gosh darn happy.
---
A spokesperson to help keep the fans updated would be nice, but I would also be worried about what might happen if something became harder to implement than initially expected. We run into this a lot - we'll try to make some update, everything is broken for unforseeable reasons when it's "plugged in" to the rest of the software, and as a result, that update is scrapped and restarted. I would feel really bad for our users if we promised something on a specific date and weren't able to deliver due to unpredictable issues.
---
Same. I have it at level 10, wish I'd known
---
Mod not headlamp mod
---
I miss the head canon I had from previous games that you got a discount not for dressing smartly, but for getting changed right in front of them.
---
Neat!
---
I can‚Äôt find the one where they said the 15th,but I have this one. https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/5te3GDsV1eOM2YOKoyWoI6/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-1-2019
---
qq pvp server
---
No problem
---
Shit. Oh well
---
I would like to be able to make some curved walls, like the bunker style as well.  
---
Still a bit confused with recon, so if u use your sighted scope and highlight an enemy, does it go away when u swap to a melee weapon?
---
&gt; why would you continue to buy their products?
---
I won't. Unless they prove they learned from their mistakes. But I doubt they will if there is a big enough market of useful idiots who don't realise what a subpar service they are getting.
---
I'm also pretty sure none of them would take a 25 years old clipboard's spring
---
Ahhh
---
It wouldn‚Äôt have mattered, I had 1000+ scrap steel on my character. Still scrapped the mods that were in my stash. Goodbye T60 calibrated shock mods üò≠
---
She‚Äôs definitely among the worst of NPCs, and I can‚Äôt stand her voice. But if you read between the lines and pay attention to the holotapes in the questline you find out exactly who and why she is what she is. 
---
Which still makes her incredibly annoying, but slightly less so.
---
"THIS GAME BETTER NOT BE PAID TO WIN"- Says the duper who dupes items and sells said items.
---
You can fast travel from buildings and CAMPs (so long as they aren't already in game marked as hostile towards you)
---
Where do you get the dress?  Been looking everywhere and no luck yet.
---
I got your left arm
---
no, screw you, i want to struggle my ass off with a weak crowbar, a 10% durability 10mm, 5 bullets. and my left leg leather armor.
---
Wait, why does a ghoul there mean it's a bad nuke??
---
Yep, still good. Thanks 
---
Very useful. Curious about normal armour and what effect the AP regen has on legendary versions. it might get super confusing though if different armour has different amounts (leather/metal/combat etc) or its via weight. 
---
I'll start worrying if we don't see an update by mid-Thursday. The last couple weeks were short due to holidays, and they're pretty random about the day of the week. Then if they want to update consoles at the same time as PC they have to do it less often because their xbox/ps4 patches tend to be huge.
---
There was a small [New Year's announcement](https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/5te3GDsV1eOM2YOKoyWoI6/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-1-2019) but it gave more info about new features &amp; DLC than it did about fixes.
---
Depends if you have a Bloodied build. If you do it is easily better, if you don't then using the Bloodied Super Sledge is basically the same as a non legendary Super Sledge (until your health is low from damage), so Executioner's is better
---
i like to go into whitespring resort itself
---
that shopping center is magical, the nuke doesn't even rattle the paintings on the wall.
---
What. You trying to put words in my mouth and call me a duper?  
---
For all I care is that people are paying to win and the dupers don't seem to give a damn about the game's (or any game really) health as long as they're turning a profit.
---
Well, we're waiting
---
In the bog it's not really that important though, since it's pretty flat and open.
---
Sweet I‚Äôll be on tomorrow afternoon sometime 
---
what weapon?
---
three star legendary mobs don't drop anything.
---
Er.. I just use the trap pressure pad with garage door actually.  You can enter through the door faster than it can close so its a nice way to walk up and it automatically opens. 
---
Just be sure you make one on the inside via a window for powerline.
---
It was a joke. Glad to see your first reaction is take something as a personal attack.
---
You're meant to start the responders questline at the church, that leads to the airport, which leads to the hospital, etc. That questline ends around the top of the world and you start the raider questline or the free states, but the free states requires the raiders to be finished before you can  get too far. 
---
Have you gone to the top of the world?
---
Hell, I joined a server and it was the first time I saw a nuke drop and the server crashed 5 ministers after. 
---
Same here 
---
Here are some tips to stabilise and lose some weight:
---
* Eat a high-protein breakfast.
---
* Avoid sugary drinks and fruit juice.
---
* Drink water a half hour before meals.
---
* Eat soluble fiber.
---
* Drink coffee or tea.
---
* Eat mostly whole, unprocessed foods.
---
* Eat your food slowly.
---
Yes! Its so god damn annoying. My friend got it after like 30 minutes. Meanwhile ive gotten every other stupid mutation, most more than once, EXCEPT the one i want, have been farming for hours upon hours. I shouldn‚Äôt have any other mutations as i clear them each time with a decon shower, so i don‚Äôt know what gives. Really pissing me off though.
---
So then why do you troll their products sub? Just to be a stereotypical internet douche? Because you‚Äôre killing it right now. Yeah bud just idiots, because they don‚Äôt agree with you? I forgot we are in high school. Naive teenager.
---
Wish there was a way to scrap legendary weapons since vendors give you like 2 caps for a legendary.. Might as well be Mike from pawn stars
---
Grahm also walks up to the ammo factory(workshop) terrain from the ski resort. On the north east wall he will turn around and walk back towards the ski resort. you can hear him clearly while being inside the factory.
---
It's reddit, I've gotten quite jaded with how everyone's treating each other.  
---
From pvpers against pvers, to people calling triple digit level players cheats, and to people calling others dupers just cause they're hanging out with their low level buddies or dropping stimpacks.  
---
Shit's fucked.
---
I‚Äôll be on this week. GT The Phanimal
---
Try using the weapon wheel, up? On the d pad, or down i cant remember 
---
I'd love a spiral staircase and better staircases in general
---
I built an "AFK chair" in my camp that I sit in with a note above it written with the small metal letters. I have also AFK'ed in front of the vault, sitting on the benches there, since it seems pretty safe.
---
I try not to be AFK for too long, but since I'm using a wheelchair to get around while my foot is broken, I am a little slower at using the facilities and going on snack runs. 
---
Workshops are PVP, so I don't think you're being rude by taking it. I would be a little upset if it happened to me, if I cared about workshops. I get disconnected too much, so now I just claim them, defend them once, and leave it up to the Universe after that. I don't even build anything (unless I need a stash box or workbench at the moment), so I'm not camping on the extractors personally.
---
These weapons have to come from somewhere, right? I doubt the dupers even play the game anymore besides to dupe and sell. Pretty sure the trade discords are where they get the pieces.
---
Think I actually met with a duper today because I got an okay roll on a 2 shot lever action and he let me trade it for anything on this huge list he had. I mean he had variations of any chase legendary you could think of.
---
Could have just been a mega trader but if anyone sees any 2 shot lever actions with +10% damage while aiming and +50 damage resist while aiming on PS4 then you know who the original owner is.
---
 He also picked up some other stuff I had so I was able to fully kit out in 3 star stuff and did my first silo run. He was a pretty cool guy so I feel iffy about it.
---
The amount of programming needed to pull it off though (in game) is amazing.
---
The illegal micro trasactions are more fair than the actual in game ones.
---
She is a person, sort of, she is Rose inside a Nannybot.
---
He also sells the marquee arrows plan. Don't think you can get it anywhere else.
---
i mean real mods
---
Huh i did not know that. Would be funny if the robots started to panic
---
I've had that one a few times but never had it contested.
---
There's too many fusion cores around for PA users (me) and the gatling laser is to bad a weapon. It breakes after a fusion core or two.
---
It's the one in toxic valley where you have to find the lost kid.  It starts in Wavy Willards Waterpark.
---
1: turn on pacifist in the game settings.
---
2: you're making the queen fight harder and most likely not contributing much.
---
3: your flux is his prize for not turning on pacifist.
---
Some random in game objects can't be picked up. For example, the little oil lanterns are about 50/50. 
---
I don't really get the reasoning behind it.
---
I was involved in killing the Queen yesterday as well! So many players and goons showed up, nothing like the last time. If this was the same instance (PC), I was the guy with gatling plasma (later black powder rifle once the GP broke) and grognak axe.
---
Finally got the rad shower plans.
---
oh? i coulda sworn i got max level gear from this
---
I‚Äôm not understanding the fuss over ‚Äúduped‚Äù TSE weapons. 
---
I thought duping just, yuh know... creates duplicates of an item. 
---
If somebody gets a TSE weapon, what does it matter if they duplicate it? 
---
I was nearly done clearing the mine thats in fire for the responders when the Gabe decided to randomly crash.. Its not tough to clear it.. Just annoying
---
Ah so your in the three-stories club as well, lovely.
---
Yeah, I'd love to see a 1x1 staircase that includes a flat plane.  
---
Like [this](https://www.gamingcfg.com/img/10524/Rust-stairs.jpg) or [this](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwic34rFmNvfAhXQJTQIHYhsCyoQjRx6BAgBEAU&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Frustlabs.com%2Fbuilding%2Fstone-stairs-l-shape&amp;psig=AOvVaw3eJShsJNuL_9XuG7YEnLnf&amp;ust=1546933993073091).
---
All they really need to do is make it so explosive is not armor penetration, but is reduced by the armor as well.
---
you should wonder how hillarious will be the vendor shops once they get implemented and everyone will buy bobbleheads from them for 1 caps each :D
---
I have the Alien Blaster... and its worthless really, just a novelty, a toy.
---
He may not be docile to anyone but you. I was attacked by a team mate's deathclaw today until he shared Animal Friend with me. 
---
Yeah. I've essentially stopped doing most quests until I'm lvl50. It's all events and daily quests.
---
What everybody else says. 
---
If your on Xbox I have a couple of high lvl friends that love to help people out. Just let me know.
---
Someone in another thread claimed you can ignore the map telling you to restart and just go to the end in the cave, dunno if you have to be on the last question step or not. 
---
Sure nerf melee too. No more teleporting vats, and more 3k damage. My explosive weapon does 961 a shot with all perk cards. Melee can easily do triple.
---
&gt; Yeah bud just idiots, because they don‚Äôt agree with you?
---
No, because they drop gems like 'I don't understand it but it seems hard so it's fine they didn't do it properly'.
---
Ikr? Hence why sometimes you'll get griefers, sometimes not.
---
I.e. me personally I carry a little 10mm just for when lobies are around.
---
Also this happened to me constantly at low level until I did some of my own reasearch and GUESS WHAT? I found out about passive mode.
---
Funnily enough when I got what I wanted build and weapon wise, I deliberately gain wanted level of 1000 caps plus just to attract pvp.  But whatever floats your  boat.
---
Same with Blizzard, it's hilarious to read the forum comments every ban wave.
---
Yeah that would be cool.. I use the + vats one, but I don't really use vats that much anyway:o
---
I don't think so.  Consider the implied point; the argument being made is still true if you compare TSE to TSE.  I'm not going to continue the discussion with you though, you've proven to be an unpleasant person to interact with.
---
There is another on the roof of Watoga High School as well. Just take the stairs on the left when you enter. 
---
I was at that one. Decent run.
---
Yea. I like the second style especially!
---
It‚Äôs from an overseer‚Äôs chest.. all the purifiers are. 
---
Fair enough. It's easy to forget that context behind typed words is hard to read. Sorry my dude.
---
This game really needs cool new legendary effects to make it fun for a longer time. Experimenting and getting cool weapons is all the endgame atm, so expanding on it would increase the longevity of the game.    
---
They also need to actually fix energy weapons, both damage and durability.    
---
Also, let us break down legendaries for a chance to learn their effects.. (like the Fallout 4 mod, which was great)    
---
Actually, just go hire som modders, they'll make the game great:P
---
Bravo
---
Sloths have a small aggro field tho, that guy just wanted to kill a Sloth
---
That worked. I don't know how I managed to turn it off in game though! Duh. I should have checked although I don't remember turning it on when I first played.
---
Thanks for your help
---
there was a video days ago about infinite atom shop glitch when i clicked the youtube link the video was removed :D
---
honestly, i don't think it's that much worth. fire damage is pretty weak. 
---
from unique weapons, i think the only actually useful weapon is blade of basted with 50% armor reduction. this is is pretty all-round melee weapon and you can free yourself from running incisor perk (it's level 34+ anyway). Or maybe All-Rise, but you get it little later on (and the last part of the quest is pretty hard, so you probably need a decent weapon for it already).
---
i found explosive 10mm smg the other day and this have been pretty fun. not nearly as powerful as my explosive combat shotgun, but it's awesome against slightly lower enemies (or less armored). Recoil is nearly non-existant, range is great, rate and handling exceptional. and you don't oneshot if you accidentally hit something next to you. Great for saving shells to something more meaty.  
---
FYI: the perk that will increase the damage of SMG-s is commando (not guerilla, like the icons on the card suggest).
---
If you took those ones, wind‚Äôd blow the plywood boards away... (some boards held down by blocks too) about the only logical or realistic thing in the whole game...
---
Nice!
---
Fuck!
---
Sweet man sounds good
---
Very impressive ad libbing on my behalf, I noticed you couldn‚Äôt quote me actually saying that, but no worries. I just thought you had an eye for detail after all we‚Äôve been through. But since you know how to ‚Äúdo it properly‚Äù you should call them, after your shift at Taco Bell, and dropping your sister off at soccer practice of course, and give them the know how pal. 
---
Only issue with any TS is a munted accuracy. It blinds some yet others....have no issue.
---
Mad I‚Äôll add you now 
---
I think it's considered a rifle by the game. 
---
No, the Plasma Gatling is by far, the quickest breaking weapon in game.  
---
I had 200% condition one and it breaks after 1.5 cores for me.   That was able 3 mobs.  I had picked up a minigun and that thing lasted about twice as long easily and it started at 50%.
---
If you're able to get into nuke silos, there are loads of weights in the first area, but the nearest bench to deconstruct is in the section after. 
---
I think it hasn't been fixed because they have no idea how to fix it.
---
What are you worried about? I'd be more worried if they patched an I fell through the ground. Never to get my character back again.
---
Ah ok cool. I knew it was one I got pretty early on and have it on my low level alt
---
It would be nice to have more compact staircases (honestly hate how the only stairs we can use indoors can only be placed in the middle of a floor), but just not the church spiral staircases. Those stairs just do not work correctly and you have to jump up them
---
I like Rose. She is a bit annoying, but that's part of her charm:)
---
I had combat armor, i was ok, killing queen was hard, but I dint die.
---
Now i have leather (bcos i bought vault-tec skin accidetly) and bcos it have hight energy, but low balistic resistances, i get wrecked by all those scorched with guns, who shots only me for some reason (i have 23agility, should be invisible even for bethesda).
---
You can always add filters later, but you can't unfiltered the original.  Wise words from my art professor.
---
Poor Carlos üò¢
---
Do you have a source on this? Not saying you're wrong or anything, just interested in knowing more as I use the perk. If I can really dump it to free up points I will.
---
I'm betting fans would purchase those original paintings, framed. I saw some awesome ones. 
---
I've been dying and not getting a bag drop recently. Only started happening in the last few days
---
Me too
---
If only you could charm turrets and reprogramme them to shoot the camp owners that built them 
---
If you kill him and he is down but not completely dead, can you revive him and kill again? Does this count as kill? Also would that count towards the achievement revive 20 players?
---
Stash/inventory are lists.
---
Anything showing up in world has to have a mesh and skin,  lighting interactions and general physics.
---
All of these things place strain on the server.
---
It‚Äôs part of the reason we drop paper bags instead of items.
---
Do these numbers bypass the slap mechanic in pvp? Is it possible to oneshot a peaceful player without them knowing what hit them? 
---
Mmm, glad his team killed y‚Äôall. SBQ leechers make the experience that much harder without contributing anything. Good on them,
---
I had Mutant Slaying plasma gatling (explosive) and it was a sight to see killing mutants.  Was like a river pushing down trees...
---
Actually you can't. The recipe requires the old gun to make the new one. Same with the Mistress' dress. Its not a big deal, I just wanted to upgrade to 50 and the lvel 25 I originally received was gone. 
---
Thx homie 
---
I usually scrap for ammo, but that isn‚Äôt the point. I had a nice half hour hanging out with the dude and his friend talking while the workshop did all the work. 
---
Still treating ‚Äòdoing it properly‚Äô like some arcane secret I see. There are issues in the game that should have been marked as Sev 1 (aka Showstoppers) and resolves pre-launch. Clearly BGS cares more about making money than quality products so if you want more of the same, triple A prices with additional micro transactions for a game on the borders of being functional then go right ahead. But remember the only reason there aren‚Äôt lootboxes in FO76 is because of the massive backlash on SWBF2 and the horrendous PR disaster of the 76 launch.
---
Game crashed/disconnected four times tonight in a two hour window on Xbox.  The person I was playing with froze/disconnected three times, two of them at the same time as me.  All of this was when at whitesprings, not sure if that matters.  Once was after a nuke, another happened after the framerate dropped to the floor and there was about 300 robots milling outside the main entrance to the resort.  Most nights I average 1 disconnect or freeze per ~90 minutes.  It seems to be steadily getting worse though.
---
If there is some duping trick requiring overloading the server, more people are finding out about it.
---
No thanks, I've tried going up a few already an there seems to be some kinda pathing issue. Like you get stuck at certain areas of the stairs.
---
I‚Äôd welcome someone with a hint of salt. Replying to questions with ‚Äúyour guess is as good as mine, fuckers!‚Äù Somehow seems a touch more genuine.... 
---
Would be nice to have. I have a two shot tesla rifle which does 1 dmg more than a regular one. Would like to know why.
---
Fantastic use of the environment!  
---
ESO has far more players than 76 does, even after all these years lol. has nothing to do with a "Hate boner" or whatever that is 
---
Best is having camp near ghoul spawn, equip cannibal perk, eat them.
---
You can also eat everything that is scorched. I dont know how eating scorched megasloth is cannibalism, but he taste great !!
---
How do you know they are charm immune? You may be effecting it's roboty parts in ways we have no way of understanding. 
---
Wait do you get that from the enclave?
---
That‚Äôs great!  So you run across the first red bridge and Graham should be in eyesight somewhere if he spawned?
---
Or screws from a toy car for that matter.
---
ESO was even more hated than FO76 when it came out was my main point. If that didn't get canned then I dunno why this would
---
Thank you! No where else in this post explains where it is exactly. 
---
if you are on ps4 id love the ammo, started using heavy weapons so i have few ammo
---
He's just... in tents. ;)
---
same with "mayor for the day" 
---
I claimed my first workshop to learn "water purifier - small" which can be placed in dirt instead of water.
---
ESO has a subscription. This game has a ridiculously overpriced "micro"transaction store as its only revenue generation for the game, outside of the already dropped price of the game. 
---
Nice try Bethesda.
---
They can‚Äôt have their cake and eat it. They completely hosed the go live and as a sweetener they promised better and more frequent communication going forward. Then they screwed that up the first few tries too.
---
You can do same thing in grafton, i got there 6legendary supermutants on 1run without reloging≈Ø. But they have guns.
---
I'm actually really low level and I just spawned in a nuke zone one time and decided I'd at least try to get some flux since it's gonna be a while until I can launch my own nukes. 
---
My dumbass hadn't looked it up and didn't know all of my crimson and violet flux was decaying and I didn't have any materials to stabilise it.
---
While walking around I'm sprinting and suddenly BOOM 50 pounds overweight.
---
So that ended up just being a waste of 12 stimpacks in the nuke zone as well as half of my RadAway -_-
---
2 Ghouls, 1 Cup
---
That and he does come up red. Wish they would make it so he comes up as white 
---
 Atom bomb baby, little atom bomb
---
 I want her in my wigwam
---
 She's just the way I want her to be
---
 A million times hotter than TNT  \~ ‚ô™
---
They have 10-20 caps. Kill the rich!
---
ESO has an overpriced store too, don't worry. Sure the subscription gives you some money, but just playing gives you money here. And trust me, that is overpriced shit too lol I played it. I picked up the super deluxe edition which was a 100 bucks at release for 40 a year later. I got to play an Imperial. They charged you an extra thirty dollars to play IMPERIAL
---
Yep, I do actually have a quest to create some explosive bait. But I had to trudge through level 40 mole-men things to get there
---
Wait.... SG equipped stops you getting mutations!? That....explains a lot :( sigh

You can still get strength cards after picking a different special point, by removing or cycling through the filter.

 Heavy and energy weapons were nowhere near as bad in Fallout 4 and they were nothing special in New Vegas. 
---
Fallout 4 derangement syndrome has reached new and unprecedented heights with the release of Fallout 76. People are actually suggesting that the problems with the games are somehow comparable, and that's just not even close to reality.  
---
Absolutely amazing!
---
Okay, so maybe I am on track. I just did Top of the World and have to make some bait 
---
I thought once you exit the vault everything you didn‚Äôt pick up gets magically transferred into your inventory?
---
while certainly overpriced, the MTX's in ESO absolutely pale in comparison to the absurdity that is the ATOM store. There is no real argument against that 
---
Hmm, I have full Heavy Leathers (Except chest) and have 306 physical resist.  The scorched with guns don't seem to affect me much.   Ferral Zombies will tear me up as will the SBs.   Recommend you lead line one of the leathers because even with 15 rad resists, seems to lower rad damage a large amount.
---
The number one most troublesome mob for me are those colonel gutsey... Their armor penetration shred me to pieces.    If I go against 2+, I am about dead in 2 seconds.
---
Hey bud ‚Äúdoing it properly‚Äù was your super savvy technical term. What dev doesn‚Äôt care about money? Isn‚Äôt that the point? No money, no games bud. You don‚Äôt need a degree to know that. And yes I do want more of the same, that‚Äôs why I bought the game, and why I am currently enjoying it....I thought we went over that. Also you lost me at loot boxes. If there is something in a loot box that I want I‚Äôm gonna buy it, because I don‚Äôt have to worry about mom not giving me an allowance or a minimum wage paycheck. Also many devs are following suit with no loot boxes in general, so moot point there guy.
---
Sloths picked up Grahm's trading habits better than other Super Mutants, damn

I take it you're talking basic feral ghouls. I'm talking about Glowing Ones in a nuke blast zone.

First one for the overseers log quest is the one at the overseers camp according to the quest data

Nah, don't think you've played or looked then lol

Weapon creation (what many folks call weapon crafting) needs some serious reworking.

Anyone else find it odd how gun manufacturing with literal trash is so easily done in the post apocalypse?

I like playing against guns, not enough gun enemies in game

Thanks for this, this is indeed the case.

Atom Store duplication method? Dev test room? What?

If this dude does not pick it up, I‚Äôll take it

the last patch added in the thing where your base comes back when you join a server that doesn't have the area claimed already, so you dont have to worry about losing your camp anymore.

LEVEL 102: WHITESPRINGS GOLF CLUB: TO THE GUY WHO NUKED THE AREA: FUK U, TO THE CREATORS OF THIS GAME, SAME THING. TO THE GAME FOR NOT GIVING ME THE USUAL WARNING: FUK U

What the fuck, they pulled this shit again in an online game with no save reverting.
---
I think that during the last server maintenance they have implemented system to gather information about dupers.

What was the location? Can you pm me?

Bounty hunting players 5-30 level. There are tones of ppl who dont know about pacifist. Just kill them and if you feel guilty, throw some stimpacks in their paper bag.
---
I was fighting in one of those defense waves when a nearby player went down and did the help emote.  I rushed over to him just to watch and stare at him sadly as he died...  Because I had no stims left.
---
Yes, it's something we've all been saying for a while. 
---
Why is he scum? You took a workshop. That initiated PVP. Working as intended. Playing the game how it's intended is being scum now? Also, levels don't matter as much anyway..
---
Yes I think we should be able to name them. Its infuriating to have to take them all out, place them etc, then the game inevitably crashes and back to square one.
---
I'm pretty sure I read somewhere they were going to bring something in that would enable us to see what was what, but I may have been imagining it. 
---
That's cool. I've never tried that. I have helped out at defend events simply for the rewards and if I accidentally get a bounty I don't even mind if they claim it it's still cheaper than buying plans and you get XP.
---
I tested this with a friend and indeed he recieved increased slap damage but only around twice the actual slap damage. I still had to shoot him 25-30 times. I don't know if there is a slap damage cap - if not it's may possible to oneshot neutral players with thousands of bobbleheads/magazines.
---
i'm the sword man. giving away low level swords to random low level players. and some stimpacks/antirads and purified water (i get more than i can drink it). i'm level 125 something, in full X-01, with a jetpack.
---
pretty much:
---
One third of the players just run in full panic when they see me. Have heard "please-please, don't kill me" numerous times.
---
Second third of players just kinda stare at me "what kind of animal you are?" even if i tell him "here, pick this up, hope it helps". many are even scared to pick stuff up. 
---
so only the last third are somewhat  "friendly" and are happy with my visit and help.
---
still, every bit helps and even a few hearts or thumbs-ups make the day.
---
very easy solo. It's just running around hitting x about 40 times.
---
As soon as they sell more versatile weapon paints in the atom shop, they'll make lots of money!     
---
Like painting all your weapons gold, or other shiny cool effects!
---
Where can I join?
---
Yeah, New Years just got over and a lot of people take time off this time of year, including programmers.
---
If had to hazard a guess, I would say that any new patch would be another 3 to 4 weeks away.
---
I would go so far as to say that the next patch is quite important.  They fixed just enough in the last patch to keep the die hard players playing.  The next patch will need to do much more if they want those who dropped the game to give it a second chance.  So, it needs to be solid, which means taking time to do it right.
---
If it's such a strain, that could be reflected in the camp budget costs, no? If it costed half as much as a turret, then I bet people wouldn't put so many of them as to overload the server.
---
Same for .44 caliber Somerset special got it at level 5 and regret it, because it ignores 50% of the target's armor  
---
Considering we just got an update not too long ago, it was the holidays, and Bethesda often comments on posts updating them about a feature/issue that will be mentioned to the team, no, I am not worried.
---
Didn't know we were a burden
---
Many devs are following suit because people turned around and said no to it. Now people are turning round and saying yes to $60 early access skinner boxes. So guess what‚Äôs coming next. And guess what that means for people with standards higher than a limbo dancer‚Äôs shoulders. But hey you‚Äôre a guy that is fine with buying loot boxes so that must mean those people that pressured EA to remove them are just shills right? I mean they probably never even bought a loot box so why were they so vocal about it.
---
My camp is next to the Brahmin spawns in water, so i get free Brahmin spawns at my camp whenever i log in, and sometimes when I travel there! Great to allways have +20 carry weight steaks for my carnivore mutant!

Always gets laggy on Sunday, must be the day everyone dupes
---
People are tribal, and it feels good to accuse and persecute the invisible "other".  When people see a bunch of posts decrying and warning of dupers, it goes from yes there's some dupers to KEEP THE FIRES LIT!
---
I didn‚Äôt know that, it was just a thought that came to me after frustration of doing this multiple times
---
Info found [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/acf26a/psa_to_all_new_power_armor_pa_and_future_atom_cats/)
---
Yeah, sounds like you're on track. Once you finsh Rose's quests you get access to a thing you need for the free states and can continue from there.
---
I agree and I don't think this thread helps at all. If cheats want to compare notes on here and help others cheat, they should call it what it is and not pretend they're trying to help the game in any way.
---
Or take all from their bag except for a single container of salt. 
---
Tbh, only mods would bring a lot of people back to the game, especially private servers that people can play their slooty mods!
---
Hm! A *"*much weirder ***bug****"* indeed. Hue hue hue hue- I'll see myself out. ;)
---
No gun damage perks to make the weapons powerful
---
No storage space to keep multiple weapons
---
With gunsmith rank 5 repairs are pretty infrequent, unless you're using energy or automatic weapons
---
I like to use lots of different weapons too for variety, but this is definitely not the game for that.
---
or stack boobleheads
---
i mean, i have. youre insane if you think anything eso offers is worse than an $18 paintjob for power armor, or $8 lamps ffs. 
---
Or put BS crap on the end of videos just to extend it to get another advertisement in there... Like a psychology discussion.
---
Or steel! I'm fairly certain the level 3 safes aren't cast iron.
---
I can scrap a rusty shopping basket to get steel suitable for building combat weapons or scrap a tin can and build exo armour but that 150kg of hardened steel sitting RIGHT there is impossible.
---
Or the cars. Or scavenging robot parts to make robot armour....
---
Wait how is the developers fault?
---
Little bit of a bump, i'm at 9/76 and I probably have at least half of the learnable recipes in the game. I've just started tracking challenges lately and there seem to be quite a few that are completely bugged, including this one.
---
How much does one of those fancy manors go for in crowns, and then what's the conversion rate for crowns to dollars?
---
Once you pick your special point you can cycle between the card types with A and D, or maybe Z and C I forget.
---
Why would anyone want thousands of treasure maps? Thought the loot from them was junk? I only ask because I have yet to use my maps. 
---
Ah, okay, cool. Thanks! 
---
I would also like to see what does a mod do in details, not just a laconic description that does not include even half of changes.
---
even if you know about this issue and try to avoid it, you will eventually  fall for it again either for crafting ammo or repairing weapons, steel is heavy so you cant keep a lot of it on you all the time and whats funny is that the game prioritize your mods for steel more than bulk steel.
---
I had to move all my mods to another character just to keep them safe.

You can craft it. Tinker 's work bench
---
Try capping the ammunition workshop + taking advantage of ammo crafting perks such as super duper + ammosmith. Super mutants/scorched drop it at higher tier areas too.
---
You selling them
---
The robot by the stairs and balloons outside will give you the tape if you missed it.
---
Amazing! :)
---
First time I saw the laser grid I thought I would die if I touch it. 
---
Yeah 800 caps
---
Ps4 here want mine?  Frankly it's 50 but I use rifles
---
5.56 is relatively rare until mid-levels when more enemies spawn with assault rifles. Probably easiest to craft it at a tinker bench.
---
You should get different icons to show up your camp too. For example: home, store, restaurant, raider camp. 
---
ofc take words out of my mouth and turn them to your linking!
---
It makes a whirring noise that rises in pitch until the body blows up, right? That's just the generic robot self-destruct sequence. I've had that glitch show up on super mutants a lot
---
Well not a poster, it was the album cover that I pinned to the wall https://imgur.com/a/IKff3ZN

Mine also must be at a pretty low level because it's pretty shit. I don't actually use it though so that's fine.
---
You are a horrible person, flaunting it like that all over the place.

Do you know how long I have been pulling myself back up those stone steps from the radiated water...  Only to get sprayed at with all those chemicals and such from that arch.. then crawl into bed and go into that very long, deep sleep dreaming of a much later time when I will have to do that process all over again.
---
I dont have a lot of lead or else I would. Thank you though!
---
Processing....
---
Oh when do you get those mods?
---
Not really 
---
Yup. But there is some extra excitement of the possibilities when you run into a Legendary Glowing Radstag. 
---
I'm able to pick it, every time on my main. My son's character got the quest message. I get 22 to 82 stims out of it. Plus a lot of other stuff. I've always just kept part of it, and I stick part of it back in the chest or one of the overseer's chests. I didn't realize other people couldn't pick it and access it as well, until a couple of days ago. 
---
here's the link to my data:

---
action girl/boy work with power armor okay, BUT
---
if you already running lone wanderer, then because of "diminishing returns" actual regen value will not be as great. If you don't run LW, then action girl/boy is certainly useful. Also, consider Well tuned for +25% AP regen, so you might be okay with just LW and well tuned and use something else instead of action boy/girl
---
PS. as with all +% stats, look for flat +X AP regen (mirelurk egg omlette is easiest, net +2AP/sec, need just egg + wood) and you'll profit even more.
---
Look for raider corpses. They have either a frag grenade or gunpowder on them. Other than that, try to hunt down some super mutants or just make some yourself. Then with a bit of steel and lead you can make your own 5.56. Make sure to grab super duper (luck perk) and ammosmith (agility perk) as soon as possible to maximize your gains
---
So just the act of claiming a workshop gives you a BP? Would it be profitable just to take and leave to get a plan?
---
Alright
---
Why not use a different weapon that has more available ammo? 
---
Seems like your problem is sticking with an ammo type that isn't all that easy to come by, even at higher levels without crafting.
---
I got my 2 shot dragon for free. My friend gave it to me after a guy tried to sell me one for 500 caps
---
I am no programmer, but even I know this is probably an oversight on their lines of code. They may want to randomize the types of melee weapons each Scorched will be holding when they spawn. However, they may randomize the melee weapon dropped when the Scorched dies.
---
I make more ammo in 20 minutes with Grafton steel mill and my camp on a lead spot that you would in a couple hours with the ammunition depot and have way less people wanting it
---
Hi, if you are low lvl, swap servers till you find nuke at whitesprings, get an hazmat suit / Power Armor, and hit at least once all mobs you see. That will guarantee you a fast lvl to 50\`+ Then you can get lvl 2 ammosmith, lvl 3 super duper, get the materials and start crafting the ammo. The ammo factory is only good if you plan to make shotgun shells, since you burn trough shells way slower than any other ammo, it is worth taking the workshop. For all other ammo, sell your stuff at vendors for caps, buy materials from players, craft . izi
---
Thanks for the images.  Helped a lot.
---
&gt; I suppose it is possible. I know the general location of it as it was confirmed by three people now on PC.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Don't ask I am not going to help someone cheat, my curiosity
---
You don't even have to mention that at all, I despise any form of cheating in my game, not even interested in simply knowing how to do it for the heck of it. Disgusting, but the fact that it is reachable by physical standarts (glitching obviously) makes me wonder... 
---
Far as I know on the older games that room and ones like it were only reachable via console commands, i'd like to think that people just randomly got spawned into the room in this game via an accidental bug - not actually reproduceable.
---
When you meet enemies way above your level, they were probably spawned by a higher level player who was there first. Try switching servers, you should be meeting mobs ranked 15-25 in those quest spots.
---
Not sure if it's intentional or just poor coding but I've seen that with a bunch of different objects around the place.
---
Sadly, just have to accept it and move on.
---
You really are living in your own head. To you there is never a possibility you could be wrong. Not even once. I was enjoying this little duel, but now I'm starting to think I'm abusing a mental patient. I'm afraid I have to put an end to this little affair. Have a nice life selling your virtual contraband.
---
Hopefully one day. It's not a new issue.
---
Same too with seeing what is placed on the PA frame when inspecting it.
---
Hi, I checked but still no change, Mk2 and Mk3 (Treated and Resistant) can be bought from traders, Mk4 Protective as now is only in two test containers (unaccessable locations created only for devs testing purposes) with no alternative way and Mk5 Shielded is gained from Queen of the hunt event, when you have Mk2, Mk3 and Mk4 already learned (so basically unobtainable).
---
34 for ammosmith and 50 for super duper
---
Same here. Fortunately I happened upon a vendor where some other poor fool had also sold their Blade of Bastet, so I was at least able to buy that and replace it in my inventory. 
---
You can join only in your mind, brother.....and if you update your Reddit flare to show your support :P
---
There is no other Cult of Mothman missions yet but hopefully Bethesda will add some more content in the future if the wise and powerful Mothman allows it.
---
Yeah the robot armour one bugs me since the description specifies they‚Äôre made out of robots.
---
Your test confirms that low-damage weapons suck (not surprising), and furious probably has an upper limit (great finding).
---
To truly test the furious effect though, you would need to craft a weapon identical to your furious version (same base damage output) and time it.
---
You‚Äôre splitting hairs now bud, grasping at straws sort of speak. You‚Äôre talking about EA now, and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a sub about them you can troll. Guy, Girl, reptile.....it‚Äôs about self control and about what you can afford. No one held a gun to anyone‚Äôs head and said buy loot boxes. They are an optional feature, and a feature that is considered gambling, which is another rabbit hole all together. I‚Äôm here for 76 because I enjoy it. Plain and simple. Calling people idiots or teenagers because they bought a game that they like is a tad bit elementary school. Everyone has bought something that someone else has considered to be a waste of money, or lame, or broken, or whatever. We are consumers at the end of the day. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve done just the same. No one can say every fiscal decision they‚Äôve ever made was a success or we would all be rich. I bought something that I like, and I‚Äôve bought things that I wish I hadn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs the way it goes, but maligning others based on what brings them joy is mildly immature. I didn‚Äôt come here to change people‚Äôs mind nor did I say the game was a masterpiece. I just said I liked it, and I support it, and I will continue to do so. It drives people crazy for some reason. Like what you like man. 
---
But carrying it in your backpack with some salt (PERK) works like a fridge.
---
Realistically the.... Freon? Would probably have leaked out in the 200-300 years of F03/NV/4.
---
But 25years? 
---
Oops. :(
---
For easy lead, look for workout spots and gymnasiums. The weights in the weight rooms junk into pure lead.
---
Ah ok awhile away but thank you :)
---
From what I hear - plans are dropped by the Scorchbeast Queen herself. You might be able to find some doing Enclave events, but I don't think they reward with X-01 plans
---
I think there are some weights in the hotel in the first town you go in, you could scrap those. Cans and tin cans also have lead in them. 5.56 ammo isn't common at low level since few enemies use those weapons.
---
Im using a 10mm pistols aswell but im running out of that aswell. thought id ask if there was a way to sustain an ammo type.
---
Its always just the lead for me. I have super douper and ammosmith. I just wanted to be lazy this time. Fuck me right?!
---
It sounds like you're rushing through the game. 
---
Are you taking time exploring each area thoroughly? Often find that quests can pop up from approaching certain areas or activating/picking up certain things.
---
Yes lag and getting disconnected all the time, 3 times today in a 2 hour session.
---
Ps4 marauder3299.  Level 82~ escorts. Fun exploration I'll tag along for generally jappery
---
I tried. So much. But the accuracy on it is poo.  The only way I'm doing damage with the crossbow is if I'm walking up and bashing with it.  
---
Drop the armor instead of placing it. It worked for me
---
I noticed out of all the creatures I have tamed the bears are the slowest.
---
So when you tame a creature it doesn't teleport to you camp it literally has to run there. My bear took like two literal days (not game days) to make it to camp.
---
As long as your budget is still full then you know he is alive. If it drops down again then he got killed but I am sure he is on the way.
---
I did the same. Then I had to invest in Ordnance Train (or whatever it‚Äôs called) so I could carry some mini-nukes. Then found that I kill things far faster with a rifle anyway. :-/
---
Or a server based on langage, or level bracket... basic online functionnality m'kay.
---
Totally Awesome!
---
I enjoy it, but it certainly doesn't draw me in and keep me up till wee hours of the morning like previous titles. I think the biggest mistake, to me, is the lack of storage. I
---
If you picked up those weights the walkway would collapse. üòâ
---
I'm playing, just not very much. F4 turned me into a hoarder and the limited storage is my biggest gripe. Love the Enclave gear though. 
---
10mm isn't so bad if you're not firing in auto mode.
---
I guess it depends on how low level you are.
---
I found that I used melee a lot with small creatures not worth spending the ammo on or for close quarters.
---
Aside from that, I find .38, .45 &amp; .308 most plentiful. Only in my mid 40's levelwise but still can't use up .45 and .308 ammo fast enough.
---
Thanks a lot for the info!
---
Flamer, Broadsider and Harpoon Gun too.
---
Thanks will edit them in
---
tfw non-PA pleb
---
Oh I forgot the laser and plasma gatlings.
---
Dick move but if it's allowed in game without cheating, more power to you. 
---
It's the same as waiting around for someone to die without helping them and then taking their junk. You're not a good human being (especially considering you're meant to be a colleague from the same vault) but it's "fair".
---
Totally agree. It doesn't really add to anything. It's just a poor way of balancing the fact you have more ammo stored up the longer you play. I don't think any level of feral ghoul should take more than a few bullets to the dome to kill. And bugs that tank bullets? BUGS? When I first found an MG3 and M2 Browning and saw how horribly low the damage was I was heartbroken. They shoot .308 and .50, yet have less damage than a pipe pistol someone rigged up in their garage? 
---
You don't actually need any code pieces. Just a keycard. Just look up this weeks code and bring your keycard and that's all you need.    
---
You can also, if you want, try to figure out the code yourself, but it's a lenghy process that I am not able to help you with:)
---
I did say I was not including energy weapons as they don't seem to do much damage but ok I will add them in 
---
I got a Prime receiver for the crossbow. I can make ultracite arrows. 
---
[An earlier comment has it.](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ad6xgr/psa_sulphur_drinking_fountain_at_whitespring/edfi4cs/)

really? wild
---
I won't argue that she doesn't disappear some times but keep in mind her meat pile shows up where she died, not where her corpse landed. Friends and myself have had to spend 15+ minutes looting every single meat pile and corpse in a 30m area before going silent on chat to hear that last source of buzzing flies to get our loot off of her.
---
cmon bruh
---
Dancing queen, young and sweet
---
Lol. My first nuke that I myself keycarded, I accidentally nuked the other fissure site next to it because I didn't discover the prime site yet. Fissure site prime was barely out of the zone but the event still triggered and it was the easiest queen kill ever (this was on the day they fixed explosive weapons and claimed to have fixed duping, so there wasn't a lick of lag either). The sun was out and the PA bros were jumping 20 feet up chunking her health with all their explosive 2 shot shotguns. 
---
I've been trying to use it with my stealth build, since it's silent. It's fun to plink away, you just gotta give up on killing anything in any kind of hurry. 
---
A true man of science!
---
Explosive weapons cannot get explosive legendary, only two shot.
---
Outside of vats the accuracy isn't bad. Havent used TS automatic receivers enough to tell if they are worse outside of vats.
---
Unless there are enemies nearby. I got trapped in someone's camp a few days ago - they must have spawned in as I was walking through and a 2x1 metal box appeared around me. Tried to fast travel out but couldn't because there were a couple of dogs attacking parts of his camp. Luckily he left or got disconnected just as I'd deactivated pacifist mode.
---
Anythint with the name "Gatling" in it, Harpoon gun, broadside, light machine gun, flamer, Auto-Grenade Launcher (?). 
---
Don't get me started on why can't we scrap cars for steel in workshops 
---
Words, i see many words... https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/5te3GDsV1eOM2YOKoyWoI6/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-1-2019
---
But when dismantling one he/she can figure out that the addition of a piece of whiskey bottle and crossing these two wires gives a beam splitter even if the weapon you are dismantling doesn't have that mod.
---
But this pointy screwy boi 
---
Luck has some pretty solid perks too
---
Next time get their name (or look it up in the recent list in the social tab) and then report them.
---
Sucks that it happened to you but if you can't punish the duper in-game (assuming they were one), then at least do so out of game.
---
The fewer duper this game has, the better.
---
I know but apparently the crossbow is considered heavy if that is so work that one out.
---
God I wish we could have mods. I would love to see the Tesla PA from F04 in this game
---
It‚Äôs Ulif, where would I even report him at?
---
I feel like I‚Äôve seen this post before. Can‚Äôt put my finger on it.
---
Aren't the bolts ridiculously heavy?  I might as well try again now that I have all my rifle perks. 
---
This is so cute and heartwarming! Keep doing it! üòç
---
im getting tired of these kinds of posts
---
Heavy weapon player here, so the actual list is:
---
.50 Cal Machine Gun
---
Missile Launcher / Bunker Buster
---
Cryolator 
---
Fatman / Daisycutter
---
Flamer / Pyrolyzer
---
Minigun/ Shredder
---
Gataling Gun (5mm)
---
Gataling Laser
---
Gataling Plasma
---
Ultracite Gataling Laser
---
Broadsider
---
Harpoon Gun
---
Light Machine Gun

In the official guide it states that it is supposed to also include the Automatic Gernade launcher and the Tesla Rifle as heavy weapons but the perks dont actually work on them. This apparently changed since a change was made some time ago (so your AGL still weights like 20 still while using Bear Arms so it is no longer a heavy weapon). 
---
Also not sure if the normal grenade launcher is counted as a heavy weapon. I don't think it is but I am interested to actually know ig you think it is so i know if i have to actually keep one next time i pick one up.
---
I never noticed it being an issue. I craft them and only carry 100 or so. 
---
YET we can pick locks with a bobby pin in our Power Armor. 
---
Or a drill lol
---
Can only offer advice from FO4 experience as I'm playing 76 on the PS4. Steam has an app called CPU Cores available that you can use to limit the game and OS to specific cores. It's not too badly priced and telling your machine to use 1 core for the OS and 4 other cores for the game clears up a lot of stutter i experience gaming.
---
I can build a fusion generator but can't figure out to make one of thousands of vehicles or even a frickijg cycle work so I choose to walk everywhere instead. 
---
When I hear wings I usually try to run/hide because it normally means useless fight with a Scorchbeast.
---
Can somebody explain the issue for me please? I don't think I have encountered this so I would like to prevent it.
---
When you repair guns it uses mods?
---
Really?  I was thinking that there was always a chance for a melee strike to be blocked and this is what was happening.  But it kind does make sense that it's a bug...
---
Wait, they kept that trick from Fallout 4?
---
Stash all your junk and burn their base to the ground, then run round finger guns‚Äôing people to get rid of the wanted :p
---
Doesn‚Äôt fix the problem but you will feel better 
---
Thank you so much shredder gataling gun is that the short gataling gun with max mods? 
---
Agility effects how heavy stuff it? I know bear arms decrease the weight of heavy weapons but I wounder if exsplosives weapons are excluded.
---
Thats assuming the server isnt a laggy piece of shit that makes your AP just not regen at all, or stop regening for no reason for a second then resume. Also love when you stop moving at half AP, but your AP bar keeps depleting until its empty. Very cool, Todd.
---
Just hot-key and drink canned coffee/nuka quantum
---
but lots of the robot characters specifically could be influenced by speech checks, or specific dialogue, so the merchant robots are not out of the ordinary.
---
What's a greifer and what seems to be the problem here ?
---
Oh ho ho...
---
But now you need a second list to sort out what Bethesda considers a heavy melee gun weapon that gets a fire rate bonus from Martial Artist....
---
Yeah, it happens to me often. Cleared the clubhouse just a bit ago and got 7 legendary items. Only one ghoul was legendary
---
My roomate has, but I have been fine
---
I have been complaining about CAMP radius for weeks, now. 
---
My CAMP needs about 20 more ft to be able to have a Junk pile AND water. Right now, I'm stuck using small purifiers because the body of water is too far.
---
Thing is that I never store my stuff when moving. And for a week or so I had this duping but after (I guess) first big patch in November I stopped having these issues. So you mean that basically they ‚Äòve never gone it‚Äôs only my case that I see it fixed?
---
I was able to ignore the resetting map markers after getting DC'ed multiple times during BotB, but I was in a group with my GF who didnt get DC'ed. My map showed the first area, but when we got to the end of Glassed Caverns my quest updated anyways.
---
Haha good luck mate
---
i feel ya. Not sure why I continue to play. Ever since BETA I've had nothing but problems. I've uninstalled/reinstalled/checked integrity submitted tickets asked everyone you name it blah blah blah... still getting freezes every 5th time I get out of my PA, sometimes when I jump and sometimes when I fast travel. Freezes at the worst damn times too. Oh get this: when I get into my PA there's no PA opening up to allow me in animation, I just get in there. 
---
So when I get out, same thing, I just pop out without the animation/sounds... so sometimes when I get out, it freezes. I thought it was TOTALLY frozen but last time I accidentally pushed the attack button my mouse before I alt+f4'd and.. lo and behold, I'm in there alright, I can swing my weapon; but I can't move, can't get out of the PA, can't fast travel... WTF is this crap
---
If you use the printers under the blackboard in the command bunker after the code word has been completed. It prints you out one of them. Nice made sense of it tho.
---
Battle That Never Was, Hunter/Hunted
---
Do it all the time, just be ready to jump in your power armour real quick
---
My theory is that as they are reworking the facial animation system for starfield.  So the no living NPCs are infact robots and monsters that require no lip movement whilst talking. 
---
I know that's the problem. In my commando build for a massive part of the game I was using a auto combat rifle when I realised it was not getting any stronger from the perk. When I made it a sniper rifle and gave it to my partner who had rifle man there was no change.
---
In the forest
---
There is a lot of science that seems to indicate that as humans we are essentially slaves to decisions that our brain makes without any input from ourselves. Pretty creepy. It calls all of freewill into question.
---
Oh I ignore 30% armour? Sweet. What does that mean practically? 
---
  Its a trap!
---
Sounds like a Raider to me :P
---
Thank you for the link. Was very helpfull! 
---
I mean, it's one thing to take over a workshop, that's a pvp zone and to be expected. But to then follow you to your friends camp and do that? What the shit.
---
Equip the weapon and toggle the card.
---
There are only a few invisible effects.
---
But also it's Bethesda, so Martial Artist (increases melee weapon swing speed) really does increase the fire rate of some guns ...
---
Bear arms reduces it significantly!! I literally carry every single one of these and they all weight 1 or 2 each. I also carry 1 single hunting rifle and that weights 18 just by itself. Its lighter to carry every single heavy weapon  with the right perks then it is to carry a single rifle (there are no perks to reduce the rifles weight).
---
Yes explosive guns are included with the bear arm perk except for the AGL. 
---
I believe agility is more to do with your action points (sprinting, jumping, VATS etc) and does not change the weight of items. Strength increases your carry weight but doesn't make stuff lighter.
---
The shredder minigun is essentially the same but with slightly more damage and looks more like a super mutant minigun. I think it takes the same mods of the minigun.
---
Xbox One X
---
There are air canisters than spawn above the uranium ore at Poseidon Energy that prevent the resource extractor from being placed. You can move them by walking over them or exploding them, but this gets frustrating to do every single time you take the workshop. 
---
either there's a minister NPC i didnt know about or autocorrect failed you
---
Really wow Bethesda really need to sort there perks system out. I take its a glitch?
---
Coming to an Atom Shop near you for the great price of $20!
---
Hey are you still searching? There a resdit post, I ll search for the link, where someone found that many cosmetic items are event rewards. And the Asylum outfits are on the loot table aswell. They are pretty rare though. I am currently trying to get a different outfit and I got nothing so far. I am sure I did over 50 events without getting any cosmetic reward.
---
There's also a PA chest mod that increases AP regeneration. It's great!
---
I had to drop mine on the ground to craft more and then pick them back up. That worked. Before that I crafted like 10 hoping it would trigger lol
---
fallout logic.
---
What? Really? I would consider it a rifle at first glance. 
---
Cool thank you so much I got confused by the AGL as you mean auto Grenade launcher but I saw agility XD
---
Someone can zone in to make mobs spawn. Some people still think you have to leave the area for respawn to take effect, which is entirely untrue.
---
No clue. There's been a string of them.
---
At one point the little grenade launcher got buffs from Rifleman and Demolitions. The combat rifle thing you mentioned makes no sense - one of the auto receivers counts as non-auto.
---
All of the above was well known in BETA and as far as I know they have only fixed the grenade launcher.
---
I read the somewhere to and tested it and it didnt reduce the weight with the Bear Arms perk.
---
Me too but according to a site it's heavy I need to check it out to see if it is 
---
Oh sorry, that question comes up a lot and it's more words to type :P
---
I bet you anything they could if they even spent half an hour looking into it.
---
‚ÄúA player, typically in a multiplayer videogame, who does not play to win, but to cause as much greif and frustration for the other players as possible, even to the detriment of their own success in the game.‚Äù  I get it‚Äôs like a free for all so go for it take the workshop whatever we‚Äôll move on but don‚Äôt follow keep killing us and destroy our camp when we flee. Now if we were higher level bring it on. But a fleeing level 7‚Äôs camp attacked by a level 120 was annoying. I don‚Äôt think this guy was playing a raider I think he was just bored and being a dick for fun.
---
Oh man glad the Granada launcher one dose not exist anymore but I can see were the logic in that is 
---
That ok I got there in the end lol.
---
discord link is in the google drive link
---
You can get this from events or even pick it up in-world. The Penitentiary event guarantees a long range weapon plan and was popular, but you can even get it from story quests (along with the lever action rifle, etc).
---
What is greif ?
---
Translation: we are fixing issues that have no place in a finished game and putting some end game content because you don't have any, but we don't really care about the players with multiples millions of each items, selling duped things for real money. Pvp is a joke if you have a explosive weapon and they can't fix that without nerfing explosive to the ground
---
But we better put more and more into the atom shop,while we have still 0 gun paint in the game, 3 paint job in total for PA,etc
---
these are the words i see
---
Thank you all so much for the help. I have a great idea on what to use. Incase you are interested here is a plan on my build for perk cards please look and let me know what you think.
---

---
How many non geniuses do you know that can make high tech energy guns from typewriters?
---
Think it was the Watoga Medical Center that usually spawns one or two legendaries, but usually one star. Also, any event labeled as a horde event always has one legendary enemy as the boss enemy, but again normally one star.
---
The in quotes stuff is the online definition. 
---
I thought you see no words ?
---
Dude I want to use mods, but since the ban wave I'm pretty fuckin terrified of doing so...
---
bird bones+stranger gets very old when you want to jump and then go through a doorway and have to stand in mid air for 10 seconds before you can finally come down (or annoyingly go into pip boy to turn stranger in numbers off)
---
 Biggest secret in the game :P
---
Not being sarcastic either, I was level level 15 before I released you could do that. This is even after watching tutorials specifically talking about it. It is really not an obvious thing.
---
I have 15 charisma, I sell inert at 8-9 caps and raw flux at 13-15 caps
---
I don't think so.
---
My friend Steve the Mega Sloth died when he was shot by robots when we moved to the whitesprings. Poor Steve, I can still see you in my loading screen pictures.....
---
I have shit the sentry bot as well. Almost shot my pants!
---
Why not ?
---
If you're not human, \~aims down the sights\~
---
In Maxson's voice: You're an ABOMINATION! \~Fires\~
---
Can I get a new invite to this server? 
---
The thing is is that you can unlock chest mods by scrapping arms/legs and vice versa.    
---
So dont assume that when you see "mod x unlocked" its for that specific armour piece.    
---
Eg I was scrapping metal arms and got polished, tried to add polished to a new arm but it wasnt there. It was instead now available on a metal chest.     
---
    
---
I have seen them, haven't seen any good ones tho.
---
Random drop chance from doin early responders quests. Got the full outfit. Pics on my page.
---
Pictures hurt the most..I hope you find a new friend 
---
They're definitely on the Harpers Ferry item list too, as I picked some up yesterday.
---
Alpha and charlie too
---
My Dude!
---
5000 halloween candy does not redeem 3* items.
---
Well that‚Äôs what I got, what do you think it is? Because if I‚Äôm wrong I‚Äôd like to know. 
---
It is, truth hurts....
---
Haha.
---
Or my personal fave TIFU: Actually jumping out of your PA in a nuke zone. 
---
That instant Rad buzz sure wakes you up fast!
---
Back in Fallout 4 specifically for armor piercing they were all 40%. There was a mod on PC that showed you the actual numbers. The only difference in the more advanced (or less advanced, if you follow the flavor text) was ammo capacity and reload speed.
---
TL;DR it doesn't matter on the mags and the flavor text is misleading at least in FO4.
---
What truth you idiot
---
Oh my bad. They should be at the Watoga BoS vendor as well then I would guess.
---
Well, at that point you're actively hunting a new player down. I'll hunt people down at workshops/bounties, but to go after a low level for no benefit after they won't buy your items?
---
I bet the exact same thing would occur as it did in F4.
---
Point made, thanks :-)
---
Or when you think you‚Äôre fine because it looks like such a beautiful sun and fun-tasting day... but then it suddenly turns red as the pits of hell and you die instantaneously from rads that accumulated in secret behind the facade.
---
You want to hunt someone inactively ? Is that it ? You want to tell people how to play their game while respecting legit game mechanics ?
---
So if I am running LW, drop AB for something else?
---
Point made for me, thanks :-)
---
Oh man absolutely, it break immersion so much when you see a Scorched shooting a shotgun with one hand, with the pistol sound effect playing, and when you go to loot them they were using a Hunting Rifle the whole time.
---
Ladders as well please! 
---
In a fight with waves of scorched or ghouls hitting you, you will be begging for those APs. 
---
I only use text chat mod due to issues hearing others. So if they try to ban me for text chat i would be very upset. I do believe it wad cheat engine and reshade that was the big no no.
---
What exactly are you looking for?
---
At this point really don‚Äôt know to u see it. I know that‚Äôs kinda hard to understand.
---
Left a definition for ya. Cheers
---
I think it would be dumb if they banned you for that, but I just don't want to risk it. If Bethesda comes forward and says they're not gonna do that anymore, sure, but for now it's a big no go for me man.
---
Sucks cause that mod looks really cool.
---
Hi! Another mod here. The mod you contacted is having internet issues. 
---
In future please use the modmail option in the sidebar so all the mods see your query. 
---

Then he should have built a port a loo, put a lvl 3 lock and gotten inside.  Or gone afk not out in the open.  Workshops are PVP.
---
Good to hear
---
Oh didn‚Äôt know you could do that it‚Äôs stuff like this that the game doesn‚Äôt tell you about 
---
Really? didn't know about the Horde events.  Usually avoided them because they made me run around to god knows where on the map.
---
You should aim for 76
---
Just because 
---
You're not tugging any pickles pal,duh, there is no such word as greif. Cheers.
---
Loved the song, now in my playlist on my phone.
---
I‚Äôm talkin‚Äô to OP.
---
I think it's just saying it's between 0 and -1
---
You have marsupial serum? If so how much? 
---
Will be*. Fallout 2 is in the future of fallout 76
---
Yeah I get that, take my workshop kill me once and let me go. I mean I couldn‚Äôt have defended myself against a level 120 at level 30 and my level 7 friend was less than worthless. Kill me once take my shit let me go don‚Äôt track me down and continue to do it

Even so, your definition is wrong. Unless we are talking about

I couldn't stand it, it felt weird and unnatural to me. Had to get rid of it...
---
I hope you come across more responder oriented players. Lol if people can do it, they‚Äôre gonna do it. 
---
I got a 2 shot gauss rifle from whitesprings a few days ago. It's a lvl 50 one so happy with that
---
Got a a toad which got killed by ghouls, a bear who caught the scorch disease, a Snallygaster who just disappeared (I don't actually know how he died). 
---
My Megasloth was still the best and had him for ages.
---
Put on pacifist mode as soon as you load in.
---
Lol. Its a Bethesda bear. He probably stumled into all kinds of situations while trying to get to your camp... like quests, new caves, bugs...
---
I have a two shot Gatling plasma it hits pretty hard.
---
I server hopped the hell out of a character all the way up to L45, checking multiple vendors.  I must have checked a couple of hundred times, and \*never\* saw the handmade plan or lever rifle plan.  I started wondering whether the experience is different here on the Australian servers, so I directed my PS4 to my own DNS server and manipulated the query results from the game to redirect me to other region servers.  Within 30 mins I'd found the lever action plans (thanks Western Europe).  I never did find the handmade ones and figured that with the level locking it was too late.
---
Grief, Inc....I‚Äôve only ever heard of big shots like RobCo or MedTek. They‚Äôre all the same. And I was talkin about Raiders, huckleberry. I believe we are on the same page 
---
Cheers! Mostly using a pipe pistol ftm (level 4) but I want to go for a more Intelligence/VATs build if that helps?
---
And even if I could have actually engaged in some solid PVP if he was even 2x my level instead of 4. But oh well we just server hopped and had to bitch about it. 
---
Yeah it's not just a failed event.  It's the hundreds of ultracite ammo wasted trying to compensate for lower levels in the event.  
---
My squad can take her down in 3-5 minutes.  Solo with low levels in, I go 26+ minutes just burning through ammo and wasting stimpacks only to lose the event. 
---
Greif, not grief. Grief was never mentioned in this thread.
---
I was in pacifist. 
---
Hilarious. 
---
The not-divisible-by-10 flux is good vendor trash, too.
---
Shucks, I done fucked up my spelling. Believe me, I get it. Hahaha 
---
Yes I was disconnected in the middle of a bunker back to back from two different servers.
---
This will just tickle old Queenie lol.
---
What system?
---
Bethesda: STAY RIGHT THE FUCK THERE
---
I did that today and my game froze on me. I had a sliver of health left when i logged back in then
---
Sounds awesome. I remain hopeful of finding one someday. I have 3 star legendary auto grenade launcher that I've been using forever. It's pretty awesome but I would love to switch back to Gatling plasma if I had a viable one. So sick of blowing myself up üòÜ
---
To be fair, that‚Äôs about as much my ‚ÄúSuppressor‚Äôs Tire Iron‚Äù is worth....
---
The very first time i tried to summon the vendor, it took me literally 30 minutes and i got the long coat on the first ever inventory. I was like "isnt this supposed to be rare?" well im not selling it... yet.
---
Don't get me wrong..I don't care that much haha
---
You‚Äôre my hero
---
https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Greifer  I know it‚Äôs spelled stupid. 
---
 Useful.Thanks for your share. Once ,I am not allowed to bring a noisy generator so I needed something really quiet. I purchased suaoki solar generator a short time ago and it has proven to be one of the best investments I have made in recent history. I got it so that we can go camping and power our CPAP machines. Love it. 
---
The other team killed it in 10 minutes or so
---
thanx a trillzion time ! Any way you guys can at least leave an automated msg on the post for why it was removed ? or even one that says : Removed ? cuz there was no way to know it got auto deleted before i asked a buddy to check the link
---
Just keep creating characters and grinding the cook a steak and boil water quests over and over and you have a good chance of getting it. I have the full outfit and helped a guy get the uniform just the other day.
---
Nah, that's OK, scrapping a crappy mod let me fix a anti-aircraft rocket system, taking down that irritating cancer bat.
---
You should've received a private message from Automoderator. It's set up to do so on this sub. That said, the bot is part of Reddit now and it does have occasional hiccups so this may have been a freak occurrence. Not sure! 
---
Nah in this case OP is just an illiterate whiny little bitch.
---
Rip
---
Well, that‚Äôs the thing: it isn‚Äôt. 
---
So to grief someone for no other reason for being a dick after they refused to buy things that they cheated to obtain? Sounds like you're a real winner at life too.
---
Youll only get either the helmet or the outfit tho so youll have to move one over to complete the outfit if you do get both of them.
---
Building a camp near there is fun for RP though.
---
I call my DC Rupert. 
---
We have a standing appointment Everytime I log on. 
---
One of us dies. One of us lives.
---
I have seen a few people running around with explosive Missile Launchers. Can't tell if they got it legit or not but they are "obtainable"
---
It is global to chat to all with the mod, party for well party chat , clan chat , local chat even a trade channel.
---
Its exactly like the world of warcraft setup.
---
when you fast travel there, you can go to the first gate on the right, but instead of going in from the gate you can turn left and there‚Äôs a hole in the wall. go through there, to the other side of the building, and from there go straight forwards on the alley and you should end up next to a wooden platform where the vendor is. hope this helps
---
When I was around level thirty I fought against a level sixty something. With a two handed melee build, I was able to hold me own and obliterate his ass. 
---
It‚Äôs possible to defeat higher level players if you set yourself up efficiently. I just so happened to have two handed perked up, and things like adamantium skeleton and 2x attack while in sneak along with some gnarly mutations. 
---
But that‚Äôs just my two cents. As I said, I hope your adventures yield experiences more suited to your tastes. Don‚Äôt let it ruin your day. 
---
To be fair, I‚Äôve used the hell out of it from levels 5-30 or so, so I‚Äôm not kicking myself. 
---
I've started taking them all out, dropping them, repairing my stuff then picking it all back up. 
---
Great system when some of the mods cost upwards of 700 caps and a cap stash is 50 caps....
---
No no no, we are talking about greif here, my friend.
---
Has the bottom fallen out of your world?  Drink Andrews liver salts and the world will fall out of your bottom.
---
Seriously, the min-maxing is fucking unreal. 
---
I was thinking an intervention against the evils of video games and how bethesda is really after our souls.
---
Ok I'll try to give you directions..from the fast travel spot, head towards the train you're facing. Go through the gate, keep heading straight. Go between the two train carriages then things open up a bit. Go up the street, you'll see some scorched/mutants/ghouls up by some cars towards the end of the street. Turn left a little before them. There's a propaganda poster on the wall you turn down. Vendor is on a patio to your left. Keep in mind that you may need the gate key or marsupial to go this way, but that's where he is. Sorry if the directions are a bit shit
---
Thanks! I mean I get now where I was in the wrong for being upset about it but sometimes the gaming community is so toxic 
---
If you go to whitesprings don‚Äôt hit the robots  they won‚Äôt forgive you
---
I absolutely love it
---
Would be far better to have the palm reader door and allow any on team or friends list to enter. Use the exact same door as on the service entrance to the enclave bunker.
---
You ain‚Äôt wrong, you just got a different style. Only thing you did wrong to was a spelling error lol and I think the community is often misunderstood (with a rotten few). 
---
Well, I mean "seen" how? Just curious. Did you see a friend Inspect theirs? Because you can't usually see the secondary/tertiary properties on someone else's equipment, only way I know of is to use the Inspect function. Unless they were posting screenshots of their Inspect view?
---
I‚Äôve had a few but just sold or dumped them as I‚Äôm a rifle build
---
Lol poor kid
---
But the pathfinding is a bit odd there. You'll see Grahm coming along the road down by the bus (often after a defend event), but suddenly he goes off the road towards the army base. Then returns to the road halfway towards the docks. It's like he's trying to avoid getting too close to the Lakeside Cabins.
---
I've also done The Messenger event by the same route, and he too does the same path.
---
You need to destroy it
---
Your camp is saved as a blueprint
---
If it isn't attacking you, i'm pretty sure that meant it was stalking AKA being peaceful... and you murdered him ;_;
---
Sounds like the best plan I've heard.  Got my night planned ahead of me.
---
Move it for free or server hop...
---
Was in a nuke zone with someone using it. Was curious what kind of ML he was using so he droped it for me to look at. was a 2 star iirc.
---
One of the first times I ever saw in a game where the monster dropped what it was holding was everquest on pc. Ever since its never made sense to me when different things drop lol
---
You get a notification and if you move to another server your camp stays. If you decide to move it, it's free and your camp is blueprinted
---
Country roads 
---
the only thing i have is my all rise and as long as the scorchbeasts land i can take them out in no time. but if they dont land, it‚Äôs gonna be a problem cuz i dont have one of those fancy two shot explosives, which seem to be even better for scorchbeasts than two handed melee
---
Was going to comment this. I've saved up plentiful amounts of .45 and regularly give my .38 to my friend who uses it. I use a pipe rifle revolver (.45 ammo) and use this to clear enemies (I created the lvl 50 version recently) and it is possibly my most underappreciated weapon.
---
I have a bloodied one. like to play chicken with scorchbeasts  While they are spamming attacks i throw my green shit right back. Usually ends with a crash landing sometimes a splash. But regardless of landing my melee buddy is left tweeking off psycho with nothing to hit lol.
---
You can just log out and back in to switch server. You will find one where there is no base ‚ò∫
---
When I was going scorchbeast hunting in the bog I found a scorched mothman.
---
I have same with super mutant behemond. He lives down in little lake, where this "river" going around my camp ends. It makes nice water splash, when i shoot him with TSE shotgun. RIP Swan.
---
If they are yellow they are on your team...
---
He proabaly picked up too many items on the way back to camp so he is overencumbered and walking really slow :P
---
This. And also it seems the damage they do to you has nothing to do with the weapon they have equipped.
---
I tried once and the sever about died. :-P
---
Price for jetpack and 1 shock?

You're trolling right?  It's getting harder to tell now with all the politically correct and butt hurt people.  Raw food can make you sick. Bad programming just leads to people online bitching about it when a company takes 2 weeks off for the holidays.  
---
I dropped a grognaks axe and some bone shards for a friend. He got bones when all he picked up were shards 
---
2500 Caps
---
Why chemist? Ores and Gunpowder aint chems
---
My problem with uranium fever is the mole miners seem capped at 40. I only ever see 35 or 40 legendaries. Witch is a shame cuz that is a fun event. 
---
Recently played unarmed melee in Atom RPG and would love to have shields for that archetype here aswell.
---
Lemme catch you in the wasteland Tin man
---
well, yeah. the max level a mole miner can be is 40, but they still drop weapons levels 40, 45, and 50.
---
What platform are you on? I have one just taking stash space.
---
Ugh, so much trouble with Sierra Bravos at that site.
---
To the place
---
Whats the bed? none of mine come with linen :( 
---
It's smelted in the chemistry station. It applies to smelting and making stable fluxes. However, it doesn't apply to boiled water. Other than that it increases the yield of anything in the chemistry station. And yes it does stack with super duper.
---
The one time I turned it on, i walked up to a vendor and within 20 seconds a guy yelled into his mic that there's a line and I need to hurry up.
---
"Simple modern bed", quite a few vendors sell the plan. 
---
So you bullied a kid into crying for you to stop? And now you're flaming the parent for asking you to stop? 
---
Watch out folks we got some kind of bad ass over here or something
---
Any idea where protected drops from? Guessing I need to learn it before shielded will drop.
---
my pit was full of rad rats, but sure it was the same one as yours 
---
cheers shovel was there
---
about 150 steps
---
This is the only reason it really annoys me. I don‚Äôt hate the game because of it, it just bugs me.
---
Chemist also stacks with super duper when making flux.
---
Less of an issue in this game but you can also spam VATS to check the ground for frags mines, etc. 
---
I have an explosive combat shotgun but has a shitty range, those fucking things never land.
---
But i never used the all rise with them, i have to try.
---
Interesting 
---
Immensely. It literary annoys me to no end.
---
Where did you tame your and what level wa sit and what level were you?
---
Yeah, I just wasn‚Äôt 100% when I posted that it affected super mutants, so I just went with my gut.
---
If are looking for something different you can always do the Order of Mysteries questline. Unlike the other main quests this one doesn't lead naturally into it (as in the main quest line will actually direct you to all the main factions but this one doesnt). I had finished all the other quests a long time before i accidentally stumbled onto this one and it felt like it should have been done much earlier on.
---
It can be started by heading to southwest of Charleston and finding the body of a Young Woman.....
---
The HS is filled with higher level ghouls. You can get up to 140 plastic per visit, but it's a much tougher fight. Morgantown HS is much more economical despite the fact that you only get about 1/4 the plastic. 
---
The HS works better as an xp farm, with the plastic being a bonus. Going there solely for plastic (especially if you are a shotgun user) is a mistake since you'll use up that much plastics worth of ammo, and you wont get any lead since there are very few robots in there if any.
---
Right, because all of that atom shop stuff is definitely being added and wasn't already leaked in the game files on launch. I guess the only logical solution here is to retrain their whole art and design department to stop making skins and go fix their mess of coding instead
---
From what i experienced. Weapons are absolutly not balanced!
---
For **killing mobs** you want *Super sledge with double damage if enemy have full HPs*.
---
For **queen** i would probably pick *super sledge with armor penetration*. (yeah there is 75% from perk, but she have sooooo much def) Or if you want strongest damage build is **bloodied**. Check it on youtube.
---
I currently have 4\* machete with 40% swing speed. Mr gustys are 3hit same as super mutants. On queen, i cant tell, we farm it, so i should have data, but it is so lagy and sometimes i dont see any gray damage, and sometimes like 10% which is not real with 170damage wep (well maybe if its 3x from stealth, we still dont have exact number of her hps). 
---
I would like to know, which perks affect unarmed, becouse i have anti-armor knukles. I see only that 20% damage from one perk, dont know if it gets bonus from 75% armor pene perk.
---
Off is the general direction in which I wish you would fuck, grammar nazi.
---
If you're on PC and ever see me about wave me over. I'm always happy to help. I am often loaded down with goodies lower level folks would love.
---
If you go extreme on the melee glass cannon build and have ideal gear you can hit up to 16k-17k lol
---
even all rise probably wouldnt do the trick if your character build isnt a melee build, i have power armor, 15 strenght and all maxed out two handed melee cards and its still nowhere near a one shot job, still better than anything else i‚Äôve tried so far
---
When you enter fort defiance there is a board with a note on it that starts the Brotherhood questline. I don't know if you can interact with it before finishing up with the Free States though.
---
You can put on a prime receiver, which uses ultracite 5.56 ammo and deals the same damage as a hardened receiver with the added bonus of dealing more damage to scorched and scorchbeasts. But if you mean an actual ultracite handmade (like the ultracite laser/gatling laser), that does not exist 
---
There is a ton of lead in the gym at the Charleston fire department, and a workbench two rooms away. I think you can pull around 120 lead there.
---
So what i'm wondering is i got a leggy zealot ultracite lazer pistol. it does 30% bonus dmg to scorched and is ultacite do the bonusses stack ?
---
Oh I get yah, GTAO gave me trust issues of low level players too! Legit game mechanics keep breaking my legs when I fast travel, i think I've developed Stockholm syndrome.
---
Yes, and from what I have learned so far is Scorched beast queen drops plans for those. I have learned two so far and it will teach you the associated ammo you need to use for that weapon (For .45 and for plasma ammo) and have fought a SBQ 3 times total. Your mileage may vary.
---
Sorry, i uninstalled this travesty of a game weeks ago.
---
I don't think it does, I had it on and it still showed X1 when crafting, not two. 
---
I don't think flux counts as "chems", they're junk. Super Duper stacks with Chemist when making blood packs and stimpaks etc. 
---
Helping new players get oriented is my mission in life. GT: JetUnicorn9613. 
---
Send a team up request any time you see me online. If I don't reply, try again later -- it just  means I'm playing with someone else at the moment, and while I try to remember to check in when my teammate logs out, sometimes I get distracted. 
---
You get nothing
---
That's what I would say while I develop the tools to punish dupers too.
---
I have around 4k 5mm ammo I'm not using if you have any 5.56 to trade?
---
For the love of god if anyone has any spare powered door plans (not garage doors) on the PC please let me know.
---
Graham never has them in stock when I am looking for them. Name your price!!
---
Hmm so it's OK to be illiterate, nice try. Keep the day job.
---
There is a Perception perk that allows you to see the resistances of an enemy in VATS. The shield means the ballistic resistance, that's what you reduce. That's also why melee weapons are OP. 
---
I'll double check but on that same run OP is doing I come out with between 2100 to 2600 lead scraps. 
---
Shooting someone's camp up is pretty shitty, but I agree that they shouldn't be letting a 9 year old play mature games.
---
I got lucky the other day and spawned in to a nuke at whitesprings with the no radiation bug. Best nuke zone yet
---
People have turrets at their camp?? All my budget is consumed by posters, rugs and nice stuff. Psss. Go away turrets taking up my camp budget xD
---
A nice looking house with a prison on the side!  Dream vacation home for those looking to get away from it all! &lt;3
---
More reasons you should not be able to log in to a nuked zone without warning
---
Me too. I kept it for trading and when repairing your CAMP you don't get any warning!
---
Or you can eat it as a good source of water. You need the lead Belly perk though 
---
Hancock loved that. üòè‚ù§Ô∏è
---
I can get 100+ plastic just from Morgantown HS gymnasium...so if Watoga is a tougher fight for the same payoff, Morgantown is much more economic.
---
Just keep making and scrapping the lowest level combat armor arms... it will unlock ultra light on the chest eventually. 
---
Because that's how I did it. 
---
even 1 nuke usually crashes me last time i heard 3 nukes hit the same server it crashed fallout
---
There is a priority system when crafting and repairing, say you want to repair a gun or make some ammo, the game will take steel first from your loose steel scraps, then break down mods for steel if you don‚Äôt have enough loose steel, then it will use your bulked steel last, so if your holding X01 mods don‚Äôt bulk steel and always make sure you have tons of it available as loose steel scraps
---
Scrounger perk in the Luck tree, but be aware that you have to hit the "search" bottom (Y on Xbox) to actually trigger the perk. It works on all ammo boxes and some duffle bags. 
---
Jeeze what a pair, dump the old xbone on your SO and get a new one for yourself.  Chivalry is dead.
---
Most weapons are viable with the correct builds for them.  I just down one with a normal pump shotgun earlier.  Good at crippling it.
---
Sneak automatic rifles are probably the quickest next to heavy weapons.
---
Do you have a geiger counter? 
---
yo this is sick holy fuck, well done bro 
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre on, been grinding a couple weeks hoping for one
---
It's an impressive feat that the 9-year-old is not the immature one in this situation
---
Well, I used to be an overall balanced heavy-gunner. And then I took a supersledge in the knee. Long story short: from what I saw, heavy guns damage output is still lackluster when you take in consideration the need to spin it up to even start to dish out damage and the fact that it breaks after 4-5 tough enemies. The damage should be much higher at least to justify these drawbacks. Why would I even bother to use it if I know that my trusted sledge or a good rifle/shotty will cope with any task in a much more efficient way?
---
So, as I mentioned before, it's a balancing issue that needs to be fixed.
---
Possibly servers down in your area, if haven't trief again already just give it 30 minutes to try again.
---
Well you still get the stat bonuses from eating plant foods and visa versus. 
---
There have been a few reports I‚Äôve seen today of a bug involving other mobs acting as robots. One user here said they were experiencing super mutants that made the dead robot noise before they blow up. 
---
Explosive splash damage works on floors/walls. Flying beasts aren't affected, that's why when she lands she take massive amount of damage, because you shot explosive on her feet instead of using VATS. Best way to deal flying damage is to use sniping builds from far away, trying to trigger crits+stealth damage on her head through VATS.
---
&gt; I've been downvoted into oblivion for saying this before but it's gotten worse with every patch
---
I won't downvote you, but correlation is not causation.
---
It's got worse over time, you are assuming that's because of the patches.  Maybe, maybe not.
---
The issue is even with both hydraulic mods the dmg with unarmed PA is under 100, it's medium speed and has no access to legendary modifiers
---
You can't fast travel if you're over-encumbered though.. 
---
&gt; I‚Äôll check my wifi connection.
---
Wifi is shit.  Use wires.
---
I never have actually taken the time to look at the actual benefits you get with certain foods.
---
Think it's time to do some more Googling. Thanks...
---
I mean, it would only apply to junk.  There's no real reason to have mules with thousands of every type of junk on them and it causes issues with server stability so if you not being allowed to carry over 5k of each type of junk (which is still a metric shit-ton of junk) is the line in the sand for you then idk man....
---
The problem is... i don't have a built for any kind pf weapon
---
I would give you gold if I could, the illustrations are so beautiful, and I love how you really got into the lore. Actually, you've inspired me! Me and my SO are now thinking of starting new characters and making a journal of our adventures
---
They're clearly conflicted and should seek professional help.  They knew it was a kid and still chose to do it.  You got it right "bullied".
---
Yes. I had aover hundred steel in the inventory, then my CAMP got nuked. I rebuilt it and was suddenly out of steel. Goodbye X-01 Jet pack.
---
Thank you for your info! Now I need to cross my fingers that I‚Äôll get a drop or someone will be kind enough to mod it for me.
---
Is it that much? I love that place. All the baseballs are a nice touch as well. 
---
If someone locks u I'm their Base they deserve to have it blown up. 
---
&gt; there was about 300 robots milling outside the main entrance to the resort.
---
Oh noes, somebody's being duping robots!
---
apparantly not the minigun i use, breaks after around 2 mags
---
Uranium fever has three legendary monsters. Filled with molemen though so if you aren't damaging them much you might have a difficult time
---
Pick up all the tin cans and children's toys, they contain lead. Make ammo at your tinker bench. 
---
If your base is constantly getting attacked, it's probably because it's in an annoying location.
---
I feel like five minutes is a reasonable amount of time to be away. Sometimes you need to take a crap or make a sandwich. There have been times when I've taken a workshop to use as my home base when my camp spot was taken and I didn't want to move it, so bring AFK at a workshop seems like the next safest thing. 
---
I tend to build a bed and put myself in it when I need to go AFK, tho. I feel like only a real dick would shoot a girl in her jimjams. 
---
Sorry for the late response. I have given this a lot of thought while creating, and couldn't bring myself to sacrifice more screen real estate than absolutely necessary while displaying item results. So I feel like, for the time being at least, this will not be changing. However: If your item is featured on the front page, OR your own page, it will be there. Hope that answers your question!
---
I have a two shot explosive
---
I'm more  sick of getting  wanted levels for accidently shooting someone's base.
---
Yeah, yeah, everyone knows this.  Boring.
---
Yeah, I'm not sure what the point of having all the different types of bears and gnomes is when you can't even make a shrine to your dark gods. Or put pool balls on a pool table. 
---
The point is not being competitive, in the current state PvP is just not fun.
---
Start standing back and poking feral ghouls others are farming at Whitespring Golf Course. You get full XP gain plus the loot, even if you shot a singular bullet into them
---
I actually prefer Fallout 3 and New Vegas' sound tracks more. But 76's is still pretty enjoyable.
---
And 90% of the time when I drop it it is not obvious to them and then I have to try to point at and shoot the ground like a maniac.
---
I am ashamed to say that my Stash is full of bobbleheads, magazines, mutiple power armors, robot models (from Robotec facility) and different teddy bears I have collected in hope that one day we can show them off in camp.
---
Stash size be dammed!!!
---
Maybe your dweller has a degree in engineering. I mean, engineers are great for plans and math but not everyone can make a wooden shelf like a carpenter.  
---
Okay in the game you can fuck logic because the whole thing is just a communist simulator.
---
Thanks brah
---
I don't see what either of you did as scummy or wrong. He took a workshop for resources, he went AFK for unknown reasons, maybe to kill time, maybe dinner, who knows. Nothing wrong with that. You come along and want the workshop, you initiate PvP by claiming and kill the AFK. If he's going to AFK in a PvP zone, it'a his fault.
---
Cool. I bet that wrecks anything you come up against.
---
when you spawn in at charlston trainyard and you see no vendor, just run to the other side of the train bridge and run back, that should spawn a event. Might be the vendor or random monsters. change servers until you get the vendor :)
---
If you have a friend, you two can find the vendor and if it does not have what you want, you quit to the main menu and join your friend, when you browse the vendor now, his wares has changed. repeat until you get what you want. (this is also the fastest way to do it)
---
Prime receiver plans are a very rare drop from scorchbeasts and a guaranteed drop from the queen. It's honestly not too hard to get them, just very rng intensive to get the specific one you want. It probably won't be too hard to find somebody to mod you one though. The bigger issue is making ammo for it, the plans for ultracite ammo unlock automatically but I don't know if it's when you get a weapon that needs it or if you unlock the plan. In the first case you would be able to make it, in the second case you would need to consistently buy all your ammo from other people
---
Or have a cash shop filled with home furnishings that you'd love to put in your home but....ahhh you get the point.
---
Khajiit has wares, if you have coin...
---
Probably better to use 45 or 308. Low level enemies don't drop 5.56. They don't generally spawn until lvl 30 (ISH) and in harder areas. Turrets drop 5.56 but if you hit those belonging to other players you probably won't keep them long 
---
I really wish they would make it so they couldn't be destroyed. Blow up turrets, thats fine but there is no point to having people blow the rest up for no reason.
---
Do you have a teo shot Dragon by chance
---
I‚Äôm a melee / rifle build but I find the plasma Gatling to be the best weapon for scorchbeasts in my experience 
---
Are you sure it‚Äôs a 100% drop from queen? I‚Äôve killed her twice and haven‚Äôt got it? (Unless I‚Äôm blind)
---
I want this too! I have a full Buttercup pony!
---
Just agreeing with the first comment really
---
It‚Äôs MAAAAM
---
This was posted 36 days ago.. I haven‚Äôt played since then 
---
yes, they did
---
I do not
---
Inside the vault - January 1, 2019. The Portuguese version states that the faction based PvP will be on the end of the month patch.
---
Just wow.... Amazing talent
---
Anything works, but depending on your build a range weapon would be better than melee.  Scorchbeasts hardly ever land so unless you're capable of killing them in 3 maybe 4 hits you're going to want a range weapon.  At level 58 I'm learning this the hard way and I'm about to make a new character so I can get the handmade and change my 2 handed melee build from one that uses chems and alcohol to just a 2 handed melee build.
---
Yes like generators! Stupid!
---
Thanks! I still killed all of the molemen, it just took more rounds than I would like. Oddly, the level 50s went down quicker than a level 8.
---
You mean my junk node. üòã
---
Nice! Thanks.
---
If you want to one shot almost all enemies (I'm talking about killing mirelurk queen in 7 hits and she never hits you) and be super sneaky (no power armor though) use this: [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f3251ff&amp;d=pj2cu0a04lt2la2a72ar2ao0lv2e31se2si2s52sj2ss2ir0c72aj2lr2lk2&amp;w=&amp;n=](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f3251ff&amp;d=pj2cu0a04lt2la2a72ar2ao0lv2e31se2si2s52sj2ss2ir0c72aj2lr2lk2&amp;w=&amp;n=)

---
2h weapons in PA are in my opinion much weaker damage-wise.
---
Think the luck rating in your SPECIAL is important, my luck is quite low and out of the last 100 3* legendary anything's I killed I have had about 90 1 star left leg pieces and the rest 1 or 2 star rolling pins or batons or pick axes etc, basically shit.
---
Scored a 3 star hammer once ...woo hoo lucky me :-)
---
You can out run and juke a melee player. You can't out run bullets.
---
I hear it all the time 
---
As you spawn in you will be facing the train, if you continue up half the length of the train and find an open carraige you should see a split in the row of buildings across the road, that path leads to the vendor who is just behind those buildings.
---
Someone writen somewhere here that they are childrens that were in mines or something like that. If it is true, Yay finaly we can slain childrens (in game). Idk why are people so soft about it. Those games are about killing whatever you meet, why are childrens different? LETS TALK ABOUT IT!
---
if i can remember correctly, theres a loading screen tip that says they were miners that were trapped in their deteriorating mining suits, very similar to the ghost people of the sierra madre 
---
In the Portuguese version still says it is faction based.
---
My game has improved massively since using a mic. 100 ish hours in I put a mic in to talk to a couple I'd been playing with for a few days. While I was a bit nervous because I don't ever have much to say, it made the co-op a tonne easier and more enjoyable. 
---
I noticed today that I don‚Äôt hear the noise anymore.
---
Only sentry bots, and all legendary robots.
---
Gatling Gun! The sound is incredible.
---
Im 50+ CAMPs in, a little over level 50, and Ive noticed no change, this after reading the 'items cost less as you level' hypothesis and unscientifically testing it out. Pretty sure the build budget is static and anecdotes, like yours about the brother, simply arent tracking all variables thoroughly. 
---
If you are low level you might want avoid enemies .  If you can fast travel, dont go past the  train, go down the steps to the left.  From the bottom head to the right going through the hole in the wall or sneak through the doorway slightly further on.  Head through the rooms whichever you choose.  Once in the alley behind follow the low wall and you'll quickly see the vendor.  If you have disturbed the enemies they will follow you, so place yourself looking back the way you came to trade, keeping the bot between you and the entrance gap to his platform.  I have seen players die when trading as enemies can be 68's.  If you have not disturbed the enemies you should be able to fast travel away.  I now just blast everything but didn't at first.  Hope this helps offer a choice.
---
Awesome Post!
---
With ballistic weight perks at least that ammo is zero weight.
---
I get this same error, so many times every day, that I've lost count, saying that I mostly get it when I am taking anything out of my stash or putting something back in, what a nuisance.
---
Fallout 76 is a &amp;\*\^%$# up game, sometimes I fear if I breath too hard, I'll get kicked out.
---
Record including Beta that I've been kicked out of this game up to now (including this error): before the first patch: kicked out the most in a single day 12 times, the least in a single day 6 times = 200+ times so far.....
---
After the first patch: the most I've was kicked out: 8 times a day, the least times I've was kicked out: 4 times a day.
---
I expected this game to have problems, but from what I've personally experienced, written about and read online from people around the world; it seems to me that this game is exceptionally broken, and I'm going to say with that, that Bethesda, rushed this game out just so they could separate our money from our wallets..
---
Have a nice day everyone.
---
Take the locks off your resources and it will stop shaping your camp as being attacked.
---
I stopped locking things and all of a sudden people stopped attacking my camp. 
---
Depends on wether your ‚Äùteammates‚Äù are assholes or not.
---
I accidentally hit a friendly high level at White Springs, couldn't tell if he killed me accidentally or intentionally, we were swarmed by legendary glowing ones. I was notified my junk was looted on respawn. 
---
It happens, it should be expected, especially if you don't have pacifist mode on. 
---
Whatever, move on, it's only junk. Turns out he only took specific junk anyway, the rarer stuff for crafting. The world is filed with junk - no reason to get upset about it.
---
I have a vampire one. I love it can kinda wanna prime it once I get the plans tho mainly use rifles
---
username checks out
---
We are in death world, there are no rules. It all about your own calculation. Never take loot from someone who may be worth for you in future. 
---
Someone in my team attacking a guy with a bounty shouldn't drag me into PvP with them also. What if my muscle shoots a guy half his level but twice mine? I'll tell You, you get beaned 5 times in a row and lose a ton of caps.
---
Its not free game for me and my friends. Either leave the loot or take it and give it back, before someone else takes it or the server crashes.
---
That explains the appearance, but not the mannerisms or inability to communicate. How / why (in terms of in game lore such as a note or holotape)?
---
Check your atom challanges, farm legendaries, make a cooler house, help other people out. That's about it.
---
Same deal here. Feels so odd seeing nothing in the top right. Bit directionless now.
---
Sure, its called Ammo Vendor which will be implemented on next patch!
---
You ruin the song lol
---
I have gotten sensitive to the duping events, so when they start DCing me, I now just jump to another server.  Happened yesterday in fact.  Took me 2 server hops to get onto server not experiencing the Duping DC.
---
0.o... Jeez, I would never be able to fast travel carrying that many.
---
Spending on how young they were, this would explain why they can't speak, they're basically feral animals
---
There are two types of camp builders in this game. People who can build like this. Then me who builds a 2√ó2 wooden cube in the middle of a dried up river bed. 
---
Right, my team hates loot stealers and kicked a guy tonight from the team for doing it. We also started a PVP after the Scorch queen attack on some non teammates who loot stole too.
---
Yes it bugs me. And it bugs me that they aren't even holding it correctly and still manage to shot it up in the air but somehow directly at me.
---
"Good with Salt" is not what's needed for me.
---
I can make it back just fine.  Its me not clicking the "Junk all" button at a workshop before I get back to chemistry station.
---
4 times now... Lost that Hardened Mass.  &lt;cry&gt; 
---
After that, best to just sell the raw flux at vendors to get caps because I was too pissed to go get the mass again.
---
Been there, done that.
---
Cool story bro.
---
Mostly very good. I don't think power patcher is worth slotting for combat as pa is ridiculously durable, but take it to 3 stars for the reduced repair costs. I'm not sure the 2 second debuff from suppressor is worth  using 3 points on, particularly for ranged builds. 
---
I got a lvl 45 two-shot handmade with no mods and it‚Äôs far better than my lvl 45 heavily-modded handmade.
---
I actually haven't noticed that yet, weird.
---
Not quite sure actually,  will put a bit of time to work it out, on the flip side I lost my ultracite armor inexplicably.
---
Not a beta thing, I noticed that on my new char yesterday. Had to do a double take and make I was on a male char. They definitely play one of the female falling damage sounds.
---
I like the overall idea. Changing world type stuff has been used to pretty decent effect in Guild Wars 2 over the years. Entire zones have been fundamentally changed since launch in that game. I'd be interested to see Bethesda implement something along those lines in FO76 for sure. But, I'd also want them to wait a good while before starting that sort of thing, to give the proper feel of change having been put into motion by the emerged vault dwellers.
---
Tangentially related, your mention of 'commie bot invasion' reminded me of a strange happening at a workshop I had claimed. There was a defend event where Liberators were the attackers, and a fair few of them were simply handled by my turrets. But, when I went around to check on things and repair etc, I found that *just one* of my turrets had turned against me. It was red-name, shooting at me and all. I just picked it up and put down a new one, but then I saw the Liberator husks laying around and found myself wondering if one of the little Chinese buggers had managed to hack my turret! Probably more likely it was just a glitch, but still one of those things that makes ya go "hmmmm...".
---
Eh, we guard each other's bag until they come back to make sure they get their junk back. 
---
Imagine dupers going to servers dropping 1000s of items and it not being in a paper bag, pretty sure it would crash servers and people would do it for fun. 
---
Hrm.   Make sure you use the gun perk.. Gunsmith?   Its agility perk that reduced durability damage on guns, 5 ranks.
---
Also be away that mods will change the durability of guns, make sure you put a mod in that extends the durability.  Sometimes that is better than taking a better mod ability.
---
This post is about game ballance. I am not questioning the legitimately of those guns. The thing is, they do exist and they are prevalent at the meta.
---
If people couldn't destroy each other's bases there'd be a new way of greiffing. 
---
Find over-encumbered player - move camp - build box around them. They'd then have to drop stuff to fast travel and you'd get free stuff. 
---
I like dropping them to randoms as I get them because I have no doubt some greedy shit will come and take every item in that box and try to sell them on.
---
I only loot bags with junk if I see that nobody is near me on the map, then I know that that player doesnt care about their junk.
---
link to video please ?
---
I recall a loading screen tip stating that they were pre-war miners who got trapped in their suits and are now frenzied combatants who attack anything they view as a threat. This is collaborated in-game during the "Uranium Fever" event as the computer will refer to some of the Mole Miners as "Terminated management personnel".
---
I keep seeing this sort of thing quoted, but have yet to see someone from Bethesda, or even remotely close to Bethesda, mention it...
---
It might be good but no mutation is worth farming it or spending caps on serums
---
That was the first coming to my mind reading the headline...
---
true, but just ban em until they write a 500 word essay on why being an ass and crashing servers is wrong ;)
---
You could also get a debuff on healing items when you are engaged in PvP.
---
Well for you, you‚Äôll want meats because of the double benefit. So here‚Äôs a few with stats when cooked.
---
- dog meat gives 2 endurance
---
- wolf meat gives 2 perception
---
- brahmin meat gives 20 carry weight
---
- mutant hound give +10 to melee
---
- glowing meat also gives +10 to melee
---
- mole rat meat gives 1 strength 
---
- deathclaw meat gives 2 strength 
---
- rad scorpion eggs cures addictions
---
Then easy stuff that you can craft but require recipes are.
---
- Appchilli gives 2 luck (found in Flatwoods) requires brahmin meat, stilt beans and 2 tatos (all of which can be found in Flatwoods)
---
- Ground mole rate gives 3 agility (bought from whitespings) requires 2 mole rat, 2 stilt beans and 2 pepper (again all of which can be found in Flatwoods but you‚Äôll need to really hunt for the pepper your better of going to the winter sports store)
---
i use plants

---
Yeah that's really annoying. I always have to make a point to deposit the important stuff before I scrap anything. 
---
I usually make it back with my flux in time, but today I had two nuke zones consecutively and some of it became inert. Pain in the neck. 
---
Dude, Rose is the best and I will destroy anyone who says otherwise.
---
I don't know about eyebots, but if you shoot off both arms on a protectron or all limbs on an assaultron, then they will explode. They should make the noise. In 4, they started glowing orange and got brighter in addition to the noise, but they don't do that in 76.
---
I've thought something similar in terms of ending the Scorched arc with dynamic servers, but I'm unsure if we should lose nukes. Todd was taking about a "nuclear cold war" in the NoClip documentary. Maybe we could have a PvP event where Responders &amp; BOS who want peace to rebuild have to fight Raiders and Enclave for control of the silos.
---
ESO has guilds, so maybe 76 could do something similar in the dedicated PvP servers. Would certainly keep you on your toes
---
It's cool but I dont like how the art styles are both serious mixed with weeb mini characters just a thought it'd be so much cooler if it stuck to the post apocalypse theme and not like its been mixed with the nyan cat. 
---
10/10 tho.
---
As bad as this is on PC, it's a lot worse on Xbox. I have been getting disconnected about every 10 to 15 minutes all weekend. I'm no longer bothering to start quests or take over workshops.
---
I've got a junk pile and water in mine. Spot is east of Berkley Springs under one of the large pylons.
---
Thanks man, you saved me a lot of running around trying to find this!! Appericate it.
---
A lot of the time I eat the meat raw so it looks like its worthwhile doing some cooking for some of these.
---
This worked for me at lvl 80.  Thank you! 
---
RIP 3* Pitchfork with Flaming Barbed Wire. 
---
My condolences are truly with you in this devastating time. 
---
I might be out 11:30-12:30.. but will see about joining you before or after. 
---
You get one as a quest reward I think, if you wait till level 50 before completing quests the quest legendaries will scale up to your level. 
---
Server didn‚Äôt crash was a little laggy in the nuke zone but no different than any other nuke zone really. 
---
You don't play as a raider, you play as a bug-exploiting asshole if you do this tbh
---
[Nwm, it was theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a4d703/theory_mole_miners_are_kids/)
---
The Somerset is *another* gun I missed out on... even on my new alt account I made specifically to deal with level locked garbage. Its another one of those missions they throw super early at you. 
---
Luckily I didn't get All Rise until I was 50.
---
The best thing about it is when you get disconnected just before finishing an instance. The enemies respawn but most of the containers are empty. You also loose ammo. I am beginning to think this game will never be fixed. The issues with it are just too many and too significant. Why didn't they just make the game co-op, instead of MMO-like?
---
The level 80 was hovering over a train station. Nice try though.
---
Got any more excuses for bad game design?
---
Lol I hope it's fixed eventually cause I do miss putting items everywhere . In oblivion I collected hourglassess and built a dam next to one of the homes you get. Fallout I always collected pre war money and had piles everywhere.
---
Making a missile launcher and mini nukes from literal piles of scrap and junk. Can't make a power armor fist with deathclaw claws on it
---
Be nice if they'd quit spawning in the Forest then.
---
I was able to finish the game / story line, but thats only due to the game skipping over the quest automatically, I did not do anything special to get it to kick off. 
---
But not get the military ID. My buddy was not able to drop it or trade it with me. He did craft me the gun you receive from the mission though. 
---
Yooo, I won't be on tonight, but if you don't find anyone I am down for this next time I'm online. My GT is Zambah
---
&gt; I should upload it sooner or later.
---
You should.
---
What are you after, you never know..
---
yes you could. the difference with well tuned is quite neglible. 
---
if you run non-power armor, marathoner is superb choice. just sooo much more sprinting.
---
if run PA, then the choice isn't so obvious. on the one hand, +10AP from every point of agility is rather good, but considering +4 AGI from bird bones and easy +AGI from food and + Max AP from widely available mirelurk meats (+20 from softshell ones and +10 from regular), cutting AGI to say 7/8 might be very much okay. I'm not very fond of  stacking type of bonuses, but you might invest a free points or two into more Adrenaline (one point is super worthy, but more is personal preference). 
---
I still wait for the winter to come to appalachia, so the trees finaly loose their folliage and I will not be bleeding with my eyes by seeing them. Why I mentioned this? F 76 are the playground for devs. After most of bugs fixed (god I hope this game will be fixed one day) they can go wild and do with the world all kinds of things, experiment with storytelling, new tech, new modes, OP thing, anything, basicaly. So many things can be played with.
---
Eh situational sometimes if the server we are on is getting a little skippy and it looks like imminent disconnect, we will holler at our team to pick it up. We share materials all the time anyhow. 
---
Dying for metal keypad doors here. Will pay good price if you have them
---
Go scorch beast hunting, found 2 today
---
I've got an Anti-Scorched Gatling Plasma.  So, just the kind I'll need if I ever get around to helping to kill the Scorch Beast Queen.
---
Both you and the other person were ‚Äúscummy‚Äù. I hate people that kill afk players, while on the other hand, I hate players that go afk for loot. 
---
How
---
That's awesome! üòÅ
---
Thanks mate. What‚Äôs the best place to farm them?
---
Two Shot Gauss rifle with +10% damage while aiming. Would be even better if it was three star with an additional +15% reload speed but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever get that. 
---
I get that you're opting in to PvP when you take over a workshop, but there are definitely bullies living it up in the wasteland. Last night someone a full 150 levels above me destroyed my base, every single object, forcing me to go back to the munitions factory to get any work done. This was just a ploy to get me there so he could kill me when stealing the factory. And about 2 minutes after he killed me, stole my junk, and took over the base, he logged off.
---
That was a bully, plain and simple.
---
100% to drop **any** primed receiver,
---
Not 100% to drop handmade primed receiver.
---
If you were not aware, ultracite ammo requires stable flux to craft.
---
For the 5.56 ammo you require violet stable flux.
---
Also all you benefit is about 20-30% more damage against scorched over the hardened receiver since the damage increase is exactly the same between them.
---
So what you do with primed receivers is spend stable flux to deal only more damage to scorched.
---
I consider the gauss rifle's primed capacitor, to be the only good one. Since it doesn't have any capacitor that increase damage other than the primed capacitor. (also it is good damage per shot)
---
damnit.
---
Spent my night reading the comics and now I'm somehow a patreon of this absurdly cute art.
---
Thanks.  Thanks a lot.
---
Hell yeah, man!  He was excited for you lol
---
It's a shame that breaks so fast...
---
I've seen no source of it, and it'd appear to be an extremely amateur kind of mistake not to have any log stored.
---
But then I also remember that they're making the game with an engine that is not thought with the multiplayer in mind, so...
---
Awesome info. Thanks for that
---
You have a build for heavy weapons?
---
Ha, had this last night: clicked on the Play button, game goes to loading screen and I'm like let's get something to drink.  
---
The game loaded faster than I got my drink and I ended up dying from radiation at the Whitesprings service entrance.
---
Yay
---
You can drop it on Morgantown airport though that's my newbie nuke location
---
Ah, then no, if you wanted a 3* rolling pin I'm your man, thats all I ever find...comedy weapons and left leg pieces.
---
Had a 2 shot Guass once but I was only 1* (from the SBQ), sold it to Watoga bot :-)
---
Better yet, forcefields.
---
NO. 
---
Msg me
---
That cant be real. I thought Bethesda fixed this. Where 1 nuke can be launched every 15 minutes.
---
One time I found someone had dropped like 20 mini nukes on the floor (they weigh a lot so it's not an odd thing to see) so I thought it would just use them up by shooting all of the whitespring robots to get some XP.  
---
Blew up so many robots, got a absolutely nothing for it :(
---
If there is ever a next time you would be much better off going to a super mutant camp or the crashed train with the sentry bot to the north (?) of the white spring instead.
---
I gave up having pets because of that. Some guy killed Jester, my SnallyGaster. The only tamble one I've seen :'(
---
They shouldnt die... They should respawm after like 10mins. They should also be able to lv up. Think that's be cool
---
Haha I feel you man :D 
---
Market is completely crowded with those TSE Weapons. But I feel like it‚Äôs way too overpowered so I‚Äôd rather go with the +10% damage 
---
I feel like Bethesda should hire you; (if they haven‚Äôt already)! The fallout world needs more creative things like this!
---
Watoga, or bos events like line in the sand and air to ground" somthing like that" but you could kill way more beasts then queens. But the problem still is ammo
---
There's a treasure hunt type quest to get Nuka Cola paint for the T-51, Google it. 
---
Alternatively if you're on xbox and can't be bothered, I can sell you my one for 350 caps. I don't use PA, playing dress up is too much fun lol!
---
Pretty sure that is utter bullshit. It's not even the same lamp. 
---
How are you spending points then ? It would only take 1 nuked whitesprings to grab you 15+ levels. Can then spend them on a build... don‚Äôt spend 9 points for 60% in maxing dam for a build instead go 3 points for 30% and go adrenaline and bloody mess.
---
Has anyone successfully tamed an animal that's more than half their level?
---
A lot of it completely depends on who you happen to bump into.
---
At low level the majority of higher level players ignored me.
---
One said "hello" as he wandered through my camp picking all my crops.
---
Only one ever gave me anything, and that was 2 purified waters.
---
However none of them tried killing me either.
---
Conversely since Ive become a higher level I try to be helpful - any plans I have duplicates of I find someone under level 20 to give them to. Figure they may as well get used rather than wasted.
---
The other day I realised I had loads of ammo I wasnt using (3k+ shotgun ammo) that was weighing me down. I found a lv4 and gave it to them.
---
I dont go out of my way to craft stuff for newbies, nor am I interested in teaming up etc. However I dont mind dropping off whatever Im not using on a low level rather than dumping it in the wild
---
\+karma
---
We were all thinkin‚Äô it
---
Naming you power armor would be nice also. Being able to park one in a power armor station would also help. Setting the carry limit higher and the stash box to 1000 / 1200 would be a nice touch.
---
Yeah, I think a run through the whole school nets me around 130. Golf balls, plastic pumpkins, plastic plates...lots of the stuff! And a Red Rocket right outside to the north...My favorite farm so far!
---
I usually hit up Green Country Lodge and Charleston Fire Dept for their weight rooms afterwards. While in farming mode, and with a few virgin instances (not to mention Ammosmith 2), I can get shells for days!
---
I never saw him and I have around 420 hours :/
---
Then just drop stuff, theres literally nothing that can stop you from fast travelling or leaving the world.
---
Yeah I use the perk to double its condition when I repair but I would say it‚Äôs still only good for two scorchbeasts before it need repairing again 
---
I think OP meant to post this like 5 weeks ago
---
It's ma'am! I'm gonna call RobCo and throw a fucking fit!
---
The person who bought it from the store us the only one who can have it in their camp. Same with PA paints and everything else bought from the store. It's for your account only and can't be transferred for obvious reasons
---
you can also have Sun Kissed and watch the rads melt away right after drinking.
---
So *that‚Äôs* where all my mods keep going, lol
---
Wait, you found where I built my home!
---
I managed to squeeze a small house in there, with the entrance right through the little stone arch.
---
It really is a fantastic place to live, especially when ghouls spawn at the waste site.
---
I've been sitting behind the Whitesprings golf course for about 4 hours now and didn't have this problem since I met two trolls when I started, guy literally came back to my base 3 times after leaving the world for varying amounts of time just to destroy it with his TSE.
---
Someone from r/fallout is here on a downvote spree. Or really hates your conversation. My teams policy is leave it for when they come back, I feel like we have one guy that just doesn't care and will loot you anyway and it's getting on everyone's nerves 
---
I have an executioner's gatling plasma. Nice for Scorchbeasts as long as I switch before it gooifies.
---
I much like a few others have our own tools to view the data files for F76, I dunno about other tools, but mine wouldn't be too hard to bulk export the data, but no one has requested any data extracts yet so I haven't bothered
---
I literally had no clue why my mods kept disappearing until this post lol
---
I‚Äôm not duper but I‚Äôve got your point and approve you. This game needs private servers.
---
I bet that they would. Thats what duppers are doing
---
Just did Whitesprings nuke event and had no problems with the lower AP regen. Soloed couple golf house waves as there were not many players there. 
---
Excavator. You can confirm if something is for excavator by the junk it scraps too which is black titanium
---
Excavator 
---
Take up stamp collecting.
---
That's so low in the list of things that need to be fixed ATM... I dunno why you even mention it!
---
People should stop suggest things when they don't know how duping works seriously.
---
Your suggestion won't fix item duping.
---
Yeah the pay off from the effort of launching a missile is Whitesprings. Best return on investment. It'd be cool if other zones had rad bosses like the queen and other locations had good farming points. But alas. 
---
PC 
---
1. Slider in settings for horisontal and vertical mouse sensivity 
---
2. Currently, favourites menu opens by 3 buttons by default, "F" and mouse wheel forward and back. Mouse wheel cant be changed. I suggest to allow rebinding of mouse wheel scrolling in the "keybinds" too, wheel is much more usefull for camera controls, for example, or changing weapons without favourites menu hopping in front of the screen.
---
3. Separate buttons for strong melee atack and throw grenade. Or, like in skyrim, just holding the LMB for strong attack, it's much more intuitive.
---
4.Make map on "M" and main menu on "Esc" by default. It will be much better this way. 
---
Try Watoga, 3 spawn locations all close to each other, that's where I built my set(s) up. There and Big Bend Tunnel.
---
I build them, paint then Nuka Cola and give them away when Im bored.....
---
Cover it, wait for them to return. If you take it, then we are entitled to take yours when you die
---
AD VICTORIAM
---
It is ok to die, it is not permanent.
---
Nice pad. The weird part is that I had my CAMP in the exact same spot for the longest time. I saw the layout of the rocks and immediately recognized the area.
---
I'd start worrying if she gets all "i'm sorry dave, i can't do that" start running. As fast as you can
---
You could‚Äôve also put on passive mode so that you didn‚Äôt initiate the slap, if I was in a nuke zone and I know everyone just got some stable flux, and then I get attacked and it‚Äôs not low level and his friends, that‚Äôs bonus flux right there 
---
Thank you for your input I with make some changes and repost in this thread.
---
He tried, his funeral is in a week... RIP
---
That's exactly what a synth would say!
---
I don't think luck plays as big a part in it as people think, argued with the most  "meta" person that plays apparently over whether or not having five luck drops better loot than max. He said I was an idiot and It does, I said weres that proof. Never found. Try lowering their health halfway on the 2-3 star and waiting for the refill. Once it does then take the kill. Helps me anyway. 
---
r/totallynotrobots
---
I really like the little guest house :)
---
Thanks for the answers.
---
It has been there for month.
---
Depends what your main weapon is. I'm using a handmade, and 5.56 doesn't commonly show up in containers/as boxes. You get it sometimes on enemies, but not at the rate needed to keep me supplied.
---
I am complacent. Dupers really are assholes, but they've been able to do this for months and nothing substantial has been done about it. This should have been a top priority fix. Instead, from what I can gather, the last hotpatch somehow introduced a way dupe much faster, with less of an impact on server stability. At a certain point Bethesda becomes just as liable as the Dupers. 
---
Luck affects the size of the condition bar of dropped loot
---
Robots get lonely too.
---
Also with energy weapons, they seem to have a durability problem.
---
It is a debelopers job to provide initiative to work past the company's bureaucracy.
---
That is correct. 
---
I played for a few days in a row, each a couple hour session, and made it a point to stop at whitesprings and a train Depot just to sell me crap
---
And learn you can't sell ammo or supplies.... So I found a party of 3 super low lvls and gave them ammo and supplies I already had 2000 of
---
i have been doing the ammo plant cause i have heard of people mostly finding it there
---
5th attempt, not crashes but server disconnects and I've never had less than 4 Scorched Beasties near the mine entrance, but I can just sprint under them and enter the mine so that's something. Always disconnects while deep int he mine, something in that area is triggering it I suppose, who knows?
---
That reminds me of the ending to the Big MT dlc to New Vegas.
---
Easiest way would be to disable armor and weapon stacking.
---
No it was fine, surprisingly. 
---
A bummer since the patch.  The love of your life won't be able to build ATOM store bought in your CAMP either, even though they own it.  You'd need your own.  Sure Bethesda would make you do almost anything at this stage if they could make another $$$.  Plus wasn't it time limited, not logged on today yet.  If it was that sucks even more.
---
Must chop wood... forever

I have never experienced it on PC, but recently started playing on Xbox and I had this happen 4 times in a row.

It's not always duping that causes the problem though. I spent the past few weeks trading for bog maps so I could open one multiple times. I managed to get almost 20 from bog #4, and when I spammed it open, I accidentally caused a server crash. Anything you do too quick in this game tents to fuck up stability. In fact I'd say crashes are 1/3 Bethesda bugs, 1/3 Dupes and 1/3 treasure maps. It doesn't make much with the maps to screw things up apparently. 
---
Well as a solo player I don‚Äôt need to really worry about any of that. XD But if nobody is around I‚Äôll take the bag. If somebody is I‚Äôll wait a few minutes to see if they collect it and take it if they don‚Äôt. There was a lvl 25 in incomplete power armor guy who killed a level 10 (not a fair fight at all) and I was stood by the guy as he died (went to stimpack him) so I grabbed his stuff as I saw the power Armor guy approaching. He then shot at me so I got close and tore him apart with my shotgun before taking his loot too. I waited for the first guy to come back so I could give him back his loot and the loot from the guy who killed him, but he didn‚Äôt. Think the power Armor guy assumed that because I wasn‚Äôt in power Armor and that I was a lower level than him I‚Äôd be easy pickings. Shotgun and lone wanderer defence perks are a beaut for that. 
---
The wires will go away if you move. If you blueprint it I‚Äôm not sure if it stays, but either way wires are free to make. You won‚Äôt waste copper creating wires. You‚Äôll use copper making new conduits that aren‚Äôt already stored in your storage. 
---
You have great technical skills, especially your shading for the texture and depth on the stone. Very nice.
---
So you found a glaring bug about an exploding bug? 
---
I travelled loads up the West side locations to build sets for me and friends.  What platform?
---
Yup, it prevents you from losing or gaining anymore mutations while it is equipped.
---
But now you know so you can rock ALL the mutations :).
---
I didn't realise the camp boundary extended that far, and since it's such a steep incline there wasn't much I could build. I thought a little 1x2 cottage would be cute. 
---
I like having a few smaller buildings in a compound, rather than a megastructure with not much in it. 
---
Ty!
---
It's a black market though, people will sell anything and everything for real money. Yes it's scummy, but it's not the developers fault. Even if they add more lines of defense for in game items, what's to say someone can't just sell their email and details linked to the account to give the items away?
---
You've got good intentions behind your complaints, but they're embedded in a naive perspective. 
---
Yeah, the robots in the silos are the same way.  negligible amount of XP and no loot aside from the sentry bot and assaultrons
---
Give my regards to Ms. Claws once you are there
---
the inability to communicate could be due to the breathing apparatus they are always wearing, anyone who has worn  a respirator or gas mask knows its extremely difficult to talk without a speech apparatus so they could of changes to grunts due the difficulty of speaking and the deterioration of their mental state

Production sector in the enclave bunker, the vendor there has it 100% of the time. On rare occasions its at other vendors as well.

---
It's just for crippling limbs..each limb has like a seperate HP bar which causes limbs to be crippled when it depletes
---
Well, it means you can cripple enemies' limbs. Like, you can stop an enemy from running by crippling their leg, or stop them from holding a two-handed weapon by crippling their arm.

I don't understand why scrapping them wouldn't give the components required to make the mod in the first place. (Or what it would be required if it was craftable.) Seems like that would be what was in a mod box.
---
Yeah I was thinking of doing that tried to just quit to desktop and start the game again didn't work. Seems only way that worked is I force kill the game with task manager.

"I've lived in various parts of Appalachia..."  
---
I thought you were being literal, and you made me homesick for no reason. Also, I like your house.   
---
No. It's a reference to J. Robert Oppenheimer, Director of the Manhatten Project
---
Does IT look different?
---
Never been to Appalachia IRL, I'm Australian. I'd love to, though. 
---
Last week the official statement from Bethesda was that 76 does not support mods and that using them is a ban-able offense.  This was separate from the cheat software and they went on to say if you were banned for having a mod detected you could write in an appeal.  The write an essay part however was completely false.  They concluded by saying this was to prevent players from gaining an unfair advantage through mods and they do plan to implement mod support farther down the line.
---
Wish I could link this for you but I believe YouTuber openworldgames has a snippet of the reply article in one of his vids.

you're the bloatfly king

Ok I guess the adamantium skeleton won't make me tougher.

---
I'm a level 48 and I still run for cover like momma called me for dinner whenever I hear the thump of flapping wings.
---
OK. I can't say for certain that the chems guy was a dooper. 
---
The weapons guy described himself basically as a middle man. Not a dooper. He described 5 two shot explosive rifles in his stock, including 2 that used prime ammo. ... Ammo with components that must be harvested from blast zones, I think. 
---
He acknowledged that his sources couple be dupers and referred to the guy selling the serums as possibly being a duper. 
---
Maybe I incorrectly connected the dots based on the disappearance of the cook station at the overseer camp. I have been told though that doopers do wonky, unintended things to the database. 
---
There are 2 separate issues. ... 
---
* Whether they are doopers ...or even if selling goods created by doopers is bad for the game. 
---
* Whether setting up shop like this in Flatwoods is good for the immersive experience of new players, just popping out of the vault. There are plenty of locations that make more sense, though some would be subject to various types of attacks. 
---
If you use the automatic blueprint that shows up as a blue blob at the top of your Stored tab after you move camps, anything snapped to or sitting on the main structure (stacked on a foundation somehow) will be connected and you can place it in one click.
---
Power lines that go from your structure to things sitting on the ground like purifiers will break, and your purifiers will be stored separately. 
---
I recommend building a power connector on the outside of the wall near where you usually place things on the ground. Connect it to the rest of your grid. That way, you can plop down your structure, then any powered things on the ground, and just wire them to that one connector. This is easier than trying to find the sweet spot to go through windows or around corners again and again.

Now, THAT is a very good idea.  
---
Here‚Äôs hoping the Bethesda lurkers see it.
---
But it will be Atom shop, be warned.
---
+Karma

Whitesprongs station vendor gets it
---
because not the craft lets the server crash you but the stack of 300 of the same weapon.  
---
So even if its slow it will still work
---
Ive seen the army of dead brahmin before by that same area, not the grave. Wonder why these are there?
---
"Mr. Five by Five" and "Pistol Packin' Mama" are my two favourites.

 I recently realized how many fluxes I wasted because I didn't know that =(
---
xcom missed!

CONTROLS DISABLED-SERVER NOT RESPONDING
---
Also the Atlas Observatory was a weaponized weather system creator. It‚Äôd be such a shame to have that in the game and not do a nuclear winter at some point. 
---
I believe I can manage that much, at least if it skews to the lower end of the spectrum.  I logged on this morning to make sure I had requested the right pieces, so let me know if you come across the elusive right leg. 
---
I don't dupe, but I read a thread about one method because I get curious about bugs üòÖ
---
From what I understand they use some automatic key clicker to spam the craft button quickly. Most of these have a timer you can set. (I know this from my unfortunate but finally cured addiction to the *confusingly addictive* clicker game AdVenture Capitalist)  
---
So if they change the time interval, the dupers could just adjust the interval in the auto clicker to fit that time frame. 
---
Still, the way they actually dupe the things is in some glitch with logging in and out of the server. At least that's what the thread I read said. I don't really get that part, nor do I particularly want to.
---
How is this different from all the other posts like this?

---
Does it get redundant after a while or is it because YOU posted it that it's suddenly relevant?
---
Didnt know this, thnks :D and wish me luck, i hope i dont get stuck another half our trying to hack another computer xD
---
Nice tip :D didnt know that and that save me tons of space Thanks!!!
---
If I'm with a buddy, I'll guard it for him. Anyone elses, I'm snapping it up. Half the fun of Nuke zones is picking up goodie bags! 
---
Yet melee is broken as ever.. 
---
Too late for that i think :S anyway i have lot of fertilizer (i hope) xD
---
In that brotherhood of Steel mission that leads to the Scorchbeast Queens lair (I can't remember the name of it, but it ends in the Glassed Cavern), the holo-tapes fairly heavily imply that the guys that were down there might have been the original mole miners. 
---
One of the final tapes says something about "never being able to take our suits off" from memory, and they were even starting to sound a bit like the mole miners. 
---
It was a while back I did the mission, but I know I have done some mission or other that suggested that was the start of mole miners in the tapes. Sorry I can't be more specific.  
---
 before I leave camp I check to see what components I need most and tag those and other than knowing you'll always need screws I only pick up the components I've tagged. 
---
You will receive a message notifying that someone else is in your spot.
---
If you choose to drop your CAMP somewhere else it will be free of charge.
---
If you don‚Äôt relocate your CAMP will be placed back in its original spot, in its original state, the next time you log into a World where the space is not occupied by another player.
---
I would use the workbench to add a 
---
Mole Miner Gauntlet to my right arm, a Power Fist to the left. 
---
bloodied swingspeed strength powerfist.
---
Sorry no
---
about your original comment, fallout 76 takes place in america, not china
---
It's a warning. On that road you'll encounter a scorchbeast. 
---
Il be there
---
The Brahmin thing happened to me too, 3 times at the same road first 3 then a small distance ahead another 8 and a bit further another 5
---
I remember my parents confiscating my CD of Fallout 1 back in 1999 because the game was rated PEGI16 and I was only 14 at the time.
---
Now, almost 20 years later, I gotta admit that they were right... sort of. A modern and graphic PEGI18 game is no place for a nine year old kid, even if the parents are sitting right next to them to put things into context.
---
And you, OP, should have at least dropped some junk to compensate for the damage done (prior to the victim leaving the game)...
---
He just wanted to flaunt words like repository and disclaimer.
---
Or just allow people to log in and out while remaining in the Whitesprings/Bunker. Just stop putting them outside.
---
Fallout &amp; Xcom have this in common
---
Leaving stuff around doesn't matter TOO much cause there is no world permanence. If someone misses out, they may pick it up the next gaming session. It's not that big of a deal.
---
As for answering your question though, I take what I need and move on. Usually no point picking up something that you're going to later have to spend time inventory managing later to clear up space to fast travel or space in your stash.
---
That sounds great, but I have a feeling that things would go not according to plan, and we would witness a birth of a new, terrifying bug...
---
LoL
---
I just typed about this too
---
i play in segments.
---
take everything i can and every 15-20 minutes (depends on; do i farm at whitespring or doing questing?) search for a camp/trail-station and sell everything i can/dont need.
---
Didn't they always?
---
your right, it sounds like a bug, but could make for interesting gameplay. The bot invasion came to me because of the story in the whitesprings bunker talks about the mama dolce's plant being a potential threat the secretary investigated for increasing the defcon. 
---
It would be cool if there was a question to free the robots.  Maybe not all of them, just the ones with personality.
---
This is awesome - please let me know if you ever publish a book of your journey. I would definetly buy it!
---
Does it mean head too?
---
100%
---
I've had random enemies drop dead the moment I approached them. Also had scorched walking around a corner to get in cover only to hear the sound of them dropping dead.
---
No such things as spawning tombstones though.
---
I think it do. Its my understanding that limb hp and body hp = max hp.
---
You remember the misses more than the hits.
---
Also, there's a bug I found where if you fire too soon after initiating VATS, doesn't matter what the number is, you'll miss regardless. Usually have to trigger VATS, pause for a moment, and then shoot. Then 95% is close to 95%.
---
Take a listen to live Johnny cash version from Folsom Prison. It‚Äôs amazing. 
---
yup
---
But then you couldn't loot multiple of the same weapon?
---
Modus has mods for the scout armour, and i dont think the mods are learnable sadly. no idea about legendary ones existing, though you do get the last bastion when you become an enclave general, so who knows
---
It makes you last longer under heavy fire
---
I swear though...last night I scrapped a combat shotgun and the mod I learned was just "Gray"
---
I wondered about it for a moment, but I was busy.  I wonder if it was a paint option.
---
But who cares about gray paint?
---
Not to come off derisively but are you making the DLC in the next couple weeks as an educated guess or have I missed something concrete regarding expansionary DLC? 
---
gilded weapons? why have i not heard of this?
---
Very well done üëç
---
Don't farm, don't grind,don't hoard, take your time to read everything, learn about all the stories, explore, be patient..
---
What level were you looking for?  What bits? When are you on? I'll log on go look have spare time.
---
I‚Äôm a big fan of the fallout series and as it may not be as good as the previous games it‚Äôs still a load of fun to play ! And even more with a team, I‚Äôm enjoying it a lot and I‚Äôd say for that price it‚Äôs definitely worth a goüéÆ
---
I doubt they have stated this, from what i've seen they have excellent logging build in, absolutely everything is tracked.
---
So yes, they can easily see who duped..
---
Maybe you mean that they can't identify it based on an item, which is probably correct, but irrelevant.
---
Melee is extremely powerful. You can easily swap between one handed and two handed perks once you get passed level 50. Heavy guns are in the same tree. Most your stat points will go into strength by the way. 
---
this game is much broken than other bgs game. but sadly, still fun
---
I never steal loot unless you start attacking me while I'm just trying to do my own thing. I'll kill you and steal everything you own.

Not sure if this is a glitch but it was bloody hilarious when it happened. Whilst doing the "A Real Blast" event at Seneca Rocks Visitor Centre I went around activating all of the lures from one to the next. I returned to the Red Rocket to await the "pests" (\[Danger\] status) only for nothing to happen (eventually \[Hidden\] status). I went around the back of the Red Rocket just to look for junk and I let out a nervous whimper. Around twenty Yao Guais, each around level 28 plus a two star legendary had spawned but were obviously unable to clamber over one another to reach me and so gave up hence I was now \[Hidden\]. 
---
Well boy did they clamber at the sight of me, it was like a game of pass the parcel with me in my power armour being the parcel.
---
So yeah, the glitch is either/both that they get stuck behind Red Rocket and/or are the lures meant to spawn three of each mob? It should be noted that I was alone here (lvl 44 at the time) so no high levels influencing the mobs.
---
Start with your idea and you'll see during your travels.  
---
Luckily, melee and heavy weapon both use Strength perks, so you can invest without any risk and see where it leads you.
---
Have fun :)
---
Yeah, basically players are reading the esm file in an xEdit program, like the ones for FO4 and Skyrim.
---
The game wont be F2P and well im having fun (have played since beta) but im a huge fallout fan idk if you would get the same amount of enjoyment out of it, still i would take it for just 20‚Ç¨
---
We just take it... it's just junk that you picked up recently, so probably not that much. If someone needs screws, we just share with each other anyway.
---
Yeah, GW2 was a good example of an evolving world. FO76 could be the first scifi/post-apoc type to do it though.Decreasing the defcon might just substitute the nukes for something else, like defcon 3 unlocks a hidden armory and defcon 4 gives a orbital platform. I'm just concious we can't have nukes active for more than a few years or the game will feel janky lore wise... Nukes going off 25 years after the great war is one thing, but to have them going off continuously for 50 years... nothing on the planet would be alive at that point.
---
I'll take it for 500. I can meet up tonight to buy it if you're free
---
That dose pa stand for?
---
Changing seasons would be great.
---
How the fuck do I even FIND Mini-Nukes!?!?
---
And plasma cores, ffs!!!
---
DO IT! JOIN US
---
Maybe if someone posts this one more time Bethesda will patch everything in the game people are posting about
---
If I see the person die, whether they're on my team or not, I try to Stimpak them and then squat over their bag (I'm a girl and the dress my character wears helps cover it up from thieves). 
---
If I find a bag all by itself, I stand over it for a moment and look around, then look in it. If it has anything besides junk in it and nobody shows up in my peripheral in about 10 seconds, I dig through it for stuff I want (since only junk drops from death, so finding non junk is an intentional drop). If it's only junk, I'll stand over it and do stuff like heal/feed my character, plan perks, look at quests again, etc., and after a minute or two if nobody comes running up to it, then it's mine.
---
Team policy is that your bag is yours and we protect everyone's bags.
---
&gt;Modus has mods for the scout armour, and i dont think the mods are learnable sadly.
---
In the production wing? Server hopped for 10 times and he/it never sold a single mod for anything.
---
If there is a quick change system for Cards, then they must implement a function to stop it from being available in combat.
---
Don't think of this like FO3 or 4 where you have a "main" quest.  Follow the breadcrumbs left by the Overseer, but take time to explore each area, do the missions, read terminals, listen to holotapes.  The way this game brings the story together as you progress around the map is pretty amazing.  But it's easy to miss for those who are insistent on getting to the end.  It's like rushing through a 5 course meal because you want to see how much the check is going to be.
---
Take your time, take it all in.  It my very humble opinion, it's the best executed story and world-building in the entire franchise.
---
If you want Fallout 5, then this isn‚Äôt for you. There are no NPC‚Äôs. Lore and enjoyment is mainly found through explorations reading notes/terminals as well as the occasional hollotape. It‚Äôs not a ‚Äútraditional‚Äù fallout in terms of quests. However, for people like me who always ignored the storyline/quests and mainly enjoyed the random wandering and discovering things then it‚Äôs great. I‚Äôm a solo player and it‚Äôs very ‚ÄúFallout‚Äù for me. But if you‚Äôre quest driven then not so much. However if you have friends that play and you can roam in a team doing things for shits and giggles then it‚Äôs great for that too.  Free to play is just speculation based on lunchboxes having an atom shop tag. 
---
It's a random event location. If you server hop the same spot, it will change each time
---
I know the feeling of an illness changing what you can do in life. I have end stage kidney disease and require dialysis 3 days per week for 5 hours each time and gaming has been a great help for me.
---
It has helped me cope with it and in truth helped me meet new people. Have been surprised by how many people I have met in games that have problems (not just illnesses) as well and use gaming as an escape 
---
I don't know about raw, but cooked brahmin gives +2 strength and cooked radstag gave +20 carry weight. Deathclaw steaks also give a +2 strength boost, but for much longer. Stingwing filet, does as well, but not sure for how long. 
---
You can stack one meat strength boost (+2) with one alcohol strength boost (whisky is +2) with a chem stregnth boost (like bufftat's +3) with radstag's +20 carry for a short term boost so you can fast travel when you are overburdened. 
---
I may have a hoarding problem...
---
Same sort of annoying "being too quick" thing I noticed with the Gauss rifle. Unholster, charge, fire... fire... ? Hello?
---
Nope. Resets.
---
And if the person purposefully trapped you to make you drop stuff they could steal? 
---
Lol OP ‚Äúrandomly‚Äù lost it 
---
No but its annoying when you are loaded with junk and don't have gear to go back to the nuke zone to retrieve your stuff.
---
Also annoying to login to your camp to find that in a nuke zone and everything is destroyed in seconds.
---
Is it end of the world stuff? No but fixing this is a nice qol feature especially for casuals like me.
---
Don't be afraid to interact with people. The game has an extremely friendly community compared to most online games. Have fun!
---
You can invest perks as u wish, after lvl 50 you can re-invest.
---
Go lvl 1-30 weapon, to research, explore and having fun
---
After that you know what to do, how it go and what you should go for: meele.
---
Start questing, Grinding, Exploring in a good scale and have fun.
---
Be nice and handsome to all other players. Use "g" for quickemotes, if you want
---
Hey there, if your on xbox feel free to add me megamong228 is my GT. I can help with anything from items, ammo and bodyguard services all for free :) This is what i like about this communty... Its the little things in life that make a big difference !
---
That sounds like it is entirely luck based.
---
LoL, you won.
---
It's the mole miners gauntlet that gets me. It would go perfectly with the Excavator Armour.
---
oh i dont do trading and stuff like that really as its about 97% turns out bad
---
Since your on pc, download these quality of life mods:

Chatmod.ba2  
---
BetterInventory.ba2  
---
NoAutoscrap.ba2  
---
pahudfix.ba2  
---
PerkLoadoutManager.ba2  
---
SaveMyStuff.ba2  
---
IconSortingRatmonkeys.ba2  
---
IconTag.ba2  
---
These specific mods have brought life back into the game for me as they should have been essentially been in the game officially. None of the ones I listed are cheaty mods, and I wouldn't recommend downloading any "cheaty" mod unless you really want an easier time farming certain things (i.e. glowing \*insert item here\*). Those mods may or may not up/down the difficulty for you.
---
This
---
On PC press E or R.
---
That's about all the options, hope it helps.
---
Faction *PvP* is coming. And we don't know when, or in what form. If it is as unbalanced as the rest of the PvP, it will be dead on arrival.
---
But if you don‚Äôt want to do this you have the option to build your character any way you like, too. It‚Äôs your choice. Melee is OP, but so is my stealth sniper
---
Sorry, that was my "Norwe english" kicking in, lol
---
Was a bit piss of reading all complains the whole day about TSE's :)
---
It's fine, upvotes don't bring food to the table.
---
Server hop. 
---
I'll mod it for you. Got many prime reciever plans.
---
Spend dem atom points
---
IIRC there is no heavy weapons to be found in the world that are lower level than...20?  25? so you'll be rocking other stuff for a little while &amp; have plenty of time to build up for it.  
---
As others have said take your time, there isn't really anything end-game at the moment beyond farming for better weapons to more quickly farm for better weapons so no point in being in a rush to get there.  Hopefully Bethesda really does roll out some substantial content later this month. 
---
I live at whitesprings so i always log out in a hazmat
---
I think it is all part of persistent world gaming.  Filthy casuals will burn or learn.
---
Doesn't matter if the kid was 9 months, 9 years, 19, or 90. You're still an asshole.
---
Is healing factor that good?  I couldn't tell, cause 300% increase of how much?
---
That's great. Brilliant work. I'd buy it.
---
Don't have a cheat engine running in the background
---
I would always go through the gate, until I discovered that hole in the wall. You can get to the vendor in 30 seconds or less, without having to fight anything.
---
what's the bracketed number between carry weight and caps?  I've seen it on other posts from people as well
---
I start off taking absolutely everything. Then when my stash is full I dump out anything I have huge amounts of. Or if it‚Äôs lots of excess wood/steel/concrete I just build&amp;scrap for the exp. then I just take things I know I use a lot of, or will use a lot of in future. Screws/oil/plastic/lead/acid are my top 5 picks I never put down. I also collect springs for when I get to the stage I need to kit out power armor. 
---
How about SBQ, are you solo launching nuke and killing her with randoms on server? Are you strong egouth to solo\^\^ her?
---
Problem is if you are hard of hearing , female not wanting to deal with silly teens with boners or even unable to actually get voice chat working or lack a mic.
---
On PC we have a chat mod that a very unreal 76 fan made. This thing is pretty much World Of Warcraft chat but for Fallout 76. It even gives ya the ability to setup and run clans.
---
Not sure what for consoles though but they can message one another atleast.
---
Likewise, leave the Fire Breathers Exam cheat sheet in the desk near the exam terminals. 
---
How many duplications did you do?
---
Cube builder reporting in 
---
Loved Fallout 4 as well and I'm having a lot of fun playing 76.  They used most if not all of the models form FO4 so it will feel like coming home.  :)
---
Nukes can land everywhere outside the protected area around Vault 76.  There's a chance, albeit small, that you could log in at any time and be in the middle of a nuke zone. Whitespring and the Fissure just happen to be the two most popular spots, although people are figuring out more creative places to nuke.
---
Ive played alot on ps4,(300+ hours) never randomly lost a weapon.
---
That happened to me during a Scorchbeast Queen fight. Made it back in to armor with about 5% health left. Always wear your Haz-Mat suit into nuke zones!
---
Given that 2 Bethesda community managers have commented on two separate posts of this nature, I think it's safe to say that they're aware.
---
I would have thought you'd, you know, contribute to the existing ones or wait until after a patch with an updated list. Not less than a week after 2 major ones that were already posted.
---
Cough \*Jane Doe\* Cough.
---
Give me proof of your first statement. You are making big claims about this "majority" of people playing like this isn't online, but in every server all I see is players in groups of at least two. That suggests something different.
---
Still, what they *think* doesn't matter. It's a fact that, in an online game like F76, what a player does affect the rest.
---
Damn, you *seriously* play this game for the grind. That's really sad. I expect you to be out pretty soon. So, why did you play the other Fallouts? For the farm, too? There's only so much the main story can give you.
---
Starched genes perk my dude.  Then class freak
---
True. I didn't mean exploiting the bug. it sounds like this guy dropped the armor instead of placing it. So if I got the option to take it, I would assume it's someones cast away. If you drop armour and don't pick it back up straight away, you're basically inviting other players to take it as a gift. Some kind chap gave me the PA I'm using now. 
---
If you drop any gear, I''m going to be keen to pick it up - entirely within the laws of the game. If I can sell it back to the owner who's made a big mistake by dropping it next to me (My character is defo dressed like "the wrong sort", then it would be hilarious to sell it back to them for a pretty price. That's playing as a raider.   
---
Don't like it and play on Xbox one? Then see my bio, message me, challenge me to a duel, and teach me a lesson!  
---
Same. I find the lack of word disturbing.... Granted i love conspiracy theories so in my head canon it's all a big duper trap. (I'm bored at work lol)
---
No trade, I'll search and drop.  I just noticed your post.  Like I said I did it for my friend when he wasn't on (due to illness) I gave my 51b Nuka, to another friend otherwise you could have had that.  I'm like a 60 year old grandad with my eldest grandson now playing.  I don't do grief.  Currently a lvl 105.
---
I just want to put the shovel back down after i use it to do "Buried with Honor"  No guarantees theyre going to go inside the building and check the cash register....
---
&gt;No but its annoying when you are loaded with junk and don't have gear to go back to the nuke zone to retrieve your stuff.
---
Is it really hard to NOT be loaded with junk AND log out right in the middle of Whitesprings every night. No, no it isn't. There's nothing to fix here.
---
Yes and I think it should not allow you to log in to a nuke zone without warning. 
---
Jesus. The PLANS for the shocks?
---
Yeah, I feel like there could be middle ground by having prebuilt display cases where in order to craft them you have to have x number of magazines/bobbleheads/bears and then they show up on a shelf as one solid object that can't be looted.
---
I'm not talking about just whitesprings. I'm level 31 I don't go near there yet anyway. This has happened to me in Charleston, Morgantown and Grafton 
---
I usually claim the workshop for one random plan. Then the defend the workshop quest appears about a minute later. Finish the defend quest for another random plan.
---
After that I usually leave to workshop to its fate.
---
Honestly I see no use for claiming/owning workshops except for the plans. I have never needed anything they provide bad enough to warrant sinking any amount of time into them.
---
Did the frag grenade one for about 100 grenades then felt shitty so dropped them by vault 76. 
---
I never seen that, only had the xbox one x for 2 years, lool
---
Mannequins and racks, yes.
---
The game is just a buggy mess. That is the most likely explanation. 
---
All the duppers logged off cause they would have lost all there shit probably
---
Hah. Yeah. Super Duper, Ammosmith, capping the ammunition workshop, plus fighting high level enemies? Not great advice for a "low level".
---
Massive respect for what you have achieved.
---
ya its not cause of griefing its usually problems on my part bad internet timing and things coming up and just general running out of time
---
[deleted]
---
Except a fix for this doesn't hurt hardcore players and makes the game more appealing to casuals - seems a win win
---
I‚Äôm on my phone
---
I could solo her, wouldn't be quick and would take most of my .44 ammo. My build is not at all good to solo her, but she does melt pretty quick to a prime 2 shot gun.
---
I get disconnected randomly, but it is much much less than my son who is on a PS4 Pro. Yesterday we played about 2 hours. He disconnected four times, I didn't have one disconnect. He got the Pro for Christmas and it seems that since then he has had more trouble with 76 than before on a regular PS4. We play on the same server, on the same internet, and at the same time.
---
So if you maximum the adamantium skeleton,head shot does 0 damage to you?I really hope someone could test it.
---
Thanks! I'll give it a try when I get home from work. 
---
Thats how much the current tab weighs. In that screenshot its to show my 50k+ ammo only weighs 19
---
What outfit it has?
---
Here's a new one.. how about a handmade that fires gamma gun waves at u somehow after  every 2 rounds of 556  and can take out a level 175 in 3 hits ..it was happening weird as hell 
---
Waiting for a hairstyle that doesn't suck.
---
If you have friends to play it with and want to play it for it as a game not as a masterpiece, I love the fallout franchise and I‚Äôm able to look past the problems with this one becuase I like the concept of the game too much
---
2 shot weapons mess up vats.. As well as firing too early after entering VATS. Could explain it!
---
im pretty sure its in the military wing
---
I like 'Atom-Bomb Baby'.
---
When I first heard it in FO4 I thought it was a spoof song they'd commissioned for the game. That and 'Uranium Fever'. I was amazed to find out they were 'real'.
---
ayy
---
I find it unfathomable how someone can have so much time on their hands to play 500+ hours.
---
Given that it's been something like 54 days since launch, that's approx. 9 hours a day every single day without breaks.
---
Obviously doesn't factor in beta but still impressive none the less.
---
Don't know the English words lol. He changes them if one person holds him the other one server hops back in. I want a hunters long coat
---
Ok so the crossbow is not a heavy weapon thanks for testing for me

I've tried to be funny one evening and crouched my way into someone's CAMP. (actually by opening his door; he checked the perimeter and I sneaked inside).  
---
When he was trying to figure out who/what was near his CAMP, I placed a plasma mine in front of his door from the inside. Figured it might make a funny surprise moment to get blown up by a mine, when you walk inside your own CAMP.  
---
He didn't go inside his CAMP, but fast travelled to some other place. The mine blew up, triggered by a CAMP building, which didn't get triggered when the other player was around.
---
So I'm pretty sure mines explode, when out of focus.
---
It's got explosive rounds. And it usually has nice damage but long reload.
---
Whitney Houston was a prophet!
---
He's like me, just drop it in the ground or drop an entire frame with the pieces in it. No actual trade required. 
---
Is that why it does so much damage? It's now at 450, with Expert Rifleman.
---
Kinda low, are you fully spec into rifles and explosives? 
---
Shitting in the woods.
---
I clumsily forgot the level requirements perks!
---
I figured if he was high enough level to have found a 5.56 rifle, he was at least 20-30 which is still relatively low, which is more than high enough to cap the munitions factory with no problem. And high level enemies do go down easy even if you are under leveled, especially with 5.56 caliber weapons!
---
Yea my rule for queen fight is don‚Äôt take loot bags unless it‚Äôs from someone hiding in that area with the workshop had to track down two dudes who looted me during the fight 
---
That's cool, I hope text chat becomes a thing built into the game eventually.
---
Get demolitionist to rank 5 it will double the damage so it does 800+
---
I want that ammo. I got a two shot minigun and 2k ammo went on a test run to harpers ferry. After killing the boss there I had 300 rounds. What are gilded weapons? 
---
&gt;slide between them
---
Ah yes, the 2-inch-square wendigo. Cubigo? 
---
Is it? OK, I thought it was high. I usually see them around 200-ish.
---
So we can tranfer items between characters?
---
Wow! Nice!
---
Get demolition expert (intelligence) and max that out if you haven‚Äôt already, will add to the damage 
---
can't agree with that.  
---
Example:   
---
player A and B go to the queen  
---
player a and b both loot the queen  
---
\-no more mobs-  
---
player a is overweight, so now he is in perk menu and is getting ready to go back to camp  
---
player b decides he wants player A's junk.  
---
player A gets into pvp while in the perk menu before he could even hotswitch perks  
---
player A now is on a carry weight build with no damage perks.  
---
player B steals all of player A's junk after killing him.  
---
This already happens on pc since we have perk management already. The only difference is I can still switch to another build while in combat BUT only while in the perk menu. I'd rather not have hotkeys to switch to begin with however and just only be able to switch from within the perk menu.
---
I was in a group of 3 my last round, I was so frustrated after that that I ended up turning off the console. They are waiting to complete the quest after I walked them through to that point from the DMV. They didn't get disconnected once but I'm going to give it another go tonight and just start from the GC. 
---
if it has low/lowish value, i just move further and won't touch.
---
if it has a high value, i'll wait and cover. If the owner doesn't come, then i'll take it.
---
i hit the motherlode once. 
---
some waaaay overloaded paperbag (over 1000lbs no less with hundreds of any kind of bulks and scraps, for example there was over 50 bulk aluminium :D; yeah over 1000lbs of  just scraps/bulk) was there, near lewisburg trainstation. I so wanted that. But i waited for good 3-5 minutes, because if legit, this was someone's life's work. I'm really sorry for the owner. i hope maybe he just dropped it all because he didn't want to play. dunno. I did share the loot with my son as teammate.
---
Sorry, didnt see the lvl
---
Indeed but until then it does the job very well. Only downside is can't chat to everyone you come across. Not everyone on pc uses it so you find yourself mainly chatting with mated and those on global chat.
---
Okay well I am on now.  I'll look for some and if you want you can try to take it.  I'll add it to a frame as I can carry for 7.5 if I choose to.
---
Military Wing, where Gatling Plasmas and X-01 Mods and whatnot are sold
---
HOW DOES IT TAKE CHEMS
---
@_@
---
Ordonance express lvl 3 mini nukes way 0.6lbs. Must have if you wanna run around with a fatboy.
---
 My team is close friends. We openly share mats, but if you die the rule is to grab it in case we all disconnect or crash. 
---
Ehm i think you misread what they said..
---
Here is a copy:
---
We flag the use of 3rd party applications within Fallout 76 because we do not want players exploiting the game in ways that provide a competitive advantage or negatively impact the servers &amp; gameplay experience of other players. 
---
If someone receives a ban for Modded content, for now they should reach out to us through help.bethesda.net and we will review the appeal. We don‚Äôt need an essay for this.
---
So yes, mods are completely fine and you won't be banned for them, if you are you can contact them to get unbanned.
---
Third party cheating software like cheatengine however, is a bannable offense since that can be used to create actual cheats, something that isn't really possible with ingame mods.
---
&gt; 200 yrs later the scorched obvs got eleminated
---
How? By what? Asteroid? ;P
---
That is what I did on my first (and only) queen fight! Since I was only like 55, I felt I wasn't doing much to help with killing her. But when the trash spawned, I made sure I was taking care of that. Even though I could do shit damage to the queen, I could at least take down the trash. Also made sure to help downed players as often as possible. 
---
Is there files in the Fallout76 install directory?
---
Bethesda wants to know your location
---
Misses entire point and writes incorrect snark: whoosh
---
We also need an option to tab the stash, so different categories of items correspond to different containers if the player chooses. Seems a real waste that I have a tool chest that doesn‚Äôt hold my junk, an explosives crate that doesn‚Äôt hold grenades or ammo, a suitcase that doesn‚Äôt hold my outfits, a locker that doesn‚Äôt hold my weapons, etc....
---
I think you misunderstood my sarcasm, I‚Äôm agreeing with you‚Äôre original post
---
EBay
---
Nope 
---
 And you wrote it to show off? Pathetic, you behaved like assholes...
---
Wasn't aware the servers are region specific but if that's so, its likely there's only a limited pool for you.  The Lever action plans shouldn't be locked, just might be harder to find/come by.
---
&gt; my kids favorite show
---
mm hmmmm ;)
---
This one jacket you get in a asylum but clean and a fisherman overall
---
Good player experience is very subjective. Same too with fun sadly.
---
I'm having fun with the game but I don't feel the same draw that I did with past titles.
---
It's fine if you're into the world exploration and combat and crafting mechanics of 4. The voice acting I would say is the best yet that Bethesda has done in a number of instances. However, don't expect a lot from the questing.
---
If you're the type to find and make your own fun without having to be lead around by the nose, you'll be right at home.
---
I‚Äôve had the inventory literally change in front of my eyes. 
---
For the love of god make sure your scrapping your wires. They have a bug to them and if you store items before removing the wires you can end up with phantom weight.
---
Only way to fix it is to move your camp completey then once you use up all stored items or scrap them to log out and back in.
---
PS4 Pro User here. 
---
Currently got around 220 hours on the playclock.
---
When I started the game it was really stable but the stability took a nosedive starting around the middle of december.  (Level 50+ during that time)
---
Currently I am having massive stability issues with complete game freezes (need to restart the game) or bluescreen crashes. 
---
Mainly these crashes happen either when I am starting to trade with a vendor or in or around whitespring.
---
Whitespring nukezone is a special kinda hell. It is currently that bad that I am no longer visiting Whitespring during a nuke.
---
The last trip into a WS Nuke with two of my buddies ended in a bluescreen every 5 to 10 minutes into the game.
---
Buddy of mine (PS4 Standard) is encountering frequent game crashes as soon as he has taken a workshop.
---
In my opinion the stability is getting worse as soon as you group up - at least from my gut feeling.
---
Charisma is a pretty busted special stat in general. I understand it's the stat for 'groups' which makes sense, except for lone wanderer. But no matter how high your charisma you can still only share one perk card. The problem is that there are so many perk cards, in many stats not just charisma, that are just useless or applicable in very niche situations. It's compounded by the fact that there are a few perks that are just universally great and they are competing for your precious perk card slots. I hope some new cards get released soon, and that weaker ones get a rework. 
---
love it 
---
Ok. Thanks for the info
---
I mostly listen to classical radio too and not because I'm really into it or anything, Seems to go well with walking around aimlessly for hours and hours! I switched over to appalacia radio the other day and do like that station too.  Here's my thing on radio though, can't they add more songs to it with each update?  Doesn't seem like that would be hard and it does get repetitive.
---
Graphic artifact
---
The Death Tambo weighs .5 lbs and does crazy damage to weight even without perks. Imagine if you actually built around unarmed melee.
---
Yes i got 5 houses lol üòÇüòÇ but now its ok
---
I've got a really cool base I think you would like to take a swing at!
---
Sorry, my bad.
---
Don't know, but red rocket workshop is where I mostly see them
---
Wouldn‚Äôt mind just being able to sell it. 
---
 An escalating sound like an energy charge building up. Legendaries don't make this sound for me, so I loot and run after I kill one or wait for it to detonate if I'm at range. 
---
lol i was stumped on this until a few kind reddit users pointed this out.
---
Well  we can try, are you still holding it?
---
Why is everyone in this post ignorant of the meaning of ignorant ;P
---
You've got ot on a frame, right?
---
They could just block for session, leave server, join a new one and continue to travel. They don't have to drop anything.
---
Can happen with any creature, since Morrowind. The engine is older than some players here (which is why exploiters are having a good time with a well know game engine historically full of flaws)
---
I call them slender wolfs, but the more you know about them, the more they come after you
---
My explosive cryolator seems to do a number on them. Not as much as my super sledge though when they land lol
---
Agreed.   I think when first started playing, I was doing the hand-water pump thing too fast or something and kept getting DC-Lag.  I am not sure it caused any issues with anyone else but definitely got me.
---
Is that a pc mod? 
---
Fuck no I do not memorize the scrap counts in my stash, nor do I at this moment know exactly how much milk is left in the jug nor how much coffee I have left, I'd have to go look :P
---
Throw in some proper punctuation next time, since I might very well have misunderstood your answer.
---
My point was more about the possibility to abuse any sort of fast changing system.
---
Your example scenario seems fully acceptable as a risk to be calculated when building a "carry"-spec.
---
You‚Äôre overweight because you eat more than you are supposed to 
---
That is correct. See.. that's what I said too. Haha
---
it is yeah

I think i have 103 missiles on me because i cant bare to throw them away but the missile launcher is so under powered its not worth even having 1
---
It will do around 675 damage at demo expert 5. Explosive damage is about 50% or so on those and demo expert will double that
---
You need to have 2 PS4s
---
I believe only ballistic weapons can get the explosive effect. 
---
Look getting a pet is a big responsibility! Deal with it lol
---
Unarmed benefits from Incisor and Martial Artist? (whichever one speeds up swing speed). Combine that with a couple mutations and my anti armor deathclaw gauntlet will one-shot most things 
---
I also liked that real basic mods didnt need to be learned in fallout 4; a literal genius needs to "learn" how to put nails in a board...really?
---
I had a look into this to be sure but it seems like they are fine with mods that are interface only. They do warn though if you bum up your game then they aint gonna be able to help support wise.
---
So as long as a mod is interface only and does not effect other players it seems to be A ok.
---
So the chat mod is more than fine by them. Ofcourse no harm in just waiting for full mod support i am sure we will see that this year.
---
yes actually. should i just delete them?
---
here I am, stuck in the middle with you.
---
or
---
one fist of iron and the other of steel,
---
if the left one don't getcha, the right one will.
---
(sorry, random thoughts to share on a Monday morning)
---
No, I've absolutely seen energy guns with the Explosive property, just wasn't sure about already explosive weapons
---
Uranium by the commodores is the greatest song during the uranium fever event. Or the greatest song there is.
---
There should AT LEAST be filters we can apply to stash boxes to only show certain items or categories.
---
All these labels and stash box types are pointless when they all show everything.
---
Let me choose to do things like, set the locker to only show clothing, the footlocker to only show armor, the yellow crate to only show explosives, etc. Or however I choose to organize it.
---
Man, it works. I have 23agi build, and I can go to everything, crouch and stab it in face and i deal 3x damage. If i stand behind Scorchbeast Queen and stab her in ass i do 3x damage. If i see scorchbeast i crouch and she dont see me. 
---
Enemies are scripted to go where you were when they "noticed you" so if you are sniper, shoot until you get "caution" then move.
---
LoL.  There is a known enemy-miss feature of XCOM2 that the first shot from enemies always miss.  This was coded that way to make the player feel more ... tough.
---
If you head south along the road, you will also come upon the civil ward reenactment actor and he will have plan for confederate outfit on it.  (Plus black powder pistol with 1 shot).  A great find for anything lower than level 10.   You will dominate everything at that level with the pistol.
---
Definitely an interesting road.
---
Feels like a waste not to hand off the excess.. approaching 180 and almost always overloaded .. not much need for caps... I drop everything for under lvl 50's ... weaps, armor, chems, scrap, legendaries... at 12k caps with nothing to really buy I just palm it off to randoms if my party (who are usually overloaded too) don't want it.. lol.. most of the legendary gear is rubbish and 99.5% gets left behind.. but just coz its rubbish for me doesn't mean it's not the best gear a lower would have so I try to drop as much as possible in popular areas preferably with others around so my unwanted gear is not wasted needlessly lol
---
I now have ever mutation in the game, its an interesting experience, marsupial is definately my favourite, i got it in the beta too for a bit
---
I'm going to have to disagree with you .  Stealth works for me regularly.   Sometimes mobs will randomly walk in my direction and re-aggro, but that's not consistent. 
---
Yesssss
---
oh my bad. idk how to reddit properly lol. i typed it out with with enter presses, but reddit seems to want to stuff everything back into a paragraph LUL.
---
sorry about that. but yeah. when it comes to pvp, i get how having hot swap buttons would be bad. at the same time though if everyone had the same features it might? not be so bad. the biggest factor would be level at that point since you'd have more maxxed out cards then. even then... quick swapping would be hard on myself since i play the game with a controller. they'll more certainly be some kind of advantage there to a kb/m player.
---
it's pvp though, and pvp is not good so :shrug:
---
Skyrim did that and I loved it.  I had a huge collection of cool weapons on the walls.
---
My camp is at overseers camp and he travels past there abit. Think i have everything he can sell not even sure what exactly makes him so good.
---
Now the Charleston rare vendor mmm he is the good one to find.
---
As i said, Im off work with injury. I've had literally nothing else to play. It is a crazy amount of play, and i've surprised myself how much i'm still playing.
---
I have an explosive cryolator... are you saying that is good for them?
---
Are you in a full set of shadowed armour? Also, what is your agility at? Enemies perception and your agility are also contributing factors. Only thing that I ever have a problem seeing through my stealth are scorchbeasts because of their super high perception.
---
Forget words like "efficiency" or phrases like "the current meta" If you see a hill with cool looking shit miles away, go explore.  
---
Switching from hyper efficient Mythic+ on World of Warcraft to this game was a very refreshing change of pace.
---
Same, then I got the Bunker Buster with triple barrel and started firing them as a way to get rid of them.
---
Later realized that my damage had gone WAY down because of this and it was actually hurting me.  So ended up dropping the missiles from then on.
---
Ocassionally I keep the mini-nukes to launch out of the daisy cutter because I want a little fun.
---
Pretty sure taming another animal will get rid of the previously tamed one.
---
This is the first ive heard of such a minigun, what effects does it have?
---
You're taking a raider leader at their word, robot or not. A raider boss isn't gonna be like "Yeah I'm a robot. I can't take my chems anymore. Totally sucks." Raiders know that chems give an advantage, and thus, if the leader can't take chems, a HUMAN raider could easily win a fight by pumping themselves with whatever chems they've got (in flawed raider logic). Chems = Power.
---
That's weird because I did notice price changes from charisma, so very minor but they did
---
So you being in my server is the cause if all my auto stim wooden armour woes! Stay away from my Brahmin.
---
Vendor inventories are player specific and get rerolled every time you log in, regardless of same server or not. Source: me, "jumping" servers to check a vendor by leaving and re-joining the server my gf was playing on.
---
Wish we had an option in settings to not be placed on servers where we can't have our camp spot..
---
A simple server check so we don't keep logging in and out until we get our spot.
---
u/LoneVaultWanderer thoughts bro?.
---
Stealth works fine for me mate. The other day a scorchbeast landed a few feet in front of me sniffed around and flew off. My agility is 19 and I didn't have any chameleon/shadowed armour on.
---
Are you using a suppressed weapon?
---
Similar story.  3* 2 shot gatling plasma from Phoenix for like 300 caps
---
They break fast but what the hell, I'm a heavy build.  It shreds a landed scorchbeast in 5 seconds.
---
The only reason i keep them is cus i have the heavy gun weight reduction perks so theyre actually the lightest weapons i carry now
---
Must be broken for just you then. I can sneak up to almost every single enemy in the game and shoot them from point-blank range. Not that I do because I'm a ranged stealth build.
---
But no it is not broken. Bethesda doesn't need to Cave to your childish demand and fix something that's not broken.
---
A pet is for life, not just for Christmas!
---
For these I have Cheet and Limbs:
---
-Combat Armor, Leather, Raider, Trapper
---
I only have Limbs for Metal.
---
This is kind of how Ultima online used to do it.
---
I think it worked well. When you killed the criminal, you would cut off their ear and bring it to the guards for the bounty.
---
Did it? Because I couldn't decide between Double or Bow. Double says it does more dmg but the number didn't change for me, whereas Bow says it has piercing so I just went with that.
---
Did you notice an actual increase in dmg despite no change in the number? Or did your dmg number actually change?
---
ahh yes. correct. i tend to forget about energy weapons.... since ya know... they're kinda bad in 76. (they're all really bad tbh, except for the gauss rifle but then ammo is heavy unless you also get batteries included).
---
Yup I don't quite have the agility you have, but am still able to be completely stealthed from a scorchbeast for as long as I want, and pretty much most creatures
---
Thanks. I have 2 brothers I play with on FO76. Ill use one of them as the middle man.
---
Arguably just as fun, but with less glory
---
Long bois are the devil. No idea what it is but normally Ive only seen them in nuke zones so far.
---
Im more pissed off by the fact of this game being so shit
---
&gt;Dysentery
---
Anyone who has served in SE Asia or Africa can attest that this is simply not true:
---
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysentery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysentery)
---
Dysentery does not require blood in the stool.  I had exposure to bacillary dysentery daily for months at a time, and suffered from amoebic dysentery regularly, along with giardia, e. coli, and a host of other diseases.
---
It doesn‚Äôt have any special effects, it‚Äôs just a ‚Äúpaint‚Äù
---
/r/DeconShowerthoughts
---
No, i got tagerdy‚Äôs id though
---
Crappy game code
---
r/fo76bazaar and r/fo76market
---
For a normal scorchbeast I just use my gauss rifle. From sneak while in [CAUTION] it's about 10 well placed shots. I killed three the other day checking out that place near thunder mountain on the south side of the lake. I felt pretty good killing all three of them on my own.
---
I got DC'd during the Order of Mysteries: Novice quest and now its bugged.  I cannot progress.  So feel fortunate.
---
just gonna share some ideas.
---
mine the area then aggro the windego, though with there jump/dash you might get wrecked by your own mines but worth a try.
---
the other one is to stack up on chems, psycho, med-x, are the ones i remember off the top of my head but there is atleast one more dmg one i cant recall its name 
---
and the last option is to find power-armor just a frame will give you a good boost in damage-resistance. 
---
I feel the same! I play on Xbox one (Lady Rot Roh) and I can honestly say I‚Äôve had 10 times more positive and friendly interactions than I have negative ones! :) I am now level 55 and I regularly try to give back to players that helped me back when I was a little noob. It‚Äôs times like that when I see where Bethesda were trying to go with this game... ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Thank you guys looks like I have to buy it now

I'm only LV 14 and I get by pretty well too. I'm not invisible but I get more than a few shots off before I'm discovered. If the enemies are low enough in level I can clear a whole mob at range.

I just got that same role but on a smg. Not sure if I wanna give it a try or not

You know, there is a stuffed animal prize from Camden you can get with the tokens, I wonder if this is a room decoration or another teddy bear that turns into a bag.

ahh good to see people still crying over things that aint broken
---
I feel you, started the game with a friend who have chosen to quit after reaching the first overseer camp. Since then, I've managed to build a small team of people and the game quality skyrocketed instantly. We're always on Discord helping/grouping each others, sharing finds and gear. We're Italian so probably it doesn't fit for you, but if you still wish to catch up just send me a PM
---
I also suggest you to join the Fallout76 trading HUB Discord, over 3k people selling/trading, calling for server nukes (awesome) and LFG aswell. That trading hub plus my gaming friends made the game "complete", since it was lacking all the multiplayer things needed for an online experience.
---
Ok will add you now 
---
Perfect
---
Just got Marsupial yesterday - long time mutation holdout here.  I'm not a fan of the hyper active roof jumpers I see out there but the ability to jump higher and that extra carry weight is so delicious.  I can deal with the negatives so I don't have to run Class Freak with it.  The single best mutation out there by far.
---
I didn't know it allowed you to jump higher in PA - that's what sealed the deal for me.  Now I know how all those guys I see jumping around in PA in the Fissure Prime weren't actually using jetpacks, just Marsupial.
---
*shrug* ya they're not great, you're right. Never were that great, but definitely got nerfed in 76. The new Plasma Gatlings absolutely melt Scorchbeasts, but they also melt themselves.
---
And I have a lotta fun with my Cryolators, but that's mostly because I have Christmas T51 and I like pelting stuff with snowballs in it. But beyond that they're mostly trash.
---
reeeee, brotherhood!
---
As others said, fun and enjoyment is subjective. Now, with that out of the way, I'll say this. Keep in mind I've been playing since beta.
---
The game is bugged, yes, just like any BGS game. The difference is you can't go back to a previous save. Having said that, I've only encountered one bug which I describe as game breaking, and with help from other redditors, managed to fix it.
---
As for fun? To me, and this is just my opinion, is that it's so good that it's insanely addictive. Don't rush it, and enjoy it for what it is, and honestly speaking, it will give you tons of fun. Yes, there is hate especially by Youtubers, then again they need an easy bandwagon to jump on and rake in views.
---
Give it a go...and better yet, try to make a friend or two in game, and this game goes from "good" to "amazing".
---
It's Duping Day.
---
I dont have tamed pet, but what about killing it and then build over budget? Is it posible?
---
Can you collect it like you can dirty/boiled/purified water?
---
It's a $20 game so no reason not to try it. Just don't expect a $60 game...
---
Or just log out/log back in.
---
There are a number of strange visual "reversals" from FO4 that are counter-intuitive. I have tried to ignore them, I give up, here's an example:
---
Look at the Hunting Rifle. As you advance in Gunsmith skill and mods learned, there are a dozen stocks for it.
---
All of the "high-tech" looking advanced stocks that should be good for recoil are instead good for hip fire accuracy, which no one except Super Mutants use a sniper rifle for.
---
The only good Sniper Rifle stock is the plain solid wooden lo-tech model that should actually have the worst recoil but instead has the best @\_@
---
yer killin' me smalls
---
I had that and then switched genders, so now my character always makes girl sounds. Plus being able to wear all the outfits without looking silly (to me) is a bonus.
---
The only one that shows up in the forest is scripted, near Morgantown Airport as it isn't aggressive it won't attack.
---
If it did spawn somewhere, you should screenshot it or something because IF if did, it could be a glitch of some sort.
---
I'm a bit skeptical about this. What level are you btw

Killed it and got a normal hunting rifle, some missiles and a launcher.    I was expecting something at least even if level 1.
---
My first thought was "terrible", but the more I think about it, the more I like it
---
Thats what i call clickbait 
---
What gauss rifle do you have?
---
Regarding eye color:
---
* When I completed landview lighthouse quest, the friendly mothman had purple eyes, so that checks out as passive.
---
* I have had vengeful mothman visit my CAMP twice and immediately hostile, but with yellow/orange eyes, so I don't think its only red that's aggressive.
---
* I saw a mothman in the wild with red eyes, but it just sat there and rocketed into the sky when I got anywhere near it, never came  back. Could be I just didn't aggro it in time to fight it.
---
I should have mentioned I'm in the UK. I can't speak Italian in any meaningful way but if your group is fine with English?
---
Would your group actually be interested in grinding nukes though?
---
I bought this game a few days ago and ashamed to say that I haven‚Äôt seen much sunlight since. I start working again today so I wont be able to play again till maybe end of the week. But yeah, this game is hella fun . 
---
What level are you? I got an armor piercing handmade I can sell for cheap:)
---
It really be like that
---
I have been killed with One Hit from a heavy Melee, while controlling a public workshop, granted I was only around level 36 at the time, and not in PA.
---
I have on a couple of occasions, killed a friend who sometimes gets "wanted" for damaging his own CAMP, and even though I'm not a melee build, I can take him down 90% with the 1st hit from an All Rise.
---
Tse shotgun for real money? Lmao seen people that have dozens of that duped trash in their inventory. Everything is duped now from the best 3 star weapons to the best 3 star armor... economy is completely broke. Caps have no value. When pvp becomes a thing every duper is going to be outfit in full sentinel/assassin armor and will be nearly unkillable.. 
---
Explosives need a nerf is what needs to happen. They need to operate as described (AOE damage), not simply double or triple the damage output of a single bullet on a single target. 
---
It makes heavy weapons less viable tho. I just want them to be a semi decent option
---
West-Tek has the AWOL Armaments event.  That usually has up to 3 legendary mobs plus 1.  Sometimes you only get 1 legendary mob outside, but its usually a 3 star in that case.  However you can go inside the building and get another legendary mob after the event is done.
---
Also the Graphton Monsters spawn up north near that golf course and drop good supplies.  No legends really but &lt;shrug&gt;
---
that has literally never happened to me. I've never lost a mod I bought or found because it took the mod over any other resource I've had. 
---
And I've had moments when I couldn't continue crafting because I ran out of steel or wood. But my mods were still there. I'm not saying it doesn't happen. 
---
Also I never said that it's acceptable. What's ludicrous is people argue like that. Trying to suggest something that wasn't said. Of course it would be better if Mods only junked down if you decide to junk them down. 
---
I learned the hard way about Hardened Masses. Normally when I get back to my camp, I scrap everything, and store it. Didn't realize that it would auto scrap the HM. Because things like beer bottles, deathclaw hands, and more don't auto scrap because you have to use them as is, to make other things. 
---
I hope they change this, in the future, but for now, having learned my lesson once, I know to be careful. See how it works? Make a mistake, or the game missed something, you learn. 
---
The OP has spent time in the reddit. The fact that he and many others seem to run into problems because they don't pay attention. They button mash and then get upset with the consequences. I sold the wrong thing, I wasn't looking and dropped my best weapon. 
---
You know, if they put in the ability to tag items don't trade/sell/drop, guess what? There are still going to be people that do that, and then complain, because they forgot to tag something not to sell. 
---
I'm amazed that some people can put so much effort into researching the best builds, the best weapons, the best armor, the best anything in a game. And yet, continually run into problems that a paying a little attention to and thought would prevent. 
---
Try server hopping
---
it's affected by all melee perks too. it was the same in fo4. let's you have 80% dmg boost in perk cards, though most run with rank 2 of melee one hand cards and full fist card, this leaves you at 65% if u do that but allows you to have 75% armour piercing and increased swing speed- so it's worth it. my unarmed build does like 2000-3800 dmg a shot, and swings much faster than anything else. two handed one does like 1800-2200 or something, and swings a bit slower. raw dmg is higher with unarmed, but it makes you die a lot unless you know how to play it. one shots literally everything except sorch queen. if u get attacked by scorched beasts that don't land ur fucked. unarmed is also affected by twisted muscles and talons so that's 50% bonus dmg, adrenal action and bloodied add together and you get like 6x dmg, with a full set of unyeilding you get 15 more strength at low health, radicool gives you 4 or 5 more with rads past 50% I don't exactly remember- anyway you end with nearly 40 strength. nerd rage gives you 20% more dmg, bloody mess gives 15%. in the end you just shit on everything, but if ur amour sucks u die. not the best for general mobbing but I love the build, now I generally play heavy explosive harpoon build sin e I'm farming alot, and I can just swap out my cards between my unyeilding bloody two hand, unarmed, or heavy explosives. all of the builds are pretty similar and use the same stats spread. sorry for the long reply, trying to open ur eyes to the glorious unyeilding unarmed. gotta say between my Power Fist and my sledge both with bloody swing speed and increased strength, I would choose the Power Fist for raw dmg output.
---
Guess I'll try that more when I get back on 
---
Xbox
---
With skeet shotter you can snipe the scorchbeasts out of the sky with a shotgun from long range.... :)
---
So you already tried it atleast once?
---
No it doesn't.  Chemist only doubles the chem and ores are no chems, neither is gunpowder. To make sure, I just checked. Without Chemist, got 5 scrapes of lead. With chemist I got 5 scarps of lead. 
---
With 15 charisma and max hard bargain you get great prices. I definately see the difference when I go back to Mongo, the Meatshield.
---
That is amazin, thx for sharing.
---
Only the Minigun has a "Gilded" Paintjob (at least until the foreseeable future). And considering it's the Minigun, that's probably why you haven't heard of it until now. 
---
I'd kill for golden power armor paint, though. Maybe even let us use gold scrap to craft gold paints on weapons and armor
---
Also not beeing able to make screws out of crap steel 
---
Thanks for writing that story about your douchebaggery. 
---
You can sell junk if you bulk it together at a tinker station. 
---
How did you lost it? 
---
Did you drop it on the ground? and then disconnected?
---
That's where my effing mods keep going?!?! Jesus Christ! I had no idea I was assuming bugs 
---
Yeah Johnny's version is terrific. I also love [Dylan and Joan Baez's live versions from '75](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIGwrFazuhA)
---
I've caught him walking the road north toward Pleasant.
---
Yea it really stinks, I was holding on to some valued mods for trading. Had a guy come to my camp and everything just to realize they were all gone.
---
Max it out a 10 for weapons and armour and don't let them pick up or craft anymore until the others are scrapped 
---
Did you do the DMV quest?
---
I had the same thing. Had to talk to the gutsy on the second floor of Camp McClintock. He gave me the military certificate. Then go to the computer and register at fort defiance. 
---
Not blazed enough to witness a mythical monster.
---
West-Tec Research center, usually in my experience spawns atleast one 3 star legendary, different story if it will drop a 3 star weapon.   
---
Horde Events in the Mire, Cranberry and Savage Divide. Although triggering them is sometimes bugged.   
---
AWOL Armaments, those damn mister gutsys are my nemesis even still.   
---
That Sons Of Dane event in the compound where you need to play the instruments. 
---
So you brag online for being A asshole? Why?
---
nope, it just means that you'll never be crippled, semi-blinded etc... 
---
&gt; the robots in Fallout can't even seem to figure out if I'm a ma'am or a sir
---
To be fair, you *do* get to change that around at will.
---
Pick me! I can be on tonight 
---
If you‚Äôre good with melee, get yourself a super sledge and PA. My first go with Wendigos was a 1v2 and I rocked it by constantly moving, blocking, and swinging.
---
And the fact that vandors control the entire economy yet can only afford 200 caps per real world day. That's probably damn near a month in game. 
---
Trying to get rid of it as quickly as possible as it's taking too much weight. I'm actually usually the excavator carry weight glitch right now just to move
---
How do you join a random group?
---
They're just a tougher version of a ghoul.  What level are you?  What combat perks do you have?  What weapon(s) do you have that are supported by perks?  What platform are you playing on?
---
Disagree, it's totally worth buying.
---
You need to download the GIT GUD patchfix. Bethesda only released it to those worthy of true Stealth.
---
That would be great üòÄüëèüëç
---
Will test tonight.  My tired old machine is struggling and maybe this will help.
---
Gotcha. Sorry. Getting ready for work. I'm sure someone will help you. 
---
I've strayed away from melee since I started to amass so much ammo. I'll take a quest break and work on my melee a bit. Any suggestions on chems to use? 
---
Tesla Rifle Charging barrel works fine here -  PS4 Pro. 
---
If they could do something about ash pile enemies being unlootable, that would be nice. 
---
I doubt this but does chemist work with flux?
---
Yes that would be great üòÄüëçüëè
---
PS4 normal
---
I beg you bethesda please fix base building. I can't place my home anymore and its not like before, this time you literally cannot place it. It just has the warning saying its floating all the time when its not floating.
---
But then how will you get rid of the second one? :D
---
So why not move your base and take 10 minutes and delete all the extra shit?
---
I just checked and it seams you are right. The article I read on it was apparently wrong.
---
Buy a mutation serum? I paid 500 caps for mine.
---
She was banging.  I‚Äôd still hit it.  We‚Äôre of an age, after all.
---
If you're on PC add jex_pvp
---
I'm not in game, but message me here and I'll give you a hand if it's soonish
---
just get 2 shot explosive 50 cal 
---
I've got no problem with stealth. Is yout armor lightweight? Armor weight has a direct affect on sneaking.
---
Probably not what you want to hear, but I was doing Monster Mash last night and round 3 glitched and never officially ended so the mask wasn't taken away.
---
I have unequipped and reequipped it to see if it would stay and I have relogged.  Still in inv and wearable.
---
Not saying it's completely his fault but HE is the one that chose to place all if them there
---
Hadn‚Äôt really used chems much (besides Buffout for carry weight). What guns and ammo you have?
---
Too funny. Oh, I loved that game.
---
No I haven't 
---
Players can't damage pets, only mobs can. And they will just respawn to your base upon re-login. My question is what happens if you tame another pet and he dies before reaching the camp. My guess is it will not replace your current one so no solution in freeing up that budget.
---
Be Batman, prep time! Land mines, gernades, psychotics, whatever, just have fun with it
---
Tried that, he just says congrats and that's it
---
I ran into the spawning then dying cows as well. I just chalked it up as a glitch in the matrix. Since I assume all of vault 76 people are actually hooked up to a computer simulation. That's why there are only robots and monsters alive the computer simulation can't emulate people's emotions.
---
So, fake, then.
---
Sure I agree with killing in 1 hit without slap-damage.
---
Sorry I am talking about 1-shotting someone that is non-pvp flagged and has slap-damage protection.
---
I have seen declarations about people killing others with 1 hit on non-pvp.  I seriously do not believe that.
---
But wanted/pvp flag, sure.
---
It‚Äôs like typing Google into Google. You crash the internet.
---
Killing it doesn't seem to reduce the budget. :(
---
Happened to me a few days ago. Managed to get into the Whitespring Resort "in time". Had 0HP but managed to live!
---
Sorry. Good luck. Let us know how it turns out. No wonder you're frustrated. 
---
3 nukes is the internet crashing lol
---
What other legendary weapons/armor are you offering?
---
What happens if you move your camp and pet dies trying to reach the new location? Will it still respawn to your new canp after re-login?
---
I can speak in English no problems, not sure about others. We mostly farm whitespring nuke and post nuke, plus occasional SBQ wherever available. Add me in game, we'll sort something for sure :)
---
To be fair all you need is 5/5 explosive perk card and you are good to do a jack of all trades character who uses all guns and can decimate all.  This is due to how OP explosive affix is.  Hopefully it is nerfed.
---
Would you like a group to play with on PC?
---
I‚Äôm sorry you feel this way.  I still really enjoy it.  
---
Depends on what size spring you need. You can‚Äôt interchange the springs from drum brakes and the springs from a mechanical pencil any more than you could interchange the screws from a toy car with the screws in a desk fan, or the springs from a clipboard with the springs from a pogo stick. 
---
Both of your logic is flawed and much more so than mine. 
---
1500 caps or a combo of legendaries
---
My main carry is a hardened hunting rifle (68 damage) and shotgun (I think 58-60 damage). I have plenty of ammo for most other weapons stashed away
---
What platform, I can kill those things ez
---
You cannot take everything in sight.  Eventually stash gets full, vendors have no more caps, and you end up encumbered and start dropping stuff.
---
The way to play is stock 70-100 junk components, and when running low of any one, flag it.
---
Then as your walking around, any item flagged, you pick up.   I often have like 4-5 things flagged as I go around (Springs and Screws always it seems).
---
When trying to learn mods for Leather, I flag cloth and leather.
---
I haven't logged on in like a week. Got a Switch and sucked into Diablo. I do play on getting back to FO76 today. That said, i forget what combat perks I have, I can respond later when I can confirm. I'm mid twenties level, and on PC.
---
Sorry for vague information, just forgetful 
---
I mention it because it‚Äôs a minor annoyance this is the internet.  I wanted to vent and connect with other.
---
Shotgun is probably your best bet. Enforcer and concentrated fire perks may be good, focus on the legs.
---
I'd much rather have a Jetpack on my Power Armor
---
That's actually a good idea. I'll start to collect mines and just litter the place. 
---
Because I can't get into the game to do that
---
I recently noticed that a lot of my Challenges for Atoms are bugged. One says to find locations but several of the ones not checked in the challenge is marked on my map as found. The Challenge wont update if I go there.
---
That's how you get a government ID
---
Just a normal one that just happened to come with nearly all the best mods. 
---
ok.
---
So that is wtf is happening!
---
Thank you, I thought hardened mass would be aid and thought it must be deteriorating before I get back.
---
Bethesda's unorthodox business practices aren't exactly helping their situation. The game itself is another issue all together but it all ties together. 
---
You can't man everything has been devalued like mad unless your lucky enough to get a TSE weapon or certain types of 3‚òÜ armor. But even then they have been devalued insanely.
---
Bloody serums for 100 - 300 caps is bullshit. Getting TSE weapons takes weeks of grinding and really good luck not ok with 2k for bad versions and 4-5k for good ones.
---
I closed my store and became very annoyed at Betheada for not doing anything to even deter people doing it..
---
Believe so
---
I have a black powder rifle and a handful of ammo for that. Would that work somewhat? 
---
How do I get the quest? Recruitment blues isn't in my quest list and nothing is coming up 
---
Pressures on to get to this point of the quests soonish then! 
---
exactly, bethesda played no part in the design or manufacturing of the dark rum yet "its all bethesdas fault for not making a glass bottle." im sick of these peoples shit. some stuff they complain about is correct but then they talk about the lunch boxes and how theyre "loot boxes" with no actual proof, its blatant slander against bethesda 
---
Doesn't bother me, but it sure is silly :p
---
Yes, but a drink has nothing to do with the game. The atom shop and the bait and switch with the bag does. 
---
I'm pretty sure if you just go to the DMV the quest will pop
---
Haha
---
I was outside thunder mountain plant standing there and a mole rat fell from the sky. Dead as a dodo. Another time, I had a dead dog fly through the window of my house while I was crafting... My house is three stories high and over a river... Weird shit keeps happening
---
I‚Äôm still working on it, and the helmet too. Ive been server hopping at the crash site in watoga, but I haven‚Äôt been checking the outposts. I‚Äôll do that too :) I appreciate the offer!
---
Have you gotten the BoS paint for your T-60?
---
Gotta place your camp down again... Yeah it sucks if you‚Äôre happy with your camp build but it was the only way I got my deathclaw to go away lol
---
I think putting up bounties from your own caps would incentivize killing lower level players since they wouldn't have the caps to put on a bounty like someone whose been playing longer. It also penalizes getting killed since you have to pay up. 
---
Ah I'm on PS4 that sucks
---
This deserved to be an in-game joke.  Class dropped in VTU registration system, etc.
---
Boooooo
---
Fully Immersive
---
But like if you can, get Slugger 2 and either a sledge or supersledge. Easier time.
---
Update: Don't think I made it clear that I had placed my camp site thing somewhere else in OP expecting to find previous camp in blueprints to just drop wherever I desired. So when I logged out that day I had a floor and a bed to my name. However, logging in the next day I planned to go around farming wood and steel and knick knacks to rebuild. But when I opened my blueprints again, low and behold the previous camp in it's entirety was there. That being said if anyone else finds themselves in this situation maybe try logging out and in again too see if it appears. However better safe than sorry by manually making the blueprint and storing. 
---
Thanks for the help everyone.
---
Why charge so much? 800 caps is a lot for some lower players and seems like a scam.
---
I have ghoulish and rad sponge... worst bug for me
---
I was on that server, but too far away, and over encumbered, so I didn't get to join the fight.
---
I would love to help you though, I can kill just about about anything and a wendigo is near the bottom on the hierarchy of hard enemies
---
Oh, so you think Bethesda didn't have a say in the design of the bottle? 
---
We got a badass here, huh?
---
Well, it's the thought that counts. You'll be with me in spirit. 
---
That's not a gun its a pee shooter...
---
This is a gun!.
---
;)
---
Where is it?
---
Never waited more than 5 mins or so, but yea you get left alone
---
If you prevent the server from lagging out, won't matter, the weapon wont duplicate.  So I can see this as working.
---
Put a 30 second pause between clicks enforced by the server, it ignores any requests unless 30 seconds apart.
---
Prevent lag on the server, prevent dupes.
---
1. PC
---
2. Wolfdale
---
3. nope
---
4. several issues: (most of them are really pathetic and i am really sad bethesda has no QA department with common sense)
---
   1. every now and then when i start the game, i am required to log in, while i launch it from the crappy/buggy bethesda launcher. --- FIX THIS ! its really annoying.
---
   2. the launcher opens at a fixed size and not minimized. --- your launcher is shit.. it deserves no place on my pc if it keeps resetting its position and place when it starts up, also i want to start it minimized --- PLEASE PROGRAM THE LAUNCHER PROPERLY SO IT WILL REMEMBER SETTINGS/SIZE/POSITION.. the entire world is doing this, pretty sure there is SOMEONE with common sense at bethesda who can explain them how this works.
---
   3. when i start fallout using the shortcut, it launches the game TWICE ---  FIX THIS ! its pathetic that a game starts twice when u use a shortcut instead of the above mentioned crappy launcher.
---
   4. the ingame music is turned off, but the main menu music is allways on. --- FIX THIS ! (the new song is crap compared to the F4 version anyway, and i dont like music in the game, i prefer my own over yours)
---
   5. SERVER HOPPING; come on, you guys cant be this ignorant.. just make vendors sell the stuff they are supposed to and remove the crappy RNG, over 300 server hops and i never saw any jetpacks for any power armor in any of the stores that are supposed to sell them, yet you do allow people to duplicate hundreds of other items by not fixing the bugs (that also make the server crash for everyone else on top...))
---
a lot more issues, mostly..  plans,.. make some indicator to let us know which ones we've learned... (there is NO WAY noone in your internal testing has not said this before the launch)
---
Charleston. South East of Camp McClintock.
---
By giving everyone the same end tier, OP weapons, you are pretty much breaking the game for everyone. Their current build will be useless, and most would switch over to a shotgun build, causing a lack of diversity in playstyles.
---
I see your point of flooding the market.. But all that does is give the weapon to everyone, potentially increasing the amount of duping by giving them something TO dupe. The appeal may drop of the shotguns, but that doesn't change anything for the other weapons. The best change would be to decrease the damage output of those weapons, or to somehow remove the explosive weapon attribute from the explosive damage buff perk unless it's actually an explosive weapon (grenades, missile launcher etc) 
---
Thanks, I'll give it a shot next time I'm on 
---
Yes, I completely agree with you on that one, I had someone attack me with a Perfect Storm, and it was doing virtually nothing, kind of  funny, the guy wasted about 500 rounds of ammo to do 1% damage 
---
Holy shit, a girl stating she's single in an online game. Boom. 1000+ replies. 
---
Also: Stop saying "girl gamer". All of us male players are also just "players". not "male gamers".
---
I can make the freestanding TV. Don't have a plan tho. I'll make one at your workshop for free when I get home. I get off at 3pm EST
---
I'll take it off your hands GT aGraciousGod
---
AWOL Armaments has a guaranteed 3 star major gutsy as the last mob.
---
Other events in the mire and cranberry bog have high level monsters, but the legendaries aren't guaranteed as far as I can tell.
---
Shouldn't even need a stack over 100 unless you're using a lot of nades/knives, and even then, if we could just have separate stacks of 100 would that help?
---
I'm on now
---
wow!
---
Nice. That'll work. I'm in xbox though, are you?
---
I think it also doesn't work on super sledge.
---
Yesss, I'm a mutant PA heavy gunner and I run all three of these mutations, my reloads are so much faster and I'm extremely mobile
---
Joining, much appreciated.
---
and this is the textbook case for fanboying.
---
Bethesda most certainly had an input on the dark rum bottle design.
---
to deny otherwise is just stupidity.
---
Have you played ark?
---
How about fixing the servers stabilization first. Then add cool stuff.
---
It's easy to buy from one of the vendors in the whitesprings shopping center - I've seen it many times. It's just a suggestion...
---
Must've been a 3 star legendary, I'm never wrong. Especially on the internet!
---
Nice, thanks for the tip :)
---
850 caps

May have to join again. I'm server hopping vendor Greg in grafton sorry. But no problem man. I've seen some people on here lose theres and since I got a free extra one I mind as well pay it foward
---
You have to do 76 surely! üòÅ
---
I have literally had enemies bump into me and run around me while crouched. 
---
Not saying stealth functionality is flawless, but it‚Äôs definitrly not ‚Äústealth doesn‚Äôt work‚Äù all caps + angry expletives‚Äù
---
I‚Äôm just tired of youtubers. YouTube is weaponized cancer. While they may have relevant things to say about Bethesda‚Äôs crazy marketing, they all claw onto the same content, try to one up each other for views, and end up blowing everything up in misleading or disproportionate ways. It‚Äôs beyond this game and Bethesda, it‚Äôs every game and company at this point that just gets universally shit on. Hell, even the Outer Worlds is getting hate from the YouTube crowd, and Obsidian is heading that game. 
---
I‚Äôm all for trying to make an honest review, but that becomes hard for someone when they have to try and compete with all the other content creators. That and they‚Äôre usually unforgivably annoying in their presentation, which makes their videos borderline unwatchable.
---
I remember playing Dying Light as one of my first games I got with my PS4, along with the original Destiny and The Evil Within... man, they were all overall really great games
---
The first rule of Salisbury Steak Club is that you don‚Äôt talk about Salisbury Steak Club. 
---
1. holy shit, that is a lot of flux to craft all that ultracite ammo. 
---
2. why is the prime combat rifle chambered in .44 instead of .45?
---
Yep üëç.
---
That‚Äôs why when you kill them they drop the parts, when scrapped bring black titanium for excavators.
---
Currently have a low level melee named ‚ÄúRocky‚Äù you may have just convinced me to go unarmed for his name sake!
---
Oh, might have to check. My base is not too far from whitesprings.
---
This is so sad. Can we hit 50 kids

F
---
A burn from a hotter source than all three nukes combined. Get rekt Bethesda.
---
Yea it happens sometimes. Very common with turrets in nuke silos
---
I dropped it behind a level 34 absorbed in his Tinker workbench at a claimed workshop, along with all the 5mm i had on me. I left it in a pool of light. Hopefully he saw it when he turned around.
---
I tried waving my arms and carrying on like a foo' for 5 minutes before giving up and dropping it lol. Maybe he thought someone who was actually there to kill him wouldn't shoot if he pretended they weren't there?
---
or just afk who knows
---
1) Make pacifist mode on by default. 
---
2) Make "P" key to toggle between pacifist mode on/off.
---
3) Show Pacifist mode on UI
---
4) Remove revenge option. 
---
5) People who want to attack wanted, should go to bounty board and take Wanted note from board that toggles them to be bounty hunter for that Wanted. This removes slap damage from bounty hunter &amp; means bounty hunter can't hide behind slap damage. When bounty is claimed, bounty hunter is toggled off from hunter and wanted can't initiate revenge mode. 
---
6) Only players or who's property is getting attacked, should have option to attack in self defense without having to pick up the bounty note from the board.  
---
Except they'll be $12 each and only apply to one weapon, so they won't
---
It doesn't work in combat, but outside of combat, it's practically instant healing 100%.

Radiation.

Sittuation is starting to be so bad that we may need a total wipe. Now remember that duping TSE is not the only duping problem.

Kill mole miners at say blackwater mine, scrap the moleminer gauntlets they dropped and you will have tons

Who saying shit about outer worlds? All I ever hear is that obsidians outer worlds will shit all over FO76 even though they are completely different games.

I killed a lot and nothing is almost funny haha

i dont even have a hard bargain and i sell raw fluxes from nukes to earn atleast for 800 caps
---
Theres a actaully a barrel for the syringer that can heal enemies, but yet I have no clue where to find it. I heard its a daily mission but I want so bad so i can troll people doing the queen where I can healed her little by little.

Than u sir!

If you skip bots on the way there, especially with respawning and going through the storage room shortcut, then you will have to deal with them. But if you've cleared every rooms initial spawns you should be fine. As long as you stay in the room it will be in the ready to launch status. My cousin and I have waited in the end for about an hour once.
---
In less than 15 min after completing Charlie, leaving and going through alpha and coming back, Charlie had reset. It seems you need to stay at that silo to make sure it stays ready. 
---
keep on going! it's the only way i think!

I asked this morning and he said 1 weapon were modified at his (gauss rifle) bench, one was found on the ghouls at whitesprings (a 2 or 3 star pole hook) and the other (3 star gauss rifle) he got from trading with someone and had both for weeks.  The gauss rifle he modified multiple times over the weeks at his workbench.

Only place I can think of off hand that always spawns molerats is the carpark for the motel in flatwood. Heaps of places they spawn, but I'm drawing blanks atm

Is there a time played atom challenge?
---
Lifesaver! 
---
This...I end up with 20 + each time I do the "Uranium Fever " event. 
---
Event: One Violent Night, location: Sons of Dane Compound (North area of Savage Divide). 
---
You make noise by activating the Jukebox and/or playing instruments on the music stage and fighting Ghouls that constantly spawn to break up your amateur Woodstock. The whole event timer is \~30 minutes and this is a good way to farm level 30-60+ Ghouls as they spawn fairly frequently and the noise meter rises more slowly if less music is being played (so just keep the Jukebox going, repair when it is damaged, and farm the constantly spawning Ghouls). The final "Boss" (when the noise meter fills) is a level 42 3-star Legendary Glowing Wendingo aka the Nightstalker, at least that is the highest I have seen it spawn as.
---
 It has a bonus objective of beating it bear handed and you cannot do it in Power Armor (I tried fighting it with my fists in PA and that objective failed), most people starting shooting right away so I have never seen anyone complete the bonus objective, no idea if it gives a bonus reward or anything (you do have to beat the Nightstalker within the same event timer, so make sure you leave enough time to do so, but it really doesn't take long unless you are low level). 
---
i see what you did there haha
---
Nice 
---
No they don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm trying to do the same things, move content between 2 toons with 2 distinct builds.
---
See this is exactly what I did want. The mask itself is not meant to be kept  but circumstances can allow it to happen.
---
Go to menu in game and click challenges. Go to the achievement for 7600 hours played and it will show your progress
---
Where did you find yours?
---
Your paintings are gorgeous. Really well done. 
---
There are no stats. You can look at your challenges but it doesn't give you much 
---
There is an Atom Challenge to play FO76 for 7600 hours. It keeps a tally of time played. (Pretty sure it exists for just that purpose. 
---
 Yeah true, I just want to know how long I have nolifed this game 
---
No, but seriously, I've reached level 62 recently and genuinely wanted to see how long that took me to accomplish  
---
It'd suck if they don't add this as a feature in the future.

Or ANY hand held melee. Like is it that hard to duct tape some deathclaw claws onto your arm?
---
It‚Äôs part of pvp.

I wonder though if you‚Äôre below lvl5, can folks still trash your base?
---
I heard a guy say he got one, so I activate them every time I see them. Got my PPP a few weeks ago. Welcome to the club!

Post pictures when completed... I must know what your definition of Luxury is!

May have will check. I know I have a 2 shot silenced. What platform ?

Nothing. You can just collect money, stock up ammo and just wait till Beth actually rolls out the endgame.

Check out a program called Joy2Key for mapping keys to buttons.

That would be awesome. Ps4

Levels do matter, there is no way you can justify a level 5 to 100, or even a 30 to 60.
---
Happy cake day.
---
Yesterday I saw two boys, one with an owl mask. and another with a fasnacht mask very different from what you usually see, I asked them where they got them but they did not want to tell me
---
Sweet same here. I‚Äôll have a look 
---
Great thanks man :) 
---
I kinda like the whole perk card thing with Lawbringers and Raiders, it brings back that Fallout 3 perk of returning an ear of a bad guy or returning a finger of a good guy you kill. Maybe another vendor bot (or y'know, maybe an actual human NPC) could be added to give out caps and other goodies for things like this?

Does rad sponge work when you're alone too? 
---
Yes! For the longest time I was really searching for a sledgehammer (low levels) and every time a scorched would come at me with one it would end up dropping a pipe pistol or a sickle...

I wear the tattered mole mask. Sorta cute. Sorta terrifying.

Yeah sadly I'd rather deal with the annoying bear than move my base or even attempt to re-do it.  I'm sure they will patch it eventually. :)
---
In The FOrest region, it doesn't aggro, just flies around and scares/detects randomly.
---
How do you not heal from mutations? Is it a mod? I play on PS4 and if you use a radaway then it heals mutations once you rads are gone
---
I think the winter coat looks ok. Don't use it, but I like it
---
I once got a Quad crossbow, could hold 4 bolts at once and would fire them semi auto at a pretty decent rate. I thought that would be the only way to make it viable. 
---
Nope. Because when you reload it you have to load each arrow one at a time. 
---
No, the best thing is when you forget to log off and have no idea on your health, because the glitch that says you have max rads, no ammo and no AP, even though everything works like normal

Isnt there a fo76bazaar sub? Or have you checked that one already

He loves you though 0-0.... J/k.

Good luck on losing man eating bear. I've heard there's a lot of issue currently with taming currently.
---
Even if people aren't hostile or have zero cap bounty tamed pets will attack them...
---
I've been wearing the science scribe outfit since I received it from the technical data quest. My favorite so far.
---
Then it's still useless if you are wearing a power armor...
---
So far Im liking the fire breather uniform and welding helmet.
---
I guess I should have specified after lvl 50.. But the levelscaling is far more forgiving also for early levels than most other games..
---
Not a computer on earth, now, or in the future, or in another dimension, can run this game without lag. There will always be lag.
---
I have Acid, Adhesive, Ballistic Fiber, Lead, Plastic, Leather, Screws, Springs and Gears permanently tagged. I never leave a tagged resource behind.  
---
On top of those, I may also pick up (without tagging) items containing steel and wood if those resources start to get low after crafting.  
---
I try to maintain my resource levels at 50, 100, 150 and 200+ depending on the usage of the resource and the ease of collecting it.  
---
Doing this, I find it easier to manage my Stash weight. I regularly Bulk items and sell them. And if that doesn't help with weight, I'll make a few stacks of Ammo.  
---
I started doing this, and tweaking it, after a few "oh crap now I have to farm resources" to make/repair/upgrade this cool new plan.  
---
Doing this helped me be prepared to make the X-01 as soon as I got the pattern, while my friends had to go out farming.  
---
But despite all this, I am still having an issue maintaining enough screws. Now I need to make Lever Action Guns to scrap for the upgrades. And at 10 screws each, I only make them 5 at a time before I have to go out and farm again.
---
I don't know about excitement when almost every kill had a random one star legendary lol
---
I never thought of this. That's true...But then, this game from top to bottom makes entirely NO sense.
---
Starched Genes under Luck. 2 ranks; 1st rank reduces the chance of removing a mutation with radaway and reduces the chance of being mutated by rads. 2nd rank eliminates radaway possibly removing a mutations and you'll never mutate from rads.
---
Ho w and where do you take your animals? I can't seem to do it and I have the perks.
---
I need to find this
---
Had this happen a few times.  Attributed to my Raider PA with Reative  mod. The only bad part is that NONE of them drop ANYTHING....
---
For a certain amount of time, yes. My friend took a break when we finished launch prep and took a bit longer than planned. Guessing it was around the 10 minute mark 4 or 5 Mr Gutsy spawned on top of me. We were still able to launch after they were taken care of.
---
My condolences
---
Lagging with a ryzen 5 2600
---
What I want to know is how you legit found explosive weapons. Man Ive been farming whitesprings for weeks now, got about 200 hours in the game, level 162 and I have yet to find a single explosive drop. Hell, I have yet to see any 3 star gun. All i ever find is 3 star crap mele weaps that I could care less about.
---
It was in reference to Microsoft being the publisher. I don‚Äôt think Microsoft is a bad publisher though.
---
Excellant, thanks.
---
Also spent ages looking through my pip boy thinking it was busted, someone had to tell me where those daily and weekly challenges lived.... 
---
Anyone know of a 76 discord?
---
That is what I paid for it at the Welch train station.
---
Lmao that's what I've heard, but will my processor support the game in medium-low quality?
---
Wait what? You mean I could‚Äôve just gone with a shotgun 6stack this whole time?
---
The delay is intended. Which means it also needs a visual cue that says "vats is getting readied". 
---
 I have seen the owl mask in the church, but I could not catch it. I checked the city several times, but I had no luck, I thought they had taken it from another place. 
---
I dunno, after level 50 there's still things like having better weapons/experience, but there is a lot less of an advantage through SPECIAL/Perks.
---
Can confirm, same story. Lvl 99 main (never found); lvl 22 second character I took to HF/Watoga @ lvl 15, took 45 mins server hopping -found them at Watoga train station.
---
I use Holy Ghost and still lagging.
---
I usually do a pretty big eyeroll at suggestion threads, but everything you've asked for is absolutely spot on. Completely reasonable and would really add polish to the game.
---
I have always wondered about this as someone who fell in love with Bethesda with Morrowind. It still spins me out that after all these years we still are playing on the same engine.
---
Crazy to think that Starfield and Elder Scrolls 6 will be on that same engine. Heck we could see Fallout (insert next number) on it as well.
---
It also lagged me to no end rapidly collecting dirty water. If you do it in PA you collect as fast as you click and it does not like it. 
---
How does this stack with Lone Wanderer?  45%-30% or multiplicative?
---
I like the field scrub with halloween skull....I collect all rare outfits I can find. If anyone knows where to find a green camp fatigue outfit...please let me know. Or any rare ones tbh
---
I find my self short steel often and I set up at the lake north of watoga. Lots of easy robots and the occasional legendary as well. 
---
Yeah, my husband too.  We were playing together and he said "I wish there were some way I could see these challenges ".  Me: "You can."
---
There is not much of a tutorial aspect to this game and a lot isn't intuitive. If I didn't reddit, he would know a lot less. Lol
---
Best comment I've seen. Gold for you! 
---
The disappearing loot table I thought was tied to the phantom weight glitch, but I don't have any evidence. I've just specifically avoided it in the off chance that it is. I've seen those most commonly with frag grenades. If you go into transfer, not just take, then try to drag one grenade at a time it won't work but if you would have just hit "take" it "takes" them all although they don't show in your inventory. Very odd, but as I said I just avoid it to be safe.
---
WITCH!!! BURN THE WITCH!!!
---
Fasnacht can spawn in Fort Defiance, that‚Äôs the only place I‚Äôve seen it. Never found an owl mask, though I‚Äôve seen them around on players. 
---
"I've built you a fusion generator, 3 sets of power armour, an entire arsenal of weapons and even threw together a complete dinner table set with accompanying sofa."
---
That's great, thanks - would you be able to make me a few screws please?
---
"What? No, that's far too difficult. I can build you a house though if you'd like instead?" 
---
76 days!
---
Damnnnnn
---
That'd be handy as hell
---
Though I have seen many good players and try to be too, I've had my share of hostile players. Not really toxic, but for someone like me that don't enjoy PvP, they're not pleasant.
---
Just yesterday a lvl 75 player ran into my CAMP and shot me and ran away. I'm 120 and wondered what he was doing. Looked at the map and saw he had ran to a nearby place. I ignored him and continued working on my camp. Looked at the map a little later and saw a lvl 150 and a lvl 200+ at the same spot as the now wanted lvl 75. He was trying to trap me so his team mates could kill me.
---
Also when having a workshop some other player contested it and I just left. He ran after me and shot me. Didn't do more than 20% damage but enough for me to start sprinting away. He followed and killed me with the next shot. I spawned and looked for my bag but he had looted it. Looking at the map a while later, the workshop was unowned.
---
Do you know where you found this? I came across something similar somewhere in the nw part of the map next to a tank
---
Can I interest you in a set of skis or ski poles? We have the largest selection in West Virginia.  They're all the same brand, but there are lots too choose.
---
GG, my dude. Most of the weapons must have been from end game content. White Springs farming or queen, do you actually launch nukes and solo adventure in or just attend when other people launch?
---
I have like 30 cores just from exploring slow, with no ammo/fusion core perks.  Can't bring myself to throw them away.
---
900 then? I only paid 750 with drugs and perks.
---
Every time I do Uranium Fever, I always get level 25-35 legendary weapons :(
---
Yes.
---
Exactly my point. Because what if you get a set of power armor that you wanna keep but dont wanna wear
---
not just weapon stats I'd love to see camp stats to - how much damage does a rocket turret do - how many hp and armor does each wall type have - basically those things every mmo player (ok not every one but a lot of us) needs to see to debate things into the depths of night 
---
You most likely won‚Äôt be able to, so get something you REALLY want to keep.
---
Kind of a waste of a nuke, but Toxic Valley produces a ton of flash ferns. It's where I got the majority of my violet flux. Just gotta train yourself to see them since they aren't as easy to spot as the rest of the nuked flora.
---
Uh ... in 3/NV/4 don‚Äôt you do exactly that? Strip the armor off the raiders/etc? Am I totally misremembering that ... because I thought you totally could and did take literally the clothes off their backs ...
---
Whats the graphics card?
---
My secondary system is an i5-4460 w/ a Fury X. Does fine at 1080p, but I purposely keep things at low settings w/ medium textures on this system since the FPS variance is yuge. (30-60, never consistent)
---
Your best bet is to grab FRAPS so that you can easily monitor your FPS in game and adjust settings as needed. Medium and high textures usually run below 4GB of VRAM, I constantly see 8GB+ VRAM in this game on my primary system (8600K + 1080 Ti). After you dial in textures, work on shadows as they'll be the next biggest performance impact. Potentially lighting as well if godrays are as inefficient as they were in F4 (and there was 0 difference between low and maximum for those in F4).
---
Honestly tho
---
unfortunately no, it only works for team mates as far as I can tell. 
---
I believe it stacks with Lone wanderer to get 75%
---
Nice! very well done
---
I liked it, I had no power armour or hazmat on me lol 
---
Yeah but the lvl 50 might as well get lucky and the perks might not matter.. But sure, someone that has grinded a lot might have better gear..
---
Really? I'm pretty sure I wandered down that hallway and was still getting shot at.
---
Trees are the enemy 
---
I completely agree; for those of us migrating from FO4 the strictures of this build system are suffocating. I would also like to see them be more forgiving with terrain clipping/manual sinking. Some of us like immersive builds with a more grounded feel. For those that like the "my house floats connected to the ground by a single set of metal stairs look", more power to ya. But for me it is far more satisfying to be able to slightly sink objects into the ground, give it a real contact with the earth feel. Many improvements to be made with build system here.
---
Maybe if you move your camp and he dies on the way there you lose it forever. Not sure if you get your budget back though.
---
I am not the op.  Was saying 850 is a fair price.
---
This is the one I do when farming sets to mod then sell:
---
Up the fire escape at the civic center, jump across to the med center, jump down to the vertibird, reset.
---
(Marsupial and a jetpack to jump across. Bird bones helps too)
---
Call me a little mainstream here, but I like the version of Country Roads played on the radio, as well as Wouldn't It Be Nice and Sixteen Tons
---
The reward from completing the bonus is a one-handed melee weapon titled "Nailer".  I have personally verified this.
---
[https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Nailer](https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Nailer)
---
There was just  a single player, who seemed to be doing it for the sole reason and it falls under the 'grief' chapter for me. 
---
Had a lot of normal PvP fights and just one player, who actually camped for the right time and only tapped the workbench in order to 1 melee hit me for the caps. He was bunny hopping before and swinging tens of times. Had to stand still to figure out, he was trying to 1 hit me. I tend to get confused by most griefers: "Really?? Ahh really- respawn &amp; ignore")  
---
You should actually lose something, when losing a workbench. But as you've already built stuff and all those things, the caps price is too steep. When you encounter a single player griefing like this, just forget about the workbenches; not worth the hassle.  
---
(I had 4 workbenches in that game; 3 were full of useful things, he contested the only useless workbench and didn't even take it over.)
---
Tldr:   
---
Wait for a defense mission at a workbench. Camp/stay hidden, until the owner protects it.   
---
At the first moment after the mission, tap the workbench, kill owner and get profits. 
---
Starched Genes perk
---
I lost both Terry the sloth and Genevive the deathclaw to unwitting players. Kermit the Radtoad died to a scorchbeast while I was escorting him home. 
---
There's a super mutant vender 
---
Note to self, have Veldron replaced with a synth duplicate.
---
Feels like I'm back in school or church just being talked down to. Wasn't fun and if you did miss a dialogue you couldn't go back. You are stuck being railroaded. 
---
It seems like at lower levels the misses at 95% were higher for me. Either my play style changed to compensate or my additional SPECIALs/PERKs did because it hasn't been an issue for awhile.
---
better* with significant caveats. Like saying the .50 receiver for the hunting rifle is better*
---
Also confirmed the M79 is not as well.
---
I have an Asus Rog Strix 1060 6GB and 16 GB Ram
---
I don't mind people blowing up bases because i will kill anyone over and over until they feel the same way they make others feel. Then again i still feel we should have pvp and pve servers. One for the idiot griefers and one for us wanting to focus on helping each other.
---
What i don't like is charging us resources for player damage. Bethesda should know the rising trend of the high bounty trolls.
---
Send all caps to your mates then go troll your ass off. Then laugh as the person that comes to collect the high bounty gets bugger all caps because you stashed them. They get a pitiful debuff based on their bounty level minus their caps. In a few hours they can just do it again.
---
I take everything that has screws,gears and springs anything else on a as needed base and keeping a min. For crafting and bulking sometimes just to sell. 
---
After completing the Mistress of Mysteries quest, I can now craft every item from the quest at different workbenches. I do not need the original. Dress, revolver, sword, and stealth boy.
---
Someone please tell that to the guy in the sub complaining that supposedly a lvl 80 scorchbeast its slaughtering him in the forest region
---
Maybe as player vending gets more popular (coming next update) these will realise this and start making more interesting food and legendary plans. But this game is meant 2 grow the longer its around so give them time
---
Now that I know your also on xbox, curious how often you get crashes in game? We have both seen it vary quite a bit, some days it can be 2 or 3 server disconnects or where the game hangs and closes in a 3 hour window.  But then other days no crashes.  I would say there are many more days of crashing then absence of crashes though.
---
The game seems very buggy. I told him to hold off playing till they get the game sorted out more.  I am going to keep a close on on their change logs.
---
I was actually in the savage Divide at the South Mountain lookout tower.
---
yep since PA makes you immune to limb damage. Overall it's a pretty useless perk since you repair your limbs with stimpacks and anyway it doesn't happen enough to justify 3 points.
---
I take everything not nailed down for scrap and all ammo cause I don't need to carry food since I'm a cannibal
---
&gt; I have yet to find a video of a ranged guy out playing this guys melee builds 
---
Thing is, you have to consider the full picture. In the video, the guy runs around for 30-40 seconds until SB lands, then 1-shots it. I've seen videos of a heavy weapons guy (not even TSE) melting one down in 10 seconds *in the air*. That's the thing with melee. It has insane *potential* damage, but very limited *practical* damage. Two enemies 100m apart? With a crit rifles build it's headshot, dead, Gun Fu spins you around, headshot, dead. Even if it wasn't the case, if it took 5 shots, it's still faster than traveling 50m to one enemy, 1-shotting it, then traveling 100m to the other enemy, and 1-shotting it. That travel time, while doing 0 DPS, brings the overall DPS of melee builds way, way, way, waaaaaay down if you factor it in.
---
Ironically, that same build can be applied to ranged as well, there was even a post about it, how Rad Rage build can be applied to rifles, and also works with shotguns.
---
Also, once you have a decent build rolling, ammo isn't much of an issue, because you're wasting a whole lot less of it. If you go from 5 rounds to kill something down to 1-2 rounds to kill something, that's significantly less ammo farming that you need to do. 
---
Though I do have to admit that melee builds are just in general far easier and hassle-free. Being super-strong allows you to carry more stuff, you don't need to carry ammo at all, and your weapon weight reduction is built into your damage perk (Martial Artist), not a whole separate perk like all other weapons, except rifles, which don't get one at all (which is really shitty). Plus your repairs just require some adhesive, and that's pretty much it. And aside from Scorchbeasts and the cargobot and I think one or two events, everything else is grounded, so 99% of enemies in the game are easy to deal with. So you can't go wrong with melee build.
---
When player trading posts become a thing, I want to make a new character called "Lejeet" just so I can say, "If you have caps, Lejeet has wares!"
---
Back in FO4 when mods let you swap legendary effects, I never really used Two Shot.  The accuracy sucked so wasn't worth losing that sneak damage multiplier most of the time.  I preferred Instigating for the most part, tho explosive was decent.
---
Can you flag items that you are not missing?
---
Another weird thing: going to a location totally alone. Enemies start spawning from that areas enemy table, but they're all the strongest version of that enemy. So say for ghouls, they're all level 60 glowing ones or something. You kill the first few you see but then as you walk around they're all already dead. Bizarre stuff. The old Bethesda bug/feature hybrid. 
---
You'll be fine with that combo outside of cell loading hitches. Their inevitable ability to stutter even the gnarliest of builds is incredible.
---
Love classical music over anything else. If you're talking replacement of it I want no part of it. If you want it in addition, sure. 
---
Your welcome 
---
ahh, thanks :)
---
Have only done a "dry" test doing the bio id thing until the point where you are told to head for the control room, that bit is easy, but wanted to get my 3'd hacker perk and lockpick perk, so bailed out after that :)
---
Think i will like to try and solo it, didn't spawn many bot's at that first bit, but i guess it steps up a lot, hate clocking insultatrons, lol
---
The idea is cool but the super mutants and commie bot ideas were actually already done , the reason we see super mutants and a shit load of robots was to get defcon to 1 and gain access to the nukes, they eventually made the scorched virus which was labeled as an extinction event allowing use of nukes,  so good ideas but their already been tried I guess 
---
&gt;Tse shotgun for real money?
---
Well if the dupers wanted caps they could just dupe nuka colas and drink them for unlimited caps. Real money trading is a problem in pretty much every loot based game that allows item transfers between players.
---
Yep.. and you also drop your bag when dying, thus you see a swarm of players on your bag in seconds if you die in a nuke zone.  
---
This is why.
---
Assuming you don't have to server hop for hours to find a server that's not pre looted. A majority of my farm time for ammo is server hoping why bother anymore when I could reroll a melee build... And just not have to worry bout it. 
---
You're the only one being a dick here, check all the downvotes you're catching.
---
What you don't seem to understand is that players can 1-shot enemies in a nuke zone even without TSE weapons. So you're calling all of them dicks to? You're acting holier than thou **ordering** people to play by an arbitrary set of rules. It doesn't work like that. 
---
If other players give you the chance to tag an enemy, either intentionally or incidentally, that's great good for you. If they don't, that's life, but they're not being a dick, and you're not entitled to a piece of every single enemy in the area.
---
Thank you dear sir, at least someone I would partially agree with. I am the second part here, the crazy guy, that shot up the camp of the poor kid. As you write, game is rated M for mature and the kid is playing without supervision. Game allows damaging each other's camps and killing other players with so called slap damage, which is not that hard to achieve. It is a part of the game.
---
Now before other people decide to be toxic towards this or aggressive, again, read the above. If you can't handle the game mechanics and toxic people, maybe you should not be playing the game. Besides, game has built in function to block and mute people (with only downside if you client has been open for a while, you need to find that player in the recent list, which may be over several hundreds of people). It also features these nice functions as restriction of microphone being enabled only by use of push to talk button (default) - instead of having it to detect each and every whine of a 9 y/o kid, completely disabling in-game communication and even restricting it to team only.
---
As last thing, I do not care if I will be down voted or whatever, but the kid was asked to disable his microphone several times prior to destruction of the camp. There was no further in-game voice communication from my side, until the 9 y/o came back into nuked zone, screaming and whining through his mic in the area voice chat. PvP is one of the game aspects, it is "the endgame" for many people, who have spent countless hundreds of hours on this game. It was not mentioned in the original post, but the parent of the kid actually showed up and took over the mic of the 9 y/o after the destruction of the camp and started to scream racist slurs towards me and my friend, implying that we are the "immature toxic players" for utilization of game mechanics...Nice, very nice

Lets not kid ourselves. I've had a explosive quad double barrel since the first week and its still the only gun I use. It's cheesy, but I'm addicted to the raw power. 
---
I don't know, did you?
---
I crashed while in Whitesprings and had that feeling of panic because I had a lot of junk mats on me, but was 2ft from the stash when the crash happened. Luckily no nuke. 
---
Previously I disconnected while in there in another char, inventory empty, and came back to no nuke. Entered the building, then got the nuke warning. Target: Whitesprings...twice. 
---
Yeah, I actually had my first one on 65+ hours playing yesterday.  Sucked.

Your comment slandering youtubers is completely unjustified. Most Youtubers I‚Äôve seen have been fair, and instrumental in spreading awareness on unsavoury business practices that harm consumers. I especially appreciate what Yongyea does, and I enjoy watching Juicehead for fo76 content. 
---
I‚Äôm very grateful for them for helping us consumers by showing us when we‚Äôre getting exploited. Especially following a recent Yongyea video I watched, they‚Äôre the only ones left standing up for us gamers in this age of micro transactions and loot boxes.

I'm working on a small web app that documents all this in a meaningful way and allows people to vote and subscribe to each individual change.

Would you be open to testing it in a few days?
---
Oh lol I sell stuffs for a little more than I get it....so I like to keep different things on hand. I try my best to get a good deal to pass it on. A great many things I drop price for people just so they can get it. One scenario was a long coat for 400....
---
No, doubt.  The place I have my camp has bumps in the terrain and of course the mobs use that so my guns can't hit them until they've already torn through my concrete barricades and are eating my crops up.  I only use 3 guns, but it would be nice to have at least a couple more without sacrificing the layout of my house which doesn't really have a lot in it.
---
It was pretty funny back in FO4 luckily modders gave us a patch to fix it. It has returned in 76 and they did say they fixed it but yeah still there bro.
---
It's pretty creepy though, we had it happen on a silo run not long ago. It always reminds me of that icecream man demon thing from the movie Legion lol.

I have no issues sneaking and I'm in full PA. I can spring by some enemies and the don't even detect me. Some enemies can be hugged at times which seems like it's your issue here. But I have no problems with it and I'm a sneaky hulking tank for christ sake lol

Long wolves are abberations of reality caused by nuclear explosions ripping the very fabric of space time.

Pro-Tip: they're vulnerable to mines and even better it appears enemies in other factions can easily fight them. So if you're being hunted by a stretchy boy just lead him to other enemies (mole miners are great for this, super mutants too) and start laying some mines. 
---
There certainly are a number of visual and other bugs in the game!  I'm hoping that like No Man's Sky, their iterative improvements will provide the value that we all hope to be getting for this game.  The foundation seems quite good, once they iron out the details (and add more content!)

My only concern is how you aren't able to use a death tambo with power armor but you can use a tiny 10mm gun with the huge power armor fingers.

I like it too but if it was a toss-up between one or the other I'd have to go with bluegrass. I always feel pretty good when Clair de Lune or In The Halls of the Mountain King comes up but think I'd feel even better if I could hear something like Salty Dog Blues  or Mountain Dew. 
---
I concur with all of these guys, crafting it would be best for you. While out venturing, make sure to pick up low weight sources of lead wherever you find them. Good junk include: pencils, tin cans, alum. cans, letter blocks (toy wooden blocks), baby rattler, and paint. All of those fairly common items break down for lead and you will be surprised how quickly it stacks up, especially with how common all the cans are. I find that when I prep an ammo session, it only takes about 30 mins of searching if I started with no lead to make a good haul; but I generally pick that stuff up as I go now, so I always have a stock. Pair ammosmith perk (when available) with Luck perk Super Duper for max gains when making ammo. Making it yourself is the best once you have settled into the routine of it for yourself because you also get all that experience that racks up over time. Good luck and happy smithing!
---
A downed vertabird, crashed satellite, grave stone, civil war reenactor, greaser, a crazy person who thinks the nukes were a population control plot, tent surrounded by baddies, scorched bar poo and flies, suitcase, in detonated bomb, these are just some of the random events you can spawn in certain areas on the map. There‚Äôs no rhyme or reason. There‚Äôs a spot near the overseers camp if you follow the road south just past a pick up truck that spawns many different kinds of these random events.  If you server hop you can cycle through several different kinds. On occasion there‚Äôs nothing. 
---
Btw, after having done the bio id, is that saved for later use, or does it need to be done every time ?

have 7 nuke cards i need to start using, they fill up my stash, lol

ive ended up having to msg people some times or just invite them to the party.

Ive even tried to use just FO76 chat, the only thing that works is to set the audio to Area (from auto) and then just flip between party (when you want to talk to your team) and game chat (when you want to talk to anyone else)
---
You paid $80 for the Tricentennial Edition of a Bethesda game. And unless you bought it LAST YEAR at launch or pre-order, it wasn't $80 if you were smart about where you bought it so 2019 has nothing to do with how much you paid for it.

If you want Atoms, as soon as you log on check the Daily challenges.  There usually 2-5 that are super easy to grab while playing, should get you around 40-50 Atoms a day.

Tag Aluminum, Adhesive, Gears, Black Titanium, Springs and SCREWS for pickup ASAP.
---
I'm in the same boat as you man; even when I look up spawn sights I'm finding them empty, even server hopping isn't doing much good. I think the best bet is to start buying!! I was reluctant to spend caps but since turning level 20 (only recently) I've noticed an increase in caps so started spending.
---
I have a few duplicate plans, not sure off top of my head (wish there was a way to check stash/inventory while offline), but look me up and we can trade (psn: jericdarcy)

All cans including aluminum have lead. Not just the tin cans.

I did the same but with PS4... but meh im getting my monies worth.

Honestly I was kinda disappointed by Furious, it doesn't seem to increase by much per shot, and caps kinda low compared to other properties. Whereas Two-Shots seem to break faster (or maybe I'm imagining that)
---
Here here, time to retune that dang radio
---
It would've been nice, but it's not something I was expecting so I can't say it disappointed me. I am disappointed with the music this time around though. I'm going to get downvoted to hell, but here goes. The 2 songs most notable songs they added this time around are completely out of place with the game's soundtrack. I love the postwar era aesthetic chosen for the fallout universe and love that the soundtrack matches up with this....then they add a bad cover version of a 70s song in this game because it says "West Virginia" in it. Very jarring. Although I don't mind the beach boys, "wouldn't it be nice" is a very different era of music to the 40s and 50s post war era music chosen for the series

I like the idea, but given how easy it is to server hop, and how crashes/server disconnected frequently **force** a server hop, it won't be a very persistent thing.

Just wait until you learn the plan Dense for Marine is named Dense Combat Armor....
---
Spawning at my base gives you a 50:50 chance of fall damage/death. One side you spawn on the dirt, other side you spawn up high on the cliff. Everytime I log in I hear my armor make that long fall sound. 
---
PS4 Sadly. Got a whole heap of ultracite ammo. So really just want a way to burn through it 
---
That's easily fixed with one piece of armor that reduces all weapon weights by 25%
---
You don't have a hoarding problem if you're not using Party Boy/Girl to pump that +2 Str from Whiskey up to +6.
---
Mine keep disappearing. No matter how many I pick up, I will have no more than 3 when I log in, it's quite frustrating.
---
Well you can‚Äôt really compare Outer Worlds with BF V, since they are to different types of games. But you are right.
---
Weapon and armor upgrade plans can be learned from discussing weapons and armor.  So if you want to learn combat shotgun plans,  for example,  scrap a bunch of combat shotguns.  Same for armor upgrades as well, leather armor for leather upgrades, metal for metal etc. Camp plans can either be bought from vendors or licensed through events or workshops.  Workshops are the fastest in my opinion.  Claim a workshop and you have a chance at getting plans.  After you claim a workshop wait a few minutes and you'll get a quest to defend that workshop. Do that and you have a chance of getting an extra plan.  Then just go to another workshop and repeat the process. Hope this helps. Also, sorry for format, I'm on mobile

I don't believe it is a male or female thing exactly. These bat buggers spew their cloud and hive mind the hell out of everything they touch.

It was being goofy with those stairs also, but i didnt try any iron post trick or anything. At one point i placed it and it wouldnt let me delete it because there were walls around it already in place. Shortly after could not remove it or any foundations so i "moved camp". Didnt use stairs at all and still had the foundations glitch that they wont delete. Think i have to "move camp" again.

Damn no plans from vendors? There goes my entire objective

The point is that I paid 80 bucks, for this in 2018, and here we are in 2019 and this is what a game looks like.

You‚Äôre playing Fallout. It‚Äôs an open world wasteland. Just in case you don‚Äôt know, here is the definition of a Raider.
---
From the Fallout Wiki: ‚ÄúRaiders, sometimes referred to as bandits, are any group of wastelanders who pillage, plunder, murder, or otherwise ruin the day of anyone unfortunate enough to not be one of them. Raiders tend to organize into loose confederations of gangs in the post-apocalyptic wasteland and are a constant problem. Raiders typically prey upon travelers and very small towns, leaving more populous or larger areas alone.‚Äù
---
A quote from Fallout 3: ‚ÄúRaiders take whatever they want, whenever they want, and their favorite pastimes are torture and murder.‚Äù
---
I always hear the sound if they're going to explode.
---
Except with Sentry bots.  They never make the sound and always explode, so I know to expect it anyway.
---
That would cool for Excavator people. I love me some T51. I was an XO-1 for awhile untill I found a guy selling T51 shocks. XD.
---
Looking good, have you been lifting weights?
---
 good to know
---
I still might make an energy weapons char because I want to believe they'll eventually buff energy weapons. 
---
I love the bounty coming from your own caps idea. If you really want someone dead you can spend a larger amount of caps to give them a juicy bounty. If you don't care you can forgo giving them a bounty at all.
---
You either need:
---
1) a middle man to hold the items for you
---
2) a second console, logged on and swap with the characters that way (much safer, but most don't have an extra console laying around)
---
3) find a friend on a session, add them to your friends on psn. Dump the stuff you want to swap somewhere where it's accessible to your alt character (suitcases are a good bet). Log into your alt and join the session your friend is in, and go collect the loot.
---
I've tried the 3rd multiple times and can confirm it works. Just put it somewhere where you don't see alot of player traffic or somewhere inconspicuous so you don't run the risk of someone else picking it up
---
Yes with Animal Whisperer
---
You remember that part of Rose's Quest where you 'befriend' a Deathclaw? (And subsequently run away to avoid getting your head ripped off?) Well, there's a perk available that actually lets you befriend animals by pointing your gun at them. So that Deathclaw? Point the gun. Boom, instant pet. Megasloth? Boom, instant pet. Scorchbeast? Boom, no instant pet since I don't think it works with them (unless I'm mistaken)
---
Shit game is shit. 
---
In team we have team mate that is next to it grab it so no one else does and if there is only specific loot you want the person can keep the rest. We share junk anyhow so it doesn't really matter to us.
---
Queen but from the mobs. The longer you keep her alive the more mobs
---
Lol, I was joking.
---
They already have both of the things you said in game btw. I only found out recently that there is a passive mode in the options to disable pvp for your character.
---
There is also a mission / quest in the game that involves PvP. The school pumpkin candy thing. As well as the radio station hunter vs hunted that initiates PvP. 
---
It's not just Marine.
---
iirc robot armor is named "Robot Armor Right arm" (but unlocks both), the Advanced Power Connectors were named Brick Building Set (now fixed), etc.
---
Keep an eye out for that Dense Combat Armor plan. I had to have scrapped thousands of Marine pieces and never unlocked dense until I got the right "Combat Armor" plan. You have a chance to get the actual Combat Armor dense mod, too, because they're identical for some reason...
---
My wife's a blender. She has quite a revolving personality.

Only 20 atoms for spending thousands of hours in the game? 
---
GGJigglePhysics is my tag I believe. (Definitely didn‚Äôt just buy an Xbox to play FO4/Skyrim/FO76 And has no idea how to do anything with it) xD
---
Thanks! I'm pretty happy with how the video turned out, I just wish I was better at stable analog stick movement. Unfortunately I don't usually use a controller for FPS games! 
---
I could go for that. I normally farm sbq because i believe the loot is better but I could join you
---
Hey that what a man in his prime looks like!  Dont let Hollywood fool you
---
Furious, I'd say anti is only good with melee since it can be stacked with incisor
---
But... do they follow you? Are they saved when you logoff?
---
 The round ones in the church are horrible, but the lighthouse and flight control towers are not bad. 
---
Watchtowers are preferred, but all of our stairs lock to the center, which is frustrating. 
---
The Dark Rum was sold as part of the marketing for FO76 same as the "Canvas" bags... so it is relevant.
---
You do realize Bethesda would of had to sign off on any final product designs right? as they licensed it out?
---
So either Bethesda just signed the order without taking at glance at the proposed product, and as a result¬†allowed their license to be mishandled for a shitty cash grab product
---
Bethesda did keep tabs on what the products design was, and still signed off on it.
---
Either way, Bethesda cant escape some guilt/blame. 
---
We will see after the next patch...when is that again?
---
I‚Äôm Level 121 and I only feel like I‚Äôve barely scratched the surface really. It has more context that Fallout 4 but you digest it differently

---
High level mob thing is an issue i do remember this while leveling arouns 25 and kept comming across 68s that was a pain.
---
The server stability is most likely due to the duping madness with the videos havinf anywhere from 60k to some with 500k views. Bethesda has not said anything on this issue at all goinf all the way back to the early versions in BETA.
---
Now i know this is silly to hear but try to hold in there. Something tells me they must have something big planned to address all the issues with the game soon. At the least should consider checking back in a few months.
---
I'm not certain, but my luck certainly sucks when it comes to legendaries....and it is low in SPECIAL :-)
---
Lmao. Alrighty, gonna add you lol
---
Forget it, too much work and opportunity for more bugs/glitches. There are many more frequent problems to be done/patched/change to think about complete overhaul (which would be NPC's). At least, that's my opinion...
---
Dude it does that to me all the time. Ooh this enemy has Fragmentation Grenade? Just kidding, you get a RadAway and a piece of wooden armor.
---
i take over the food workshop one (cant remember the name) and i rarley get attacked for some reason
---
Sounds like something a synth would say.  But everyone knows where‚Äôs no such thing. 
---
Theres a perk card for that lol
---
One you craft as "ammo" on tinkerbench?
---
Spawns in the trainyard north of Whitesprings in the building with all the safes (I assume it's a bank).
---
The problem is, if NPCs are unkillable then that breaks immersion, but if they're killed and come back to life a little while later, that breaks immersion too.
---
It could work with Brotherhood patrols as those squad members aren't 'characters' as such and completely disposable. I'm not sure how the presence of BoS would work with the overall FO76 storyline as I've not got to the endgame yet.
---
Yeah, i've been able to get 30+ cobalt by skipping the clubhouse and taking a long walk.
---
That‚Äôs true, it‚Äôs not really fair to compare it to anything recent. Single player RPG‚Äôs are on their way out, it seems, especially with Bethesda turning it‚Äôs back on the genre and simplifying things, like in FO4.
---
Yup. That‚Äôs why I have one point in Charisma which is to boost luck by two. 
---

---
This is the definition of a Raider. People forget that entities like this exists in this world. All of them are squares. Raid as you please. I wouldn‚Äôt feel bad at all. 
---
the issue I have is that a lot of youtubers don't correct the mistakes and assumptions in their videos after having them pointed out. Juicehead was VERY bad about this until his more recent videos and yet a ton of youtubers are STILL bad about this. For example, The Quartering released a video 3 days ago claiming that Bethesda is going to rush out Elder Scrolls 6 THIS YEAR. He doesn't point out that the source for this information is a guy that's been claiming it'll come out EVERY year since 2016, and he still hasn't corrected himself as far as I'm aware. THIS is what is wrong with youtuber gaming journalists right now.
---
I would say anti-armor simply because armor pen is really strong in this game. 
---
And unless i'm mistaken, I think the furious effect damage bonus caps after a certain point. I have not seen this confirmed, just what i've heard. 
---
You should probably test these weapons on identical enemies and see what you like better though.
---
That's a terrible idea. Tse shotgun even with no shotgun perks or demolishing perks does 400+ DMG and with perks does 2000+ so even of they nerfed them 75% they would still be doing 400+ DMG and it would ruin the entire point of the game.... RNG
---
Noted, thanks for the tip. I‚Äôll have to grab one later. 
---
It's unmarked because it's not equipped. You don't keep armor equipped while in PA.
---
For science: do the crops on their camp become flux?
---
I‚Äôve seen normal Mr. Handys explode if you shoot off all their limbs. Kind of a kamikaze move. 
---
Glad it worked for you!
---
In all things, there must be balance.
---
I take everything. You never linked what might come in handy.
---
Good advice OP.
---
Additional notes:
---
You typically need one hardened mass to help turn 10 raw flux (that come from plants, and that spoil) into stable flux (that does not spoil).  Hardened masses are rare and most often are gathered  from the bodies of non-plants in nuked zones and for some reason are placed into the JUNK category, whereas raw flux is placed in teh AID category.  You can easily spend a lot of effort gathering raw flux then accidentally scrap your hardened masses by scrapping all junk in your inventory leaving you without the means to convert raw flux into stable flux.  
---
Always, always, always move your hardened masses into your stash box before you scrap anything you are carrying, or you will have a pile of raw flux that spoils into (heavy) inert flux before you can convert it to stable flux. In the worst case inert flux can be sold for I think two caps per unit, raw flux sells for more of course if you need to dump it before it spoils.
---
There's a bunch of them out there.  What's more, there isn't really a comprehensive guide on their existence or where to get them all.  It's kind of neat that the game is at a point where you still need to discover stuff without being able to look it up.  Reminds me a bit of the first year or so of WoW.
---
Not getting Legendary Items from Legendary Enemies.
---
Last Night, someone Nuked Charleston, I was a ways off, and over encumbered, so I had to hoof it over there (thank you for Speed Demon), so I made it there just after the mushroom dissipated.
---
I ran through town killing a few ghouls here and there, but not finding any Legendary enemies, then I remembered all the enemies that spawn in the DMV, so in I went, and it did not disappoint, must have been over 30 Bloated Glowing Ghouls, after about 5 minutes of total mayhem, and killing at least 5 Legendaries, I proceeded to loot the corpses which were quickly turning to meat piles, but could not find a single legendary, and most the corpses were de-spawning rather than turning to meat piles.
---
I left the DMV and headed into the Capital building where I found a few ghouls here and there, including 2 legendary ones, that promptly de-spawned upon death.
---
I went back outside, where I killed several Snallygasters, and a "Diseased Grafton Monster" that I looted a piece of Legendary armor from, even though it didn't show to be a legendary enemy. 
---
Technically she dumped the old one on herself and got me the new one, but yeah you‚Äôre not wrong. I try to make up for it by giving her all the best stuff I find in fallout so she has it first, and I always stay several levels below since it‚Äôs ‚Äúher game‚Äù
---
Can I ask what platform you're playing on? If you're on PC I'd love to play with you and at least try and show you some good parts! The bugs and disconnects are things they're working on, collecting junk wise it is a pain but I've found myself with too much too often, I can pass some onto you if you would like some help with that area!
---
Good leave more for everyone else

Okay. See you in Appalachia.

quick question is there any debuffs for the cannibal perk or no cause it seems like its just an upgrade

You know, I guess you‚Äôre right, I made a blanket statement and can agree with you in that my blanket statement wasn‚Äôt fair or correct. I won‚Äôt take it down, because what‚Äôs said shouldn‚Äôt be unsaid, but you are right, and what I said was unfair to the people who legitimately put effort and care into their content.
---
People still think they're getting human NPCs on this game?
---
I think they may open a vault that effectively turns into a underground city. A place for trading/hanging out with other players but populated by NPC‚Äôs. 
---
I think this is a fairly popular theory. 
---
*SPOILER*
---
In a perfect world I would of liked the main story to resolve in a way which destroyed the scorched at which point all the other vaults open up because they knew it was safe and you have a populated world. I understand that this would have effectively meant building 2 worlds for the devs and needing different servers so probably unworkable. 
---
Yep, you can leg just about anything. The effect does wear off, though. I stood next to a crippled level 91 deathclaw trying to get the perfect picture in photomode for so long that the damn thing finally shook it off and stood up and one-shot me. DID NOT get a picture of it clawing me, dammit.
---
Combine enforcer with marsupial mutation and you're shotgun spiderman. 
---
They won't.
---
This is ace! Don't let the haters making comments get you down
---
My psn is Dr.Spiffington
---
Ok so I know there's game problems yet to be patched.  But why are you looting areas beyond your rank.  Your not that guy who travels to a Nuke wearing a T-shirt and .38 pipe pistol are you. 
---
But seriously do what the lvl 20 dude with me last night did for a bit.  Waved, followed, got a shot in for XP. I then killed he looted, rinse and repeat.  Make heart emotes and friends. There's enough good high level players who will help you.
---
A while back I took the food workshop and started making Salsbury steak and put up some water purifyers. As soon as I saw a lvl 2 at Vault 76 I fast travelled there in my Vault-tec painted T60 and presented them with a paper bag of 5 purified water, 5 Salisbury steak, and 2 stim packs. Some didn't realize what the bag was but the light on the helmet helped out. It was very funny to reperent the nice Vault-Tec and players who didn't know if they could trust me or not.
---
Ok but it would be nice for it to be marked so while in a nuke zone can see easily its my main so dont drop. Farming nuke zones you collect so much stuff. Maybe should just go without armour or stash it before going. But my fault either way for dropping. 
---
I've played quite a few games that have had dupe exploits. The most recent, prior to FO76, being Fortnite. Real money traders made a killing on it selling duped weapons &amp; materials on sites like gameflip, and are now doing so in FO76. The duped items might be worth nothing to you and I, but others will buy them simply because it saves time grinding for a similar item or the in-game currency to buy one.
---
Anti armor is great, especially since rifles don't get a great anti armor perk!
---
Your best bet is to start farming for Legendaries. Nuked whitespring is best, followed by uranium fever event, then probably normal whitespring. Good primary effects are bloodied, instigating, furious. Good secondary is +40% swing speed. If you get a third effect, ideally you want +1 strength. You should keep getting some decent upgrades and eventually end up with something awesome
---
If I had one, I'd sell her in a second.
---
Good With Salt perk works on flux too- last much longer.
---
It's time to play something else.
---
Loads of rads, but i didnt notice any disease, so for me better than eating spoiled food.
---
If you were IN the hotel you would be safe anyway, even if you're inside when the nuke drops -- not sure if you actually meant 'in' or just outside 'at' the hotel. 
---
Charlie Brown got a rock.
---
Then just don't watch such videos on youtube. 
---
Thank you so much! Want me to jump on another chat? Think I have 900 or so caps you can have as thanks xD
---
Travel agent.
---
It's ONE SINGLE POINT of investment. The largest fee from fast traveling I've seen across the map is 36 caps. 
---
Good thing you can repair your entire base at once pretty easily. 
---
Well if you ever saw the Police Academy movies, there's a gun crazy guy who runs around in the movie and is what we'll call beyond trigger happy.  If you're familiar with the Tremors movies, we was like a Michael Gross (the gun guy who was in every last one) kind of nutty with his weapons.
---
But you are right. Outer Worlds looks good, and I think it could be better than other games.
---
The problem with marking it would be that it would make people think the effects of that armor would be applied. Maybe like an empty square or something next to the armor, opposed to the full square next to the PA parts. That might be a good way to do it. 
---
It can be from any power plant.
---
You only missed out on some ballistic fiber, nothing to good. 
---
Char* not chat
---
Bullets.
---
You do know you have to inspect weapons to see additional affixes? It can show a two shot Gatling, that when you inspect is actually a two shot explosive bloodied for instance.
---
After 3 tries it seems to be working, I got the quest to show up now I'm gonna go do it 
---
Idk why people refer to them as griefers, I honestly see them as Raiders because, well...that‚Äôs just what they do. Expect it. 
---
Raiders, sometimes referred to as bandits, are any group of wastelanders who pillage, plunder, murder, or otherwise ruin the day of anyone unfortunate enough to not be one of them. Raiders tend to organize into loose confederations of gangs in the post-apocalyptic wasteland and are a constant problem. Raiders typically prey upon travelers and very small towns, leaving more populous or larger areas alone.
---
that's pretty good ty for sharing :)
---
If I'm reading this correctly you did the Event then went to a different server? Then yes, of course the Event wouldn't be done on that server.
---
Same. It was an ashpile similar to the ones Tesla rifles make and 'spinning circle of eat a dick'
---
I hear you but I don't really understand how you can have so much trouble with the basics (killing) of the game?  My 12yr old daughter picked this game up and in 3 days is level 25.  I really don't get how the game can be that hard for you.  Are there glitches and bugs in the game?  Yes, but do they make it unplayable, no.  What exactly are you doing to brake the game?
---
" getting swarmed by high level enemies who just kill me within seconds. "  The map is level based....if your getting slaughtered then don't go to that side of the map.  
---
I could go on, but I don't think you'll suddenly realize your doing it wrong....  
---
But then I'm a) having to juggle ANOTHER situational perk and b) still going to be doing the same thing, just to save a relatively smaller number of caps.
---
Based on the description, no.
---
It says theres a 10/20/30 percent chance that itll happen. I dont see how higher luck would change those static numbers. 
---
I could potentially see it if the description was vaguely worded like a lot of the other perks, i.e. you regenerate some /more / even more health being exposed to rads
---
You‚Äôre welcome! Wanna join our team? We‚Äôre just out questing about. Not sure what you mean by another chat üòÇ
---
Same here for me. Great list with lots of useful inputs! Hope Bethesda will implement at lease some of this.
---
But since I've been playing Beth games since Morrowind, somehow I find myself just accept the fate that the UIs are clunky and not always make a lot of sense/are consistent.
---
Yep, creepy ... 
---
I‚Äôm lvl 35. Gonna take a trip next time I see it pop up. Thanks
---
The only explosive weapon I've found in 100ish hours of gameplay has been in the Watoga Trainyard. It was a TSE Weightless 3* Gatling Gun.
---
While I've found tons of legendary stuff at WS, all of it has been garbage. 95% 1* stuff, and most of it armor (which I don't need as a PA build). Still, good for caps and XP.
---
Not just that, but I've literally had them fall from the skies in front of me.  It rained a bear one time.
---
Its not infinite it can just take a long time  one of the worse ones was a queen kill. Took about 8 minutes for the loot to show up on her body. Luckily her body did not become a meat pile or anything else.
---
Just remain near the corpse until it loads it. Even if it ends up showing empty don't trust it. Wait and keep looking. Fell for that a few times on Whitespring nuke runs. 
---
To go from the bottom of the map to the top corner to adjacent corner WITH fast travel perk is still 50 caps 
---
Hey nothin wrong with 2x2 cubes!
---
All outerworlds looks like is a borderlands knockoff 
---
That would be nice just anything to let you know its your main. 
---
They're crafting ingredients for endgame mods. Stuff like treated linings for underarmors, rad cleansing arch, powerarmor jetpacks, ultracite mods... all require stable flux. Hardened mass, glowing mass, high-radiation fluids and whatever flavor raw flux are just the ingredients to make each unit of it. 
---
I agree with your reading of the description. Yet when I increase my luck super duper seems to proc more. 
---
Ps4, my game froze twice today. Once in whitesprings, in the shops alley and the second time in the headquarters in watoga. The first time a nuke had been launched in whitesprings I said "ok it happens" but the second time I didn't even have the time to step out of the elevator, the game just froze. I also have to mention that yesterday I did a big part of the BoS main quest and went to the last location to find Taggerdy. When I loaded the game today the quest was back at the beginning. 
---
I can almost consistently get the game to crash by just moving legendaries in and out of stash to sell.  maybe I bought a duped item at some point off a vendor, but still.  I've rolled through my inventory a few times since I started playing ,and it always comes back to fetching a legendary from stash causing my crashes.  
---
You actually need to hit to build crit meter, but I guess if he is a shotgunner then he is already up in their faces..
---
Char* as in a previous character. XD Id give you caps from this one but I barely have anything haha. And I wouldn‚Äôt want to impose on you two, I mean I‚Äôm super low level xD
---
Popped up in an in named location too. No map marker on the forest while I was fulfilling another players order. Worst comes to worst and I don‚Äôt find it, I‚Äôll do the leg for 750? I‚Äôm trying to complete all orders within 24 hours but I also work a full time job with weird hours 
---
Sorry. Power armour.
---
It's also random.   First I got the windmill, then I got nuclear.   Still don't have largest generator.   
---
I have 8 luck and the 30%in the description feels about right
---
I am always confused when people complain about the story line. Part of my worry is people are just following compass markers and checking the map. Blaming people for not reading and listening isn't something I want to do but... Maybe that's a big part of the problem. 
---
Personally I have been enjoying the game but can't deny turning it off once or twice after a hour or two of frustration. When the lag happens, can't see my gf on the screen/she can't see me, fighting level 60's in my high 20's and low 30's,  finding myself constantly hunting for specific junk. (always springs, oil, and ballistic fiber lately) 
---
But some of these problems are part of the game of survival. You could walk the same stretch of road over and over and run into; A Wendigo, a Deathclaw nest, unexpected swarm of ghouls with a glowing one, a bomb that hasn't detonated, even convicted of escaping prison by malfunctioning law enforcement. Some locations have a rotation of enemies so your tactics need to change.
---
Cooked Brahmin becomes ribeye stakes which give 20 carry weight. Cooked rad stags also give 20 carry but they a bit harder to find. Your thinking of Stingwing filet which give 2 to strength but they really difficult to source properly unlike deathclaws which if all else fails you‚Äôll always find one on deathclaw island. 
---
By the way, apart from +melee damage foods which I‚Äôm sure are bugged. You can always have one food buff and one drink buff going at the same time. Simple fen flower tea is the drink buff that give +1 strength for 30 minutes with steeped fen flow tea giving +2 strength for 30 minutes without risk of addiction. 
---
Also carrot soup and simple carrot flower tea are bugged too I‚Äôm sure since there no way they should each way a pound. 
---
Wait, what. So whenever you want to use Poseidon, you have to do the 40 minute event first?!
---
Are there any Energy Weapon dmg Perks? I don't remember one. Sorta curious what an Energy build would even look like lol, since they can be pistols or rifles, and idk if the shotgun/scatter mods are affected by shotgun perks ü§î
---
Could be worth a shot, especially how cheap the ammo is to buy from other players
---
Total wipe would just make me stop playing. I don't want to collect plans and gear all over again..
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm bad at this game so it‚Äôs the games fault I‚Äôm bad at it‚Äù
---
If you have any 10mm ammo I‚Äôll take that instead lol also check the bags for some stuff! :)
---
Idk if it does because my luck is at 3 and when I use super duper, it doubles my stuff nearly every time.
---
Use rank 2 in lone wanderer? I can not imagine playing without Travel Agent.
---
It's about the only QOL perk I keep equipped at all times.
---
Yeah I knew this part, I just havent seen anything. I guess maybe RNG is just bad for me. Ive gotten plenty of 3 star armor and mele weapons. I even thought about playing around with luck and seeing if that had an effect on the rate at which they drop. So far I havent noticed a difference. 
---
I started early on for about half of my hours with like 3 luck, I how respec'd for 12 luck and the rate that I find multiple star ledgendaries is pretty much the same as when I had 3 luck.
---
Yes. Here we are, less than two months later, with a hilarious minor visual glitch in a Bethesda game. Your point?
---
The Wendigo isn't so bad.  He seems far, far worse than he is with that scream.  Getting past the Mirelurk King at lower level is the problem and even if he's 30 levels below you he can be hard to kill if you can't do it from stealth with crits.  You can sneak past him, but you have to be patient.
---
I normaly have 7 luck. When I bump it up to 14 super duper seems to proc more
---
Parma Farma sucks for me, maxed out I get 60/40 at best.
---
That still beats the 80+ it would be.
---
Scorched Beasts have become nothing but an annoyance in the game, and seriously need to be fixed.
---
Being well past level 50, and having great end game weapons, means I no longer have reason to fear SBs, but they do eat up a lot of ammo, for very little reward.
---
Even after killing 3 SBs in one quick battle, and 2 more just a few minutes later, I still didn't even have all the SB meat components needed to make the SB Stew, Has anyone ever been able to make it?
---
SBs should drop Legendary Items, or at least rare plans, recipes, Mods, and the ammo they were shot with.
---
Oh ok
---
Interesting. I'll be sure to bump it up next time I'm crafting ammo
---
All the adhesive for guns bothers me immensely. If anything they would need the opposite of glue. They need lubricated to help their parts slide better and move more easily. Not dump 7 tubes of super glue on them. 
---
I wear the Union Soldier uniform because I like that it comes with a backpack.   I try on different hats when I get the chance but still haven't found anything that blows me away, I usually wear the campaign hat.   
---
It's an entire skeleton outfit, btw, not just a mask.  The body can be found in a Watch Tower near the border between the Divide and the Mire.    
---
Ugh. And I have to deal with him too? I saw a YouTube of a Wendigo take 3 mini nukes to kill, so I was preparing to get slaughtered 
---
You can take your time. If you nuke somewhere, players will allways come, even if the server seems allmost empty:)
---
I got one good armour piece which gives +35 damage and energy resistance going up with your health. Seems like it might suck when you start dying, but what really sucks is I can't repair the damned thing because my ballistic fibre never lasts long enough.
---
Wendicube^tm
---
Well put!
---
Now that's a cool idea for a goal... I'll shoot for that I think.
---
I have 6 luck and I feel it triggers more than 30%, but my friend has 12 luck and it seems to trigger closer to the 30%. I don't think luck matters, it's just people get luckier than others. Try not to slip into the gambler's fallacy, I know it's hard, haha. 
---
What a heavy weapon?
---
I feel like it does, as if its a twoshot but the damage doesnt show an increase. Ive solo chainsawd a SB pretty fast. once it landed
---
Egg head removes 1 strength! 
---
there had not been a nuke event in *at least* two hours.
---
I actually switched from melee to a heavy build to force myself to become more interactive with the game
---
Some Scorched actually spawned in the first time I logged in yesterday to record the video and everything! I was like, "Shit, I don't want these jerky people ruining my video!" so I had to change servers and hope that enemies wouldn't attack again 
---
If u nuke it, they will come. Even random spots on the map. Kinnda funny
---
There are a few trade discords.  I'll post invites in a few.
---
Thats basically been my experience as well at WS, mostly 1* armor that I dont need and if a weapon drops its normally melee and I dont play melee.
---
Id be curious to see if anyone has information on if certain locations/enemies have a better chance of dropping or if its just pure RNG across the board.
---
Interesting- you could probably just leg it with enforcer and a shotgun, get naked and beat it to death to pick that up. Have to give it a try.
---
Thats a pretty good idea
---
There are a few.  I'll post links in a moment.
---
thanks!
---
I can understand why they don't let use decorate with junk, thats not to say they could not fucking fill our selves for some aesthetic decor, lol. I mean a items like: The teddy bear shelf, requiring all the bears or a specific type of bear.
---
There has been a on going debate though various threads about a "take this" emote or something XD.
---
But even with travel agent, you still save caps by double-loading, just a smaller amount. It would just help an end-game that is already very loading-screen heavy. Especially considering server hopping. 
---
That makes sense!  Appreciate it!
---
Do the side quests and naturally level up - I didn't start grinding until I hit 70.  Take a workshop, the defend event you get right after also gives out XP.  I use them as forward bases/fast travel points more than actually extracting resources...  and to get more workshop plans.
---
Craft up your extra materials instead of throwing them out (leather armor is cheap to make, so are molotovs).  Craft and scrap armor to learn more mods.  Craft and sell those molotovs.
---
I will! At the very least I'll put them together in a pdf so other folks can. It's essentially a fanfic and the print place I usually use, lulu.com, doesn't deal with that sort of thing.
---
At least someone else gets it
---
But the ammo farm is terrible. I love love my sniper build it's very strong but just exhausted of ammo farm
---
Oh I thought you were talking about a perk lol.
---
Yeah power armour is beastly in this game compared to fallout 4. I was thinking power patch for more resorce cost then durability but that will help too
---
That would explain why laser guns are garbage 
---
we're playing as past residents of a vault whose sole purpose was to rebuild the area
---
It wouldn't be so bad if the vendor's balance actually reflected the amount of caps you just gave them for your 2-star weapon. But even *that* screws you. 
---
Should totally hire me and give me all the money
---
Oh damn I want a two shot explosive fat man! Wait... What?
---
Hopefully not 
---
Orly? Normally with TS is *does* show an increase in dmg, so I really couldn't tell. It just says "Superior Damage" but doesn't change the stats lol. But that's good to know!
---
I put flamer &amp; bow on mine yesterday and it chewed stuff up, but I was down in the Ash Heap with a lower level buddy so everything was weak as hell anyway. Wasn't sure how it'd hold up against tougher things. Guess I'll be busting it out at WS or against the next SB to land near me ü§£
---
Yup
---
Awesome! Thanks!
---
I‚Äôm not sure how you farm for ammo, but I can make around 3-4K between two weapon types in about 30 minutes 
---
I agree but without uranium fever, dont miners max at 40?
---
Camp Mc Clintock, ammo bags and Military Duct tape :-)
---
I can happily debunk the map is level based myth right now , I agree with getting swamped with high level enemies out of nowhere. On more then one occasion I have had level 60+ enemies pop in in gorge junkyard. I have had an endless wave of level 40 glowing mole miners at the ski resort , I have personally experienced the elusive TRIPLE scorchbeast circling my camp , this was all on a character i just got to level 30 btw. 
---
When you team up with a friend who is just starting out, and you are high level, you will spawn mobs at your level and your friend will be unable to kill anything himself. So you if you convince a friend to buy the game and play with you, you will have to make an alt or else his combat is fucked.
---
Every time I see a motorcycle i think who would fuck with power armor. Everyone would be getting these things up and running and riding across the wasteland. Those scorch beasts could echo locate my dust as haul ass away from that shit. 
---
That and it would make vault raids useless, since they wouldn't have anything wrong with them. If they implemented NPCs i agree they'd have to rid the scorched, but I think they'd bring stray wanderers over vault dwellers to keep up the twisted nature of vault tec. But, I agree that it might be too dificult for them. 
---
Side note, they are hiring server engineers, so maybe it'll work a bit down the line. 
---
I don't double load with TA since the cost is not that high compared to what I will make via event or vendor. Spending 100-200 caps to make 1400 or spending 20 caps to make 30 .. I am fine with. I mean we only have a 25k cap limit and most things don't cost past 2k save for stuff from other players or serums.
---
Or the lite letters &gt;.&gt; at 11.5k or 9.5k depending on your perks.
---
Yep i remember when that great raider collected up a 1200 bounty and wrecked my base. So i took out my shottie and killed him. 
---
Turns out he is a zombie... spawned back pretty close and this went on and on and on. Until i had to change dimensions to get away from this * raider *.
---
This is why we need pvp and pve servers. Doubt the pvp servers would last though it would mainly just be griefers.. sorry raiders. Its probably why hunter / hunted mode is so popular!!!!.
---
Maybe they feel like they need a real challenge so they must also find and camp low levels and their camps.
---
Because thats the raiders life yo ho yo ho...
---
But being in PA would break the Death Tambo in one hit due to all the power.
---
I'll be on in like 5 hrs. I can take you to all the major vending points if you like. 
---
I wish their volume level would decrease with every point of Charisma. 
---
Just yesterday I had [this one](https://i.imgur.com/pLemCp1.jpg) drop from a random scorched who was running around holding it like a sword. I scrapped it hoping to learn the paint, no luck though. If it was 45 I might have kept it, but it's not worth carrying around a non-legendary just for the bling. Also the tri-barrel doesn't have the skin.
---
I could do either! Is it worth making a discord and rounding up PC players?
---
The class was in all emotes. They say 76 is a control vault but it‚Äôs a lie. 
---
They're somehow able to slide across the floor after swinging and missing
---
We are dozens. DOZENS!
---
Ive got around 100 bounty kills and im coming for u raider :)
---
PS4 drunkdoja420
---
Boo hoo then dony play the game move on 
---
Yes 
---
And Yes (at least Brahmin as far as I'm aware)
---
Oh my god that‚Äôs so annoying. I hadn‚Äôt even noticed it was an event. Didn‚Äôt even get to farm any fusion cores üò≠
---
And if you read the terminal in Vault 76 you‚Äôd know that several residents have a history of being put in a cell for being defiant. In my mind, my player is one of them. Think of it. You‚Äôre in a Vault with the same bastards for 25 years, and you get the chance to start a new world. Best believe I‚Äôm gonna take out the ones who will give me problems. 
---
Do the Mayor For A Day quest and get 8 Stimpacks every time you load a server. 
---
I seem to have this happen when using laser rifles that turn enemies to ash piles
---
You are the only person in this sub who was confused by this.
---
it's different when they're outraging over shit that isn't even true, or beating a dead horse in the case of "no human NPCs? REEEEEEEEEE".
---
Same way as everyone else weight rooms silo weight rooms lucky hole mine etc but need to server hop for hours to find areas not pre looted I guess I could dupe like everyone else but fuck that. 
---
she's not normally so judgmental, i think she's just more used to voicechat in games than i am. I huess i just don't understand the proper protocol. I usually just say "hi there", or "hey, bud, need anything?" My only experience is playing wow 10 years ago while she does it every day on OW or monster hunter world. 
---
As much as I would love to be a raider in this game, at the moment it isn't really possible. All you can do is slap someone to death or wreck their base and there is no risk vs reward and I can't find any sort of sense of achievement in it at all unfortunately. To me it just feels like kicking over some kid's sandcastle. Team killing in a FPS is a better form of PvP than what we have now. Here's hoping we get something decent in the next update
---
This is true, I feel there are reaply 2 types of content: solo and team. I spent my first 100 hrs soloing the game like all other fallouts which was fun for a while. Now I found a teamate that joins me whenever we're both on and it's a whole different adventure. 
---
Sorry then ;-( I got a rifle anti ghoul explosive two shot and a Gatling plasma reload two shot explosive, but I'm a shotgun user do I can't use those. 
---
Other than that, yeah, loads of mutant hooks, junkie board and instigating rocket launchers. I got an instigating dragon but I don't do PvP so I sold it.
---
The pleasure is all mine. I‚Äôll be waiting
---
Grafton train station, and the Grafton (responder) robot vendor named Greg in the middle of town. I just finished my BOS combat armor set last night, and it took quite a few hops to get it all. BOTH vendors sell the plans randomly. Unfortunately, you will also get very very tired of the Grafton mayors voice because the 2 events there trigger EVERY time!
---
Yeah I started yesterday and knew I was going to play the same way. I was leaving the valet and a 9 year old told me to F off unless I was going to join him so I obliged.
---
All these suggestion threads like Bethesda cares lol. 
---
I was expecting to like this -- I wasn't expecting professional quality presentation/writing. Very impressive..
---
If you could actually plunder stuff from someone's camp beyond unlocked resource extractors or picking their veggies I would agree raiding is a valid play style.
---
Griefers, to me, are people who go in, see a nice camp someone made, and destroy it for no particular reason other than boredom and then ~~HIDE LIKE COWARDS BEHIND~~ give the excuse that griefing = raiding.
---
PVP is poorly implemented in this game, we can all agree on that. But don't try to justify being a Sack of Richards by saying hurr durr I'm a raider.
---
Booze/strength food?
---
Yeah i have a few friends i play with anyway but im always happy for more. You above 50?
---
I‚Äôm a heavy weapons build, and I always carry 2 super sledges with me because of ammo costs/crafting materials. It‚Äôs kinda nuts. 
---
Ignorant question, but can't bethesda extrac code from mods that fix these bugs and implement them in fo 76, or is that too hard?
---
I would only ever figure out how to dupe things to sell if i could make drills with the 40% swing speed reduction.
---
You think guys with two-shot explodey weapons are annoying *now?* BWAHAHAHAHAHA!!!
---
Ammo smith + super duper = ALL the ammo
---
With .50 ammo you make 100 per, 200 with ammo smith and add the chance to double with super duper and thats 300-400 ammo per craft. 5mm ammo works the same.
---
Keeping a Heavy supplied with ammo is much easier than other classes due to the amount. Commandos and Guerrillas have it much, much rougher due to the much lower returns in ammo crafting for those ammo types.
---
I was hoping that the factions would yield to more opportunities to express such a playstyle. For now the hunter/hunted radio ain‚Äôt cutting it
---
"And the two skeletons are...?"
---
"Part of it!"
---
Yeah, i thought so as well, found a nuked frima last night, headed over and it was just me and another player there, no chance doing the queen :/ no idea where the other players was, but nothing on the map inside the nuke zone...
---
To be removed in next patch
---
Well technically you don‚Äôt have to do the event. You can just take the workshop and build power. 
---
Do you wear excavator PA in lucky hole? The PA doubles the yield from mining resources.
---
I‚Äôm assuming you go after super mutants for steel as well. 
---
You‚Äôre right there is no need to dupe ammo
---
I have wondered this myself and would love to know why they did not look at the fixes the mods gave us for FO4.
---
I dunno, I seem to find too much ammo in the world, im always dumping ammo coz I dont want to be over encumbered by just ammo, the only ammo type I craft is .50 caliber balls for the blackpowder rifle (dont seem to find a lot of them) but .308, .50 Cal, .45, .44 rounds, find way too many.
---
Expertly crafted post echoing my thoughts +1
---
Ahww, man! That sucks. In a few days after we've all tossed it away there's gonna be some redicularly cool stuff to do with them...
---
Nice work dude 
---
Exactly which is why RIP ranged until amounts are fixed / adjusted. 
---
Obviously it's the Mothman warning you about something. 
---
Just 2 ignorant blokes meandering cluelessly though virtual life. 
---
Yeah let me spawn kill level 5 noobs in flatwoods with my TSE in peace üò°  /s
---
This lad gets it.

Gameplay „Äã Lore

Also love the point you made as well very much so lol.
---
you should be able to side with the raiders and always be wanted
---
Yeah ahahhahah

I‚Äôm level 75, and I only play with other people on a team rather than soloing it. I‚Äôm having a blast. I even have multiple characters I‚Äôve started because I enjoy certain quest lines immensely like ‚Äòinto the mystery‚Äô :)
---
Man I'm  cool with two shot. And a two shot fat Man would make that gun actually relivent again. But with all these explosive guns a fatman is pointless cause who wants carry around a heavy gun and ammo that weighs 6 piunds a piece when I can carry aroumd a gun that weighs a loy less and ammo thats practically weightless compared to a mini nuke.
---
Where did you get the red eye posters and do you remember what they were called?
---
Its the only set I havent managed to pick up yet 
---
I like this rotation: 
---
1. Check the protectrons outside of the BoS vendor in watoga - a legendary may spawn with up to 3 stars, check the vendor in case it sells a rare plan (t-51 jetpack) / mod
---
2. Go to the medical center - 100% guaranted legendary enemie spawn up to 3 stars inside the location
---
3. Go to repair yard (south of watoga along the railroad) - a legendary may spawn with up to 3 stars &amp; a plan inside the shack
---
4. Server hop and do the same backward rinse &amp; repeat. You can also check the station vendor for T-60 / excavator calibrated shocks, it sells good on market.
---
Used to do this a while ago while farming for PA mods and it was really rewarding for legendary items, caps &amp; exp. In 1 hour I'd get more 3\* enemies than during a nuked whitespring.
---
Monster Mash is decent for XP but IMO it's not efficient for farming legendary items.
---
Uranium Fever is fun but I never loot max level legendaries there.
---
Yes sbq will drop plans for that armour but you have to farm them regularly. Only gotten a leg plan so far. 
---
What is this "inspect" you speak of good sir?
---
You can get max level Legendaries there. Personally I just nuke whitespring, but since he's 46, he's probably best off just farming what's available rather than wasting too much time trudging through a silo
---
Ahh you see there‚Äôs a method to the madness. Some folks I‚Äôm nice too, and some I‚Äôll rile up. Depends on how I feel, or what I need. If you wanna talk about the cowards talk about the bastards duping and playing this game like it‚Äôs crash bandicoot. 
---
You know what I like to do? I like to make friends with another player. Do some missions with em, hell I‚Äôll even share items and plans. 
---
But if I felt like it, I could kill em. And while they‚Äôre on their knees, I‚Äôll eat them. Just like the folks over at the Bolton Greens. 
---
No. They have their own perks.
---
Haha dropping bodies on me from the sky
---
Are you the mothman though?
---
No. "Explosive" is Explosive. Furious is increased damage for each consecutive hit on the same target. Since miniguns fire so insanely fast, the idea is that the Furious bonus stacks very fast.
---
Ask for a price check on the trade subs- might get a decent offer for it.
---

---
Endurance is trash at the moment.   I would hope in the future ‚Äúthe tank‚Äù of the group needs it.
---
I feel ya, I see all these great ideas but you know that big company has their own plans and ideas. Rightly so, but none the less it still irritating to k ow they could have done so much more.  Guess they ran out of creative juices.
---
They're different weapon types, so, no, I can't imagine they would. Shotguns have their own suite of Perks.
---
You can find tvs in watoga, next one I see I'll buy for you if still needed. 
---
Imagine actually putting pool cues, racks and balls on your pool table. That's my dream
---
Find yourself a wild lead vein and setup camp.   It's been a boon for me.   
---
Can you tame a Mothman ?
---
I lije to think he doesn't have a dedicated gpu
---
The main one i think is the trade channel of the chat mod.
---
I'm not sure what sorta prices they go for as is, how much would you pay? 
---
System? If xbox I can help
---
Don't know how reliable this is, but someone told me today that in the Portuguese version of the last lot of info about the new PvP mode it mentions factions. Really hope it's true
---
I think it's a kind of lag- they were already dead and the game spawned them for you and then cross-checked and autocorrected- lol.
---
you're lucky you at least got that.. I've had a rare flatwoods monster just freeze in place after I killed him, and he was completely un-lootable.. NO window. 
---
Proof? This does not seem correct since shotguns have their own perks.
---
I do. Again it's maybe enough for 1-2 nukes then back to server hoping for farm. 
---
I'd rank Endurance as low importance. And you'll find more useful perks in Strength and Agility.
---
I can get behind that.  I often confuse the interface for transferring parts from Power Armor with actually getting in the Power Armor, so then I end up with two Power Armors in my inventory and I have to play the stupid game of figuring out which one is mine versus the one I accidentally took.
---
Haha I‚Äôd rather go for the player over level 100 and kill em while they‚Äôre fuckin around in Whitesprings or duping some item. 
---
You gotta spice it up, killing level fives are no fun. Make a friend, spend a couple days doing missions with em, get on their good side. Then when you don‚Äôt wanna drag em along because they got a little annoying asking you for Nuka Cola all the damn time take some psycho and crack em in the skull while they sleep
---
No true....If you really think so then you don't have the hours played I have, over 350.  Yes, anomalies happen, scorch beast can and will show up anywhere regardless of level.  
---
For example, if you arrive in a location that I just left, yes, your gonna see elevated levels of enemy.  But, for the most part, the map is level based.  I'm not gonna list out the different areas, go watch a youtube video to get that.  
---
Everyone seems to have these two shot weapons. I'm lvl 65 and still haven't come across one
---
That happened to me once at my camp while I was being attacked by ghouls. I think I had passive mode off at the time and something else in my camp came between the turrent's line of sight and the attacking mobs while it was firing.
---
Yay I‚Äôm excited to join, other groups are too bro-ey :) psn Linzsays 
---
PC. Thanks for the offer though! 
---
Oh I was to lazy to start that welp I‚Äôm level 43 I guess I will be starting that later
---
To make matters worse sometimes it can be mirelurk king*s*
---
I'd guess more than 500k, less than 1.5mil.  
---
Got one and scrapped it, I use energy weapons.  No idea how rare it was at the time.
---
I hope it‚Äôs true too. I need to purge lol 
---
I don't really care for the pvp at all personally. However, my camp consists only of work benches, and a couple of turrets to keep the mole rats off you while you try to use them. I use the camp exclusively for scrapping and storing when I am carrying too much. Nobody has destroyed mine so far. Mostly because it's probably unnoticeable in vegetated areas.
---
I saw a few odd pages of this the other day. It is *very* good. Sell us all a PDF or something.
---
Np, good luck fellow vault dweller. 
---
This is so great! Thanks for posting!
---
I wouldn't be surprised if by the end of the year this game had a population to rival similar titles. It justs needs more love and end game content.
---
Question - marsupial does -5 INT, right? Which really only matters when you're crafting? So could you just pop a rad-x to negate mutation effects whenever you want to craft/repair gear, thus making marsupial have essentially no downside?
---
To be fair greifing is only bad for the person actually doing the greifing.
---
Lemme break it down. You, sitting in your camp, putzing around building and just doing you. Till dun dun duuuun ... A raider comes up and starts tossing grenades into your camp, destroying your things.
---
Now, this is where being the aggressor in the world bares NO FRUIT. You, being attacked. Have options. You now have a player with a free cap value on their head for you. You also get THE FIRST true shot. You can also log off and REPAIR everything for a small junk fee.
---
So, where does cowardice come in? How does trying to use the only mechanic granted to the raider faction mean their are "greifing" more so when you the defender hold all the power?
---
Yes, pvp in this game is garbage. Those who fire first die first. The person defending holds ALL the power.
---
I love the 50 cal, they cut down on 308 drops so i wouldn't go for the lmg.
---
Wouldn't that be horrible IRL.  Go to visit your grandparents in an old folks home then everyone drops dead.  "Hi grand.... Holy Shit!
---
ski sword is one of best one-handed weapons.
---
Holy shit bud, this is clearly an alt and you're advertising your videos AGAIN. Account created 6 days. And this is the 5th or 6th time I've seen this video posted. 
---
Anyways, "*he*" doesn't kill a SB in less than a minute. "He" shows up to a battle in progress with multiple other players in the fray and **participates**. Click-bait at its best.
---
That's 15ish lead an hour which is at most 1005.556 which takes all of 10 minutes to use... 
---
One way of verifying that paints and jetpack does not exist for ultracet is to take one quick look into the "sites" that sells dupes, if they are not here they don't exist, lol
---
I have checked, paints and jetpack is not there...
---
They're all at Whitesprings, counted 17 there at one point earlier and I just can't see the fascination with that place...
---
There are always a lot of ppl in my lobby
---
Also, by scam offers does that mean I shouldn't link you to my paypal?
---
Bad ass game it has problems but a lot of hate have it a slow start...fix a few bugs and people will give it a chance first of its kind 
---
Ironclad is good if you‚Äôre not going to use power armor. If you want to do a low health high damage build radicool would also be useful. 
---
Besides the very few cares Endurance cards are more for quality of life, it just makes some things easier or less annoying. You can live fine without most of the perk cards so most of them become obsolete. 
---
Hehe
---
Hmm, PayPal may be an exception
---
I got an Instigating Combat Knife that does 2x damage if an enemy is at full health and stabs 40% faster.  Definitely became my go-to weapon in lower-level areas because one stab can take out most enemies.
---
Heck, Glowing Mole Men and the Lv. 50 Protectrons in Watoga fall in 2-3 stabs.
---
I'm with you there. They are planning on adding weekly events soon. I thought it might be a bit of new content each week. Now I think it's just going to be broken quests like the daily events that rotate with nothing really new added at all.
---
Wish I had that luck... 
---
I‚Äôve seen those drones!!! Crazy!
---
Are they the same weapon with different receivers or two separate plans are required to craft them?
---
lol
---
I carry around that kind of ammo simply because it lowers my weight by using lead I accrue through silo runs. Y'all need to stop witch hunting
---
Happened on a scorch beast, went along my way. Happened back by 5 min later and checked and got my stuff
---
Money first trade later üòâ you can trust me, it's the internet!
---
Yes as long as you are carrying at least one of said item. Simply open pip-boy, go to Junk, hit view components (RB on XB1) and select that item. 
---
Try using a flamer as main weapon then say you always have enough ammo. XD that turn out is completely broken. 
---
You should consider logging in and out in power armor sometimes, because doing so currently refills your fusion core to almost completely full when you log back in (as long as the currently-equipped core still has *some* charge).
---
Top place to farm exp , legendaries, rad away and stims. Then drop a nuke on it and those get alot better. :)
---
I turn of every radio I find as a matter of habit, and yes I am super fun at parties
---
It's the communist posters plan you need
---
To be fair I posted a video of Cheeseburger Cake yesterday myself. His video for unarmed melee is truly nuts, just all the things die.
---
Exactly! I personally have no qualms being the attacker in this scenario. I just need one more score, that‚Äôll make it go away. Just one more score...
---
I was going to say this, sooooo much wasted space üòë
---
Thanks mate, appreciate it 
---
This is honestly fucking amazing.
---
I've been on consistently full servers so it could just be your location maybe? 
---
Nice! Thanks
---
They always run away from me. Am I just ugly?
---
Thanks! I keep finding both, but it seems that every time I remember to take that piece out of storage to repair it, I only have 2 ballistic fibre.
---
You'll know it's the club when 27 glowing fat ones pour out of the front door and 4 asshats with tse shotguns scream "Git good or git out of the way!" into their mics. 
---
Pvp servers- coming soon to a 76 near you this January 
---
So what, just remove explosive weapons from the game?
---
You should seriously approach Bethesda about licensing this to them for publishing. Or getting permission to publish it yourself.
---
Spooky shit. I love it.
---
I play with friends on PS4 and often times when I‚Äôm trying to join them the world is full ü§®
---
I trade for TSE's since they're basically currency. Nobody wants caps, but everyone wants TSE.
---
Restarted the game and the mission showed up, telling me to take the elevator down so I'll see what happens next 
---
I feel like ammo and other stackable items (like junk etc.) shouldn't take up weight in the stash at all personally - there shouldn't be significant load on the server associated with this (tracking items being the apparent reason for the weight limit) - they are just Integers.
---
A lot of melee‚Äôs power comes from being the favorite to boost using stacking buffs. Control those and melee gets controlled. I‚Äôd also point out that the only reason why ranged weapon users don‚Äôt do this is because TSE exists. If they only take those away, guns will start stacking buffs too.
---
Confused by what? If you see player icons that are yellow they are on your team. So you or friends were duping. Can't cry about server crashes when your part of the reason why.
---
Also, how are you losing caps from workshops? Its 25-35 caps to take them, which is for the most part covered after clearing the location. 
---
What is greifing ?
---
\+karma :) Someone actually understands the definition of Raiders and does not forget that it is one of the base entities. Thank you!
---
Depending on the platform you are on, you can press a button on a item to "inspect" it. Upon doing this if it is more than a 1* ledgendary it will tell you the additional effects on it.
---
For instance, if you are on PS4 or XBOX I believe it is R3 to inspect
---
if you using automatic, select anti-amor. furious legendary affix is not applying properly in automatic mode.
---
Meh, I love my Commando and Guerrilla. Ammo can be a pain in the ass but it's not that hard.
---
I honestly don't like phys in this game. Not because it's easy, just to much clicking for me lol.
---
The only thing I got to work was using a paint set on my favourite power armour from the atom shop, that then marked it with a atom symbol in my inventory... Not a fix though, I really want to name all my gear too, that and lock it so I can't sell it. Couldn't agree more with you
---
https://nukacrypt.com
---
Ive noticed that in certain menus my armor is marked while in power armor, either at a vendor or scrap menu or both. Could be a (good) bug.

Dont have an answer to your question, but super duper is the best perk Ive leveled. If I knew about it, id get it as early as I could. Waited until I was 73. No more care about ammo/food and the extra crafting stuff I dont need gives me things to sell to vendors or give to players. 
---
I did a full 15 luck build. First 15 points to luck. Just hit 50. No big noticable difference in game (no TSe so far), but all looted weapons are full, and pharma pharma has been like 90%. I hope super duper follows
---
This has been posted way too much. It is coming later this month
---
I like his content since finding it on Bethesda forums. He clearly does 90% of the damage to SB everyone else was whacking on it with not much effect. I'm sure they helped with adds thou. 
---
Cheers

Chopping that wood.
---
chop. wood. chop. wood. chop. wood.
---
Things I kill seem to occasionally fly away randomly, so this gives me some peace of mind knowing they make it back to Earth. 
---
I feel your pain on the warehouse plans. I‚Äôve done quests, picked up plans in the wild, taken and held workshops, for hours and hours and I still can‚Äôt get them. None of the vendors ever have them (even with server hopping), and finding Grahm is always a huge pain in the ass, so it‚Äôs gotten to the point where I‚Äôm taking a break from the game because of it. 
---
Might just have to go on the FO76 bazar and ask to buy them off someone.  
---
dude they tore down the whole first floor of my CAMP when i first started. some ghoul got onto my 2nd floor and they decided to break down my walls to get to it.
---
never again
---
The whole mole miner thing is kind of depressing to think about. Bunch of humans doing their job in the mines just affected by the radiation and mutate to turn into the mole men. If you listen carefully you can actually hear something beyond their grunting sounds. I steer clear of Welch for their sake, but any time I need to kill one it makes me happy to kniw that I am releasing one from the misery of its life.
---
-4 INT. -1 INT if you have Class Freak maxed out. Not sure about the Rad-X question. You would think it might, since it "suppresses" mutations. But never really checked on it when I've taken one.
---
add me on PSN, have plans, will trade
---
The pitchfork was damaged in the battle, so much so that it is no longer usable. The mob also happened to be holding a pipe wrench, which of course is fine because they were not using it.
---
Gamers have to make up crap like this for all kinds of games, for example in WOW, when you kill a wolf and it's carrying a sword. *Well, I guess that wolf ate a person that was carrying a sword.*
---
I agree my commando is so much fun. Just the ammo gives me nightmares. 
---
I don't mind too much some raiding, although there isn't much you can raid in FO76. It's just the game was billed as co-op with opt in PvP. So griefing =/= raiding. Especially when they force you to server hop and come find you again.
---
Having to switch off settings and block people isn't hiding from raiding it is hiding from griefers who are, you must admit, raiding to grief people. 
---
Flamers are to heal people silly! With fire &gt;:).
---
Buggy
---
I had this issue clear through about level 40.
---
Best solutions are to craft ammo, but in the meantime what I did was had a constant rotation going. Primarily used the hunting rifle with .308, had two combat rifles - one with a .38 receiver and one with .45. Rotate usage and as you find/build ammo change back and forth. Spreads the consumption around until you get the highest level of Ammosmith and Super Duper. Even at the higher levels I keep a rotation going, melee where possible when fighting lower level mobs. 
---
Just for some perspective, I had 6k .45 rounds stocked up at one point, in the course of one session and two visits to the nuke zones I went down to nearly 0. Hence why a melee weapon build or alternate card stack is highly recommended.
---
Last I checked the game was rated M, for those 17 and up. Maybe the nine year old should have been more prepared for such an encounter. 
---
Can‚Äôt agree more on the value of super duper. 
---
Oh boy. Are we in the ‚Äúthe lore justifies it guysh!‚Äù phase now?
---
It‚Äôs a game, dude. Lore is just for flavor, not a roadmap on what players should be allowed to do. And even if it was, you‚Äôre arguing against people complaining about them. Well guess what in the lore *people hate raiders*. So quit complaining. You and all griefers are scum, and we will hate you and call you what we want.
---
And we also will demand devs fix their shit if it gives you too much of an edge. Deal with it.
---
You always spawn there in the gardens out front, as far as I‚Äôve seen. I did this exact thing the other day, I was in the Artisan Corner when I logged. Came back in to make a sale later... ‚ÄúAlright, should be just inside come down to... uh... wait I‚Äôm outside I‚Äôll head in and then FUCK ME OH SHIT SHIT It‚Äôs nuked damn it hang on no no NO NO RUN FASTER‚Äù
---
Made it inside with 10 health remaining, the rest in rads. Fun times. 
---
You can‚Äôt log into the hotel. When you log in, you appear at a nearby entry.
---
It's stupid easy to avoid them. Also, Rose is my least favorite character in this game. Or in any game to be honest. I'd rather her be replaced by Pickles from Borderlands the Pre-Sequel. And I absolutely loathe him.
---
, different weapons, if you going with heavy guns, the 50 cal if my personal fav. The lmg goes threw 308 rounds like crazy. 
---
Lol yeah, I've had that too, usually when I kill mobs that are in that sleep mode they're in before they detect you. Pop their head off and they go flying
---
I'm level 116 and got a TSE The Dragon to drop off Uranium Fever.  It's only level 35 and yet is far and away the most powerful thing I've ever seen.  I run a pure melee build with no ranged perks and a number of serious VATS penalties, yet this thing does 800+ damage and takes down scorchbeasts in a few shots without even a need for VATS, you just kinda eyeball them as they flap around and touch it off.  I hate it, I hate that it exists, and I hate that I feel like I still have to carry it around just in case I get ambushed by griefers.
---
I got the plan if you want to buy it still.
---
Ooh that makes sense, I stand corrected!
---
Psn MyNameIs_Rainman lvl 77 main lvl 16 alt, don't think I'll be on today but when I'm on I'm game to help loot and level in between my questing and event grinding

I tested your theory and afaik it doesn't apply universally as you suggest. I had two intelligence bobbleheads. I took one and checked my special. I logged out and logged back in, took the other, and my intelligence did not increase again.
---
If this does work like you claim, it might only apply to damage bobbleheads
---
Oh yeah! My mutation rundown for the last 2 weeks has been Marsupial, Speed Demon, Healing Factor, and Plague Walker. Marsupial and Speed Demon being the chocolate and peanut butter of the group. They just belong together!
---
I have a base 15 luck and usually its higher from multiple unyielding armors.  I do not feel lucky when it comes to finding 2/3 stars.  In fact, I feel unlucky.  Now the stupid high durability on everything I find is nice, but the quality of the items does not seem to be affected.
---
Uh oh... nobody tell him what they nerfed the core production rate to.
---
Mass cow suicide, ala Southpark.  Mine spawned at the bottom of a cliff.
---
Yeah .. every time I reload and watch the ammo bar go down I sigh inside, then I end up killing things near what I need to collect for ammo to make myself feel better. 
---
Raiders killing stuff to feel better ... such is life.
---
I use a shotgun build but i have a TSE shotgun so i delete everything including scorchbeasts. I would reccomend a Shotgun build especially with a X-01 PA set with a Jetpack.
---
I‚Äôm starting an alt that I‚Äôm planning on making into a melee/heavy gunner build and I can tell you it‚Äôs very viable!  There are youtubers who highlight this build and as it is now it is very overpowered. 
---
As for a tip on the build the one that pops to the top of my mind is to make sure that once you hit level 50 is to do the watoga quest ‚Äòmayor for a day‚Äô so you can get the All Rise legendary supersledge. It‚Äôs a very nice weapon for a melee build and I‚Äôm enjoying it on my main who is a melee/medic :) it pretty much one or two hit kills monsters. And when scorchbeasts are landed they do not last very long.
---
The only downside to this build that I can think of is that when you fight scorchbeasts you are at an obvious disadvantage when they are in the air.
---
Hope I was helpful :)
---
Moners do max out, but they can and do drop weps up to 50.
---
As one already stated, radicool is awesome if you do a rad build. Only 1 point and no upgrades
---
If you keep a little budget free, they come back on a relog, sometimes...
---
not enough perks room for using both.
---
Once I discovered the super Duper and Ammosmith combo, I've been sitting at 4500+ ammo for both my gauss and combat rifle on my main. I already have about 3k 308 on my alt since I just didn't wanna keep it on my main and wanted to clear up some space lol
---
Do both the machine guns have a decent mod selection? 
---
I've found a slight work around as I've noticed they stay in a specific order in your inventory so if you remember that you'll know which is which
---
I'm not surprised to see it as a crafting option, since not all crafting options have plans. But I am shocked to see it as a plan. Maybe its been added since the time the reddit poster I found did the plan extraction with his tool.
---
I can tell you that I've run Grafton and both Watoga vendors 500+ times and I've never seen it show up. Maybe I can make and scrap a ton lf combat armor chests in the hope that I unlock it somehow. But I basically gave up and I use the unique Enclave urban armor now.
---
Thanks.
---
I am the third member of daft punk with the sentry bot helmet
---
Because it isn't a well put together game. You can like it, sure, but people generally don't enjoy buggy and rushed games.
---
The one other stat I'd like to know is... How many times have you DC'd? I can't seem to play more than 4 hours without getting booted and usually when in the deepest part of an instance.. 
---
That's exactly how I did it!
---
Honestly just for shits and gigs, if you're going to follow that path you should try to recreate my outcome. Just build the quick little 4x4 then build and store 9 turrets. It took me less than 2mins to do if you watched the video. If you're results are different than mine, I'm more inclined to believe there is something else going on as well. 
---
I'm pretty sure luck does not affect quality of legendaries, only durability.  I'm 15 base and usually over 20 and not lucky in finding 2/3 stars.
---
what sort of tse shotgun do you use? combat? pump? 
---
Does the range actually hit the scorchbeasts when they are flying?
---
Very true! Haha. 
---
There‚Äôs a fair share of folks out there who hate Raiders, and there‚Äôs a good amount that love em. We could go on, I‚Äôm sure. I think you should direct your angst towards those who are exploiting the game, like the duper‚Äôs, and not those who just want to shake up your day a bit. 
---
Hate us and call us what you want, still gonna do it. And like you said, it‚Äôs just a game, dude. A game where I can go out of my way to destroy your camp and take whatever you have from your extractors. And when I‚Äôm don‚Äôt bashing your head in till your on your knees, I can eat you and have a bottle of whiskey on the dinner table you placed in your precious camp. 
---
I want the fucking warhawk ... come on BGS!!!
---
Message me if you have it or something similar
---
Your right! Don't know what I was thinking!
---
Thats kinda weird. Youd think that when you scrap for, lets say the say legs, itd be mods for both legs. Not for anything else in that category/type of armour.  Doesnt really make sense why that is. At least to me anyways. But my 2 cents would be to fix it to where when you scrap legs, you get leg mods. 
---
There isn‚Äôt any point to any other weapon until explosive effects are removed or heavily nerfed. It‚Äôs that big of a balance problem that free use of the word ‚Äúnerf‚Äù is entirely justifiable.
---
And nerf stacking low HP buffs. That‚Äôs out of control too and what leads to one shot melees. It‚Äôll be the next flavor when explosive gets nerfed.
---
Save up a few thousand caps and ask over on the trade subs- as long as it's not a god roll or anything that much will get you something nice in a trade.
---
No, it's 33/hr, it just only holds 14.  
---
You're right, it's not going to supply your entire day's play in 5 minutes.   The game is harder than that, what a shame.  /s
---
I can play later.
---
Add me on mrkusta if you want. 
---
That's it? Hit that mark roughly 150 hours in and jumped too making a primarily PvP character at level 100. The need too carry 50k ammo at once is quite unnecessary since with the ammosmith 2 and super duper 3 you can craft 1000+ in seconds and that'll last you awhile unless you're a active automatic user. Highly bought you're switching between every one of those guns during combat. The game got boring once i was stronger than pretty much everything and was two shotting them.
---
Honestly I wouldn't like the explosive perk to get nerfed at all, not at this point of the game. Many of us worked our *sses off in order to get one of those, it is endgame content after all. The problem is the insane amount of dupers going around right now.
---
You're not forced to pick a perk card related to the SPECIAL you upgraded during a level up.
---
Thats where I got my faschnact mask
---
Outstanding!
---
Yeah I'm holding off on quests that reward legendaries this time around. I have access to watoga on my alt, although it is definitely not safe to walk around lol just there to check the stock at the vendors
---
Too bad I can‚Äôt find the link now but I watched a video yesterday of a melee build that was 1 shotting all 3 levels of scorchbeasts. Only problem is it obviously needs to be on the ground which can be a pain sometimes üòÇ
---
Is that they have to add, we will not always be against the burned, also several messages from people who have escaped. in some time they will return If not, the game will always be the same, in a couple of months people will get bored and stop playing. 
---
Oh, fasnacht? Well shoot. I have that one, got it at Defiance. I thought that was for the owl mask. 
---
Aaw that's too bad, I'd have come and helped:)
---
Noticed that in day 1, it still bothers me.  You're not alone!
---
From what I understand, a large part has to do with level and Charisma.  The animal has to be, at most, half your level in order to have a chance to tame it.  The higher your Charisma, the higher chance you have to tame, rather than just pacify.  Also, I've heard that the animal has to be solo, not with a group.  I've been trying to get all the info, because I've got plans for a nice pet wolf at my camp.
---
Combat and god yes i modded it for range just for those wankers lol.
---
Plus jetpack to get close, just becareful how close because the shotgun will kill you.
---
they could make a dalaran-style wow city, where people can not shoot or harm 
---
I found Grahm today, walking around the Mire after it had been nuked, and he had nothing good! So disappointed. 
---
Just want to say this topic pops up when googling about Violet Flux. So i'll share my experience from last night.
---
Im agreeing with Harpers Ferry. I found roughly 75-80 violet flux in about 40 min. Too bad it takes 10 to make pure flux though haha. But run along the outskirts of the town. Purple plants equal violet flux. 
---
And the super mutants in the town drop all the goods to craft violet flux.
---
Enjoy
---
I did that yesterday, lvl 26, sniper build, I sniped him and went back to the shadows and sniped him again etc. Finished him with a grenade for good mesure. You can do it!
---
I agree the ammo types you listed are plentiful but 5.556 actually received a Nerf to drops in a prior patch when it was already hard to find. Urgh
---
There is a bug where the flora won't turn into nuked flora. Sucks but it happens. 
---
Go to the golf clubhouse, Raydohedron for days
---
No, not really, 
---
I‚Äôm familiar with the police academy Eugene Tackleberry lol. Classic movies. Never seen tremors tho. 
---
you don't need action boy if you have lone wanderer because diminishing returns.
---
I've been running into issues where only some of the plants turn, and the others stay normal.. however, try running around the outside of the resort and golf club.. like near the roads. There are plenty of things out there to make cobalt flux and yellowcake. blackberry bushes turn into radberries, and THEY will give you the yellowcake ingredients. 
---
Plankton is that you? 
---
That also nets yellowcake?
---
So everyone on a server is on the same system?
---
I have a sniper/shotgun build. Didn't think there would be enough room in the caves for snipe. I have a long scope, think I should change to medium? 
---
I agree. The division had at least one bluegrass song in it and it was set in New York! Add some grass please! 
---
Of course, also I can email you my credit card info or send a blank check in the mail, I trust that you'll remove only the amount that I ask you to remove from my account.
---
...aaaaany questions?
---
I have never bought the plan and I can craft them , so I suppose yes...I have scrapped loads though 
---
This. Basically makes post battle or fall damage stims unneeded. Will 100% heal you in a matter of seconds.
---
Impressive for sure. The amount of dedication and patience is a feat into itself... but one question I always have for min-maxers is why not become and accounted.. or stock broker... these skills seem like they would be better spent on making a living and helping people rather than on a hobbie or pastime.
---
Might just be me but standing on a wall and mashing L2 just isn't my thing lol
---
I will admit that I dont find a lot of 5.56 rounds, but I also dont tend to use my handmade very often, was worse with the assault rifle, get to 200 rounds, then in about 10 mins back down to 20 rounds
---
You can‚Äôt scrap it though. I‚Äôm thinking the plan is only available from vendors because I‚Äôve scrapped tons of launchers with no luck 
---
Did you have your torch/pipboy light on? 
---
How does one get yellowcake ingredients from radberries? Is there a specific process?
---
Sent you a friend request
---
[This is me right now after reading your post] (https://m.imgur.com/a/V5FF3je)
---
Agreed but i cannot deny the benifits to it lol.
---
Alright, accepting as soon as I get home
---
Yeah it's yellow innit?
---
Unless I was gifted the plan? I swap lots of excess plans/kit with other players...
---
Most people stand on the wall, but others like me and my buddies stand by the door and lay the ghouls down with a TSE shotgun lol
---
Bet you are using a 2 shot wep. 
---
So they're really just being nice and throwing the dumbdumb humans a bone?
---
If they want a ‚Äúliving and persistent world‚Äù something like this needs to happen!
---
That's what I'm hoping for ;)
---
It doesn‚Äôt benefit from the heavy gunner damage perks, so I would guess stabilized doesn‚Äôt benefit it either. That said I don‚Äôt know for sure so I may end up testing it to see if there‚Äôs any noticeable reduction. Thanks for the suggestion 
---
If you're constantly running the Queen, you have ammosmith, and Super Duper; it's not that hard. You get the stable fluxes as a regular for killing the Queen. This guy has been playing a lot. It's a believable amount.
---
Not every single one my first post was not then I discovered him on Bethesda forums and thought to link 2 of his posts for others one got 82 upvotes. Since finding him I like his content and wanted to discuss why ammo drops are broken and this video helped prove my point. 
---
If you are in pacifist mode, does it damage other players?
---
Was it by the Grafton station?
---
Precisely. You could easily leave, and to be frank the attacking party is at a far bigger disadvantage. Also, we don‚Äôt get much but some saggy veggies and a pile of some junk, but to me it‚Äôs fun. I find it fun just like how the next bastard finds duplicating fun. Just like how the next finds farming fun. To each their own. 
---
I figured the rhododendron wouldnt change. I actually didnt see any yellow plants within the zone. I need to look harder next time
---
While I agree I just don't foresee human NPCs ever happening.  This game has already become old news tbh which is unfortunate but a reality.  It's entirely possible there are limitations we are not aware of that led them to make this decision. 
---
Hancock is the thing I miss most in FO76. I just want me ghoul husband, okay.
---
Wouldn't change colors that is.
---
How is that possible? Can you find that for me?
---
I'm loving my daisycutter Fat Man with MIRV attachment lol. 6 Lbs, and 5 nukes at once! Of course, the ammo isn't practical, but it's my emergency weapon
---
It‚Äôs like 10 when semi and 75 when automatic. Damage only reduces by like 11 points so I was hoping it‚Äôd become a deadly full auto. Guess not lol
---
It's not even that. It's due to the fact 24 players with others joining and leaving. Having to have so many non static items in the world with physics and other calculations to take care of. Would add far to much stress right now.
---
A simple solution, item shelving requiring the item + wood to make said item.
---
Yep - will add to the edit above - thanks
---
You can't fast travel when there are enemies nearby. If you're stuck in the CAMP you can't kill the enemies. See the problem?
---
Nope pacifist mode stops all damage from you to players. 
---
One word for every item dropped.
---
They're all around the club house
---
Oh no, Morgantown Airport, by the camp training area. 
---
Can confirm. First time I went there was in the 30s had no idea wtf was happening 
---
my man! let's do it. i'll pm you.
---
I was an adventurer, until I took a rail to the knee. 
---
Or they're afraid that the junkies/alcoholics will vandalize the inventory and want them gone fast  :P
---
Oh damn! I found one of these way back didn't realize it was rare till now. I scrapped it after seeing the stats. I remember thinking wow this thing looks cool I bet its crazy powerful. nope. scrap.
---
Hmm, so alternatively  you could just swap in class freak when crafting...
---
i5-4430 3.2 Ghz on turbo, nvidia 1060gtx, played since beta with high quality
---
So I'd say yes. Was going to upgrade to 4690 too
---
Statistically it‚Äôs not the most powerful gun, but the style points from using it are enough for me. Choo choo!
---
A good question that Ive never really thought about. I just enjoy pushing myself to the limit. Funnily enough that's how i injured myself.
---
Yep I‚Äôm somewhat in the same boat when it comes to checking vendors. Especially trying to get my hands on the handmade rifle plans for me and my friends by farming Harpers Ferry on my level 16. 
---
Got to be sneaky-sneaky
---
Can‚Äôt wait til Bethesda gives us a way to see what plans we have acquired.
---
Yeah, a guy offered to sell me the Deep Pocketed Combat Armor Chest for 10k. Imagine what people dwell in Fallout 76. Haven't found anyone with the plans so far to be interested in trading other plans tho. We can swap other plans if you want.
---
The noise is inconsistent. Just remember all legendary robits explode. Also sentry bots, legendary or not. Finally, some normal ones may explode if you shoot off too many limbs, so try and avoid doing that. Both legs or both arms, that kind of thing.
---
Are you on pc?.
---
Melee still does the most damage and is most certainly not useless against the queen. I use a cryolator when she lands so the melee guy in my group can have more time to obliterate her. Shotguns and heavy guns should fit right into your perk points for the most part if you‚Äôre going from a melee build. I can speak well for heavy guns. Haven‚Äôt tested shotgun myself though. My 1 star anti-armor prime 50 cal does the best against her I‚Äôve found. The TSE 50 cal probably does better though.
---
Here i am hoping some day energy weapons get the buff they need
---
Push through is my opinion. Use a perk calculator and see where you want your build to go, but you can seriously get away with just using 2-3 different-leveled hunting rifles from levels 5-50. We have a respec option now so you cant permanently mess up anything with your build.
---
I usually just bump my endurance up a few for that extra HP so I can be a little more tanky. Plus since the endurance perks are pretty useless you can add cards whenever you want during situational times. I use my extra perk slots in endurance for life giver I believe it's called. I maxed it so it gives me 45 more HP
---
I had an experience with a random who came to my camp. My friends and I just goofed around and used the waving action to see if he was friendly or not...he was! Then he began to drop items underneath him. It was a bunch of plans and recipes to learn! So my friends a d I split them up and saw who needed what and then the guy started going to the house? So I let him in..next thing I knew he dropped me a 3 thresh star legendary that is level 40 and helping me out a ton! I was so happy because I finally had a weapon I could use and was relatively cheap to repair. So not all players are bad and seek to help those who need it. I will be doing the same for my fellow players.
---
Definitely seems like it. Sadly a combat shotgun is simply just better at the effective range of this thing 
---
Any suggestions on a strategy for farming mutations? I was doing it by dying at the abandoned waste dump until I discovered the "dying too soon after getting a mutation so you have it but its hidden and does nothhing" bug. So I'm about to do some blackwater mine tedium.
---
I think it was the room right next to the room the Fasnacht mask spawns, but I found a tin foil hat in Fort Defiance too. Only seen it the one time though, and I do regular farming runs there for ballistic fibers. Guess it's a relatively rare spawn. 
---
Push threw, dont worry about other peoples builds, you can tweak it after 50. 
---
you can grab it from the free states or bos vendor, btw. i have yet to see them outside of their inventories.
---
Maybe you got it from an event, it's possible but still me and my friends are doing events together and no one is getting it.
---
Do quests, do events, use grenades, when you log in for a play session, hit up a workshop for lead, lock it and leave it running while you play and check in with it every half hour. Get ammo crafting perks. Get Super Duper perk. Get excavator armor at some point and hit up Lucky Hole Mine for abundance of lead ore. Cut back on how cute your CAMP is and put metric shitloads of plants in it. Sell your food for money (1400 caps/day if you hit all vendors). Super mutants drop lots of gun powder. Grafton steel yard has crazy amounts of super mutants, as does the WV lumber yard in the top left corner of the map. You could probably make a post on r/fo76bazaar stating you need ammo and someone will probably cut you a deal. Just because you are perked up to use automatic rifles, doesn't mean you should use them for every single thing. Keep a super sledge or shotgun with you to kill low level creatures. Think of your auto rifles as your "big guns" so ammo for them needs to be saved for when you *need* them.
---
It was on this thread, I looked in my YouTube history and it‚Äôs not there. I know a lot has to do with the adrenal reaction mutation, low HP build, and nerd rage perk. He was using a low HP deathclaw gauntlet with extra claw mod. I will look more to try to find the video 
---
I was walking through here last night and came upon two Mr Handy just endlessly asking each other questions: their names were Vlad and Mia. I stood there behind a tree for a good two minutes wondering wtf was going on and realized that they were looping their conversation.
---
This is good to know, ill test it for myself. I did just try using 3 pieces of AP refresh legendary gear and both lone wanderer and action girl. I went from 0-100% ap in under 4 seconds.
---
Oh ok because I had a very similar experience but switched where I was going to the Grafton station and this guy was shooting me and his turrets attacked me so I blew most of them up and he left the server 
---
Side note: anti armor effects tend to not affect energy resistance. I have not found an anti armor legendary energy weapon myself so I‚Äôm not 100% sure on those, but perks and weapon mods that claim to reduce armor actually only reduce ballistic defense.
---
\--Close
---
r/fo76bazaar may be the sub you meant to post to. 
---
&gt;You Cannot Fast Travel When Enemies Are Nearby
---
Bethesda made a lot of crappy games before get their hands on the Fallout series
---
After the hotfix on 12/19 I never get it on any other gun but this one. It must‚Äôve slipped under the radar somehow 
---
thanks
---
Where did you get Raider, Marine, and BoS protective and shielded? Also do you know anything about Casual? I like how they make us hunt them down but gotta know a general direction
---
I have assisted killing her 4 times.  
---
2 of those times, I did not get prime receiver.   I did get some ultracite plans though, like for Ultracite PA.
---
I got the 10MM prime, twice now.
---
Not a lot to go on.
---
But, at level 20 its not a bad time to restart if you don't like the character so far. Just google some guides to what you'd like to pursue.
---
You lads never answer this and i do think your scummy as fuck. But i gotta know do people actually buy this shit off ya for real money?.
---
&gt;which don't show up in any piece.
---
What do you mean by this?
---
Because that's what a business owner likes! Some douchebag convinced of his own intelligence coming around to tell them what the prices "really" should be.
---
Ever notice that Daddy-o gives you intelligence and perception but zaps your charisma? That's 'cause somebody who is convinced they're intelligent and perceptive is insufferable.
---
I feel like there's a delay. When I go into VATS and I notice if I shot right away even with 95% chance, I miss almost 100% of the time but I wait 1-2 seconds, I'll hit. It's very odd.
---
How does your melee do that much damage wtf am I doing wrong in my build??? Do you just have really good legendary effects or something???
---
Think it's more that it gives 20 atoms or so at each milestone, might not add up to much still though
---
I have that happen all the tests, or if you are running but then pull up the pip-boy, your AP will continue to drain for no reason.
---
Ahhhhhh see none of that was there last time.
---
You're 100% right!
---
Damn Is too bad that players don't always focus on the Roleplay part of the game.
---
We can be whoever we want and that aslo mean wich faction we want to choose.
---
I am a responder and I act as a responder!
---
I am not here standing at you and just give you free stuff. I take the time to warn people about the mountains and all.
---
I met a few "griefers" wich simply wanted to play as raiders.  As a responder I have to save a'd protect people and that aslo mean I have to fight raiders. Sometime I lose, sometime I win this is the life in the wasteland.
---
I hope people don't act like kid toward you. 
---
 Hardened Mass data is missing the "NoAutoScrapJunk" keyword.   
---
It's a \*very\* easy fix, let see how many time this will get ;)
---
I appreciate you got what I was sorta going for. Non of my friends did :(
---
Now see the Tin Foil Hat I found in a trailer out by Berkeley. Maybe Defiance just has a couple rare headwear spawn points? Is that a thing? Either way, good information. 
---
Sure, all good points. My point is more that you can and it only takes 2 perk points to literally never worry about ammo, and to be able to use any new weapons. It is supposed to be jack of all trades after all.
---
Psn: ibiza4me . I'm LVL 53 at the moment, I know quite a few weapon,armour and under armour  plans so I can help if needed.
---
I'm on most nights or whenever I have time during the day (gmt).
---
I can help whenever you want with missions or just with looting, only problem I have is I live a over-encumbered lifestyle so I can't fast travel anywhere lol
---
You got shielded for military fatigues?
---
if you get hit again after your "killed" your dead dead. If they don't hit you again your only "kinda dead" and can be revived. 
---
Ok
---
Fire axe- with swing speed at least 
---
but Rose is hot...
---
I unlocked the plans for the CAMP nuclear reactor on maybe day 2 after launch, and for weeks my character could build one of those but could not figure out how to make a shack wall out of scrap metal. 
---
R.I.P. You could've gotten a lot of caps if you've kept it and sold it on one of the trading subs.
---
Ehh, they just look good so I can live with that. I want that iconic Power armor using a huge gun on those posters you see lol I just know the ammo will be the biggest roadblock 
---
Is it the civil war dress that thing is extremely puffy
---
Do you get to the mushroom cloud district very often? What am I saying, of course you don't.
---
I did this too until I went on a crafting spree and it auto scrapped everything in the junk tab. 
---
Actually you are going with the assumption that robots can't have feelings. 
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uw2OKX9ZZfg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uw2OKX9ZZfg)
---
Yeah I take the delay as the time it takes to actually aim the gun. Playing with a VATS character you just learn to give it that extra 1/10 of a second 
---
When I'm carrying them on my person and not in the  stash they stay in the same order and wont flip flop and move around. It's weird but it's the only thing I've got to help me figure out which is which. Putting them in my stash and pulling them back out results in it being in a completely different order
---
Interesting. But you had curator equipped and waited 61-119min before relogging? It only resets in the last hour of effect duration.
---
Whenever you feel like typing it out, man. I like to read haha. I'm sure more than a few people are interested anyway
---
I use a lv50 Medic Pipe Rifle with a full crit build and Gun'Fu. Last night at WP in the nuke zone my friend never took damage below 90%hp. My gun crits every other shot. We combine that with both using Rad Sponge and neither of us die. I do have to hold space bar though and deal with continual crit alert noises.
---
Yeah, I am not really a fan of the low hp builds. I feel like one second of not paying attention ends up costing me a long run back to where I was. 
---
Lucky Hole Mine towards the south of the map is the go to for lead. Then for steel I gather around the Blackwater Mines for ore, or just kill stuff for steel. Excavator armor lets you get 4x the ore, and you can smelt it and get Super Duper procs.
---
For gunpowder, acid/cloth is very abundant in whitesprings.
---
Super Duper and ammosmith are your big perks. 
---
On the last several nukes I‚Äôve done, for some reason the rhododendron directly in front of the clubhouse didn‚Äôt turn.  Specifically those in the beds around the tennis courts seem particularly prone to the bug where the flora doesn‚Äôt turn.  However, heading from the clubhouse past the tennis courts to the garden/path area in the middle, between the main Whitesprings building and the rows of suites filled with ghouls, you can find dozens of raydodendron and a few others lining the walking paths.  These, for me at least, seem to mutate much more reliably.
---
But if they've taken over workshops they'll lose those.
---
Kinda sounds like a nightmare. Poor robots.
---
I didn't mean intelligence as in pompous but rather since the vendors are robots, having a better understanding of them could lead to bypasses or intelligence checks to alter pricing.
---
This is a good tip, as the defense varies from 1 wave of 3 scorched to 4 waves of moronic enemies that get hung up attacking a tree stump 30 metres outside the workshop.   Your description is spot on.
---
You still get the same rewards, far as I can tell.
---
Still good here, not against the rules or 'nothin
---
lmao it just happened yesterday to me! in the SBQ fight area, after she was gone
---
cricket blew to smithereens
---
If we spec into robot hacking we should be able to hack into the prices of a vendor üëç
---
yeah your last sentence basically sums it up there..
---
i would love to get a power plant running and a workshop claimed,
---
but whats the use... the game crashes anyway and u can start all over again on a different server.
---
and if its not the game that is crashing, its people who are duplicating every rare item in the game.
---
(Bethesda sure as hell doesnt care that people are crashing/duping as long as ppl spend money on cosmetics)
---
It rained radtoads for me earlier, I'm talkin' like 10 or 12 corpses just fell from the damn sky and landed next to me
---
Fatigues are casual but pretty sure that's bugged until they fix it
---
From the same silo. We went to 3 different ones. 
---
Yeah, or just permanently slot it like I do along with starched genes.
---
Or they could just make the items "craftable" in the build menu and the only requirement is that you have the actual object in your inventory/stash.
---
I am able to get down a wendigo in 1-3 shots, as a sniper build. The sneak damage bonus helps a lot. I know with that specific wendigo, you need to walk in a bit to trigger it to come out of the ceiling...so I know the sneak bonus may not apply here. I noticed that wendigo's have drawn out animations, so I try to use this to my advantage. It is easier to take them out when they stagger (they really are dramatic creatures). To get them to stagger, I like to throw a shit ton of frag grenades.
---
AFK or not, workshops are PVP areas.
---
There's some good spots Northwest of the Whitesprings Resort in the mountains. Usually right outside of the nuke zone if Whitesprings gets nuked. 
---
Spamming?   I'm not spamming.  I'm expressing a frustration.   If I were posting this several times, perhaps that would be spamming.
---
Peace and Tranquility to you, Vault 76 Sibling.
---
The southern part of whitsprings is my favorite. A lot of open and flat space to build cool bases. Also minimal threat from enemy a.i.
---
I will admit that I am raiding people because I have always loved the Raiders in Fallout. I liked the was The Operators valued wealth and how they carried out missions, I loved Dixie in the Disciples and their kink for spending quality time with their knives inside their victims. 
---
I gained influence from Pickman and his gallery, Red Eye and his stories, the Great Khans in NV and Caesars philosophy. 
---
Here‚Äôs a true story. I followed a player and his friend from a workshop to his camp. I waved. Dropped some plans and recipes. I swam in the river next to their base. I had a change of heart. I signaled a pvp with both of them. They hid inside the camp, locked the doors. I messed around with the windows. Opening them as they closed it. I walked the perimeter of the camp. I saw them peeking through the windows as they tried to figure their next move. I threw Molotov‚Äôs, grenades inside, only for the victim to emote confusion. I quickly ate some gulper slurry and went into the water. I‚Äôm invisible. He‚Äôs playing along. He comes out ready to fight, I take out his friend. Then I take him out. Both still idle waiting to respawn, I fed on their bodies. Bounty hunters showed up, killed me, and collected. 
---
Full circle. 
---
I would suggest going and farming the airport in Morgantown for ammo, guns, Stimpaks, radX, and Radaway as the Scorched there drop those things like candy falling out of a stroller. Plus they‚Äôre easy mobs (level 1-6)  
---
After farming there for a bit and world hopping for Stimpaks you should be good to get back on the beat :)
---
You can also try the AVR Medical Centre as that‚Äôs also an easy to farm area.
---
It‚Äôs a little bit redundant to go back and redo places but it helps me for keeping my characters supplied. 
---
Hope I helped!
---
My wife's a vat of acid. She has a very dissolving personality.
---
Going to bed, but I'll check in tomorrow and see if you still need help
---
To be fair, Fallout has always been 2077 as imagined by people in 1950ish timeframe, rather than as imagined by the modern world.  Gender assumption would be the default.  There are many exampled of things that are clearly not very modern or politically correct in the in game advertising and reading throughout all the fallout games.
---
only thing i lock is my purifiers i see no reason too lock everything else

Role playing is like sex in that it requires two party consent.

1.) every living plant in the wasteland is now in a pot in your house
---
2.) STACK ALL THE STASH BOXES
---
3.) seating arrangements no one uses to fill up space for no reason
---
i know you will do your camp justice.
---
Yeah, that was my experience.  Just when I though I had it figured, the rules changed.  Makes sense that it's the Stash exchange.
---
I was launching nukes on whitesprings often then would try to sit in that server until i disconnected or finished playing. 
---
Then i was mostly nuking the queen for recipes. Now i mostly just adventure around and attend when others drop nukes. I cant stand going into an area with 10 other people trying to farm a building of ghouls. So i usually wait till the big groups disperse. 
---
Ive been nuking different spots recently. Lewisburg and Dyer Chemical have been alright.
---
Most of my play time now is spent doing a whitesprings run then doing events or farming out good areas. Then doing more whitesprings. I rarely server hop now.
---
You must be on slow servers cause I see more and more playing everyday.
---
yeaahhhhh. oh well ha
---
The only problem o have with that is I'm worried that some ferals and other high-ish levels will come after my base while I'm away
---
I dont mean you just people keep posting this even though it is already going to be in the update. It has been recognized 6+ times by bethesda this week alone
---
The BOS questling will take you most likely to protective provided that you have both resistant and treated bought from the watoga brotherhood vendor, Then you finish the questline and start handing in technical data to finally obtain your shielded.
---
Raiders, buy resistant and treated at raider vendors and repeatedly do Savage divide events for a chance for both protective and shielded ( this will take you a long time if you haven't been doing any of them, or just luck )
---
Enclave (easiest one) buy at Enclave vendors for high caps, or just do enclave related events to get them.
---
Casual is bugged and currently its just pure luck that some ppl have them ( they dont even know how they got them )
---
There are workshops that make stuff like fusion cores but those ones are sure to get you in a fight with other players.
---
What is your camp setup like?
---
Yea I thought I had a good system worked out until the rug was swept from under me
---
I am glad to hear it's not just me!
---
Could be combat armor helmet. 
---
Its fun to mow down a hored, i used to be a critical sniper build but once i got my hands on my first legendary 50 cal it was over for that guy. 
---
172 roughly!
---
The vault shielded is unlocked progressively when you complete the overseer's cache questline.
---
I don't build until the defense is over.
---
1.} Other players may join the defense {rare} but at least for me it's happening far too often, lol. In which if you build stuff that can just take it from you after the defense.
---
2.} Defending without building or turrets means you don't have to repair anything, which is nice.
---
But I do agree that taking it over is much easier than 4 waves of w/e.
---
After a Nuke drop it's the quickest way to level up in teams  The other night I went from 13 to 23.
---
Won't a bunch of high level ferals and other stuff attack my base a lot though?
---
I played around with it for a few hours... And died about a hundred times. Oops.
---
I'll probably get pick up the serum again once I find a pair of Weightless Acrobat's Heavy Combat legs.
---
Player vending is why I hope we see changes in crafting. 
---
From what I felt Bethesda said about what they expect from this game, the NPCs are the other other players, rather than just scripted programs like you normally find. 
---
And part of that is trading and such. So crafting has to become more exciting I think for that to happen.
---
Any other group recommendations that are mostly (or all) female? I need somewhere that‚Äôs active for trading, selling, also I‚Äôd like to be able to help new players
---
Oh maybe, I haven't got the Helmet Recipe
---
I respectfully disagree - to a point. In my opinion, the \*only\* thing that needs to be done is not allow Two Shot and Explosive to paired together.
---
I7-920 w/970gtx at medium and it's smooth for me.
---
This is against bethesda TOS hope you know that
---
Huh. Thats weird. BOS is under the material mod section (1st option), not the misc mod (2nd option). You are correct about checking all pieces tho, scrapping is random as to what piece it goes to, the descriptions are *really useful* in that regard. /s
---
I usually keep about 80-90% of my camp open and accessible. I usually keep a single 'bedroom' locked up with a level 3 lock.
---
My most recent one, however is mostly locked. But the purifier, weapon bench, and stash toolbox is all in the open courtyard for people to use.
---
The military fatigues is considered casual lining, currently i do not have those linings yet.
---
Ea I know but the good thing about my build is I I don't need power armor even in Nuke zones.
---
The only thing I really would need from a Workshop is steel and Lead but I can farm that 10 times faster than the big machines can produce them.
---

---
Yes I queue allot!
---
Farm farm farm. Ive had probably 15-20 different explosive guns in my thousands of looted weapons. Most have been terrible. Several cryolators, laser rifles and tesla rifles. These i just gave away.
---
The ones im using are the only good ones ive had drop in 500 hours of play.
---
I have mine down the cliff from top of the world. I get more rats sometimes but that's all. It's also near the map center which helps reduce travel costs if I need to get from South to North quickly.
---
That‚Äôs a good point. The amount of ground clutter in this game is excessive. Even I get constantly hung up and stopped by random crap on the ground or even a goddamn curb. What curbs exist IRL that you have to jump up into the air to get past?!
---
This rant is relevant cause of how it affects the AI pathfinding, which as you point out is so bad they get stuck in random places. 
---
Quick fix is to add a timer and if enemies fail to destroy your shit in that amount of time, you automatically win and whatever was left runs away and despawns.
---
I think not, since the resulting product is "junk" rather than "chems" (aid).
---
I'll create it later, make another post here just as a trial run
---
Starched Genes perk. I have it on 100% of the time.
---
So an overencumbered person is taking over workshops? 
---
Often times I accidentally start picking something up, and cancel by holding E untill I mouse away. 
---
Yeah, that causes problems in PA. 
---
Just picking the flower will give you the raw flux, but you need hardened mass, glowing mass and high-radiation fluids that only drop from enemies in a nuke zone for the other ingredients to make stable flux.
---
Raw flux decays fast- spoils like rotten food. Fast travel kills your raw flux- it figures in the time it would have taken to walk that distance. Find a chemistry station before that. 
---
Good With Salt perk makes it last longer, Green Thumb perk gives you twice the flux when you pick the plant. Hardened Mass is a junk item- it will auto-scrap if you scrap all junk before you craft the flux- don't do that. 
---
The explosive perk isn't the issue. The explosive legendary affix is. It's doing way more dmg than it is should.
---
I got for bloodied super sledge
---
Even those, if I have 5...ill lock 3
---
If you want to lock up, at least built another stash and 1 workbench outside
---
Pip boy
---
I created a second character that has a non-vats pistol and explosives  build. It's... not great.
---
I guess if I ever get my hands on an explosive pistol I might be better off, but I don't cheat and I use whatever drops for me.
---
Ok sounds good I'll have a look at it thanks
---
At first, I had a fairly decent spot on the eastern side of the map, in the water near Dyer Chemical. However, the enemies are... not so fun over there. It wasn't exactly pleasant to have to deal with anglers every time I logged into the game. 
---
So nowadays, I just look for places along the river near Flatwoods, the Overseer's Camp and north of that. The enemies are really tame, and you have access to water. I'm usually just offloading junk and crafting at my camp, so it is usually more important to me that things are nice and quiet, vs. being close to good resources. 
---
Yep happend to me. Perfect timing [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2iWmsAiOGU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2iWmsAiOGU)
---
For some reason leveling from 20 to 30 was the worst time I had in the game
---
I mean, the only problems I've ever had is one time a scorhbeast came out of now where and I had to draw it away. But otherwise, it's a prime location. And if you're worried about ferals, the Whitesprings bots usually take them out before they can leave the resort grounds. 
---
Sounds useful thanks
---
Issa meme, sorry for offending you.
---
That's, something I never heard before. I'll try that. Thank you.
---
I'll get you added, thank you! 
---
I like that last point.
---
I feel like it's a Easter egg to Jurassic park
---
Just a meme I'm a big fan of FO76.
---
As said grind in Morgantown for a bit. Charleston Capitol building is also a good xp spot. Once you're up to 25, take down mole men in Welsh a few times and go get your excavator armor.
---
Two shot Explosive laser gatling gun is horrific. It actually lowers dps.
---
I think most people are looking for somewhere to scrap shit and store it.
---
nope. no idea what it is.
---
I just want to take over ANY of the workshops and not have some level 100+ player come along and 1 shot me.
---
how come no one talks about fallouts 5-75
---
West Virginia suffered a nuclear apocalypse, rise and fall of Raider gangs, the scorched plague and scorchbeasts  and Vault 76 residents nuking the place multiple times a day.  Hasn‚Äôt Appalachia suffered enough already without throwing in Bluegrass on top of all that?
---
Hmm ü§î
---
Cheers mate, ill add you. I believe we're on the same time zone too so that makes things easier too. 
---
So best to move my camp near whitespring eh
---
Furious for automatic. Anti armor for semi auto
---
Any particular spot? Hopefully the RNG gods change their favor for me.
---
Realistically this is 100% true lol.
---
Its criminal how strong explosives are.
---
Niggas out here taking really taking this post too series 
---
Or take then inside to the artisan store
---
What about Marine?
---
This happens to me every time, unless ive been playing 76 in my dreams
---
For future reference, you can heal rads by killing yourself a few times.
---
Same. Only 1 purifier, I need that water for myself. 
---
Niggas just don't give a fuck no more
---
Somebody forgot their Rad-X.
---
There is a video guide to getting the best version of combat armor on youtube. I don't remember the name but I'm sure you can find it. It basically involves two things, Grafton station and the Monster Mash event in Watoga. Good luck .
---
Don't bother with those emoticons and ask to voice chat. So much easier.
---
And all that time, only thing those soon to be Raiders thought of was the many different ways they could torture them if given the chance. And then...the vault opened. 
---
I‚Äôve actually been hoping to find someone with a bunch lol its pretty bs they‚Äôre temporary buffs, and I guess we‚Äôre expected to magically find multiple of the exact same one if you want to keep benefiting from it. 
---
Ik if they intended them to be permanent they‚Äôd be way less, it‚Äôs just hard to ignore how good the damage buffs are, and how they last 1-2 hours depending on 1 perk point
---
I still play because I understand that‚Äôs just a game...yeah it was a big let down but it‚Äôs just a game 
---
I came across a few location and the enemies seemed to die from a heart attack. I know my character is ugly, but i never thought to be THAT ugly.  
---
Maybe it's some bug in the game.
---
Can you expound on what isn't normal? Normal is subjective, so understanding your perspective could help. 
---
You just made me realize, I don't think I've ever seen a living Brahmin in game. Where are you finding them?
---
I rely on cooked radstag all the time.
---
Dont think you can kite a Scorched or Super Mutant that far and only Bots and Ghouls spawn in the tower.
---
Only a few people have protective/shielded because for whatever reason the plan doesn't drop when it should
---
Do you mean Fallout 152??
---
Are you playing on PC?    
---
I could give you some ammo and meds to help you out:)
---
You're a gentleman/gentlewoman and a scholar, Ty for the reference point. Been searching for it without success. 
---
Just wonderful. Thanks for sharing your beautiful creation.
---
Most of the gouls are north, inside the resort area. If you're down by where the snake symbol is on the map you should be fine. The only problem I have is the mirelurks that spawn in the lake behind my house. But two heavy turrets keeps them at bay for me.

Yes, no cross system play at the moment
---
Ok thanks I'll take a look
---
People suggest equipping the card "Green Thumb" that nets you extra plants when you pick them, and "Super Duper" that gives you a chance for extra crafted results. In a nuked zone, go around and pick the nuked plants.. you need at least 10-15 to make 1 stable/pure flux, and they SPOIL. You also need High-radiation fluids, hardened mass, and Glowing mass from killing enemies in the zone. Go to a chem station with all ingredients, and craft the stable/pure flux. **MAKE SURE THAT YOU DON'T SCRAP ALL JUNK, because the hardened mass will disappear.** 
---
I'd imagine they became overencumbered after the fact.
---
The Shielded marine, can resistant and treated can be bought at the watoga vendor, the protective and shielded has to be grinded through event lines in the cranberry bog, census violence and distant thunder. (this is probably going to be your hardest one to get along with the raiders.)
---
You have to remember that a whole lot of players are used to fallout being single player. Interaction feels weird. And the potential to run into cod weenies/griefers makes us skittish.
---
if your on XBOX let me know....I remember lvl 18-25 was a bit of a struggle.  I can build you some modded out lvl weapons and armor.  I can also give you a good supply of Stimpacks and Radsx-away.  Send me a message if your on Xbox.  
---
I don't think a restart is necessary.  I've lvl 200, but by the time I hit 120 I could respect my perk cards for ANY build.  
---
"Dead as a dodo" my new favorite expression. :D
---
Sometimes it requires a third and fourth party. Should‚Äôve seen what happened over at the Overboss‚Äôs camp the other night...a baptism by fire. And a whole lot of buffout. 
---
Wow.
---
Agree with all of this. Don't be afraid to run if you run into something nasty - Level 50s feral ghouls and scorched aren't too tough to handle, but super mutants, anglers and especially Mr. Gustys and Scorchbeasts, you don't want to tangle with them. 
---
Once you get to level 25, you can get the excavator power armor, which is a good first suit and has a +100 carry weight boost, if you craft all the pieces. You can buy maps to find the Black Titanium you need to craft the suit at vending machines in Welch. 
---
As far as weapons go, craft hunting rifles at 20 and 30, and lever action rifle at 25. The power armor also gives a nice boost to Strength, and there are plenty of good melee weapons in the game. If you're looking for decent legendary melees, check out Riverside Manor and the questline there for the Blade of Bastet, or use the ski blade you should have gotten for the main story quests related to Rose, IIRC. 
---
You, my friend, are the problem
---
We have a secret base location that works wonders
---
You may have just given me +1 INT. Much appreciated.
---
starched genes perk luck
---
Hehe an oldie but a goodie
---
Not a single key, that I know of, but it's just two keys (on ps4, options button, then triangle), and in my experience, you don't have to wait for the map to load before hitting triangle.
---
I only keep my upstairs area and a single water purifier locked for my personal/team use. Everything else is fair game for anyone who comes onto my property.
---
Woodcutting  levels?
---
Yes if you play PS4 you are only playing with those on that platform. Computer is the same way.
---
We call em Lag dogs.
---
Do you even spell bro?
---
Starched Genes, under Luck! Level 1 has a chance it won‚Äôt go away. You need level 2 to be sure it won‚Äôt be cured with radaway. :)
---
I appreciate you going through all of this, man. That's a problem with this game, there's so much we don't know because there aren't any shown loot tables. That would make the game a lot easier to grind I think
---
Starched Genes (lvl2) under luck. You need to be level 32 i believe
---
robco building on the farm east of the map usually has a legendary. plus its always got a ton of enemies. generals steak house is nearby that does too sometimes. watoga emergency services or even just the robots in watoga itself.
---
Basically just keep playing and praying.
---
The only time I'm in the "Could someone else use this instead" mode is when there's actually another player nearby.  I believe it only applies to physical items.  If I take Cram from a shelf, that Cram disappears for them too.  Of course, it all comes back eventually, but if I don't need it, I don't need it.
---
You end up having to be selective because your Stash is only so big.  Like others have said, screws are always a problem.  So, for me, screws, aluminum, plastic, and ballistic fiber are always things I take.  Others are more situational.  Even if you don't use it, you can typically sell it at a vendor for a Cap or two.
---
The bug he is referring to is how rare those plans are for the protective and shielded and the question on where to get them.  Currently it was suppose to drop a previous questline as a  reward but during patching it was taken out and never re introduced into the game.  So thats why some ppl have it and others dont, or no one has reported where they did find it.... im level 240 and completed all questlines, so if it did fall on them I have lost them completely and can only obtain them either a event or trading...
---
No just buy a PC and purchase the game on there and listen to them by file.
---
Sure man. Ill be on around 11pm this evening, im guessing you got a mic as well? And nice. 
---
You can make a stash at the worskshop. You do not need to leave the workshop. So where would an overencumbered person be walking to if a stash is already where they are at?
---
Got my first after lvl 90, a Two Shot Western Revolver. Just after 100 I found a TS Gauss. No Explosive yet, though.
---
This is a little undescriptive. 
---
Theres a place called billings homestead on the west side of the map near a graveyard. This was my favorite spot for levels 20-40. Slightly north of billings homestead (a claimable workshop) is a huge crop of razor grain and corn. There is also a river to the west to help make razorgrain soup. You can claim the two workshops in the area and farm the spawns at the graveyard each log in.
---
yes and you know you wasted your money
---
This is why I have guest quarters for travellers. A bed, stash, weapons bench and an open purifier. 
---
People are less likely to trash my (locked)shit.

The fallout games were like this from the beginning, i think its normal tbh.  Fallout 3 and fallout 4 is exactly like this.

It was really nice, but i moved it to change what food i ate. Now it doesnt look as nice and i hate it. The nice one i probably spent 10 hours on over the course of a week. Gonna rebuild soon. Waiting for new atom shop announcements first.
---
It doesn‚Äôt. It prices about the same time when I had 4 luck as it does with my now 11 luck. It‚Äôs solely based on a percentage chance to proc per item crafted. 
---
thanks for the direction
---
Pretty sure nature wasted a lot of carbon and water on you.
---
If it was possible to plunder more than that, it would completely ruin this game in its current state. Every 100+ level player would be using their TSE on every lower level player and steal the already sparse non-dupe legendary weapons or hard fought for resources. Then we degrade to nothing more than Ark, where literally months of grinding and hours upon hours of work can be completely gone in seconds and you are back on the beach in your underwear with nothing again. While I do agree that gains are sparse when it comes to raiding, perhaps attacking a camp should start a mini-event/quest with leveled rewards rather than being able to pillage the defeated players stash. It seems to me that Bethesda studied the player culture of Ark somewhat and based a lot of PvP/grief limitations on that game‚Äôs shortcomings and the horrible griefing it creates. 
---
Legendary protectrons are a dangerous game. One of three things happen. 
---
One, you nervously dart in and out trying to see if it'll blow up. Then you hesitate. Then you're about to run in and it explodes. 
---
Or you dart in, sure it won't blow up after this long. Then it explodes. 
---
Or you opt to go for it. You might be able to swipe the legendary and make a break for it... Or sometimes it explodes the instant you stand over it. Dead. 
---
Gene's Starched Jeans
---
I‚Äôll reveal my spot. I live just west of Twin Lakes in the savage divide. There is a steel node on my property, and the Behemoth spawns in the lake only a 10 second walk further west (he drops useful loot and ~20 caps every time). Only issue is that there isn‚Äôt much flat ground. So you have to be pretty good at base building to make it look good and not clip through dirt and trees, etc. 
---
I am only unable to place my camp on about 5% of servers. 
---
I hope your sentiment is pushed into the next patches, I would love a game where everything I can build up can be destroyed by someone else.  It would make me so angry and I would be super pissed at all the progress I lost, but it would also be immersive and fun.  I wish they would also allow you to drop all items when you die, instead of just junk.  At, like in your comment, make there be "lawless" zones, where anything goes.  It would make this game feel like the apocalypse, rather than Explore the Great Outdoors (with monsters) 76.  I want the lawless wastes, not the controlled playground.
---
Sounds difficult might have a look though
---
Is that where there's mutated flora, but no blast zone? I spawned into that yesterday, wasn't sure if I'd missed the blast zone or what. Plenty of flora unround, and glowing ones.
---
Yes, it was written in the OP.
---
The worst part is when legendary watoga bot falls like that and goes boom lol.
---
Would have fit in excellently. I noticed there were a lot more churches in WV than any of the other games, and gospel bluegrass would have fit in excellently

I'm on ps4, and there's always more than 5 other people on the server. In fact, there have been times me or one of my friends got the world is full, waiting in a queue message.

So no, I don't think people are leaving or not playing.

That's whitesprings which doens't involve the queen.

What about Fallout 40k?

Well hot damn I never knew about inspect.  Then again I haven't really farmed for legendaries yet and have only found the 1 stars.

it would be the exact same as the current npcs in the game 
---
Ooh I like it... Might have to make a guest house like that with a guitar chair too haha
---
That was built over a long time, I bought fallout 3 and 4 when it was first released it was like a community of ppl who came together to put all that information on wikia etc etc....
---
So dont be to upset about how fallout 76, just know its the same its going to be about 6 month to a year of ppl collecting updating those pages.
---
The original way i did it was blackwater mines.
---
The way i did it last was to build my own camp in the toxic waste near water. I chose the spot the alien blaster spawns to also farm that at the same time. I built my own rad scrubber.
---
After you get your first mutation on a server, the next one takes significantly longer to get. So server hopping is mandatory. Get a mutation, hop, do it again.
---
If you do it in your own camp in a secluded spot and have your own scrubber its much much simpler, with far less running around/zoning.
---
Sounds good I'll check it out thanks
---
If you are not enjoying the game because someone else is using a glass cannon melee build then thats your problem. I've fought the queen at least 50 times and never seen a person do this. I have seen someone 2-3 shot the queen with a gun though. They were probably ecploting xobbleheads but, the point is not everyone runs a glass cannon unyielding, low hp, high rad, melee build.
---
seeds, that's what I meant. 
---
I don‚Äôt have Rad sponge ranked past 1 and share it with 4 charisma. It still gets rid of all my rads pretty quick
---
Might what to edit in what platform. 
---
&gt; or that where on such low health i murdered them 
---
I like this!
---
Oh so what dose it get boosted by if not heavy gunner? Command?
---
Low HP buff + Explosive Two shot / Explosive bloodied builds have already been a thing for ages buddy.

I'll admit I had my base locked for a while for the simple fact of kiting players to lockpick the door to be wanted. One guy learned the hard way that once you do that, you definitely shouldnt start destroying the base in a panic once missle turrets start firing on you. He lost a lot of caps that day. Anyways, I keep my base unlocked now because there is honestly no point in locking it. I'll check the map every now and again to see if players are near and approaching it and I make sure to keep tabs on them incase they become wanted (my water purifier is locked). I did notice that one low level guy managed to spawn a deathclaw, I'm sure most of you know where my base is now, and they ran to my base for shelter. Seeing their movement on the map, that was the only logical outcome because well I could hear the missiles firing from the city. It was nice to know that my base saved some poor vault dwellers ass

Dont forget vats takes like, a second to go from 0 to 95 percent for us shotgun mains trying to kill something at extreme close range. God thats annoying. Then youre outta AP, and get smacked a needless amount of times.

Or Bethesda could fix the rate they get attacked. Seriously I was attacked twice in two minutes once

you just saved me so much hassle. Appreciate this a ton. I was really wanting to add more agility perks.
---
The effect does not stack. It does work on her as much as one could tell. Honestly just get some heavy gunners and kill her in a few seconds well like 30-45 seconds. 
---
Thanks for the clarification. I don't really solo I usually have at least 1 or 2 people. However, if I do get into solo nuke farming at WSP I try my best to rally the masses via voice chat. Forcing re-spawning the main building if there's individuals who will listen and people aren't ONE taping the legendaries. Hows the farming at Lewisburg and Dyer Chemical?
---
I just always end up moving my CAMP as I go. I haven't been able to fast travel for 100 hours (due to weight), so it's no biggie for me. I set turrets up on top, and I use my CAMP as a mobile crafting/defense system. I will sometimes place it down near a tough place, and if I get overwhelmed by enemies, I will lure them towards my turrets. It also saves me bullets!
---
Well now the grenade launcher and the auto grenade launcher arent associated with the heavy weapon perk I am also interested in what categories they come under if anyone knows the answer.

15 luck 17 with gear super duper maxed and I hit double about 2/3 of the time when making armor aka when I make three pieces of armor two are doubled.  When I make ammo I get about 50% more ammo then I would of gotten keep in mind this is just my rough estimate 
---
the actual pipboy pipboy screen. clock on the bottom. 
---
We meet again my friend 
---
Yeah, so might as well use an even better unarmed weapon.
---
Yeah i agree but we do also have rare/well wanted pland as well. Already see people making shops for pa with stupid high int because of they're build. Id too just see an expand on that
---
You had to have played it during 2018, they haven't sent any codes out yet I dont think....
---
Oh and yes that is the plant you have to defend there is 5 of them during the event. 
---
I have a guest quarters, as well! Not sure if I‚Äôve gotten any visitors yet though haha.
---
Oh that's easy explosive that's why I have demolition expert on my heavy build its not just for the fat man though
---
Depends on what you want you're base for. Look good? Central location? Resource point?. Are you roleplaying a character so you need a BOS site? A hunter who lives high in the mountains? (that's me) or guy who just finds his peace and serenity in the wasteland next to a nice little pond. Your perfect may not be someone else. So what do you  like?
---
It really depends on your level and any farming routes you might have. Or if you want to make a base that's way away from where most people would go or look. I know of a place in the mountains that's southwest of watoga that has a beautiful view of the bog as well as a lake to put water purifiers. No monsters spawn near it and it is very peaceful but it is also very out of the way so fast traveling to places will be quite expensive. 
---
5am on sunday morning was the only time there have been less than 5 people on a server i was on.  
---
They really do, I ran just Marsupial for about two weeks and I realized sure, it's good, but it's gotta be fifty times better in conjunction with speed demon! So I've seen healing factor and plague walker but never used them, what do they do? Do the positive effects outweigh the negative?
---
Youd need a lot more than what‚Äôs in that table (crafted out of a few simple parts) to build anything other than a pipe gun anyway. I had a mod for 7 Days To Die that made you make clay casts of gun parts to forge the new pieces one by one and had much more complicated recipes for guns and bullets...and you could scrap bullets for the lead, brass and gun powder...among many many other things that added more realistic recipes. It was just a small part of a massive mod called Live Free or Die. 
---
Some people, probably like yourself, loved it. Others found it tedious. It‚Äôs a win/lose...not everyone is going to be happy. Most people didn‚Äôt fucking care what was in the recipe, which was the bulk of the people playing the mod. I quit working on it when the content was repeatedly stolen by copycat modders and pretty much left the modding scene entirely. 
---
Again though, there‚Äôs nothing about this game that remotely suggests realism or logic is being applied so none of it really matters. 
---
Im tired of people talking about total wipe. I have over 400 legitimate hours playing and id be pissed if that was wiped cause someone keeps crying that they got one shot by TSE. Everyone plating this game needs to grow up and quit crying because they lost on a PVP match because they thought their build was the best.

I dunno. I took a power station and the vertibot did all the defending for me. I showed up and stood around whilst it hunted all the scorched down.

I'm Techrandy on pC  
---
I usually play M-F 7pm-10pm CST  
---
and off and on during the week.
---
Thanks a lot!
---
Flatwoods, but they may have been killed already when you find them since they're in the opening quest/tutorial. 
---
Thanks for the video. Watching the guys health go so low gave me anxiety. I think I am gonna pass on that one. 
---
XD
---
Aye, it's not a do or die bug (normally) since I can still kill enemies eventually, but it's annoying seeing half my damage heal every shot. 
---
Also I could swear it near always occurs when I'm nearby other players, as whilst it still happens when I'm alone, it doesn't happen as much or just hangs around from after fighting near people.
---
This might just be a huge coincidence though, but regardless it still makes me feel useless when fighting the Queen -_-
---
Yeah, if you want FCs and you have spare materials just build a Fusion Reactor in the workshop.
---
Thanks for the post and info. Really enjoyed it. Now I'm debating herbivore or carnivore...
---
I played it on release day and had it pre-loaded a day before, so I don't think that's the issue. It's sounding like just another blunder on the Fallout 76 pile for Bethesda.
---
I'm only missing helmet, but thanks. I shoulda checked dupers
---
It's all very inconsistent for me.  Things like Assaultrons and Assault Bots, I'll run away when I kill them and wait for them to explode.  Sometimes I hear the sound, other times I don't.  Sometimes it explodes, other times I'm in the middle of looting it and it will spontaneously blow up like it was a proximity trap.
---
Heck, I've seen the same robot explode *twice.*
---
If you can tame a snallygaster, you should be able to tame the other cryptids.
---
Yeah that's a thing in the game.
---
i just want the mobs to not spawn inside the munitions building
---
I can confirm recipes for mentats and bufftats, I can't remember where I got it though
---
A peaceful area that I might also be able to put a resource generator -Like a junk extractor or Lead- but that's not essential as long as it's peaceful and I can have a nice looking base I'll be satisfied 
---
I found a single shot explosive shotgun couple weeks back and it‚Äôs nasty OP, can‚Äôt imagine a 2 shot.
---
Gonna try this one.
---
So, exactly like real life. 
---
Psycho? 
---
Posted the invites on the main thread.
---
So this means if multiple people shoot her with this dart it will only count as one. Thanks for your answer! 
---
I've completed it twice but i didn't see him... Where dies he spawn?
---
Get a 1star Search legendary. It makes you smart enough to use the Search functionality in this sub to get the answers to these questions you're re-asking in your post.
---
We're all it it together, vault dweller.
---
&gt; would of 
---
*would've
---
I have a 5 luck, and super duper at 3, and I get it waaaaaay more often than say Butchers Bounty 1\* that has a 40% to give you more meat when you inspect an animal corpse. I mean seriously, that perk seldom seems to work up to 40%
---
It's the legendary perk that increases damage the lower your resistance, probably with increase power attack damage. That's why you see guys running around whitespring naked, 1 hitting everything
---
Ahh, a visionary. 
---
Of course repairing the camp must not be too arduous, as we all put in some elbow grease to create em. 
---
I have stumbled upon the idea of a combat zone (yes, that‚Äôs on purpose lol) on this sub and I really love the idea. It would take actions like mine away from the ‚Äúpve areas‚Äù and allow for a place to purge my pvp needs. 
---
I would love more risk. I get off on that shit. 
---
You mean Rose's syringe? 
---
Karma syringer from flavors of mayhen
---
I'm level 56, and sounds good, I have the travel perk that makes it cheaper so I'll definitely check it out thank you
---
Let me guess, you have a "charging tesla shotgun"? Its a rifle with a different barrel it's not really a shotgun 
---
I think armour penetration in PvP should be nerfed. You might as well be fighting naked at this point
---
I have the same issue with the BOS mod. Learned it after scrapping a bunch of legs and cant find The mod anywhere to apply it.  
---
Whats weird is that there is light/medium/heavy versions of combat (and maybe leather?) but from what I can tell, you can only see which version it is when you wear it. the description does not say. 
---
Or maybe the version is based on level of item? 
---
idk man, this game does a really bad job at explaining things in general. A lot of stuff has been changed slightly from Fo4 to work with this game and they failed to put descriptions for a lot of it. especially mods. 
---
bethes-fail
---
I was more wondering weight wise but I guess it is in limbo with the rest of the rifles.
---
Oh look another person trying to stir shit up
---
Or you can fast travel to the free spot and then where you wanted to go.  Like I do.
---
So many people whining about the game wanting everything handed to them.
---
üòÇ 
---
Another question - with serums, do the negative effects stay away with SG(2), or do you have to inject a new serum after a while?
---
Yeah I mean if they add a perk to decrease the wieght of rifle I would say it should be in rifles.
---
But that's my opinion I don't really use the grenade launcher anyway
---
21 Patrol duty events over two characters and I still haven't gotten the handmade gun plans.
---
Hopefully try number 22 will be the one... and that I'll be on the correct character when I get it :P
---
That's what gets me. You've spent years living and working with these people snd your first instinct upon opening the door is to want to murder them? I mean, to each their own, but man does that feel like a fucked up premise.
---
Not really, I wasn't even going to pre-order until I saw that offer, I've been wanting to play the classics for a while now so not getting them after that is just a bit annoying to me.
---
Well I'm ignoring this quest forever 
---
As mentioned before, Grafton vendors.. 1 at the train station, and  1 robot named Greg in town.. They randomly carry the BOS combat armor plans (very strong) and varying combat armor mods (including deep pocketed for cheap). It may take many many server hops to get, and you will get extremely tired of the Grafton mayors voice, since the 2 events fire off EVERY TIME you get into Grafton. 
---
i have the ability to makes my weapons one hit wonders i have 8 mutations i can some of my weapons over 600 damage and they arnt tse 
---
heres some of my mutations twisted muscles marsupial adrenal reaction and speeed demon 
---
i also have 15 strength i have the 1 perk that increase hit speed and decreases weapon weights lvl 2 and i have a 2 handed perk at lvl 3 that increases damage with 2 handed weapons i also have rifleman 3 twice i also have bloody mess 2 strayed genes 2 and the other perk that decreases muatations negatives and i have the adrenal perk that increases weapon damage with every kill which can give me like 50 percent increase in weapon damage plus my t51b power armour that has motion assisted 
---
I have one for "fury" but Idk how/where
---
I am with you a 100 percent but some of this players act in a way that I don‚Äôt even think they are normal in real life lol I had a dude try to invite me to his base just using emots and I felt like bill Cosby was going to be waiting inside üòù 
---
oh man,  the fasnacht mask scared the scrap out of me last night when i found it there. Just peeping out from behind a mattress. creepy ass thing
---
YES, That! I couldn‚Äôt remember the name of it for so long.
---
My personal experience is maybe different from popular opinion but ever since I concentrate on:
---
1. events which spawn guaranteed legendaries (Uranium Fever, AWOL Armaments, horde events, Heart of the Swamp, One Violent Nights etc.);
---
2. farming certain locations which spawn legendaries more or less regularly with server hopping (mainly Whitesprings, Watoga, sometimes Harper's Ferry)
---
This yielded me around 10 legendaries which were 3\* (not including armor) and a lot more of 2\* and less. Ofc not all 3\* legendaries are good and out of these weapons, three of them was an explosive (shotgun, cryolator) and one of them also two shot (LMG). I never duped, nor have I bought/traded for any gear at all - one time I sold 3\* baseball bat for 1000 caps and that's it. I am level 120 but began doing this only since lvl 90 or so (total time farmed maybe 7 afternoons).
---
Examples of good loot I found:

I understand that maybe I was a bit more lucky than others but if you do those two things regularly, you will get good gear, it's just a matter of time and patience. Of course it's better to do this only once you reach level 50, because once you are 50 and above, lvl 25 two shot explosive won't bring you as much joy as lvl 50.
---
TL:DR: Do legendary spawn locations with server hopping, and look for good events / Nukesprings in the meantime and you will be happy sooner or later.
---
Mentats are my least used drug. There's not a huge benefit to a perception and intelegence boost ya know... But thanks for at least confirming they're in the game.
---
Logs for short.
---
Right the bottom of the lighthouse if you went straight out the front door. Would be hard to miss but I have seen it glitch out before.
---
Let's hope the wise and powerful mothman leads Bethesda to fix these bugs, amen.
---
Damn you deserve to be a overboss from a certain park &gt;.&gt;
---
If you're on ps4 and if I meet a certain raider with a deathclaw I would be happy to challenge you.
---
I'll aslo be happy to give a reward like [every junks I have in my cash] if you successfully kill me.
---
(I love to explore and take my time to craft things so it don't matter if I lose my junk because the one who killed me deserve to take my junk)
---
I hope the pvp side isn't too bad for you.
---
Wish this game had pvp servers
---
...
---
Are you kidding me?
---
I‚Äôve been running a PA Melee from Beta day one, these were like the first cards I took. Have I really been wasting those points this entire time?
---
There's an intel report on a computer in the chinese bunker that gives some cool in-game hints about how to decipher the nuke codes.
---
And one for Guns, one for armour etc, the main chest should be for Junk and junk only.
---
it's worth it if you want to play a new take on the game
---
my first character is a male bloodied shotgun build with their base in the cranberry bog
---
my second character is a female stealth melee/ninja with their base in the ash heap
---
their point distribution is quite different and would require dramatic alterations to be able to play one or the other so it was quicker and more enjoyable to create a new character
---
TL;DR yes it's worth it
---
They do have Tesla Bracers
---
Technically you would need lvl 31 to get rank 2, as you need to take the first one as well.
---
You on pc?
---
Here's the link to a resource map.
---
https://www.google.com.au/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9yza6w/i_made_a_map_of_resource_deposits/#ampf=undefined
---
I suggest a central area to make easier/cheaper to travel around the map. So walk all around near the top of the world, and mountains there if you like somewhere. And south east to top of the world there is many waterways, with small waterfalls and lakes. Take a walk. Find someone you love.
---
That would be an awesome one to get. If anyone can nail down where to get this, that would be great. 
---
I‚Äôm level 40 but still get terrorised by level 68 ghouls.
---
That‚Äôs my point though I don‚Äôt fancy playing with other players I‚Äôm just not that type of gamer.
---
Oh boy incoming negatives
---
Its already in game, open your map, hit L1 or left bumper for map idk for pc, scroll to and click on challenges. I think its the third option down after the daily/weekly challenges.

Come to think of it, I have noticed more people running around Whitesprings in their underwear lately.  I thought it was by accident.  So...that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening now.  First experience farming, duping, TSE weapons, and now this!  People find all sorts of ways to ruin the fun for everyone else.
---
No me either but the auto grenade launcher would have been fun.
---
Don't forget that any schmuck off fresh out of the Vault knows how to repair a nuclear reactor.
---
That is dedication. A 40 hour work week is 2080 hours in a year. You just did 25% of a full time job. 
---
Really? How is this possible?
---
I found a combat rifle plan so I just made my first one as soon as I got 20. I have been riding this level 5  2 shot pump shotgun I got pretty early too. I'm really having trouble with armor. I keep finding chests and right leg pieces, it's annoying. Damn rng 
---
Would butchers bounty work on the ghouls or other enemies in nuke zones in helping to collect glowing mass, hardened mass and high radiation fluids
---
The only problem is melee can do the same, at least dps wise. Which on explosive melee weapons doesn‚Äôt matter for anything in the game really except scorchbeasts because they‚Äôll one shot anything anyway. So if they nerf them a bit it won‚Äôt change anything really, melee will be best for boss damage, but still broken for anything else in the game. 
---
The only way to stop them from killing everything instantly would be to nerf their base damage into the ground, because even without demolition expert and adrenal reaction you can still easily one to two shot pretty much all enemies. 
---
Yeah 1 shotting everything without even needing a build or points into anything is very fair and balanced.
---
Thank you so much. "Find someone you love" no homo
---
I have only been disconnected once with one character in it's 60's and another that's 25 or so. I'm not even sure if it was the server, might have been my own internet connection.
---
If Bethesda says something is griefing then it is regarded as griefing no matter what we think or say
---
I'd like to ability to use resources to recharge a core.  That would reduce managing multiple cores, and save having to run around farming YET ANOTHER item when the recharge-on-load bug is patched.
---
I don‚Äôt lock anything. Not worth it. I tend to not have a problem w/ general materials so I don‚Äôt bother w/ extractors, etc. as I prefer to collect while I shoot things instead of farming. I even use the Vault Boy cut out to point the way for travelers to come &amp; stay ;-)
---
Yeah I have had it a couple of times but never the ammo lol

Maybe, but when they complete it they may actually be 100%

Bits of them, sure.
---
The latter
---
Only the worthwhile stuff, ammo, caps, some weapons and armour (for mods), sometimes food and water.
---
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not a big fan of those OP melee builds. I only use melee when it‚Äôs a waste of ammo. Personally I use a rifle for normal stuff and .50 cal for the queen 
---
That really isn't a bad idea. It needs to wait though until some kind of balancing is in place for PVP, otherwise the people that can one-shot players in pacifist mode just win and the players who use the perk and gear combos to be virtually damage immune take no risk.
---
Honestly this game needs to be divided in to PVP and Non-PVP servers so people who want a pure PVE experience can play in peace.
---
I‚Äôm not the best to ask about the serums so hopefully someone else who knows more about them will answer! I haven‚Äôt used serums yet. I do think you need a second card to mitigate the negative effects of mutations in general. That card is called Class Freak!
---
I regularly see a lot of people. When you are looking around keep in mind if people are in certain areas or Crouched down you won't be able to see them on the map.
---
That's fair. I apologize for being sassy.

Love it! 
---
Ahaha yeah I edited that straight after.
---
But hey, that too. Maybe you'll kill 2 birds with 1 stone.
---
Rest in Peace Carlos. reminds me of the time my friend killed my pet Legendary Glowing Molerat. His name was Rattington
---
I always feel ike the raider types are attracted to a game like this vs. a game like Ark because there's literally no risk for them if they're being a complete chode. They get to annoy people and nothing bad happens to them. It's easy.
---
If they REALLY wanted to play a raider, they'd play a game like Ark. Of course there you have risk and consequences. Not so easy.
---
The real problem will come when actual real competitive PvP comes into play. Then that's when this whole thing will explode and they will need to address it.
---
Loved it, thanks for the share.
---
I have four luck with only one star on that perk and it seems to work more then 10% of the time 
---
I believe it was southern Savage Divide. Around the Mountainside Bed and Breakfast area 
---
Seems like it could take a long time to fully respec, depending on builds.
---
Haven't tried it yet though.
---
Jeez just let them think they know it man don‚Äôt correct them...
---
I‚Äôm level 40 and have killed plenty in the game, my point is, today for example I logged in went to white springs to try and finally finish that quest, I‚Äôd looted quite a lot as I needed to fix my armour.
---
Suddenly I‚Äôm swarmed by level 68 ghouls who kill me instantly. I then can‚Äôt get my dropped loot as they just swarm when I respawn and kill me again.
---
I try to end a night of play by harvesting a blast zone for raw flux. Start the next evening's session with a vendor circuit to offload said flux, collect some lead and steel.
---
The same way you would interact when you meet some one new and you are trying to strike a conversation without creeping the other person out.  Maybe don‚Äôt whisper in the mic like if you are about to traumatized my character for life. Is simple approach another player ask them if they want to do a dungeon run with you (mine, Nuke silo, or event) instead of making chicken sounds and jumping all over the screen, because that‚Äôs how you get a miniNuke to the face üòÜ 
---
If Rose was human, you'd be just annoyed with her. And she would be just as immune to being killed. 
---
You must be doing a lot of server hopping and such. The few times I've done that, trying to find something, i find that every few hops, I get Rose's message about starting to kind of like me. 
---
*tear forms, slowly falls down cheek* one day...one day
---
I hung around that camp for quite a while just listening to that robot sass dead Miguel. 
---
Oh really? That‚Äôll be nice
---
Not to mention enemies have a tendency to slip underground and stay there.
---
Especially at the munitions factory. I have to abandon it every single time the defense quest spawns wolves because they'll get under the ground and can still attack your structures from down there.
---
For what?
---
Players aren't forced to stay at a workshop they own... I usually have 3 or 4 workshops on the go and participate in other activities until a defense pops up. An example would be farming nuclear keycards, which generally have me running all over the map.
---
Dude, do it for the free rohypnol 
---
the medical terminal in the enclave bunker often has recipes for chems

so far I've obtained:

---
* fury
---
* overdrive
---

* skeeto spit
---
* orange mentats

* berry mentats
---
* grape mentats

If you go to welch there is a mission to find the duchess stash that will trigger I can't remember if this gives fury or overdrive but it's guaranteed to give a recipe
---
Hi unfortunately I‚Äôm playing on PS4 
---
Thanks guys 
---
Holy cow!  These perks are out of control.  Bethesda couldn‚Äôt have envisioned this being exploited...could they?
---
Are you actually venturing out and doing quests or are you just a death machine?
---
I think the only things I've  found worth keeping are the armor pieces that reduce 15% damage from xxx enemy
---
I wish the factions actually meant something.
---
Agree emots are super creepy sometimes, specially if they are trying to invite you to their base.
---
Looking at your account is the true joke. You just can't play nice with anyone can you?.
---
Regarding your post here i am a fan of thequartering and enjoy his content. I also love Fallout 76 and the community.
---
You seem to be placing all into one group and that's just silly. From your post i am guessing your a young lad. So maybe try to be abit more positive with peeps and you might enjoy life more. Jnstead of caring about what others think or do. Think about how does this apply to me and do i really need to make a silly thread about something i don't truly understand.
---
Idk about other platforms, but on PS4 I've taken to just turning down the radio in game and running Spotify (PS4 Spotify integration is pretty good for this type of thing).  You can load up a playlist with whatever songs you like from FO3-76, plus whatever else you can come up with, and then jam out for hours.  
---
I remember exploring that place and finding it. I was so bummed when I picked it up and it was just a normal minigun and the paint didn't stick.
---
I have an Exterminators Combat Shotgun - explosive legendary included- and at most it takes two to three shots to take down most enemies. Sometimes I can one-shot stuff if I‚Äôm close enough but I don‚Äôt take that risk.
---
But you wouldn't be able to cycle 3-4 if you're overencumbered. If you cannot fit it in your stash, you cannot cycle. Again, we are talking about overencumbered players. You brought up a workshop. So explain how that works, lol.
---
I would enjoy a feature similar to what I see in MMO's like Guild Wars, where the game periodically reminds us in the corner of the screen how long we've been playing ("you have been playing for one hour..."), so that we can moderate our playing sessions and not forget about real world responsibilities as well.
---
There is, however, a similar one where if someone builds a power armor station too close to a wall or obstruction in their CAMP, the animation of you going behind it to work on your suit glitches and the suit can become unowned.  It's not quite as bad/risky as just dropping your PA but it does glitch the recall feature and create other problems since you can no longer work on the suit either.  It doesn't seem to happen with in-game PA stations even those close to walls, only ones players can build and place if they have the plans.  I've personally had this happen with a buddy of mine, and since confirmed it with others so watch out if you use a CAMP PA station.  Relogging seems to be the only fix.
---
I like your style. 
---
That would turn a normal pvp encounter into something a bit more. We need justification.
---
As for the park, there‚Äôs one in Boston I remember...it would be perfect. Hopefully it won‚Äôt take a couple hundred years to come to fruition. Lol 
---
The other problem with placing bounties is if I'm bored and have 25000 caps, I can just put big bounties on everyone on the server, and then watch the world burn
---
You misunderstand pacifist mode 
---
I once met a human that couldn't identify my gender in Fallout 3...

I look to see what level players are in the area before I go there. I'm a 30 something and if I see a bunch of 60+ players in the area I want to go, I know I'm probably going yo have a bad time.
---
Where is that quest?
---
Starched genes won‚Äôt have any effect on the negative effects of mutations, even while using a serum. SG only prevents the mutation from being cured when you use Radaway or a decon chamber. 
---
When you use a serum, you gain the mutation and the negative effects are automatically suppressed for like an hour, and then it goes back to normal. However, if you get the perk ‚ÄòClass Freak‚Äô in luck, the negatives are reduced pretty drastically, and with CF 3, they‚Äôre almost nonexistent 
---
I agree, it should give 7600 Atoms 
---
I'm hip!  I want just want the exhilirating feeling of risking it all.  I felt more excited in the shite graphics runescape wilderness, than in the beautifully designed and well made Appalachian wilderness.  It was scary running across the wildy in RS, because I never knew what was out to get me.  In 76 its more tedious than anything else, the saving grace is that the game is beautiful looking.  Ideally I would want the whole server to be PVP oriented, but I get that not everyone wants that.  So combat zones would be perfect.
---
dont you dare say that. im level 20 and i havent gotten the chance to use these guns people talk about. 
---
Bingo. I think it also adds one to each base Stat you have (if it holds up to previous games) ie. +9luck means +9more hp +9more damage +9more etc. I could be wrong on that part. 
---
I have all black powder weapons except for the blunderbus  furious 
---
We will see if your killcount stays the same after PvP rebalancing when you don‚Äôt always have first shot advantage. I‚Äôm guessing your days of bounty hunting will come to an end 
---
As it stands now, nothing more satisfying than laying out some bounty hunter who has every advantage in the world over the wanted 
---
Currently 119
---
I found after doing the quests , exploring the map 100% then hitting end game. This includes gathering all best in slot items including several weapon types.
---
I now get my joy from helping others prepare for end game. Mind you i still have to hunt a few missing plans. But once you hit 50 and knock out the gear / weapon side. I highly recommend helping us to prepare others for vault diving.
---
Ah, I didn't even know what that was for, they are indeed there, thanks for the help!
---
Ah, thanks for clarifying.  Had eagle eyes (non serum) and kept it a while with SG, but couldn't stand the strength debuff with my already low str.
---
Obviously this doesn't get shown in game (though if servers were more persistent it would be cool), but dunking nukes almost daily into the same coordinates repeatedly is eventually going to either directly kill everything or cave in whatever is at the bottom of those fissures. 
---
Given those nuke silos are automatically replenished and the Overseer herself expresses horror at their potential maximum capabilities, I feel there's a decent lore friendly chance that the Scorched (and in fairness probably the rest of the region due to fallout) eventually get uber fucked. 
---
BoS likely could've done it given their tech and discipline (unconvinced by their tactics) if Maxson hadn't canned Taggerdy's nuke suggestion. 
---
It barely adds more base dmg but cuts the rate of fire in more than half. My two shot gatling laser kills faster than my tse gatling laser. 
---
Same, thought my friend was ghosting me one day shooting everything around me.  this went one for hours.  When it happened again I decided it was something else.
---
My pleasure ! ^
---
ive completed the main quest line and im trying to help others but yes i am a walking death machine the combinations of weapons i have and the perks and mutations i can kill enemys really quickliy the only enemy that i havent defeated yet is the scorchbeast queen
---
I got my 2 shot gauss from a friend.  Networking with people increases your likelihood to get nice things by millions.
---
I normally love to craft, but the vendor, weight, and stash limits make it pointless. I farm crops, to craft, to throw away. Sensless.
---
Now I go the dog food/purified water route. It's depressing but makes more sense inventory wise.
---
Kill a wendigo wearing a clown costume.
---
I can become overencumbered at any time by picking things up while participating in other activities or receiving rewards for any events I might complete while I'm out. I'm surprised that needs explaining, to be honest.
---
Dude I have made so many alts, leveled them to over 50, and then wanted to try something else out that I have maxed out and then deleted those new fresh 50s to make way for more alts 3 times since Beta.  I just transfer caps and items I want to keep off with the help of a friend and go play again.  Currently I only have two characters I have saved and played for more than 2 weeks.  If you want to play the game and experience it in a new way with a different build you absolutely should!
---
lol, I started a new rifle character. Ammo became such a pain in the ass that I'm just using melee and do still one shot a lot of things without being specced for it at all.
---
Stay tuned my friend. 
---
Mutations are a definite for me too. I run melee pugilist so heal factor/speed demon/twisted muscles make me feel like frikin Wolverine!
---
Yea that‚Äôs stupid, but Beth won‚Äôt do that because it has more chance of making the player just say Fuck It! And log off 
---
It also only takes a min to run around and store your machines before the waves start.  
---
Also be ready to pvp during defend missions, ppl like me get bored sometimes and take advantage of the chaos to cap your workshop and obliterate you with a nuke mine when you run to save it.  Sns
---
I'm level 109 and still finding new stuff by going back over areas I've been to before.
---
Worst case, okay something else until new content or modes drop but at level 48 with all quests completed I guarantee you there is still a lot of content you haven't seen.
---
Kinda excited, hoping TSE weapons are banned in them :fingers crossed:
---
[http://lmgtfy.com/?q=fallout+76+mayor+for+a+day](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=fallout+76+mayor+for+a+day) ;)
---
I play on PlayStation and my world is almost always full. Its hard sometimes to join my friends or for them to join me. The only time there is hardly anyone on is at night like 3am.
---
I did not mention PvP once and said that there was also other duping problems than TSE. I don't PvP. 
---
So grow up and go crying in right place, because this was not it.
---
Just up the road from Flatwoods, that orange truck off the road, next to those mongrels, there‚Äôs an iron ore, you can place an extractor there, not far from the river either. Not quite enough distance to get both an industrial purifier and an extractor, but still a great spot, though you might want to build some guns, it‚Äôs a frequent for mob spawns.
---
Don't forget you need one high radiation fluids and one glowing mass in addition to the hardened mass to craft each stable flux. At least those two can't be scrapped so you shouldn't lose them.
---
Then the solution is to not fight.  Let you/them strike us down and get nothing other than the kill and a marker as ‚Äúmurderer‚Äù.  Keep that up and the whole server will be coming for the bounty.  Thanks friend!
---
i mean good for u the game fixed itself implying it was the games fault kindly jog on
---
You can fix missing quest items by logging off/on again. I regularly lose my notes, holotapes, etc when I crash. Ghouls that deal radiation seem especially prone to causing a crash for me. They'll hit me and I hear the crackle of radiation but it just keeps playing eve if the ghoul isn't hitting my anymore. Then the game locks. Great fun.
---
I found my first legendary lever action (lvl 45, 2* furious) the other day at a whitesprings nuke event, and my bf found a troubleshooters explosive combat shotgun (lvl 50, 3*). I am level 96 and he is 70. It was the first time we found legendary guns we actually wanted to use, instead of, for example, a legendary rolling pin. 
---
In my experience, nuking whitesprings is the best way to find those legendaries you want! If you‚Äôre on ps4 I plan on nuking several times this week :)
---
Ok I'll take a look thanks
---
Have my babies?
---
I run a 100% HP 1 endurance build with a 2 handed sledge. No fancy items or legends my first swing puts a level 90 scorchbeast at 25% health. If scorched are in the area before hand and I can max adrenaline I can 1 shot them
---
If you leave it kinda further back it's not a bad thing, just don't have it sitting right in front of the windows to the resort and Noone will shoot it. The missiles in the window thing is obnoxious and gets you 0xp and 0loot.
---
For what it‚Äôs worth I never get NPCs at my camp. I had 3 level 6 scorched there yesterday and that was the first time. I have no turrets and haven‚Äôt had an issue. 
---
What lvl?
---
I've had rare ones that just didn't explode. Unpredictable is certainly the word for the behavior.
---
All i need is one shot for Raiders like you 
---
Maybe we are tone death lol
---
There is a treehouse that isn't a POI you can build on.  It's in the Mire on the west side.  Also, there are some cabins along a ridge, just west of R&amp;G station.  Can build and make those cabins your own, no POI.
---
Any easy way to track down Grahm?  I'm level 60 and haven't seen him yet.  Should I just walk the roads that are on that map that shows his known travels?  It's such a big map....
---
I understand where you‚Äôre coming from. 
---
We will just have to keep an eye on Bethesda‚Äôs announcements concerning the matter. Word is floating around of a faction based pvp system. 
---
You can literally drop weight or not pick up until you're over. Or pop buffout, liquor or tats and travel back to a stash. 
---
This is crazy that I've never noticed this hahaha
---
What‚Äôs stopping you?  Sounds like you have all the tools you need to do so?
---
I doubt xcell and calmex can be crafted but I would think Med-x could but I havn't found 1 person that has it.
---
Ok I'll make sure to have a look then thanks
---
Yeah I had 5 workshops last night, every 45ish minutes all the defend quests would pop at the same time. Its rather annoying having to stop what Im doing to go kill 4 mole rats that my 15 turrets couldn't mange to kill. 
---
No Idea how you got to the end.  I spent a bunch of time just dorking around with new friends I've met that I feel like I have piled up more stuff to do then I can handle.
---
Exactly that. I'm doing this right now. Got the BoS CA Legs and Deep Pocketed CA Chest and the mayor starts to annoy me.
---
Good thing I posted on Reddit. Nowhere else I read you can find those plans here! It's insane.
---
Fingers crossed!
---
Sounds cool I'll have a look
---
Energy weps in NV tended to have very large magazine sizes compared to guns, small spread and the cells let you shave off varying amount of DT and boost damage. Not to mention unique things like the Tesla Cannon (Tesla Beaton variant especially).
---
And Heavy Weapons in NV were actually quite good. The minigun especially was one of the most devestating weapons (Avenger is literally the highest DPS weapon of all even across all DLCS) due to the fact that it could pierce armor. The 5mm AP variant even moreso with a whopping -25 DT. Grenade Machinegun was also a total monster.
---
E weps lost any real standout qualites they had in 4 with mainly getting gimmick mods (wow, burning damage on a game with truckloads of HP enemies!). Things like the minigun got shafted hard due to how the armor system works. And Flamer in 4 was just too short range and got shafted by the armor system.
---
Why would you put points in charisma to get more caps to run the vendor dry of caps so you need to spend caps to FT to another vendor?
---
My charisma is 2.
---
Oh man, I've got all of them except Empath, Herd Mentality and Carnivore/Herbivore. If you grab the Class Freak perk, the impact of negative effects is minimal. I'm sitting with a very small hit to my HP, energy weapon damage and gun accuracy, which is actually countered by the + special bonuses you get from the mutations themselves. Overall, the biggest impact I suffer is the -1 Strength I end up with, which is easily countered by my alcohol consumption. I'm rarely sober lol. If you group a lot, it would be worth the other mutations as well, since that +2 on all special from Herd Mentality is pretty awesome.
---
I'm not a fan of the trash bag either. I get why it has to be the way it is. The engine just can't handle tracking the individual items. I used to drop EVERYTHING in Fallout 4 and manually scrap it to settlement instead of just dropping stuff into the pool. 
---
But I would love to be able to take my Bobbleheads, magazines, teddy bears, Robot Models, and Board Games and make a display with them. 
---
Yes, include having he physical item in hand before I can craft/edit the item into the display but at least it would give me something fun to hunt down while I'm hunting everything else!
---
It doesn't need some fancy lights or anything that would require a tremendous amount of Budget/server resources. Just a shelf with teddy bears, a magazine rack with my magazines.
---
Please, thank you.
---
Are you asking what level I am?
---
Thank you
---
Oh you know I am the kind of player who always see positive sides of things. I don't have a lot of friends in game so I mostly play solo but I do my best to make sure people are happy in this game.
---
... You make me want to be a raider now &gt; &gt;
---
Yeah, I always drop a piece of junk first and then look at the bag just to be safe.
---
If I'm with friends, I ask if they see the bag, and then I can safely drop.
---
1)max to 80%.
---
2)find a Gattling Gun
---
3)use Martial Arts Perk to increase rate of fire
---
4)use 80% ammunition and Super Duper to craft 5mm which now weighs nothing.
---
5)profit.
---
But seriously. I'm carrying 5k of 5mm on me and it weighs zero. And the Gattling is a good gun even before any Legendary.
---
Step 6 repair with Weapon Artisan to 200% durability , use Gunsmith for reduced wear, use Stabilized to chew through armour. 
---
Call Jesus his new name: Warthog inbound
---
Pretty much yes, that's the answer to anyone attacking you if PVP isn't your thing.  It always surprises me in this game how much rage people have over it when there are systems in place that take care of it and other than losing some junk you aren't really out anything.  
---
They posted an inside the vault that has a link on the launcher that opens with the game. It has details that a patch will be mid month and more details later.
---
I get this bug a lot when on a squad -- your waypoints/player markers tell you the crew is north, but they're actually east etc.  Extremely disorienting.  There are also these sorts of invisible region barriers where when you cross the invisible line all your compass directions spin around.
---
On the subject of paper bags aparently fallout vault dwellers have a virtual unlimited supply of them but have to go find toilet paper...
---
&gt;munted:  Adjective. (comparative more **munted**, superlative most **munted**)  (UK, slang) Drunk. (Australia, New Zealand, slang) Intoxicated (by  drugs or alcohol). (Australia, New Zealand, slang, by extension) Damaged  or unusable.
---
Is this what you meant to say?
---
I made a raised platform to hop up on so ghouls can't reach me. Put a Chem Station for Flux, Weapon Station for Repairs, Stash box, and Decontamination Arch for rad clearing. Easy rest stop for anyone nuking the Whitesprings.
---
In FO4 it was so nice to go into a room and know I could put things into dressers or bookshelves based on what I'm storing.  The workbench got all the junk (and didn't have a max) - and then one could easily divide the rest of the stuff based on what you wanted.  Chest for armor.  Chest for guns/weapons.  Chest for mods and whatever else.... it was so nice.  
---
Now we have all these storage options and they ultimately all go to the same pot of 600 carry weight.  One thing I think I hate about the whole game but I get why.

also there's an acid and fertilizer dual node with lots of water and semi-flat ground next to grafton great if you need lots of acid/rubber/BOS plans

Check inside the vault. The link should be in the launcher.

Yep. Gamer tag id whatever is Bleedscarlet...
---
Ye. If you‚Äôre a higher level, like 20, there‚Äôs this place in the Toxic area, top of the place
---
It spins 
---
Every time I've tried to join a Horde event nothing happens, the map marker hexagon thing just stays there no matter how much I wonder around the area. Is there something I'm doing wrong?
---
How did you manage to get up to levels that high? Also, looking at your posts, I still can farm some things, like skimming the map and helping smaller levels. 
---
Thanks for your feedback and help!
---
........ A legendary rolling pin???? ROFL
---
Yup this is the "middle school years" of the game, imo it is the toughest time being 20-30, after that it gets good again. If you haven't spent a lot of time and feel your build is unfixable start a new one. If you have a lot of time invested power through.
---
If someone really wants a workshop that bad Im not going to PvP for it, I have never turned passive mode off and really dont have any plans to, theres plenty of other workshops I can claim. 
---
huh-huh-HOWSITGOINGUYS
---
Go visit my hometown of welch wv.... Seems very odd that my little hometown made it to a video game,  but well its there,  not much to do there but thats where i seem to hang out at
---
I'm level 56
---
Who wants to start one? Msg me.
---
nothing i just havent planned on launching a nuke recentliy not that it would be hard to with my 3 star anti armour exsplsoive guass rifle with some other legendary effects on it 
---
Yeah, sorry. As I was scrapping it I was like "This was definitely a good idea. There's no chance this wasn't a good idea."
---
I'm thinking it may not have been a great idea.
---
Oh, shit.
---
Waiiiiiit right there. I think I've taken all (3 is it?) power stations and never had the defensive vertibot. I remember seeing someone mention it during the Beta but completely forgot. Do you need to activate something in particular?
---
&gt; I have to try to point at and shoot the ground like a maniac. 
---
It's hilarious when you instantly recognize the twist-and-shoot. 
---
What?
---
Why are you still replying
---
I got my first two-shot weapon at lvl 162 and still have never found a weapon with explosive.
---
I think you meant to say *Bethesda‚Äôs Fallout*, Cuz most of the stuffs in the FO1-2 are 1990s
---
For a melee PA build only useful perk is lifegiver, 4 points required for 45 health +20 for the END levels, other than that endurance is QOL perks that are not really useful.
---
Should've pumped that second shot into him haha that is crazy though. 
---
I don‚Äôt know why you are getting so much hate, you are completely right. It‚Äôs ridiculous that they take a month long break from a game that‚Äôs so broken the servers crash every ten minutes. 
---
Killing 3* legendaries only drop 1* for me sp im curious too
---
Then you should have posted pictures of all your perks, once you click that link it turns from "jake of all trades" too "look at all my end game content" at level 350+ i know damn well you have more perks you switch out too make it work.
---
I set it up so all my powered items are linked to the same pylon chain. I store one at the defend, and guard the reactor i built and boom. Easy peasy no loss
---
Yes, but the thistles from the Grafton Area seem to stack with the ones from the Palace yet aren't useable or....something
---
When it's in your inventory does it stack on another set of power armor and say "power armor (2)" I had that happen. Had to place down one and scrap the other because I could never get both of them to set down.
---
Farming nuked whitesprings nets you a ton of levels per nuke, if done properly.
---
Caps.  Time invested in scavenging.  Loss of plans for building/repairing things.  Oh, believe me...there is a loss indeed.  And the associated rage (rightfully so).  Thank you for giving me that knowledge.  I‚Äôll relish watching your kind (no offense) being hunted down as I flood the airwaves with how to handle the situation when they show up to collect the bounty.
---
Nothing personal...
---
It exists, you get it from dailys and events in the mire. But its a super low chance of getting it as the reward, so because of all that, the outfits only obtainable through rare rewards from dailys or events are worth quite alot. You're looking more at like 15k, 10k if you're lucky.
---
My character is a weird guy, I'm roleplaying him and he wears a gas mask at all times. Other players only hear my "muffled screams" kinda like a mole miner.
---
Someone else on this sub called them "spaghetti dogs" which I really like. Here's a video of one for anyone who hasn't run across them: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-trekM3hs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me-trekM3hs). You can easily VATs target them, but only rarely can you actually shoot and damage them.
---
My best is explosive/bloodied Radium Rifle and it is game breaking good. 
---
And people buy duped TSE's, so they are supporting the duping business, and are as guilty as the dupers to this situation.
---
I have no problem playing it on macbook pro with the lowest resolution &amp; graphics setting.
---
Agree.  Holy cow - Tremors - that movie is on TV so many times.  I think Kevin Bacon realizes that's probably his most famous movie that most folks remember him by over most other films he's done (including Footloose).  Gotta see it at least once... its a campy movie about underground "creatures" that hear you seismically and want to kill you.
---
TSE... Because the normal harpoon gun didn‚Äôt pack enough wallop on its own. 
---
They‚Äôre being an ass. Search ‚Äúbest 2H‚Äù  or similar on this sub and you‚Äôll find a bunch of posts about the topic. Personally, I like legendary Super Sledges and Fire Axes, but I‚Äôm not up on the current meta. 
---
I sort of felt finished after I launched some nukes and found myself with really only grinding the whitespring hoping to tag things before they get oneshot.
---
Not fun.  LvL 65
---
Of course not bathesda have not been the best at communicating latly. Plus like someone stated before it's best to keep a trap hidden for people to fall for it.
---
No that's just where you spawn in shortly after. The bug I'm on about is where you're in a live nuke zone but take zero rads. Spent the whole time in normal armour
---
Indeed.  There will be no hesitation from now on.
---
Only the sentry bots do, unless I'm crazy I think the assultrons do also. They are the only ones that give xp as well the Gardners don't at all. Trust me on this if I get bored I just start killing them all. 
---
Didn't you know everyone in vault 76 had 25 left legs?
---
Just being on voice chat to communicate with random people is helpful. It's akin to not being a mute in real life
---
Too late for that.
---
No. Not fixed. Happened to me again the other day lol
---
That's how it works already though.
---
The only time this doesn't happen is if you join a friend's server through the social menu and *their* server has your camp spot occupied. It will still automatically be back in its original state when you switch servers next time though, so long as you don't place it.
---
Welcome to the final game of fallout 76 
---
While I would definitely like an increase in the stash limit. I don't find it that hampering towards crafting. If anything, crafting is what makes more room in your stash box. 
---
I'm guessing that the first introduction to player vending will be the ability to make vending machines in your camp, and that it might be along the lines of ammo, health, like we currently have. But would also love to see food vending machines. 
---
The problem is, stuff going bad. The direct solution is that stuff inside a vending machine has it rate of decay stopped until someone buys it. 
---
But what might be more interesting is some things have a canned version of them to make. There's a lot of cans out in the wastelands. Like how making a molotov cocktail needs a beer bottle specifically, canned food would need a piece of steel and an actual can (The idea being, you take an old can, make a new lid with the steel, put the food in, and then seal it up).
---
So there could be a whole section under the cooking for canned. Or even jarred, and all those mason jars with lids are needed. 
---
They might weigh a little more, but they don't expire. And so you put that in the food vending machine. 
---
It'll be necessary in this instance, but introducing power creep can set a poor precedence this early in the games life. 
---
And you can jump start the Enclave quests by going to the abandoned waste dump...  None of the Rose, free states, or BOS run and fetch quests are required.
---
Ill killed a fair few dozen and gives xp rarely and never a drop of ammo but i could be wrong
---
Yeah I got nothing worthwhile for you then
---
I‚Äôm attracted to this game because it‚Äôs a fallout game. If I wanted to play ark, I‚Äôd play ark. But I‚Äôm playing fallout. And surprise surprise, I‚Äôd be ecstatic if they added more risk and consequence. Lose my inventory, that‚Äôs alright. 
---
High risk high reward. Bring it on. 
---
&gt;They don't have to drop anything.  
---
&gt;You can literally drop weight
---
Bit contradictory? Anyway, the only time I've ever actually been stuck in someone's camp wasn't due to being overencumbered. I couldn't fast travel because there were enemies nearby. Dogs had spawned in at the same time as him and his camp and were attacking part of it. If I couldn't damage his camp I would have had no choice but to exit the game and lose my workshops.
---
 "The Med-X from *Fallout 4* \[,,,\]. It is not craftable at a chemistry station "
---
Might not be craftable in Fallout 76 either.
---
Army Fatigues (Clean variant given as a very rare reward from handing in tech data).
---
I kind of feel the same way, but have been having some really fun interactions taking over people's workshops (and hunting bounties whenever they pop up.)
---
Some people put a lot of time into those workshops, so they can be well defended. Makes for some fun raids. Also no worry of wanted as long as you attempt a takeover of the workshop.
---
Did you have the "Scorched Earth" quest on.  
---
If you arent in range of the event, you wont get credit.  
---
Also, I've been in the "death/respawn" cycle and got no rewards.  I couldn't get any loot off her either.
---
Nah, because this is going to be virtual reality and we'll find out in an expansion/dlc that we were just in another vault experiment that was geared to find out just how much or how little it will take for someone to nuke parts of West Virginia.
---
Luck does not effect quality of lego drop, only the durability. There is no correlation between type of enemy vs type of drop, i.e. a 3\* behemoth and a 3\* molerat have the same drop rates of legos. As far as acquiring something OP pray to RNGesus or buy them from someone on the market reddit 2-5K caps for something good. 
---
Are you using a native client or are you running it though wineskin?
---
Stay away from Whitesprings, its a high level area. If you need to go there for something else, stay away from the golf course. Sneak, or sprint or kite the ghouls toward robots. 
---
I'm only level 30 because I can't play for more than an hour or so before the server starts randomly dropping connection (PC). I've checked all my Ethernet lines &amp; jacks, run all the tests on the ISP local network, and it seems to be just Fallout having the problem for the most part. It's frustrating.
---
Sadly, not really sure I'll play again unless they improve this issue. Waiting to see what the future update patches and possible DLC does for the game.
---
I'm glad others are having a blast, but as a long time Fallout fanatic, I'm just very dissatisfied.
---
I use the Vendor Cash Register - Mini-Nukes, 40mm's, .38 ... anything and everything that I just don't need but someone else might. 
---
If they think to activate the cash register...
---
I do wish that Bethesda could come up with a way to identify dupers. Then permanently ban them. 
---
Uh oh
---
I've only been targeting the sentry bots and the assultrons if I do it just because the whole never getting xp thing. I don't server hop whitesprings so it's an excuse to get a little more xp before moving on. 
---
"Coddling"? 
---
I'm not asking for anything that changes any in-game interaction or anything. I'm asking for a change that would save some time. Thus QOL (quality of life because I'm not confident in your ability to understand that).
---
Miss me with that shit.
---
Im down for this and will be on shortly. Bob_lob_lawh.

Thought about it, but it's the best weapon I've got. Can take out some enemies ~20 levels higher than me, with a single shot!

Haven't had any issues with him being aggressive, but noisy as heck.  Oh and let's not forget that angry scowl on his face all the time.  :)
---
PSN: Counterpointa
---
I'm level 90, and almost every session I claim the gorge junkyard, dirt track, billings homestead and charleston Landfill and I always get low level enemies (less than 20). 
---
You don't need lead belly per se, all you really need is a way to wipe your rads away.
---
Since you're probably at the whitespring anyway, that shouldn't be much of a problem. 
---
I'll still check it out don't get me wrong all possibilities have to be considered
---
I‚Äôm having the same problem now. I get blue-screened every damn time I try this quest. Did you ever figure out anything? 
---
I spawned in right in front of main hotel entrance and heard the creepy death crescendo and then died. It was weird because everything else looked fine right up until I died.
---
Another tine I was too close to the nuke drop and my Power Armor did NOT save me. I rag-dolled and was licky enough to get my junk back.
---
It ain‚Äôt easy, everybody fucken hates you haha but it‚Äôs alright, at the end of the day we‚Äôre all just tugging each other‚Äôs pickle. Not so sure about the other ones though...
---
One method is to disarm traps for infinite XP and materials. I don't know if that got fixed before or in this patch tho.
---
You gotta understand these items are purely RNG based. Every 3* you kill is a chance at a good item. It can take hundreds of legendary kills (yes hundreds) to get what you are looking for - or you could get it from the first one you kill.
---
So unless you are nuking whitedprings and getting 10+ legendary items/hour it will take **forever**
---
Basically Preston Garvey was:  
---
010 See Preston  
---
020 Get quest  
---
030 Resolve quest  
---
040 goto 010
---
since med-x is part of the psycho recipe I'd say it's either not possible to craft or the recipe is incredibly rare
---
Yeah I‚Äôd like to know also. I‚Äôve seen the same behavior. 
---
Melee is still useful for Scorchbeast queen runs. With 4+ players attacking she usually lands quickly and spends the majority of the fight within melee range. While she is in the sky there are usually loads of scorched spawns to deal with on the ground. I have ranged options but I prefer melee.
---
west tek seems pretty good
---
It‚Äôs north west of that gator park
---
But you didn't feel shitty taking other players dropped stuff while fighting the qween. Right... 
---
I‚Äôm convinced only 1 of each decent weapon has ever dropped and the rest are clones of it.
---
Friend runs a set of unyielding armour and maxed out melee and runs white spring in a hazmat suit. Just 1 shots everything. Forget what he has on his weapon. 
---
Nope, they are individually listed. I have 4 chassis. 1 excavator that I use, 2 empty that I can put down and 1 that has for t51 parts that I can‚Äôt put down
---
Loot on containers (like corpses) is instanced per player. However, if you open the corpse and loot at the same time as someone else, you both may end up looking the same instance. So take your turns looting to avoid the shared corpse instance looting bug.
---
Oh god the alpha wolf for the event was like this for me....I just had to wildly swing my axe around hoping to hit whatever was biting me @_@
---
I did it.  Had a ranged character I got to 150 or so.
---
Working on a melee build now.
---
That way when I feel like it I can switch to either.
---
duplication glitches 
---
It's a visual bug. The items you saw, weren't able to be looted by you at any point.
---
I love how you assume that because I am providing you the information you need to understand what happened to you that I am somehow involved :-p  I hunt bounties and like to have powerful characters.
---
1.  If you engage in PVP and are upset when you get wrecked... sorry not sorry.  Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, and in a game like this where balance doesn't even feel like an after thought I don't really know what else you expected.
---
2. I don't know what "airwaves" you think you can flood where this information isn't already common knowledge since bounties and how they work has been known since before the game released but go for it mate.
---
3. If you don't want to PVP, turn on pacifist mode.  You don't lose caps unless you engage in pvp.  As far as having to rebuild here is a trick for you... server hop.  Base comes back fully repaired like magic.  
---
Not really sure what the idea was for your post if you didn't come here for information, seems more like just another "I'm not the biggest bad boy on the block and I don't like it wah wah wah" post.
---
I thought they WERE doing this. Ala Skyrim. Didnt find out till i had used 3 levels in 1h melee that it wasnt a thingü§Ø
---
Yeah Bill, after being stuck in a Vault with you for 25 years and having to deal with the way you eat with your mouth open. IT's WHAT I WANT TO DO, KILL!
---
I ran around with a bunch of lowbies at Whitesprings today. Shotgun to the legs, and ghouls aren't threatening any more. 
---
I found someone's cool base and shot their Fox.  Sorry man, I didn't know. 
---
Your fingers would be too thicc with the power armor 
---
It can be hard to find a full set of good armor, so don't be afraid to mix and match pieces, since you usually don't get a buff for using all of a certain kind. I usually try to craft some new pieces every 10 to 15 levels, depending on what legendary boosts I have. 
---
The combat rifle is a good middle-tier kind of weapon, especially since you stumble across plenty of 45s. If you have extra resources, you can craft and then scrap weapons to try to unlock mods, but plenty of enemies are also going to be dropping those for you soon enough, too. I've found shotguns to be less viable in FO76 vs. the previous games, but some people do like using them, so it could just be a matter of modding them correctly. 
---
Iv seen it happen before to me I thought something was wrong but I did a doable take after a minute and it reappeared. 
---
You're not going to get along with everyone you live with all the time. 3 months is more than enough time for someone's morning whistle tune to get annoying. After 25 years? I'd probably want to nuke anything they built.
---
And they could add another Drinking Buddy robot!
---
It annoys me so much that PA and hazmat suits have hidden rad resists. I play unarmed melee, which cannot be used in PA, and even after 3 Radshields and a diluted rad-x (to prevent mutation suppression), which puts me at 1000 rad resist, I still take 11rad/s in a nuked zone while not in PA. Where as in my T-60 with no other rad resist (around 350ish? not too sure), I'm at less than 2rad/s. Bethesda pls.
---
So what happens when you shoot the queen with the syringe that makes animals talk? What would she say
---
I would love this as well. So many times I‚Äôll kill a glowing legendary in whitesprings amongst 10 other enemies, and then a car blows up and blasts the body to oblivion and I can never find it. 
---
Sometimes you have to defend against mole rats. Sometimes you have to defend against *Scorchbeasts*.
---
no worries I kind of spent hours looking for a perfect base location and this is probably the best locations I've found
---
also, there's a location at the end of the stream south-west of harper's ferry near treetops that has ticks if you want to farm stimpaks and treetops resources (a bit annoying to build on though since it's very uneven)
---
Haven't read all the comments. 
---
Raiding I can completely understand, you kill someone ... get some junk, take a workshop move on.
---
Grief players are not "Raiders" - they are the players who continue to harass/tea dip and follow those they have already killed. They are the people who shot at someone and don't get the satisfaction of a response and then go homicidal because the expected response didn't occur. 
---
Raiding I get if that is your play style - but Griefers are not raiders.
---
No permission.  You need to change that.
---
What people are saying is true for the majority of loot. It's a visual bug.
---
But there are something, like when you kill mobs in the blast zone, which will have things like Hardened Mass, Glowing Mass and High Radiation Fluids, which show up for everyone, but the first person who loots it's gets it. 
---
So do those zones with people you trust, or be quick to loot, because with strangers, I doubt you will find that many that will split the rewards evenly.
---
It's that kid that comes and steps on your sand castle.
---
Did you ever find these?    
---
Was server hopping effective?
---
They'd have to change it a TON. This game is set 185 years before Fallout 4. 
---
I played Saturday night and the game for whatever reason looked so much smoother and less buggy. it was 2am eastern a time i normally never play more 8pm primetime.  My thought was maybe the servers are less stretched because of less people playing.   I  wouldn't mind if less people played it wont effect me but having the servers at capacity does.  
---
Simple, go to Abbie's Bunker in The Mire.  Head south for just bit till you see an open field.  In that field will be a random spawn.  Some are tameable, some are not.  If you don't like what it gives you, just serve hop.  As a note, stay away from the road.  At the spot where the truck and trailer are hanging in the air, a Windego is always there.  
---
Maybe even if the power armor helmet mod that highlights enemies RED, could turn them a gold/orange color once dead?
---
Awesome thank you!
---
Dupes.
---
Dupes everywhere.
---
Drink more Slurm!
---
Is your soldier certificate in your stash? I had to dig mine out, and it updated the quest stage when I did. 
---
Go to the Burning Mine.  There is a power armor spawn up on top of the hill in the building, and one just inside the mine entrance.
---
Keep hopping there.  Every server has a chance to get you 2 quick power armor spawns.
---
You'll get the pieces faster that way.
---
You're one of the rare ones. Kudos on that. Most of the people I see claiming to be "raiders" just like the power trip of being a troll. 
---
Most of the advice seems to be to wait a sec before firing. I can do that but I don't like it. Wait a sec, take a hit, fire back. I'm more like shoot first, ask questions later. 
---
I get that shooting fast and missing doesn't help anything, so... I'll give it sec.
---
\[spoiler\]Go to the door that you have to open, and... look at the  mat in front of it.\[/spoiler\]
---
The wanted system should actually work first. I killed a wanted player that killed my very hard to find and tamed mirelurk and I became wanted. It's a joke at this point. You can't even defend your own stuff.
---
I‚Äôll be waiting. Be prepared for eternal rest in that coffin you call power armor!
---
That sounds like a great idea concerning factions and territory, I appreciate that input. I really wonder what they‚Äôll do. Don‚Äôt wanna get my hopes up. 
---
Ok. This was what I was thinking of when I made the post. So only one glowing/hardened mass per player per kill?
---
It's an interesting idea.
---
More incentives are needed. It would be great if having a Bounty had increasing benefits to the player. More damage or loot, etc.
---
Getting a Bounty is the only easy way to PvP with others, atm.
---
I have a mic but wouldn't typically be on that late to be honest :/
---
Oh really?  I'll have to try this.  What a pain though. :(
---
Thanks I'll check that out to
---
Hahahahaha. Ok. Fair assessment. 
---
also inside mama dolces,&gt;! there's literally a secret bunker built by the chinese that the quest for the order of mysteries or enclave sends you on (can't remember which, did both at the same time). There was a whole base of commies down there, so there was definitely something to investigate.!&lt;
---
I've said it before, if they need to have a capacity system, rework it so that stacks only count the base weight of 1 item against it. So if you had a stack of 1000 steel, just make it so only 1 unit (0.05 weight I think) is counted towards being used.
---
Okay, is it past the wendigo or before it? I've found the wendigo.
---
I mean, if you want to get technical, if you got the digital download version, isn't the entire game DLC?
---
Im getting back from holiday. Some days i can be on earlier. 
---
But what if I want to get rid of my small(wall shooting) bounty? I want those robots to attack me then.
---
I've seen this with legendary mongrels while defending a workshop many times. Dunno wtf it is but it's definitely only an issue with dog-like models.
---
You can also have to defend against ~~flying psychedelic gatling guns~~ scorchbeasts. I'd take the waves of terrible pathing AI over that.
---
Yep not going to request permission to take a survey.
---
Without knowing what plans you've unlocked or gathered there is no way to know how many are left to go.  
---
I don't see really a point in farming weapons or armor.. Being that it is such luck based the chances of getting something good is so slim. I have a crazy amount of hours in this game and just about reached level 100. I don't see a need for all the fancy weapons and armor... the game is too simple really.
---
PvP, as it is now, *is* a completely worthless concept.
---
Does it work with Vampire weapons?
---
Okay on here I come off as an asshole, it is my writing style. In game I am rather helpful, however if you try shit I am a truly petty asshole that will ruin your fun.   
---
I have made many new in game friends and team up regularly, and yes it is a great community for the most part. Are their dicks yes, some are Rp'ing a raider others are just that way in life and game. 
---
Exactly I love this game the only thing that make me enjoy it more is a solo mod.
---
Yeah! Here's a screenshot of the map: https://i.imgur.com/Kf4XBWA.jpg
---
It's east of the Whitesprings Resort.
---
yes, honestly I probably wanted to murder them inside but either didnt find a good enough opportunity or thought the risk of being caught was to high. Out in the wasteland, who cares if they know what I did because i'll kill them too and can't get trapped like in a vault. Makes perfect sense to me
---
I mean, Charisma defines how well you lie as well, so maybe your putting on some flourish/salesmanship on the item to convince the robot it's more valuable
---
"You see this can of dog food, it's special.  I aquired it on the last day the Super Duper Mart was still open, and used it to beat a glowing wolf into submission.  This can is near indestructable so long as it's sealed, all to protect the gravy soaked meat slop inside and keep it nice and fresh.  Look at how the paper label is worn, but the can it's self is perfectly intact.  You won't find a can this amazing again, so it's only fair that it would be a more expensive item"
---
Once a Raider sleeps your bed it's gg, they won. All the items in your house belong to them.  
---
Yeah i'm level 130 and haven't found a single Explosive weapon. 
---
Found a couple two shots ( lever action and black powder) but they are still just so weak compared to TSE weapons. I still use my non legendary handmade. 
---
I'm very torn on these weapons too though. On one had I know they are fun as hell to use, but on the other hand people with them just run around one shotting everything and it's not fun to be around. 
---
That being said; I would still love to have one 
---
I've been saying they should implement dedicated storage containers that each have a special perk. Like the ammo box would have innate "bandolier" perk on it (reduced ammo weight). They could make it so if you build the ice box it gives your stash the "good with salt" perk and if you build a dumpster it gives "pack rat".
---
Healing Factor is +300% health regen (when not in combat), and -55% chem effectiveness.
---
Plague Walker is diseases cause a poison aura (AOE) damage to enemies. Scaling up to 4 disease iirc. Obvious downside being, you have to contract diseases. 
---
In all honesty, the plague walker one was an accident and I don't feel like risking losing my others to remove it. So I just deal with it, lol. Could be helping me at times, could be hurting me at times. I honestly have not noticed.
---
Ok well 2 shot tends to have real issues with hit accuracy in VATs, hence my assumption.     
---
To improve your chances with ranged weapons you can try and buff your perception stat, or apply stocks and scopes in an effort to increase its accuracy stat. 
---
In that open field north of the Wendigo.  If you are at the Wendigo, look right at the open field.  About half way up will be the random spawn.  Sometimes is mosquitos, bears, mirelurks, scorched, etc.   
---
lol so start over with them.i have 4 characters now, i just started over with my brother last night who was new to the game. it's no fun for anybody team up with a level 100 just to walk around and have him one shot everything. honestly the beginning levels are more fun anyways. and if the lower enters the area before the higher level it spawns low level mobs 
---
That's just the key to the door.
---
He's talking about the protection inside who asks for a "baggage claim ticket". I'm wondering about this as well!
---
According to what I have read there is a claim ticket item in the game files but its spawn location is unknown. Its not needed to complete the quest and may be something they add in a future dlc/quest.
---
Best answer.
---
Best believe you‚Äôd see folks running around with a damn TSE, launching mini nukes all over the damn place. On top of that, they‚Äôll be completely naked too. Radiation 25 years after the bombs dropped must‚Äôve been somethin‚Äô else. I mean have you seen those bats? Haha 
---
You want to play Fallout because you like Fallout, you do not want to play Ark but want to make Fallout more like Ark? I am all about modifying PvP for more reward and risk, losing an entire inventory though is just asking a culture of griefers in this game. There would have to be checks and balances, such as a legendary weapon/armor ban during PvP. Or maybe if you build in the Forest or Toxic Valley you remain PvE, other regions trigger regular PvP rules. Something to maintain order and discipline rather than harassment of players without TSE weapons.
---
Huh good to know, was just thinking last night about just how long I‚Äôve been at 7 fusion cores in my inventory without picking any up for a couple weeks.
---
How cool would it be if a DLC set in the Capital Wasteland involved us helping build a town that's in Fallout 3? 
---
Whoa whoa whoa.  Calm down there.  I lacked the information,  and you gave me what I needed.  Don‚Äôt assume everyone knows how everything works in this game.  I‚Äôm a causal player and believe in live and let live, and more importantly leave me alone and I won‚Äôt bother you either.  This punk picked a fight with me and all I was doing was selling goods at a vendor he was using as his personal farming spot.  I don‚Äôt have the means to defend against all these exploits nor do I care to.  But now I know how to handle this sort of thing.  Let the masses destroy the exploiters as I laugh methodically on my mic (airwaves).
---
If you do put a camp right at the back door to the golf clubhouse, put a decontamination arch up. People will now find your camp very useful. Someone did that the other night and it was really handy.
---
TSE weapons personally ruin the game and make an already simple game.. even more simple.  
---
TSE weapons will shine the best if we ever get enemies with levels/strength that supersede what we have now.
---
Yeah, I hope something like that comes into the game.
---
And I like the idea of items being used directly over always scraping then remaking with the raw resources. And it also gives incentive for lower level players to collect things, to sell to higher level players, who are setting up shops. 
---
It would also be cool if we could get programmable robots. Giving the hacker perk some more value. Wouldn't it be cool if you had a restaurant in your camp, and a robot waiter/bartender? Players could come in, go to the robot, hit trade, and see what food you have to sell. There could be some kind of bar/counter furniture you have to have, and you stock it with food, and set the price. 
---
After 90 lvls, I've only gotten 1 explosive  and it is a combat rifle. No ts though. Now if you wanna talk assassins reduced weight increased swing speed rolling pins, those are abundant
---
üëç
---
If u liked F4, it's a yes for sure (I get mine for 15euro on G2A). Nowadays the games are not just polished, but under a big development after the releases (look at gta:o or d3), so me myself have a great confidence in Bethesda, that in a couple year, it will be an awesome game, untils it's maybe just for Fallout fans.
---
Are the same plans available from retaking as defense?
---
Isn't the reason to defend the plans that are available? 
---
Honest question - I haven't bothered to retake if I don't defend before.
---
Not true.
---
Place your camp at one of the more popular spots from 76maps. Click find server and see hoe often it won't let you place your camp. Also since the placement boundaries are so big anyone even close will cause you to lose your camp.
---
You then need to go to main menu and back into the game over and over until you get your spot. My camp is based at overseers so i can help people under 50. This is too common of an issue even if someone is miles up the road.
---
I suggest an OPTION that people do not need to do if they don't wish. For the game to do a server check and just allow us to look for another server right away. Instead of loading in then having to go back to main menu over and over until the free spot.
---
Trust me i doubt few here have more hours in the game than i do. Next to dupers this is such an annoyance that should not be an issue.
---
Oh hell yeah 
---
Depends on what you want most from your location.
---
There's a resource map that shows where you can camp to drop whatever resource extractor you need.
---
Or if you just want to max stuff to sell I'd drop it by plenty of water and near vendors.  I prefer the southern area of the savage divide for that.
---
That's what some guy was asking me for last night. I wondered why somebody added me out of the blue. I didn't realise.  Kinda smart.
---
I've learnt more in 100 levels than I did in 25 years with all of you. I passed that knowledge onto my daughter, Rose, who now raids Appalachia at the young age of level 23.
---
It‚Äôs an oil deposit. You might also find a crashed space station spawn there
---
I tihnk you should be able to plunder a percentage of their junk in their stash tbh
---
Ok I'll check out the area thanks
---
I usually want corpses to be easier to hide.
---
Reminds me of what I started doing, I went into the game going "I wanna cook...EVERYTHING" so I've been working on a repository spread sheet of every cooking recipee in game, with ingreedients and benefits, the 'longest part' is the transcribing XD
---
Ok thanks
---
That‚Äôs up to you.
---
Well, it had red eyes so, according to research, his intent was on murdering me so :P 
---
Ok. Yes. Also, robot police in the world, would always target onto those players when they get close. 
---
What if vertibots also homed in on wanted people over other mobs? And you could send up a flare when you are near one, that summons a vertibot? If the vertibot takes the wanted down, you get half the bounty. If you help take the wanted down, you get full. 
---
This has lots of fun potential I think. 
---
That‚Äôs Power Armor chasis (the thing you wear that allows you to equip Power Armor onto of it)
---
What are you on? Xbox? Pc?
---
Oh ok I actually didn't try what happens if you consome another one before the duration ends. I took them all instantly.
---
I've seen 2. I even used one for a while but while it will zap a Scorchbeat from the sky it is useless against the SB Queen. It broke before we'd even put a dent in her health. I dropped it right there in the Rad zone and used captured guns for the rest of the fight. 
---
I've got my CAMP currently under one of the power lines across the road from the golf course. Close enough for me to run to but just outside the blast zone. 
---
good thing your opinion doesn't matter as long as the people playing raiders feel like it is valid. 
---
I want "crappy armor". It means there's a chance it will be top quality armor. Today I got a heavy combat chest with +25 poison resist and autostim. May not seem great, but I think it might work out to be very great for the Scorchbeast fighting armor set I'm making.
---
Make sure you're using Ammosmith when you craft ammo.
---
Hit up the Flatwoods Motel Gym and Charleston Fire Department gym for lead.  Scrap weapons and armor for steel.  Super mutants give gunpowder, and you can craft gunpowder with cloth and acid as well.
---
Make sure you're using DIFFERENT guns for different enemies.  For low level stuff, use up that .38.  For Scorched use .45.  For Super Mutants use .308.  If you spread the ammo consumption out a bit it really helps.
---
Oh, I don't remember him asking.  I clicked interact and he just wandered off.   Now I gotta go back, thanks for clearing that up.
---
Did you watch the video? The chassis disappears and he becomes a long boi
---
Thanks for the helpful info
---
Make new characters, don't push points around like that after 50, it's silly.
---
Yeah, the other day I killed a deathclaw and then looked around to see it was near a base. Either I saved someone's base from a deathclaw, or I killed their pet.
---
perks are based on weapon type, not animation.  so two handed for the sledge. 
---
unarmed only boosts fist weapons.  anything you cant use in PA is a fist weapon.  
---
Well....it is a purgative so that'd flush out gut problems like parasites or bacterial infection in your GI tract, that's why Fiery Purgative from New Vegas works, and I've made the real deal version of it IRL too, only can handle small amounts cause, mygods is it hotter than hot, but it does let yous sweat out/flush out most of what ails you
---
Yeah I have a platform with a tent and cots set up, and then a small workshop/patio set up for guests, separate from my house. Seems to keep people from trashing my house, and I‚Äôm happy to provide a respite without sacrificing my privacy. 
---
true but ark sucks 
---
Hmm it sounds like you have hit a peak with the game and should consider putting it down for a bit then. Just pick it up in a few months if gear , weapons and plan farming does not concern you then you should be fine picking it back up in a few months.
---
If you force yourself to play something you are not enjoying you will end up hating it and then putting it down for good.
---
Yikes. Even more reason to give attention to both them.
---
Ah yes, the old, "But that's just what my character would do!" despite the fact that you have total agency over your 'character' and can choose not to grief other players. 
---
I've got news for you: I never carry much - if any - junk, have a gigantic health bar and plenty of stimpaks and other healing items, and I will never strike a griefer back. I just go about my business, at my pace, and take the occasional health aid, all while occasionally waving and giving the thumbs up to the griefer who is wasting time and ammo on me. I've yet to have one kill me or get my stuff and I never even have to log out.
---
They are "quest items" and cant be dropped but will self destruct when the code resets. 
---
Something I've been thinking about a lot lately is how in olden days you would get a printed manual that explained the rules of the game and how to play. But in modern game, it's up to the users to reverse-engineer the rules of the game for themselves, and I'm not sure why.
---
yeah its the best part honestly. private servers would be so boring 
---
Oh no I didn‚Äôt lol sorry for providing you with info you already knew
---
Careful where you place it the blades will hit things and make noise
---
Thank you for pointing this out. Considering what I‚Äôve read, I created this post generally to shine light on the concept of griefing and raiding in the game, and where those lines are drawn. 
---
Search this reddit for West Virginia Realtors and you will see several good posts on camp locations.
---
Yes no yes
---
adrenal reaction
---
Build a better house/camp. That usually takes time, and I seriously doubt that you have all of the plans for the camp already. 
---
I tried it all weekend and I had no luck, both in watoga and the robots of events    
---
I have not had luck 
---
Yes if it‚Äôs in a nuke zone when the bomb drops it will be destroyed.  You can always log off and wait for the bomb to drop
---
And comeback.  I‚Äôve helped friends rebuild their camps in nuke zones before so you can definitely do it
---
Yeah maybe I should try doing that and stay away until they‚Äôve done what they are doing 
---
same I love using cannibal on people down for the extra humiliation 
---
I agree, they could maybe add something to warn new/low-level players about entering a high-level area :P 
---
Use this link and look at the map to find a fitting area for your char: [https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-12-21-fallout-76-map-level-zones-5076](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-12-21-fallout-76-map-level-zones-5076)
---
Btw, if you're looking for people to play with, you could hmu, maybe I can help you a little :)
---
In my 80s and still have not been to Charleston fire dept.
---
I look forward to trying this out this evening, thanks!
---
My problem is I don't have damage perks really, and don't have any glowing mass any more, rip
---
Oof, only good if your doing a low health build. I'm gonna be full health lol
---
Easy way to test wich perk affects any weapon:
---
Make a note of the weapon's damage. Unequip/Equip said perks. Check for any change.
---
\-------
---
Rifleman does not affect shotguns or submachine guns. Tool tip is a liar.
---
Demolition perk in Intelligence does affect ANY explosive weapon though.
---
Fake "news" gonna fake.
---
Dropped two calibrated shocks for T-60 and lost them this way. Ironically I was dropping them so the repair system didn't scrap them.
---
It does! Oddly enough item weight sort of directly translates to VATS, the heavier the weapon the less shots/swings you get in VATS so I'll make you some lightweight stuff
---
&gt;But don't try to justify being a Sack of Richards by saying hurr durr I'm a raider.
---
Agree. I don't understand such lack of self awareness that assholes feel the need to justify to internet strangers why their dickish behavior isn't dickish behavior. 
---
But knackers your carry weight. I remember the 5.56mm problem well. I found a handmade very early.
---
I just went shotgun till level 30ish. Used 5.56 when I needed that extra range. The ammo scavenger Perk which requires you to click to search ammo containers is a godsend if you aren't constructing.
---
If constructing don't forget the makeshift batteries. Those are a good early source of lead. 
---
It would be cool of we could build them like in 4. It doesn't necessarily need to act as a companion if they're worried about balance. Leave it as a base pet/guard/house bitch.
---
Wear a hazmat suit under your power armor so you can get out of your power armor while in a radiation zone...
---
Also helps when you load in before your powerarmor does.
---
You should be more descriptive when you post stuff, especially topics like this. Nobody knows how to help or discuss when you just say something outlandish like this.
---
reeee he's doing pvp in a pvp game!!!!
---
Honestly this is the best place to get wood, when I run out of it, go there, talk to all the bots for their scraps, then harvest the absurd number of wood piles there too
---
I think if youre a bystander and you accidentally shoot a copbot you should get a bounty too
---
I found 3 star gatling plasma. Exploding, limb damage, and the 250 armor while reloading. Nicest legendary I've found...naturally I'm a rifleman build. What I hate is that even with my gauss rifle doing well over 200 per hit...my supersledge with zero perks supporting it rips through nuke zone mobs WAY faster than my gauss. I dont get it. I have armor pen, full rifleman, bloody mess, etc. Gauss says it does much more damage than my supersledge...but I two shot the bloated glowing ghouls with supersledge and tickle them with gauss.
---
Same friend can come and go to keep the enemies respawning. 
---
Sweet thank you! I might try and redo my perks to accommodate for healing factor, that sounds super useful
---
he said that to buy some time. he knew once people played they'd realize how stupid private servers would be..
---
Why were you subscribed to shitty channels and stuff you actively don't enjoy reading in the first place?
---
I'm guessing its ok when there is bad press about games like LawBreakers or whatever other trite the gaming industry has brutally fucked with pretty paid cosmetics?
---
This is a shit game. It was released in a terrible state and Bethesda has done fuck all to fix it.
---
If you hadn't figure out why FO76 specifically gets a large amount of chatter, the reason people are still talking about it is that they're waiting for the next fuck up violinist to join the orchestra of fuck ups that have happened with this game to date:
---
* BETA which wasn't a BETA
---
* "No NPCs"
---
* "16x the detail"
---
* canvas bags
---
* Nukarum
---
* Todd Howard
---
* Nukes breaking
---
* Duping
---
* Server crashing
---
* More duping
---
* No game balance
---
* Proof of pay to win items in the games code
---
* "I lost my entire set of armor to a game bug"
---
* "My character glitched by opening a few items and now if I punch anyone in the game the server crashes"
---
10% of the FO76 meme is the actual game, 90% is Todd Howard going out on stage to hype up and lie profusely about a game. Has Todd gone too far this time? Will he ever make another public appearance after this?
---
People tune in for the Todd. No one actually cares about anything to do with the shitty game because whatever happens with Todd next will be more interesting.
---
I love the game but this gave me a chuckle because i legit wonder this alot. What to do today?, lunch a nuke?, does anyone on the server need a hand?, maybe Whitesprings?.
---
I can't wait for vault diving gonna farm the hell out of them. I hope they come with different difficulties for us to plow through.
---
I've always found explosive weapons annoying to use because the bodies go flying and are harder to find to loot. That alone keeps me from picking up any missiles, nukes, or grenades.
---
Go to FO76 Bazzar and FO76 Market reddits.  People are selling them there pretty regularly.  Make sure you put in a post that says:
---
\[PC / XBox / Whatever You're using\]  W:  Powered Door Plans  H:  Caps
---
They're expensive though.  I've seen them go for as high as 6k or as low as 1k.  FYI if you start trading there and get good at it..........you'll never run out of caps again.  I don't even visit vendors anymore, just sell stuff on the reddit.
---
Mole rats are the worst, because of how long they sit in the ground. The burrowing behavior needs to be cleaned up. Tired of trying to fast travel and being unable to cause a trolling mole rat is hanging out underground and refuses to pop up. Or if he does he immediately burrows again.
---
Yeah, I feel like the respec option is best suited for fixing "mistakes" or if an OP perk (Enforcer?) gets nerfed making people rethink SPECIAL allocation.
---
I just phrased my comment as speculation bc I've never shuffled a SPECIAL point around yet.
---
Ha, if only I thought that wouldn't actually happen irl.
---
I'll keep doing it in hopes that it gets used by someone
---
When you think energy weapons, think about the amazing Alien Blaster.  
---
Less effective than a Commie Basher, but slightly better than a fart in the wind...only slightly.
---
 I'm now wondering the same. 
---
Happy cake day! 
---
This, sometimes they drop like 200 rounds of 5.56 and I have gotten as much as 20 caps as well.
---
I play mostly 98% solo and don't have any issues.  I do however say "hello" to everyone I meet and get a response about 2% of the time.  Yes, that's 2 people out of 100 for the math challenged.  No big deal, as I generally don't like people anyway, but it just seems odd.
---
My love of spreadsheets as a child on Diablo and the like turned into becoming a network engineer. It certainly does help if you have spent most of your adult life trying to find the best as you find it just naturally gravitates into your every day life.
---
TigerishPrune75 
---
Ya for straight dmg perks they're the same, it just comes down to the other perk options for the weapon types (stagger, piercing, wt reduction, etc.)
---
A two-shot lever action would be amazing. I wouldn‚Äôt even care about the explosive part.
---
I currently use a +30% damage to scorched and +VATS accuracy lever action as my sniper rifle, but I honestly find it so useful (and powerful) that it‚Äôs my go to weapon 80% of the time. My ‚Äúsidearm‚Äù handmade is almost totally ignored.
---
I was excited about it until I got it and realized it drains my ap when I'm crouched.  Made it useless for me.  I was trying to use it with escape artist, but I kept staying in danger/caution mode and not getting sneak attack bonus.  Imo the ap drain makes it useless unless you're a purely non vats sniper or there's  some good way to just sneak just for a second to get the shot then move again.   So far I'm not having any luck getting that to work at least in a group with lots of enemies around.
---
I'm aware how to get the vendor. But thanks for sharing.
---
It's viable - just swap some cards around based on what you're using more of at any particular moment.  Here's something similar to what I use, with some unallocated points to distribute however you like.  Most of the time I don't run Incisor and use 1 Heavy Gunner, 1 Exp Heavy Gunner, and 1 Master Heavy Gunner.

Because it probably would work the same as creatures. It's gotta be solo and from a random encounter. So far the only 1 of those I know for sure, is an eyebot.
---
Seeing the horrors and monsters of the wasteland changes every one.  Some turn to chems to take of the edge, other's loose their minds.  More turn to each other for support, but that can be fleeting when those on chems halucinate and kill those around them, making them need more and more chems to cope with the guilt and horror, an escape from what they've done, and become, until all traces of humanity are gone.
---
I was on a map with a bugged nuke zone yesterday too, it was awesome not having to be in a hazmat suit.  Finally hit 50 because I could actually kill the glowing ghouls on my own!
---
I can understand the reasoning behind what you are asking; however, I don't think this is simple and it would push an already stressed game engine. 
---
They would need to program calculations based on a randomly located structure (CAMP) to another randomly located object (you) compared to EVERY FOUND point on the map (Because you can't fast travel to locations you haven't discovered yet). And it would be hovering in the background for all 24 people on the map every time they access the map. 
---
I can see far to many bugs with this - and sadly as has been pointed out caps are not all that tough to get. 
---
Saving caps versus server stability ... I would rather have a stable server.
---
I am level 75 and I haven't used a TSE weapon yet either. Doesn't change the fact that it's extremely OP though!
---
I'm looking for one now to test out a new .50 Cal machine gun that stacks damage increase with each successful hit. Doubt it will do what I think it's going to do, but I'm hopeful.
---
There were also coded limits on how many misses you could have in a row as well, despite what the numbers displayed. On lower difficulties, series of misses would also raise your hit chance each time.
---
Oh, and Martial Artist works on (ballistic) Gatling Guns.  That's what I use a lot of.
---
u/Happydog001 brother soon on the 11th the first dlc event drops adding in new zones and vaults will open so gear  up and level because its gonna be one hell of a ride remember this is a game that you make your own journey and story embrace that role-play with other plays be a vendor a farmer a bounty hunter be your own man or woman or whatever ghoul dont give up yet 
---
Make fallout great again 
---
Oooooo That sounds like fun..
---
But, whenever I've killed whitespring bots, they don't drop anything.... It's odd.
---
Im curious how, while playing solo, suddenly 3 strangers I never met were on my team. Im also curious how you would know this.
---
I'd also like to see you explain here the differences between the colors yellow and gold.
---
stop being stupid.
---
Ive got a twoshot pipe 308 rifle that hardly hits vats unless theyre painfully close and ive waited a few seconds to shoot.
---
But considering how op twoshot weapons are i sorta dont mind
---
Wait until you're level 50, then do the Mayor quest in Watoga to get All Rise.
---
This exactly.  My Sledge makes much faster work of the green guys at Whitesprings, than my 2-shot combat rifle.  Oh well, I enjoy smashing them and saving the ammo anyway.
---
Well, **one** hardened/glowing/fluids **per mob**, not per player. So if there's 2, 3 or 4 in your group, the first person to loot it gets it. 
---
And like always, sometimes things don't show up. Last night, someone Nuked the Grafton area, so we loaded up and went there for some flora and what limited creatures there are. We got lots of flora, and the area that has a lot of scorched gave a lot of the stuff. But after a few minutes, checking the meat piles, I found stuff we had missed, or maybe it didn't show up immediately. So always double check corpses. 
---
And you get 9 whole rounds for it!
---
Yes I was in the Scorched Earth event and regardless it wouldn't have mattered because I was teamed up. It was seriously glitchy and I think that was the issue.
---
I once logged out at Whitesprings rail station.
---
Logged back in to find that someone had a slight miss and I was in the middle of a howling nuclear wasteland.  Luckily I was not overweight but it took me a few seconds to find a fast travel destination and when I arrived my health bar was 99% red.
---
Then I went off to change my underpants and have a shower.
---
Push through, its pretty easy to respec and unless your going for a min/max glass cannon build its tough to screw up your special. 
---
When you get into the high teens you start running into more mobs with higher armor values but probably dont have the perks yet for armor pierce so they feel pretty tanky. The hunting rifle punches through pretty good but most melee will bounce of higher armored mobs like super mutants without incisor.
---
Find a place where raider PA spawns and grab a few pieces, blackwater mine by whitesprings has one and there is another by the Top of the World. At lvl 15 I tripled my defense by farming a half repaired set of lvl 15 raider PA, and became way more survivable.
---
Once you hit 25 get the excavator set at the Garahan mining HQ in the SE corner of The Heap, kinda by the super tall towers you can go up into. You'll be able to carry more and last longer. The full set of excavator gives you +100 carry weight and you get more ores when mining.
---
Tldr: 15-25 feels like your weaker than mobs of the same level because their armor value went up, and ours without PA stayed the same. Get PA or spec/mod more into armor pierce.
---
I think the Swing Speed is calculated in, also check your perks.
---
I know with 2shot it is calced into the damage value
---
Maybe unstable isotope and charged?
---
I do not want to make fallout more like ark, as I‚Äôve never played and it would be untrue if I were to agree. (Going to look into it after this) If it is as you say then maybe, pick up some pointers on how to do it correctly. I would like fallout to become its own in that regard, and learn from other installments that have done this successfully. Thinking bigger than my post, i just think that there‚Äôs a lot of potential in what fo76 can deliver. That, and I like the universe. The opportunity has finally presented itself and I wanna push it in that direction. If I were Luke, this is the chance to take down the Death Star. 
---
I think you just got unlucky. I use a lever action rifle almost exclusively, and I get a wide variety of drops.
---
That's acceptable. Look at the bounty system on GTA. People could set bounties on everyone in the server, but they don't. I doubt people would commonly spend 25k caps for 25 random kills that they don't even get to watch. 
---
There are too many builds that make the game too easy.  Do yourself a favor and steer clear of them.  
---
Im not saying it was rude of you to kill them for the workshop, I‚Äôm just saying i don‚Äôt think its scummy to afk them. I understand they‚Äôre intended pvp zones however if there‚Äôs no pvp why shouldn‚Äôt i have the right to afk? I mean surely if its a big deal the game would kick me.
---
Yes I was thinking the same thing yesterday. I watched a video or a guy making fun of the the game and thinking to myself these issues are small and easily fixed or already fixed, they are not game breaking. Also alot of people issues seem to be with PC where different driver versions affect gameplay. Bethesda cannot make you update your drivers and if you didn't then running around with a graphic glitch might be your issue not theirs. 
---
For console (me) I just wish there was a way to report a bug in the game. I see items you can pickup in locations that float or mobs spawned under the world attacking a workshop making it impossible to defend. Those issues are problematic. For the most part the game is great and I just dont let the negative affect me or just done watch them. I tend to hit "NOT INTERESTED" on the youtube video to make others like them go away. 
---
You know how cute it is that you guys think people wouldn't kill your pets even if they showed up as docile?
---
Sure there is: [Willing Suspension Of Disbelief](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingSuspensionOfDisbelief) It's realistic because we choose to ignore the the parts that make no sense for sake of the narrative. 
---
Copy and paste of a...

Copy and paste from an older thread

Watoga has 4 potential power armor spawns very close together. Starting in the transit station there is a level 3 locked room with the chance for a spawn, the next one is on the roof of the emergency services building. The roof access is 2 floors above the elevator, stairs are to the right when entering the building, the armor would be on the right as you exit to the roof. Then across from there there are two buildings connected by a bridge with vertibirds crashes on each roof get up on the one on the left either by jumping across or by going down and using the fire escape to get up and cross the bridge to right hand building. The power armor spawns beside the vertibird. The last is is beside the vertibird that is crashed in the street, beside the AMS HQ. Watoga usually has a lot high level players and the armor may be already spawned at a higher level than what you‚Äôre wanting when you get there. 
---
u/daishi124 also commented that there there is another on the roof of Watoga high school if you take the stairs on the left once you enter but I have yet to check.
---
Is it the TS that nerfs the accuracy? I had a 1SE Gattling that could shoot the wings of a fly at 200m (57 accuracy) and greedily swapped it for a 2SE when offered (accuracy 27). Sometimes accuracy is achieved by volume now. 
---
I've a two shot exploding Gatling plasma. They are out there :) 
---
Just don't watch you tubers. Problem solved.
---
They had ample opportunity to mention discontent and conflict developing in the Vault, but stopped at passive aggressive lunchroom notes. It's a narrative fail.
---
I would say luck, been going in and out of servers for hours, best I‚Äôve gotten was the Metal Plans. 
---
I was thinking about that, but does the area effect damage it release when struck help a lot or not as much as you'd want it to?
---
This, RNG is still a factor even if it says a hard % chance.  Someone can still get lucky with RNG and consistently land within the 30% range multiple times since it isnt calculated against your total but just for each individual craft.
---
The thing that always kills the bounty system for me is anyone who has a high enough bounty to pursue always leave the server the moment you start going after them. Of about the 10 bounties I've ever tried to collect, I've only managed to get 2 because the others all hopped servers the moment they saw me coming for them.
---
Well, if a robot had programmed into its AI rules that it was to try and simulate human interaction as realistically as possibly, then it seems like it would purposely respond to charismatic traits with the same outcome as a human. If it didn't, then it would fail its attempt at simulation. The Free States bot and the Raider bots certainly appear to be programmed with an attempt at colloquial human interaction. The rest seem kind of vanilla, but maybe they just suck at simulation.
---
We could, I dunno... Nerf melee too.
---
So...getting a big bounty due to being a huge dick rewards them with frequent spawns and even legendary farming that comes straight to them?
---
I not only want to say no to this idea, I want to set it on fire and then throw it off a cliff, lock onto it with my missile launcher and shoot it and explode it with a barrage of missiles, and have it land amongst a pack of starving, crazed mole rats who rip it apart, consume it, who i then mini nuke, collect their bits, insert into Mama Dolce‚Äôs machine and turn into beef stew, which I then feed to lowbies who I then murder to get a massive bounty, just so I can confirm it isn‚Äôt in the game.
---
2) needs button on consoles too
---
Given that you emerge from the Vault with a SPECIAL of 1-1-1-1-1-1-1 and no meaningful skills, it wouldn't take much to surpass that knowledge.
---
Is there any information about how many copy sold for each platforms? Like PC, XBox and PS4 etc.
---
forget the death tambo.... i can't seem to reverse engineer how to fix a dam bicycle so i can ride around strafing scorched, drive by style...  i'd even spend atoms to have an animation to hold my gun sideways!
---
it's a rare glitch that I hope never fully gets patched out cause, mygod is it funny when your walking around, round a corner to see a player like this and instantly respond to the longboi/longgal like any hardened wastelander would, and reflexively shoot cause they look like a wendigo
---
No swing speed is not calculated in, and I believe you have the same all rise in both of your links or I'm dumb lol. Also the all rise has a unique  mod on it that will buff its damage to a comparable super sledge as it is unique to the weapon, add like 15% DAM.
---
Ah lol does it stagger atleast?
---
I thought I was pretty clear in the opening, the current damage perks i use i didn't go into detail in. I did highlight the ones i thought useful.
---
Nah he's just a duper, a bad one at that too lol
---
I had no idea explosive modifier also crippled the rate of fire. That sucks indeed :D
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Out of this whole rant the only thing that i have an issue with is the server and client crashes. I've been having fun with this game, why do icare what anyone else says.
---
There were a reported 800k copies sold, so take that into account. Not all are gonna be playing at the same time.
---
What issues are "small"? or "easily fixed"? or even "already fixed"?
---
Yeah, when they die it's a from a random table of loot as oppose to their own weapon they drop.
---
&gt;Are we in the ‚Äúthe lore justifies it guysh!‚Äù phase now?
---
I'm old enough to remember playing D and D and the worst player every time was the guy who would create a murderous jerk and then justify playing an asshole by saying, "That's just what my guy would do!" It's called My Guy Syndrome, it's such a thing. 
---
Explosive Fletchettes Harpoon Gun may as well be a shotgun, with infinite ammo.
---
I play on ps4. I get some empty games but nothing that low. 
---
So I understand what you are saying and absolutely would rather have stable servers if this implementation would cause service issues. But I don't know if it would truly be that complicated?
---
Vault 76 is stationary, so unless you or CAMP is closer to the upper left of the map those costs would be fairly stagnant, and I generally don't move my CAMP every session, so those could be calculated once.
---
At that point it just becomes implementing a few if statements regarding the lesser price between your location, Vault 76 (100% stationary), and your CAMP (mostly stationary, would be able to be calculated once and used to compare other figures). But obviously the c constantly changing locations is why it wouldn't with with the free travel granted by teammates.
---
I'm pretty OCD about scrapping and depositing all my junk before I log out, even if I need to pull some non-junk out of my stash to make room.
---
Then twisted muscles is all you really NEED other than speed demon and marsupial which are good for all builds.
---
&gt; Nukes can land everywhere outside the protected area around Vault 76
---
True.  Gives me an insane completist plan -- nuke every inch of the map that is nukable, starting in the top left and working down.
---
(Thanks to C. Stross for the original idea).
---
Maybe if they were able to actually add a karma system that people wouldnt be able to abuse we could have actual raiders that were perma pvp flagged for people that werent raiders.
---
R.I.P. Speech.
---
A very easy test is to get the Awareness perk from Perception. It displays the armor of the enemies dynamically. Empty handed a lvl 50 super mutant (forgot the name) had 150 DR and 150 ER. Equipping my Anti-armor Laser Gatling the enemy now has 75 DR and 150 ER. Equipping the Stabilized perk (50% less armor) the same enemy will now display 38 DR and 150 ER.
---
From this we draw 3 conclusion:
---
1. Anti-armor energy weapons have NO effect on damage at the moment.
---
2. Stabilized perk has NO effect on damage for Gatling lasers and plasma (accuracy is still greatly increased)
---
3. Anti-armor perks and weapon mods have a multiplicative effect  with each other. (worse than an additive effect, which would be OP) 
---
Side notes
---
1. The perk Gunsmith DOES work for energy weapons durability. 
---
2. ONLY shots that actually hit drain durability, you can confirm this easy by shooting nothing and seeing the results. Conversely, this does mean that a two-shot gatling DOES break twice as fast.
---
3. Mods that increase range, accuracy or damage LOWER maximum condition. A focused rifled gatling plasma has about 66% of the max condition of a non-upgraded version. 
---
4. Legendary mods appear to CONTRIBUTE TO THE PROBLEM from point 3. A legendary gun has less maximum condition than a non-legendary gun (assuming they have the same mods)
---
So a two-shot 200% condition Two-shot Gatling plasma breaks in about 3 cores, with gunsmith level 5 equipped... the true horror of the apocalypse.
---
Pssst... there is a mod that highlights corpses on Nexus 
---
The simulation is malfunctioning..
---
Sez the Buddha.
---
Often it matches, sometimes not ....
---
So you don't have an issue with duping and TSE and the lack of game balance?
---
Must be fun reading all those holotapes.
---
It breaks my heart, I loved to use Energy guns ever since the original Fallout.
---
Nah like this happened for weeks. It was definitely not just being unlucky
---
It's really exhausting when they have so many videos all saying the same thing. 
---
Then the one video complaining about how people are complaining about them dumping on the game.
---
It's like. You made 10 videos between two patches, and they are all the same. 
---
Or you took some post and turned it into a video as fast as you could. And then when it turns out the original source of the issue exaggerated or lied, it takes you over a week to come back and say, seems I was wrong.
---
And then get mad when people say, maybe you should investigate over repeating rumors? You know, because they want to be taken seriously as video game critics. 
---
I respect your reply. Hopefully we all find the middle ground and continue to strive in this post apocalyptic world in a way that is wonderfully tailored to our desires.
---
I have an infant and sometimes I have to log off very quickly lol
---
stay cool bro. i hope that bethesda  learned from this.
---
I got a sloth using YouTube for advice.  MOST creatures and animals are not tameable.  Only ones spawned from "random" encounters and spawning alone (so if there are two, it does not work either).  They slowly walk to your camp (even if it's on other side of map) and may die in the process.  Once there, they patrol your camp. I'd research a lot before attempting.  YouTube videos were my best resource.  I'd explain more now but I'm at work
---
I like this. Maybe even make them high end plans that require a couple flux to correspond to the amount of benefit they give. And if possible, make the plans also require the corresponding weight reduction perk be equipped in order to craft it. It makes so little sense that it's more weight efficient to store all food, chems, ammo, and junk on my person than in one of the tens of boxes I can have lying around my base.
---
Up north by Aarons farm theres a truck that had Two black cowboy hats
---
It was really cool, but it would break really quickly. Each shot was like what a missile launcher should be.
---
There is fall damage to enemies you fall on, it just has a limited radius, and you have to fall far enough for the stagger animation.  Explosive vents don't increase this damage, what they do is increase the radius of enemies you stagger from the 'Hammer Drop' it's just the 'flavor text' is misleading
---
That easter egg is adorable~ I def have to go check that out now.
---
I agree. I‚Äôm currently only using the Blade of Bastet, with Incisor, Gladiators, Sneak, and Ninja. I‚Äôm level 38 and not afraid of _anything_ (except SBQ). I‚Äôve accidentally made the game too easy for myself. Zero desire for TSE weapons. 
---
I have killed scorched by landing on their heads, but the targeting is kind of tricky. Most of the time I miss. (I don't have exploding vents)
---
Let‚Äôs not ignore the many issues his game has. I‚Äôve been playing this a lot lately and been disconnected dozens of times. Kicked from the world or straight up had to restart the game. 
---
The game has MASSIVE issues. 
---
Yeah there‚Äôs a hate train but the game is lacking. It can be a grindy mess.
---
It was a shit show of a launch with little said from Bethesda or any kind of... apology is the wrong word but there‚Äôs been no reassurance that they have big plans for us and the game. 
---
I think it‚Äôs good when farming groups and there‚Äôs other players there because if your in the middle of everything u basically get a hit on everything so get loot from them all if others get the kill
---
Like honestly all melee weapons should be usable in power armor. Even if it costs a lot of extra materials to craft a special new mod
---
Nope. Just does a little damage.
---
Yup. There's a few fairy tales in the wasteland. Some of them are nanny bots telling you stories and such. 
---
i spawned into one of those too (on xbox) last night....was a very nice flower picking + legendary farming experience
---
Well at least after 22 more levels you can actually shoot that terrible weapon.
---
And they can be so misunderstood. One of my teammates thumbed up a guy for a great PSN name and the idiot took it as he wanted to team up. Started taking our loot and crap, man we PVPed the heck out of him.
---
My first lever action was a 3* with 30% damage to bugs, 10 damage bonus while aiming and 90% weight reduction. 
---
It was also my favorite weapon by a large margin much like yours. 
---
Unfortunately I had focused my entire build around VATS and critical shot damage. Then realized VATS just seems unreliable a lot of times and gun damage seems weak later on against a lot of enemies. So I switched my build. Now my rifles are used a lot less frequently and I go with my powerfist and DC gauntlet more often after respeccing into unarmed. 
---
If I got a TSE rifle id probably go back to rifles as my main. 
---
Good luck on finding a Two shot Lever action. It's such a fun weapon to use. I cant wait for them to fix the reload. 
---
I've heard it's because the Texas studio is handling the game and their dev team has very little experience with the engine. We all know the engine is an archaic mess. Imagine being handed that and asked to make a game like Fallout 76. It's definitely BS, but I don't blame the dev team. I blame the executive and management teams.
---
If you're on xbox on sell serums for 200each. Quick and easy. No dying 
---
I do this somedays. Whip out my claws and slash some ghoulies. Good fun.
---
I know this but it is a lot easier this way. I have tried the penitentiary event and whenever I go there Duty Patrol never pops up. I don't know if it is a trigger or something that I am missing.
---
There needs to be more raider variants and decorations for camps. 
---
I‚Äôm confused. In the image next to some of the completed challenges it has symbols which I aren‚Äôt atom point symbols and are ones I do not recognise. They look like stacked paper and have the number ‚Äò1‚Äô next to all of them. They appear after the challenge ‚ÄòLevel up five more times‚Äô and continue on from there. Can anyone tell me what those symbols represent?
---
Well played, DOOMSHOX.
---
Not in my experience, no. I get very consistent crap across 5 characters, using vastly different weapons (fists, 2H melee, shotgun, rifle, heavy). My last 3 legendaries just minutes ago were a leather leg piece, a board and a pistol, and I was using a Handmade to kill these. 
---
RNG is RNG. It has no memory. Sometimes it streaks. Sometimes it doesn't. Like, I was farming mutations, got Adrenal Reaction three times in a row, popped RadAway each time (trying to get rid of other mutations) and it wiped off Adrenal Reaction (1 in 8 chance at the time) three times in a row. Odds of that happening are 1 in 512. I've also had cases where I would have 5 mutations, and need to get rid of just one. And I ended up clearing them all, because it cleaned the one I wanted dead last (even though it was the most recent acquired). 
---
RNG is random. Which means RNG is crap. Which is why any intelligent developer does not rely purely on RNG. Case in point, Diablo 3 and reforging. The Division and recalibrating station. Elder Scrolls Online and transmutation station. Etc., etc., etc. Hello, Bethesda? It's 2019. Wake the fuck up.
---
Happened to me once had major visual clipping in 1st person mode. Apparently you look out from your chest.
---
Hmm I'll get the charged one and test it out then
---
While I have needed to AFK in random spots when my kids need help or something it is hardly fair to complain if someone caps me. Those are the risks of AFK. 
---
Just make this great once will be good enough for me. 
---
Get rads when you eat but I have maxed out 
---
Well, I only use one weapon, and it's not happening to me, so you probably need to come up with another theory.
---
Part of me heavily approves of this message.
---
But part of me thinks immediately after working together to down a world boss that you weren't fighting over before is like, the only place I consider even slightly bad form to PvP.
---
Top of the World Vendors and Vendors belonging to Raiders faction.
---
I've got Concentrated Fire at max with and can (and do) miss more than three times right next to something. This is consistent. 
---
Believe me on this I have tried. That little Super mutant and his cow are harder to find than anything else I  have sought after.
---
Nah there‚Äôs some references from NV in 4, like I‚Äôll pass npc‚Äôs and hear them say ‚Äútwo in the keeps them dead. Most of the time.‚Äù Something along those lines
---
Never thought of green thumb, thank you
---
More what lol
---
It drops from Scorched - Melee, Scorched - Ranged, and Feral Ghouls after you complete the Rose Raider missions apparently, probably around Pleasant Valley
---
That's... Very different?

PS4

Various issues this weekend:
---
Quests were bugged last night - Did Power up Poseidon  for the first time and had two minutes left on timer, hacked the reactor room....and nothing. Couldn't get in and it didn't even tell me I failed the event, just acted like none had ever triggered. Highly annoying, but a nuke had dropped in White Springs, so I decided to salvage my time by going there to see what legendary drops I could get.
---
Ran into the legendaries not dropping anything besides one piece of armor. I even took out a 3 star alone and nothing besides junk.  
---
I then gave up, headed back to my camp where the Messenger event was happening and was curious if that event would work. I was able to put some core in it to get the robot moving then it just stopped moving.  I gave up and logged out as I didn't want to waste more time trying for events that wouldn't reward in the end.
---
Other issues, normal blue screens, I'm so used to them that I am resigned to them and it puts me one step closer to finding something else to play.
---
One last issue outside of the above...please fix rifle weights or give us perks that will negate that.
---
Someone has already posted what exactly the dev team needs to do to fix both this and scrapping molest teeth and bleached dogwood. 
---
ROFL! Take my upvote
---
I'm doing far better killing things with a banjo sword while in PA than with any other weapon. It's kinda bafflingly fun.
---
I prefer herbivore just cause its easy to maintain in my own camp.
---
Robo police......they'd need to play the Oblivion guard voice lines, and give the option to pay off your bounty and remove it, or your life is forfeit, turning them hostile and they'll take your caps if they kill you
---
I'd say its even less than that, maybe %40 tops. 
---
Yeah, even my favorite channel randomly craps on the game, and they did a typical ‚Äúrun around and goof off for a few hours, ignore quests and all tooltips, and then complain about all the bugs they ran into, then never try it again.‚Äù They never modded weapons, and fought level 18‚Äôs as level 5‚Äôs with unmodded pipe pistols, never tried to fix the bugs by relogging, all sorts of things. It was as if they just wanted to conform to the anti-hype, dismiss it for some easy thumbs up, and then move on to other games.
---
Sucks cause they‚Äôre fun and on point with other games. 
---
My brother in a nutshell. I had to teach him how to MMORG, he is so used to FO being on a single player game
---
u/boredpumpkin if you ever decide to come to ps4 you and your mum has a place among my group of 12 people all around level 200+ we can help out we have made a faction as well. we are called the g.o.t.h.s. (silly yet shortened) full name Guardians of the helpless survivors. we dedicated our services to help the low levels and every player that needs it we do run brotherhood of steel t-60 and ultracite power armor and weapons yet dont go by their codes we even have a full scale military base all decked with keypad doors and turrets and are scattered with outposts all over there are good people like him its just the matter of finding them
---
Assuming TSE don't get nerfed..
---
But I have a Mk19 with increased player damage for that eventuality. 
---
"They don't have to drop anything" and "You can literally drop weight" aren't contradictory? What? 
---
He said he had to drop stuff, it was you that suggested he could leave the server instead...
---
I'm simply pointing out that there are certain situations where fast travel won't be possible and leaving the server would be far from desirable. The time I got stuck in someone's camp it was a literal 2x1 metal box with no doors (there were a few through wall conduits so I'm assuming it was an unfinished generator shed) so I couldn't even picklock my way out. Pretty sure several workshops are worth more than one wall, and not being able to damage camp structures would have resulted in me losing the workshops.
---
I imagine the calculation would trigger when i click on the location and it displays the cost in fast travel ui
---
more liked a nuked frame  rate, amirite! /s
---
for real though, that was pretty epic to watch, great work!
---
Arms greater appeal is the dinosaurs not just the survival aspect if he wanted it to be more like ark we‚Äôd make death claws rideable, lol but o like your ideas especially the legendary weapons being banned from pvp but I don‚Äôt know how well received it would be.
---
I noticed something similar the other day. I got a 2\* Crossbow as a drop and all of a sudden every enemy was dropping crossbow bolts. I hadn't seen a crossbow bolt drop in forever, but the second I got that drop they were everywhere. Unfortunately no Robin Hood paraphernalia has dropped yet. 
---
What kind of virgin do I have to sacrifice for this kind of server stability?
---
I usually find him near Charleston Station or near Watoga. He always stays on the main roads.
---
I think it‚Äôs locked to your level. My excavator armour is lvl 45. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve done anything extra for it. 
---
You so fly right now!
---
Go to power armor station with a chassis in it and you'll be able to craft it
---
Welp, Bethesda shows it's competence once again.
---
Btw does Tank Killer suffer the same fate?
---
You trap me with a bunch of assholes for 25 years,  and you wonder why I want to murder them? 
---
It is. There‚Äôs some pretty good stories in them. Not the game‚Äôs fault you don‚Äôt like reading.
---
Might work better if you react on his comment in stead of the post ;)
---
-Don't forget super long loading screens no matter how good your pc and internet is.
---
-taking a base and getting DCed 2 seconds later.
---
-no endgame.
---
-poorly labeled store plans.
---
-and broken promises about graphics updates (oh wait, you said Todd Howard.)
---
Don't get me wrong. I am a huge fallout fan.  I love the franchise.  That is why there is so much hate.  This is the equivalent of Hollywood taking The James Bond films, casting 90 yr old Pee-Wee Herman as the lead and wondering why fans are outraged.  You will still love the series, you will still buy the blueray because you like saying you own every Bond film to date but it will piss you off when you catch a glimpse of the cover, even if it's in the 1$ movie bin at Wal-Mart.
---
Ah thanks for clearing that up for me
---
guass rifle is basicaliy the best weapon to use when you get to a point where hunting rifles   are no longer effective
---
This i love the game and the community. But jesus lets not forget all the issues we face even now. The youtubers should not be despised although i wish they would not put things like the bag nonsense and nuka cola issue in with the actual game.
---
Surely that‚Äôs backwards....
---
That's a good point. i didn't realize the defenses you put up didn't get stored after you left the server. I set up a pretty sweet system, had every point covered. Spent a good amount of resources building  all this. I figured it would get stored and I could use it on my camp next log in or another workshop. Was kind of upset when I realized it stays at the shop at the specific server. 
---
Oh well, that's how you learn I suppose.
---
What mods work on this? I can't seem to find any... Or is it unmodable?
---
It's almost mandatory for non PA users.
---
Tons of people.
---
None of my characters do. None of them are also shotgunners :D.
---
But no it's rather dumb to wait for damage perks that long unless you're using an explosive weapon.
---
If you don't like it, don't play ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Go back to FO4
---
Thought so... I had a 50 character that missed perks so i deleted that one and made a new one im currently at level 125 and still have not received them..
---
Fusion generators drop from the powering up events. The Guitar plans come from train station vendors.
---
After having mine taken before, I have no remorse. Gotta be mindful of your health before worrying about looting everything. 
---
I do tend to get killed pretty quick. Justice is swift.
---
Agreed.  I deleted a few things and realized the pet takes up more budget than you have available.  Richard had to go.
---
Or give us a separate limits, one for actual building, one for turrets.
---
Booo, haha it‚Äôs alright I get it. I would just see you as neutral, in this case. I‚Äôd probably opt for an interesting conversation, and if that doesn‚Äôt go well then I‚Äôll be out of your way. 
---
But for those willing to throw down, sometimes they don‚Äôt have anything at all. Sometimes they‚Äôre freakin loaded, and I will not even touch their stuff. 
---
Really depends on how I feel. It really ain‚Äôt black and white, there are different scenarios to play by. 
---
I always favoured the lever action. 
---
Too easy to avoid they should be targetable and not get the message to get out of the area lol
---
Ruins prices on everything
---
Well... we are getting faction PvP, that's for sure. I'm not sure how; but PvP sucks as it is now anyway.
---
Before launch, I had the impression that they would develop the factions much more. That they would have their own hubs, and every player from that faction would use that place to trade, prepare to go out... and that you could see which faction a player chose just by looking at their name (like some kind of symbol beside their tag). I was surprised, and disappointed, when I knew that you had to "join" every single faction to complete the main storyline.
---
I don't know. An online game without clans and without factions feels weird.
---
Not a Raider but - One can get tired of eating Preserved Instamash and a preserved un-radiated person from a Vault might be a very welcome change to the menu!
---
Oh, gross, I can't believe I typed that.
---
Mabye a .50 hunting rifle might do more damage, but doubtful. combat rifle is really the best ballistic sniper you will get. get the best reciver, silencer, and best scope. mabye try to farm for a two shot one if you want to go extreme.
---
All the PvP in this game feels like griefing to me. Ive never once been in an interaction where I didnt feel like a troll or like I was being trolled. I just want PvE servers at this point. If I want actual PvP with consequences or actual raiding ill go play one of the many hardcore shooter or suvival games I have where things like tactics, positioning, and team work matter and where there are consequences for messing up.
---
Or I could just level up and come back to itü§£ you do have a good idea but mines are not very common to me and I think I used all mine last time around 
---
It's the same problem Borderlands had. The game used procedurally generated guns, and there were 17.75 million of them in the game. Unfortunately, out of 17.75 million only about 200 were actually decent. So your odds of getting one of those was 200 out of 17,750,000. Good luck. 
---
Awesome! Planning on hosting on YouTube or somewhere else?
---
I found a instigating \ +40% power attack \ +1 str super sledge. It is pretty beast.
---
Yes! Or make it so no one else can get injured and it drops wherever the wanted guy is at second :01
---
 Defenses are to prevent other players from taking the workshop not enemy's.
---
And really its just to try to hurt them since the only people that really take over camps are people with hacked TSE weapons.
---
I wondered about the "Good with salt" perk working on that. But since you are at a chemist's bench, Chemist should work as well. 
---
I could have, but you could have just Googled. I wasn‚Äôt actually trying to be a smart ass, hence the wink, but provide useful information about the totality of the quest. Where it starts, what‚Äôs involved, rewards, etc. If I just said Watoga or Watoga Municipal Center, you might have more questions‚Äîrightfully so.  So downvote me all you want, but I stand by the fact that there are things you can look up yourself and should. 
---
This is good to know, but since I have terrible internet I actually notice a huge difference when they're both equipped. With just action boy/girl the bar fills incrementally, but with both that and lone wanderer the progression bars fill up in much larger increments almost twice as fast - but that's probable the stuttering bar I get because of my dodo internet. 
---
I think i once spawned in front of whitesprings in the midst of a nuke and suffered no rad damage
---
I did run inside quickly so maybe it was lag
---
Are you on Xbox?
---
Well they aren't even remotely close to outputting the insane dmg that melee can. They are pretty disgusting though. 
---
I used to watch a lot of them. Not anymore. Completely cut it out. 
---
Oh shit, yeah I‚Äôve got power smith on!
---
Dropping nuke on the queen now 11:43 
---
Best period is t51 b only by a very little, then x01. There is no mix matching for "best" you just lose when it comes to PA. BTW t60 is the cheapest to repair .. so theres that.
---
You should have bought it already, but it now.
---
Ive only murdered 3 people. But i will gladly pick up anyones junk if they decide to fall over.
---
Ok what!? You can have a pet?
---
I think that‚Äôs just a result of Bethesda‚Äôs many bugs.
---
I don't know, but if you can't then you can always bring an alt character to the scorchbeast fight
---
I‚Äôm inviting you for dinner over at the Bolton Greens, I‚Äôll have some folks set up the dining hall for us. Bring another human 
---
Those arent references though? Thats just the model for Super Stimpaks, of course nuke silos look the same they would all be built the same way, and its just Bethesdas bringing forward guns they added.  Content isnt actually a reference
---
Not really tho, the bounty hunter always has first shot advantage no matter what. Needs changed
---
Powering up Poseidon event. You may have to do it 3 times, but each time you get 1 of 3 of the larger generator plans. 
---
Acoustic plans from nearly any vendor. Random
---
Hate that about horde events. See the event, fast travel halfway across the map. When I get to the event start, it shows the horde is on the other side of the world. 
---
Two shot lever action sounds like it would be good for your build.
---
Even without the Todd my list is still longer than this game's content.
---
Haha true i meant to say that i dont even have the cards they dont exist for me :P
---
Exactly this! It just works for whatever you're dealt with. Plus its fun being able to go from sniper to wolverine simply by swapping weapon.
---
That I agree with. Rushing to the Mire for example you should expect anywhere from lvl 30+ but for example going to Top of the World at level 20 shouldn't result in every location being swarmed with lvl 68 even though some builds can survive that, like power armor melee or stealth sniper.
---
Maybe I shouldn't really exit the Forest or Toxic Valley at all before lvl 30, something to think about.
---
I once landed on a scorched and ended up taking its head clean off.
---
Problem is it remained standing after dying
---
I've got a legendary ski sword I enjoy while in PA... Without PA I stick to my modified Mole Miners Gauntlet.. Usually running mid to high 200 damage. 
---
The broken highways? I have been following other roads that go across the maps which probably explains why I haven't seen him.
---
Why rip? You can still get the perks
---
To be fair, 3 had a shitty story until you read the holotapes that actually explained what the world was like/what people were doing during it. 
---
I know people like to uphold 3 like it's some kind of a chalice of immortality but it had a shitty main story. The NPC's did fuck all to uphold that. 76 has a better main story than 3 contained in the holotapes. Ready to say that, ready to accept the downvotes. I'd much rather read about an organization forming after the war and struggling to maintain everything than 'LOL YOU GOT THE WATER READY YET? WHAT ABOUT THE WATER? HEY IS THAT WATER DONE YET?'
---
yea that too üòÇ, you should be able to craft mines though i cant remember what the recipe was
---
Yeah the rewards are:
---
Rare - Fancy Single Action Revolver or a Fancy Pump action shotgun
---
Common - Prewar money, gold watch, random trinket, and a random outfit  
---
My turrets scattered around helped me take down my first scorchbeast. In reality, they just provided needed distraction as they weren‚Äôt particularly effective but they definitely took the heat off enough for me to get in some good shots. 
---
I love this so much, but I think my FAVORITE part is the homage to Trogdor on Day 30!!
---
Explosive effect is just way too OP with Demolition Expert. If the perk didn't affect it, the weapons would be ok. Maybe nerf a bit on top of that.
---
With TSE Shotguns, you don't even have to shoot at the enemy. Just somewhere near it at the ground. If any gun can be a rocket launcher, just delete Fatmans and Missile Launchers. 
---
If it werent for the durability and reload speed, yeah. Its range is mental though. Long range sniper cannon.
---
Have you seen: 
---
Plans for the armor itself?
---
Plans for mods for the armor?
---
Mods for the armor?
---
All of the above?
---
pipe rifle maybe?
---
Good way to burn through all that .38 ammo
---
We haven't experienced that though?
---
In fact, that makes it make even more sense.
---
Maybe they just died of old age? Seriously though, this brakes the little immersion i have left. When i see this it makes me want to quit right away.
---
I am pretty sure there have been official statements saying that 76 is a spin-off, rather than another main-series entry.
---
that sucks dude. To clarfiy you do mean that you dont even see the cards when you go to apply a new level right? Because you can pick any card you want after level 50 wehn they are all unlocked, not just the cards you get from pack openings. But i assume at level 125 you know this, just making sure.  https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Fallout_76_perks is a good list of what level the cards should be available to you at.
---
Worth around 5k mate 
---
Very few of these posts make me say, "wow", verbally, out loud, IRL. This reaches the caliber of game developer "Branded Swag" that folks buy simply because it has the game logo, yet has fan-level content that gives you a real feel for the wasteland.
---
Great job and keep it going. BethSoft should consider collaborating with you to carry this forward. This is how Fallout 76 should feel.
---
It‚Äôs why you try to set it up early in a long session and only use the junk that is provided. I‚Äôve gotten some important plans from defending workshops though. 
---
Nah its all the dupers crashing the server, Beth would have raised the limits if they though the servers were stable, which they arent cause people are dupping. 
---
Shows how much good all of you did me on there. 
---
If you collect 760 wood you get 40 Atoms.
---
Wrong. I've actually experienced every single random event in the game because I'm a real gamer.
---
I bet you don't even know the lore behind "Leather Chest Piece": [https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/ad36u0/fo76\_isnt\_just\_buggy\_its\_also\_untested\_they\_have/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/ad36u0/fo76_isnt_just_buggy_its_also_untested_they_have/)
---
These spawn all the time near my base. It is incredibly annoying because they are nearly impossible to kill and they still ruin my base.
---
As someone who also would love to use my energy weapons, I fully agree and hope they are working on this because I have not seen this issue addressed. 
---
Even though we will never get one; I would love to hear an explanation as to how this was overlooked. Like was this just not noticed or did they think these guns were actually balanced? 
---
An entire class of weapons just riddled with issues. It's not like these issues are surfacing because of exploits or anything either. 
---
It blows my mind. Some of these weapons are considered iconic to the series, too. I mean the laser rifle is such a staple gun. How did they not see how under-powered it was? HOW? 
---
I am not sure if you are making a joke.
---
I asked if CAMPs were destroyed with nukes and you said yes. Then I asked whether my camp was scrapped or stored, and you answered NO (?). Finally I asked about making more powerful turrets and you said yes.
---
I am good with your first answer. The second is confusing, the answer is either scrap or storage. Your third answer could use a bit of elaboration, but otherwise is OK.
---
What system are you running? I'm playing this game on a barely in spec PC and have never had the infinite load, never had the 10min load. Have very few CTDs. Very few "game  breaking" bugs at all.
---
1 was constant CTD in a mission in Watoga, the other was the inability to load the virus holotape. 1 solved with dropping my Gfx to low, the other by dropping some of my holotape.
---
Now I don't have 300+ hours but am over 200. 
---
Even without Todd there is a lot of artificial content in your list and you must be a REALLY slow reader.
---
are you seriously bitching about having to read? 
---
Chemist unfortunately does not work with it...
---
sadly trash like you forget the other raiders in the shower, i will rape and pillage your camp all while being in stealth the entire time with my stealthboys
---
I do this after taking every workshop I can.
---
Removes the guilt. :) 
---
I would recommend Adrenal Reaction, Grounded, Scaly Skin and Twisted Muscles. 
---
Oh thats the camping grounds NW of the airport/ W of the lake side cabins. 
---
They have LOTS of building spots with existing construction and trails that go to all of them
---
Indeed, let‚Äôs not bicker.
---
That‚Äôs how I feel as well. Call me a psycho but I‚Äôll be out being nice and good and feel the butterflies in my stomach, spreading plans and good cheer throughout the land. Then night falls and I‚Äôm just trying to fuck around. Those specific servers seem to be the answer. 
---
I believe blocker purely reduces the melee damage you take. Its got nothing to do with blocking with a weapon. I tend to run through ghouls with a mr handy buzz blade, so it drastically reduces that damage.
---
I agree i can easily add more perks for damage, but its simply not needed right now. I'm already overkilling most things anyway.
---
i guess the same can be said about you being a bitch and crying  like some, regardless of how you spin it you are still one without a doubt 
---
I believe those are perk card packs as rewards.
---
because every perk is unlocked by level 50 if not his character is bugged out.
---
I think they are just starting to run out of ideas so they use the stuff Obsidian used to try and make it better, but yeah I think they were trying to sweep away new Vegas since it was arguably better
---
Oh I'm already at the point of putting it down. My only push is to hit 100 then I'm done.  
---
I really hope something substantial comes out this month otherwise I can see a decline in people playing due to hitting the "end game"
---
As another pointed out, there is a line between griefers and Raiders, one that I wish I caught before I made the post. 
---
It's a decision, not a technical limitation. The same problem exists with many quests in the game, including the main chain. For example, the DMV quest really has no checkpoints, and it's long, and boring, and I very often get disconnected doing it. And then it resets back to the beginning, and you have to start all over again.
---
By the same token, I've never been able to finish Tygart daily. It sends you to creamery first, then back to Tygart, then to 3 random locations in the world, then back to Tygart. Takes a while to do this, even with fast travel. And the game always crashes or disconnects near the end. One Sunday I wasted maybe 500 caps on travel and hours of my time trying to finish it, just once. Didn't manage it and gave up. Because there's not a single checkpoint.
---
Crap implementation of a crap design by a crap team.
---
This isn‚Äôt bingo where you connect through the free spot.
---
Youtube is all copy and paste especially when it comes to video games. There is hardly ever an original thought from any youtuber
---
I tried using vats with an auto pistol at almost point blank range, 95% the hole time, hit 3-4 shots out of my 10 round clip.
---
I'm usre it would be better with hip fire accuracy perks, but I never bothered.
---
What doesn't 95% even mean if that number is affected by stats after see it?
---
That's trash lol
---
There's a note in one of the BoS-related areas talking about a member who wanted out because he was a Ranger before and wanted to remain one. Also mentioned heading out West. 
---
Will give it a try thanks!
---
That's pretty situational then is it not?
---
Thats because it was not properly communicated to the players.
---
It took them, what, 2 Days to fix them.
---
It was not even worth a Hotfix in the eyes of Bethesda.
---
What can i say?...
---
Nice meme lol. 
---
Oh, shit.. this is r/FO76. My bad. 
---
FUCK THE NAYSAYERS!!!!!
---
Do I fit in?
---
But for real though, these posts are almost as bad as the cringy hate posts. Which if I‚Äôm being honest, I‚Äôve hardly seen any hate posts lately. They are no where near as bad as the first month. Yeah, it‚Äôs just an easy jab/meme to poke at now. Mostly everyone I follow has moved on though, OP should too. These posts are getting old all the same. I get it‚Äôs a [RANT], but you shouldn‚Äôt let outside sources fuck with you that much about *anything*. Either laugh with it, or just move the fuck on. 
---
It swings in one hand due to what I'd say is lazy design mostly, unarmed perks effect the melee weapons that power armour can't use like the mole miner gauntlet or the tambourine 
---
It'd be better to just remove the bounty system entirely. 
---
I'll look for one and see how it goes thanks!
---
Great idea thanks!
---
Yet
---
true that I also have some regen even I am using bloodied but in a SBQ fight my hp always lingers around half so it's still very strong
---
You tame a spider to eat the fly... 
---
It would be awesome if Porter Gage's armor came with the Thirst Zapper! 
---
I'd really love a "Tunnel Snakes Rule" jacket. 
---
Your not understanding. I am not enjoying the game because I need to farm for hours on my sniper to play the same content as any melee build can play with maybe 5min of farming. I am saying there needs to be an ammo balance so all builds can enjoy the game equally. So I don't cringe everytime I reload my weapons. His specific build is really OP but in general all melee builds have no overhead and do just as much or more damage then ranged builds without having to farm ammo. 
---
Thats awesome man wish i could put time in like that
---
I thought my two shot crossbow would finally be useful when I got the Prime Receiver plans from a SBQ drop. Still not enough damage (even with sneak attack etc. perks) to warrent carrying around.
---
at least when you drop excess stimpacks/drugs on the ground for someone else.... it looks legit ;)
---
Not everybody and not every piece iirc
---
I perhaps wasn't aware of the Fall damage already existing, but what about the other suggestion about squashing small enemies?
---
No I'm on PC :) Its just a personal thing. I'm at level 97 so it would just be a couple of WS runs.
---
Have you been using the crossbow? Or anyone around? Because you do get your crossbow bolts back sometimes as loot, same with the Harpoon Gun. In fact, with Harpoon Gun, you have infinite ammo if you use flechette mod (every corpse basically has 3-5 harpoons you can loot). 
---
Also, being raided in fallout isn't nearly as bad as in ark because of the reasons you mentioned. You won't lose your months of playing and be stuck naked on the beach again. 
---
I get a lot of good plans and some new friends when I teleport and defend a workshop.
---
It's funny when I see these dudes, straight faced as they can be, make stuff up out of thin air.
---
One guy was out here saying he was being personally attacked by Reddit, and then later on went to make a video saying that the previously announced Fallout 1, 2, and Tactics prize was some new thing as an "apology" to Fallout 76 buyers.
---
It's pure clickbait internet cancer.
---
The NCR didn't exist at the time 76 takes place. Could still be a reference tho.
---
I agree, person is not smart.
---
That will be 1800 atoms.
---
&gt; he a Legendary Wooden Arm with the Weightless legendary perk
---
Holy shit, if you are running a stealth build that is the ducks nuts.
---
Hmm, I'll have to try it out. I have a instigating grognak axe right now but I haven't used it. I wanna get a 3* one but so far no luck ;-;
---
How about a stronger debuff the higher your wanted rating? And it can‚Äôt be removed and sticks with you for a set amount of time regardless of server.  Th best would be if it attracted scorchbeasts that won‚Äôt leave you alone. 
---
Well it def won't work on players, and....hit detection/collision detection in the game can be a bit wonky.  If it 'damages' based on collision boxes then that'd cause it, as I've been 'body blocked' by enemies, but they'll just walk through me like I don't exist
---
I'll have to check mind you it could of been fixed by now I know in the beta it was pretty much useless annoyed me for my melee build. Yeah if you went rad build and kept yourself at 20% hp that could boost a few %. I get what you mean though I went fully maxed melee build and the only thing that requires more than 4 hits is a SQB and thats only annoying to fight as I have to wait for it to land. But yeah if you aren't going to sacrifice everything for one weapon class I could see it being a nice all rounder. Out of curiosity what are you hitting with your shotgun? Mine's sitting around 400 with no perks and can get it over a 1000 with adrenaline and the rest just wanted to know how much more itd go if i did just a build for shotguns.
---
High damage per shot: Gauss rifle
---
Rapid semi-auto: handmade rifle.
---
Hay I've just got a ski sword and moddes it with spikes, I'm only level 27 and it does some sweet damage to those scorched.
---
I got the one handed perk on so my damage is only at 67 or something like that but I just love it, looks cool with the spikes on 
---
From what I've read (a summary from someone who datamined stuff) it's just a random drop in the Toxic Valley area. It also has following notes on power armor plans (in general), 
---
&gt;Event: Distant Thunder (always awards one power armor-related plan), treasure map caches and Skill 3 locked toolboxes and toolchests (shares a leveled list with all other plans/recipes that can appear randomly, so chance of getting something specific is very low), Event: Battle Bot (exceedingly low chance, awards any loot that could appear in a "Large Toolbox" which itself has a slim chance to spawn a plan/recipe)
---
Regional spawns have a slim chance to appear in other regions
---
You can't afford $60?
---
Which is why I carry several and spend time farming repair components for them.
---
Try looking at Treetops. I run into them frequently around there.
---
Your version of the location hasn't synchronized with the server version. every time you load stuff in its from the known saved version on your hard drive and then its synced with what the server has changed, its why stuff appears/disappears while loading. 
---
i had an empty one that i couldn't put down inside my camp. Every time i tried to place it it would do the loading animation but then fade out immediately. I was finally able to place it once i walked out of my camp. 
---
Police scorchbeasts with lame loot! 
---
I consider all of your OP legendary guns to be crutches for tryhards and don't include them in my analysis at all, which is comparing non-legendary guns through the normal course of play.
---
You are  bitching about reading
---
Is it? Because it seems to do shit damage compared to a 308 or gauss. 
---
I had a similar issue with my PC freezing after 3-10min of game play following the last update. I tried everything---reinstalling fo76, replacing drivers, etc.  Turns out there was some sort conflict with my anti-malware software (malwarebytes) and fallout 76 causing the freeze.  Adding an exception/turning it off didn't seem to fix it but once I removed malwarebytes it completely it works fine now.  Hope this helps.
---
More than this I wish that we didn't do that stupid cylinder spin bullshit every time we drew a non pipe revolver as while it's cylinder spins you can't shoot, at that kinda defeats the point of have a side arm, when you make it slower to use than drawing another rifle
---
Do the Power Up events at the nuclear power plans. Poseidon is the easiest with Scorched levels 1 -6 normally. 
---
Upon completion of the even, you'll get plans for one of the following generators you do not know: Large Generator, Wind Turbine, or Fusion Generator. Make sure you learn the plans after you are awarded it so it doesn't give you plans you already have.
---
Since it's random you could get it on the 1st time, or the 3rd time.
---
Guitar plans are random rewards for claiming and defending workshops, or sold at vendors as "Acoustic Instruments" for about 900 caps (depending on your charisma/Hard Bargain perk/Grape Mentants)
---
It's happened to me multiple times - including at least once with a legendary enemy!
---
Another bethesda shill has outed themselves on this sub.
---
Are GR plans level locked? I haven't found anyone selling them yet. How much are you wanting for them?
---
You‚Äôre invited for a candle lit dinner over at the Bolton Greens. Dinner hall, wear something fancy (or nothing at all, whatever floats your boat). I‚Äôll have the Handys prepare something special for your first time. We have a Dweller that‚Äôs never done chems or alcohol in her life, super athletic and a bit plump. Bit of an attitude but nothing a little marinade can‚Äôt fix. 
---
Gonna take some time to prep though, all the plates and centerpieces seem to have been misplaced. Damn scorched always brooding around messing shit up. 
---
Yep. But it looks cool so a double action would make it better
---
&gt; Then I did a Yao Guai, huge mistake.  He spends his whole day running  around the camp growling and generally acting pissed off.  I've got to  get rid of him and that's the problem, I can't.  I've had friends kill  him and he just comes back when I reload the game.  I've had mobs kill  him and same thing. 
---
Tame a sloth and have some one kill it? [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/adfimj/please\_bethesda\_please\_show\_when\_a\_pet\_is\_docile/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/adfimj/please_bethesda_please_show_when_a_pet_is_docile/)

Not Plans for crafting the armor, but Plans for mods, and mods. 
---
2. If your camp move, you will find a blue print of all connecting parts to place,
---
3. Better machine turrets, missile, and lasser available with certain perks like home deffence 
---
Now that‚Äôs just evil. I like you.
---
It's been pretty amazing for taking down scorchbeasts. I don't even run from them anymore.
---
I have to be careful when I'm using them around a rushing mob, though... I may have accidentally killed myself a few times :D
---
It's great for the SBQ too, except that the legendary health bug means that my TSE ends up breaking shortly after her health refills, and I have to rely on my shitty weapons :(
---
I use an instigating sledge hammer during normal junk farm to one-shot enemies and the bloodied super sledge for SBQ. I have having two melee weapons for different purposes is quite good
---
Not really. I barely notice the damage. 
---
I think that one of the reasons for hate is people who made Fallout videos in the past do not have the kind of community built up to make a good Fallout 76 video because the best ones have the community in them. And because it is so easy to bag on something other people have and get clicks by the hundreds, why would you actually play the game and have some constructive criticism? (Although F76 does deserve criticism, obviously there are many of us that love to play it.)
---
I play on console cause keyboard/mouse really hurts my old ass carpel tunnel hands after an hour. So no mods for me but thanks for the heads up!
---
&gt; It's a decision, not a technical limitation.
---
Man, that's even worse if it was a decision. My thought is they couldn't figure out how to do quests on a timer. 
---
Thanks üëç

Artificial content.. like "Leather Chest Piece"?

I think they need a balloon attached, sometimes finding that bag is more trouble than it is worth.
---
Because we are all introverts
---
Had an established tribe on a server. Had been on there for months. The alphas, by tribe and a couple other kept the server friendlier. Cross ark transfers happen and with them duplicating Dino's and items. Lost the server 2 days after that was implemented. Haven't been back since. 
---
Seeing your character makes me want to pick the game up again! 
---
I gained a level (93 to 94) when completing the Site Charlie quest and "I am Become Death" at the same time. I did not choose a Perk Card nor did I respec a stat, I left it alone.
---
I launched the nuke from Site Charlie to Fissure Site Prime and gained another level (from 94 to 95) from killing enemies. When proceeding to properly level up, only the Perk Pack and the "choose one" option from reaching level 95 existed and not the one from reaching level 94.
---
tl;dr Leveled up twice but gained the benefit of one level up instead of 2.
---
Got it. Thanks üëç
---
For them or From them?  
---
Also it's wheel barrow\*. It's not a barrel. 
---
I think we should get revolvers other than pipe ones that don't use .44 but guess not
---
5000 5mm is about two minutes of unbuffed minigun combat, max.
---
Need new link, the one here has expired
---
We‚Äôll see. Maybe this could go up and they will see it
---
They could all be sneaking, or maybe shitty internet
---
All the time. My favorite was in Watoga. One of those robot spawning pods started making a racket. I turned to look at it and then a protection took one step out and plopped straight down on his face.
---
Ive seen legendaries disappear as someone else was looting at the same time as me, so I feel it effects more than just the normal drops. 
---
Surely that is a mistake that will be updated in a patch... seriously...
---
I saw it once at Welch and once at R&amp;G. I believe they weee 900+ caps. 
---
I was short, so I never got it. 
---
I think this is a great idea. 
---
I'd also like to see the return of the following. Mounted trophies. If you go up to the hunting lodge in the Toxic Valley, you'll see all the mounted creature trophies there. 
---
Let us craft those! 
---
Same with weapon and armor display racks! Let us make those! And then use them! 
---
This is awesome. 
---
Now only explosive affect the auto launcher I think and the Tesla rifle is rifleman
---
I'm an idiot. I stood at that little broken area at the top going "Okay, where is he. must have glitched" and fast travelled out
---
The Vertibot at munitions factory actually put in work against the scorchbeast that attacked me
---
I've bean meaning to ask, unless doing a stealth build, why would anyone rather walk around with their mushy body exposed rather than in a cool looking m, resistant suit of PA. 
---
Actual question, what are you guys' reasons?
---
point me to your jet dealer, you've got the good stuff. (RIP Jet)
---
My feelings mod got scrapped because I used the cooking station to make a bowl of pea soup.

---
Using the Crossbow?!? You're joking right? Seriously though...I play solo 95% of the time and I used it exactly once for about 30 seconds.
---
Exactly, I've tried to land on ghouls and the two just slide next to each other like if I was covered in butter or land right through them
---
I meant us as in me and my friend. Together we have hardly any plans at all.
---
But yeah, hopefully they can get the duping under control.
---
Lots of ppl on my servers... very few douches too.
---
Issa shitty attempt at a meme
---
Yeah, I've wondered about that. But then at the same time, all of use will get legendaries, and they are all different. So not sure what's going on with this particular aspect. 
---
Most of the people left with an imagination are in this reddit I think. The rest need their gaming fed to them with paste and a little spoon.
---
True that the NCR didn't exist yet, but the [Desert Rangers](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Desert_Rangers) have been around since the Great War. 
---
lol i have a friend nearby to take the bounty off of me, its like paying my buddies to wreak havoc. I love it or I can just look at their map to know where people think they are ambushing me and having them hide their dots so we can ambush
---
im using my X01 with T60 legs 
---
dmg res is 450, energy and rad res around 430 each  
---
The reason is same like you, I have calibrated shocks for T60 legs  and a jetpack for x01  
---
Though Legs always brake first so its actually a nice plus to be able to repair them so cheap  
---
I dont mind the little bit of resistance im loosing out on
---
If your turrets open up on me for no reason you‚Äôre getting an orbital strike.
---
If you wait until you're closer to a level 50 to complete Rose's quests at Top of the World... She'll give you a nice high level legendary ski sword called "Black Diamond".. With mods it will get you 200+ damage 
---
Raiders gotta eat...corpses...

---
I also came across a [veterinarian with a bunch of cats following it.](https://i.imgur.com/dXFEqm2.gifv)
---
I found the Psychobuff recipe. A server crash was inevitable. I've got like 500 odd...
---
I've just chalked it up to another bug and carry on regardless. 
---
The game is too much fun to get too annoyed, except for the huge step up in disconnects since Christmas
---
I'm so bored nuking white springs. I hope a patch comes out to make other spots better. They billed it as each area would be full of unique stuff but so far it's a little meh. 
---
It's nice to see people have fun instead of three different people all picking whitesprings at once (yes that once happened)
---
Grahm is human, so are all the scorched. Hell Rose may have actually been a human at one point.
---
so my best friend just bought an nvidia 2080 on an i7, internets bla bla bla
---
at that point it is not about power, shit game engine is shit game engine; 
---
he still gets choppy parts
---
the braindead bathesda shill was just reading from the script. even bethesda's shills don't have dialogue options.
---
Streamers and tubers are cancer. Period. 
---
76 wasnt released in a bad state, its a bad game. Sorry, but they dropped the ball. This is the first fallout game I wont be purchasing, and im one hell of a fallout fanboy. 
---
Comparing 76 to NMS really doesnt help, apples / oranges. NMS was essentially a lie on release, published by an indie studio. 76 comes from a known developer and a solid franchise that has been here for decades. Just my viewpoint, but id say the salt is a different flavor between the two. 
---
At this point, for me, 76 is another Fallout Tactics. I hope they didnt kill the series with it, and I hope the next venture will be focused on core concepts responsible for the success of the series, and not what 76 tried to do. 
---
Naw. I don‚Äôt watch YouTube BS. I also don‚Äôt care about bugs as much. The gameplay just sucks. 
---
Me and my wife are huge fallout fans. Enough so that I bought the PE edition and bought her a second copy + a headset so we could play together.  
---
Neither of us liked it. It‚Äôs so empty. Not putting NPCs, from a story perspective seems like s good idea, but in practice it‚Äôs fucking horrible. And the servers do not have a high enough population cap to make it useful. It‚Äôs pretty easy to go days without seeing anyone else unless you specifically walk towards someone. 
---
It‚Äôs pretty much a single player that‚Äôs empty and devoid of life. The quests are uninteresting and there isn‚Äôt much incentive to explore. No real chance of finding fun or good loot. Oh cool, got a high level legendary item? Can‚Äôt store it because it takes up to much precious space. I get the item cap and why it‚Äôs needed, but it doesn‚Äôt work in a fallout game. Not after we‚Äôve been conditioned for the last 9 years to be hoarders after playing 3, Vegas and 4 multiple times and through multiple play throughs. 
---
I really wanted to like it because I love fallout and I liked ESO when it came out following Oblivion and Skyrim, but this game was half assed with little to no relevant follow up. Unfortunately it‚Äôs pretty obvious the game is already dying hard. 
---
Well its a matter of degree though. In Fallout 4 for example sure your settlement could be raided by raiders... who were not all in power armor with two shot explosive weapons and destroying everything in your base in a matter of like 10 seconds. If that had EVER EXISTED in any Fallout game people would have freaked out and I guarentee it would have been modded out of the game and maybe even patched out of the game (being Bethesda I wouldnt count on it).
---
So if we are on the realism Fallout lore train, heres one for you. As a raider in this game you should only mostly wear raider, leather, and metal armor. If you do happen to wear PA make sure its the Power Armor version. Your weapons should be mid-grade at best. You shouldnt be in a shiny suit of X01 nor should you be wearing some silly hat and a red dress. Thats just the beginning of "lore" in terms of how things would be if things were aligned with lore.
---
Your house wherever it is should not be decorated with a bunch of kitchy vault tec stuff, it should be rustic, basic, barely concealing you from the elements. Theres many places in game where you can build a camp in raiderish places and really live this lifestyle.
---
Now if someone was doing that, I would respect that. I would go "OK... this person is really being a raider". As it stands I have "tommy12XXXXX" in his tricentenniel x01 power armor blasting me from 100 meters away with two shot explosive weapons and its just a one-shot fest back and forth until one of us gets bored and leaves.
---
I‚Äôd say keep that in like a special server or something, some of us are just tame casual players looking for a GOOD way to spend our time. 
---
There are chem benches in the Artisan shop in the whitesprings and in the med bay @ the enclave bunker, bunker doesnt have a stash container though.
---
Jet was invented in New Reno far further in the future than 76 took place in so....yeah
---
And 3's story sucked compacted shit through a straw. It blew. It was embarrassingly bad. 76's isn't great, but I don't feel like I'm being strewn across the wasteland like  post-apocalyptic Brita man.  
---
I suck at building camps. I have a one-room shack near a small super mutant encampment. 
---
Was Bethesda even back from the holidays when the Nukes broke? Getting people to come back to work during a scheduled vacation is damn near impossible; regardless of what might be happening with a product. I thought they were off for another week or so...
---
2 days also isn't that long. Legitimate MMO's let shit go on for longer than that in some cases.
---
You would steal a friends stuff? Found the guy I'll never play with lol
---
It does sometimes, but I‚Äôve also had it stop shooting, or continue flying upward until it and the scorchbeasts reach the sky limit, then get wrecked. It seems that a scorchbeast can attack a flying enemy at the same level as it, while a vertibot requires the enemy to be below. Once that sky limit is reached they just kinda sit there, not to mention keeping the SB well out of range of any guns. 
---
Doesn't work like that, you wouldn't see Starched Genes until you leveled to 30.
---
Actually 
---
I think it‚Äôs both. When you take over an unowned workshop, it tells the cost, and the warning that attacks pve and pvp can occur.
---
After it‚Äôs done raising the flag, the pve waves you get are NPCs.  It‚Äôs after you get reward that pvp can occur. If other folks want the workshop resources, those who own them  must defend.
---
I‚Äôm only saying this because I see folks who capture multiple workshops then cry foul when it‚Äôs taken over by someone else, when they‚Äôre not around to defend.
---
That sounds awesome tho lol somebody just starts their own battle royale
---
Will be on my discord and one other location haven't decided yet.  
---
My Discord is for pc users of fallout 76 so if you play on pc i can send you an invite. otherwise this weekend I'll send you the link to the 2nd location.  
---
You are one of the most hurt players I have met. So you have not scrapped your feelings, you have a broken heart because of a videogame.
---
The wise Mothman has blessed you child bear his gifts to the path of illumination he gives dark warnings you would do good to heed them.
---
The nuke wasn't fixed by the time the first videos about it came out. hell, i tried to launch a nuke friday and couldn't. the first nuke i saw this week was yesterday, i had given up by then two people launched nukes on the same server yesterday. so i got a nice farm out of white springs and a 10 minute queen battle that yielded me a pretty decent armor piece
---
Real gamers are sad pedantic illiterate fucks per you
---
Glad I‚Äôm not 
---
Oof, i logged out on some random place and when i got back i was nuked and died instantly with no way to get my stuff back 
---
Well It's a Mutant's with +33% Vats chance if I remember correctly (at work now) if you have any interest in it I'll sell it to you cheap.
---
I take my gaming in holotapes thanks.
---
Well, reading is hard with that hard-on for complaining. So distracting. 
---
Maybe the ghouls BoS members 
---
There's a hate train, because Bethesda set out a hate railway
---
Sweet, I'll definitely want to get that.
---
I've got one quest off her and it's to mod her syringe gun is that the quest you mean? 
---
I'm amazed you had any time to play the game with quality work like this every day. Nice work!
---
According to my pip boy its only been one day though... :D
---
I almost did a few times
---
Combat Rifle has half the damage of a Leaver Action but it has 20 bullets and you can shoot them as fast as you can pull the trigger. So i say it wins by DPS.
---
Same. I now watch Marvel HQ and the kid shows while I work lol. Much more soothing.
---
I have found the plans for light metal legs in this location three times after server hopping numerously! Have yet to find the plans for light metal arms...üòû
---
Nah, but thank you!
---
Reading this right after having stuck scorched at a junk yard keeping me from defending (same as day one) and then having the server crash about 20min later (day one) still going to play but this game has had major/minor issues that can kill the enjoyment and have been there the whole time. (Ps4 pro)
---
Why not just change the mods to not able to be scrapped.. 
---
Hot fix, wouldn't be out of place in mmo of this scale for something like to happen over maybe 12h of down time 
---
You mean you don't see them? Like you bumper over to Str perks only and it is not there?   
---
that is a strange issue and I have not seen it on any of my lvl 50+ characters, not sure what would have caused that for you. 
---
That‚Äôs exactly why I thought if this. I was thinking, ‚Äúwhat is the point of one handed melee when I can just pick up a spear and double the damage?‚Äù
---
I found that VATS need to be initilized before you charge the gauss rifle.
---
Same for crit. You need to activate crit before charging.
---
Some guns seem bugged however...
---
Should be online in the next hour or so
---
I went up to The Toxic Valley in my 20s and did pretty good there, until i hit 25 and decided to do the excavator quest. After that i ended up finishing up the responder questline i was on and then the Firebreathers, then up to top of the world. 
---
It really is empty. Other than revisiting places to see what items RNG has placed for you to pick up, it's just farming Golf Club for Legendaries or killing SBQ. One-shotting every mob gets really boring fast.
---
There we go! Now I agree with that. 
---
As someone who is both a diehard Fallout fan and who spent a few years in the trenches of FFXIV (healer lyfe yo), it delights me to no end to see you doing this. 
---
I can confirm that it does have some effect, but I also use a Cryolator as well, that really has an effect. Freezes her butt but good.
---
I find doing missions fun. But I'm out if missions aside from the super repetitive events. I haven't played for over a week now. Pretty much waiting for new content.
---
Better yet, no loot, no experience, and they explode immediately when the wanted player gets near then
---
Handmade rifle is good. Works really well with Tank Killer because you get so many staggers with spam-fire that melee enemies rarely get a swipe at you. You could go with a two-shot, but I prefer anti-armor (with drum) or quad (with perforating) because they have far more accurate hip-fire.
---
The wasteland shall provide.
---
for newer pet owners, if you have your pet get lucky enough to arrive at camp.... well you can then pacify them to make sure they don't get into combat with the animal friend or ww. Doesnt show up as red to my friends after that unless they attack/destroy camp
---
I generally wait until people aren't around then if they're near the top of the world with their camp set up there? I obliterate it. Rose don't want no competition, you feel me? 
---
Try [this](https://store.steampowered.com/app/552620/ATOM_RPG_Postapocalyptic_indie_game/) instead. It has native linux support and is an excellent "Fallout 3". :)
---
How'd you get workers disability? Drowning in Todd Howard's cum?
---
I was watching my brother play and he had a dead scorchbeast that would travel with him anywhere he fast traveled. It would just drop from like 30 ft up every time.
---
I‚Äôve been watching kurzgesagt. Lots of space stuff. I love space.
---
You should be able to use Old World Money at that restaurant. And all the shops there as well. The Nuka-Cola cap promotion was on top of the regular way of purchasing.
---
You can go ahead and complete that one, and then there will be a few more to do before she gives you the ski sword. I waited until I was 50 before I finised just for that purpose of the higher level sword. 
---
I thought this title was a mispelling of lone wolves. 
---
I was pleasantly surprised. 
---
Didn't you do that by buying the game at launch?
---
/r/patientgamers/ would encourage you to stop buying into hype.
---
Now that is just evil....I like it
---
I agree w you about the notes. Sometimes the font used is obnoxiously illegible. I appreciated the system Red Dead Redemption 2 used, adding a "Read" option that displays flavor text into a modern, legible font
---
Well best way to upgrade is to find a two shot, or furious, maybe with explosive. Then mod the hell of it
---
I have a great video of my first interaction with one that I'm going to post when I get home tonight.
---
My spaghetti boi was legendary so I wanted him dead. I figured explosives would hurt him, so I shot my bunker buster at my feet and it worked, but I only had a couple misses, so I had to run to a workbench, hop out of my power armor, spam a bunch of stims, then make a bunch of misses as fast as I could and hop back in my power armor.
---
Then I just took a few steps away and jumped and shot a rocket beneath me a few times. Dead doggo.
---
2/10 do not want to see spaghetti boi again.
---
the come back when you relog as long as you didnt max out your budget. King has died and come back 3 times now
---
Can't get stuck of you're busy jumping 15 ft in the air everywhere you go.
---
I'd be curious to know this as well!
---
Sweet, I'll get this one finished and then wait till I'm a higher level and complete the others.
---
Thanks +kamra
---
I wish there was a train track and on that train track was a train and on that train was a plaque and on that plaque was the words "Hate Train". The "Hate Train" would take a wide loop around the map and be a great alternative to fast travel and safer than on foot. Nothing could detail the "Hate Train" not even a nuke.

fake gamer: "your list is artificially long!"
---
fake gamer: "you're a slow reader"
---
me a real gamer: "actually I've read everything and completed every single random quest"
---
fake gamer: "i dont actually have anything to write to refute or counter anything you've said because i'm not even a real gamer! that other subreddit is terrible!"
---
Yes, iirc it has level 35 and 45 versions, but you can't 'upgrade' the level after construction.  Only two or three items have the ability to be leveled up after making them and they are tied to the Order of Mysteries quest line
---
Doubt.
---
I was under the impression that it was a high level problem, which makes sense considering the bug that makes the handmade plan almost unavailable after level 44.
---
misinformation, they only stay at your camp
---
I had a unsimilar adventure not far from there with a mean 65 Assaultatron, I got stuck in some cargo containers where I was able to get some random pot shots off with my Naval cannon, but only had 6 cannon balls.  He was shooting like nuts but from where I was sitting he could not get me.  Until I ran out of ammo on all my guns and went in to finish him (I thought) with a sledge.  
---
This is amazing wow great work! I would absolutely buy this. 
---
I'm usually on every day, even for a couple of hours during the week. Lvl 103 +/-. I would be able to help ya out, hit me up when ya get a chance.

Unarmed only gets one damage perk, 20% for 3 points, versus gladiator/slugger having 3 perks, 60% for 9 points. However, with martial arts, blocker, and incisor already taking 9 points, it's not like you can reasonably spend 9 points in damage perks anyway. So you'd probably take 1 point each of gladiator/slugger, expert g/s, and master g/s, for 30% for 3 points. So, that's a bonus for 1 handed/2 handed. However, unarmed benefits from twisted muscles and talons, while one/two handed only gets twisted muscles. Talons is an extra 25%, plus bleed damage. 
---
Conclusion: two handed is probably pretty good. Unarmed is too. Only downside of unarmed is no power armor, so in blast zone you are pretty much forced into wearing a paper hazmat suit.
---
I would be mad ***too*** if I couldn't afford $60.
---
Server hopping wasn't effective at all. It seemed like when I was trying to actively look for pieces I couldn't find any. However when I would just travel to Harper's ferry randomly I would find recipes and plans. I got the marine legs (or arms) can't remember and wetsuit from Harper's ferry .
---
I love how even this subreddit gets so annoyed at posts like this. 
---
For every 5000 hate posts you have 1 post like this talking about how people are overreacting (and they objectively are overreacting) and suddenly everyone comes to complain.
---
fuck off bethesda cock smoker
---
fusion cores are located around the map and are fairly easy to find the main issue with them is they are heavy
---
so either a player left them there to help a new player or they dropped them as they were over encumbered
---
Yeah I run into once a week usually it‚Äôs always near a main road.
---
That's pretty awful tbh. Maybe it's good for scoped rifle but not for sniping. 
---
I don't know why anyone gives a shit what some guy on YouTube thinks of a game. Your friends? Sure. But some guy on YouTube? No. This is one of the first things that has made me feel old and out of touch with people younger than me. I'm 33 and I swear that 4-5 years ago this wasn't even kind of a thing.
---
My buddy and I got practically all the mutations on our Melee builds and run Stranger in Numbers, and Class Freak which make us pretty godly. It's super fun to play Monster Mash with people since they can't keep up with us, and we can jump floors when in tight situations. I do feel bad about playing against normies, but I am generally just farming candy (and exp) and they show up in the middle of the first or second round, so I don't want to change my play style.
---
If you haven't spent 8 minutes search-gridding the grass for a dead super mutant you were *sure* had the sweet loot, only to find it carrying 2 caps, a legendary exterminator's spatula and some syringer ammo, you haven't played Fallout.
---
OP, first of all, damn!  Why so aggressive with the PSA.  We already know, chief!  But I have been pushing this idea on here since day 1 so I am totally in your corner.
---
In regards to people saying, "No point in being a raider.  There's no incentive.  Oooh, let's trash a CAMP.  It's like kicking a kid's sand castle over." 
---
Well, if you have fun kicking sand castles over, mission accomplished.  A raider's life for you and all that!  But there will be people who enjoy stopping people from kicking over sand castles as there are people that like helping kids rebuild these castles.  The circle is complete and we all had fun.
---
Works for me
---
Screw the haters. I still love this game, despite its Bethesda expected flaws. My only complaint is I can't seem to get the damn plans for the Handmade... @_@
---
That‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôm considering, mostly because I have 2x calibrated on my 60 legs (and excavator) but having a beast of a time finding the others 
---
Definitely sounds like somebody left them there... But either way fusion cores are that rare. Whenever you find PA frame in the wild it has one, they're plenty of fusion generators you'll run into while questing, sentry bots drop them and you can get them certain workshops.
---
Yeah this happened to me last night. two guys entered my camp, once did in front of me chatting me up all friendly like while the other one started circle strafing me so when I return fire I hit the guy that was first talking to me. Bizarre that people would think up a scam and gain enjoyment from that rather than just playing the damn game.
---
PREACH. 76 ROCKS
---
Never worked for my SnallyGaster. :(
---
You have to be lvl 35 and have science 1 to make them I believe. 5 caps and its all yours!
---
Wouldn't it be nice if we were older
---
Then we wouldn't have to wait so long?
---
And wouldn't it be nice to live together
---
In the kind of world where we belong?
---
You know it's gonna make it that much better
---
When we can say goodnight and stay together
---
Wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up
---
In the morning when the day is new?
---
And after having spent the day together
---
Hold each other close the whole night through?
---
Happy times together we've been spending
---
I wish that every kiss was never ending
---
Oh, wouldn't it be nice?
---
Maybe if we think and wish and hope and pray
---
It might come true (run run ooo)
---
Baby, then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do
---
We could‚Ä¶ 
---
I haven't even done the quest and I'm like level 100 or so. . Ihate quests lol.  I like sandbox.  More sandbox content would be nice though.   More base-like structures I could put down and some kind of faction control content would be nice additions.
---
I'm running only carnivore because everything else doesnt seem worth it to me. 
---
When I talk to my friends that never played fallout 76 they immediately hate on it because some meme page post about it
---
Yeah like my strength is at 12 and it does not show up since i want to invest my last points in that card, But its not there...
---
They are pretty common. I dumped a few last night just to make space in my stash. As said they are heavy and I'm not a big PA user right now 
---
If you play stealthy sniper then you could be right.
---
Logged in to check. Yes, it affects both Gatling plasmas and Gatling lasers. Seems to reduce each material requirement by 1-3.
---
For the water part go to camp mclintock. The overseers stash should have plans for a industrial water purifier. You just need to be near a water source, and you can get more purified water than you need.
---
You‚Äôre 10 ply bud. 
---
You found a TSE Harpoon? Do you still have it? I'll buy the crap out of it!
---
I have a heavy weapons builds and VATs rifle build, lvs. 164 and 91 respectively.
---
Promise I won't let it get in the hands of scumbag dupers :P
---
I'm sorry, but no raider would go around shooting up people's shit without some profit to be made. The griefers in this game just blow up your camp and log out, effectively making them waste precious resources without any kind of profit. On the contrary, they're now worth a bounty to everybody else.  
---
Griefers are not raiders, they're just morons.
---
Yeah, that sometimes I guess wasn't my time, darn
---
You are? How is that going? Todd seems like a nice guy. I hope he treats you well.
---
It's because there's 12 people out of 24 have the equivalent of 8 servers worth of items... 
---
If ur in danger maybe u shouldnt be able to sign out like fast travel, that way if ppl are fighting u cant just sign out, if u dont wanna fight u gotta run
---
No it isn't, just has the MIRV mod and 90% reduced weight.
---
Yeah, I'm going to server hop for the plans in the world, not the vendor.
---
Here's hoping!
---
I love marsupial and speed demon. Being able to jump away from mobs (or jump on top of something) is so useful.
---
Haha I swear it‚Äôs just the way I talk I‚Äôm not angry or truly pissed off. I just wanna spark conversation and that‚Äôs exactly what‚Äôs happening and I couldn‚Äôt be happier with the outcome.
---
And there was another person her that pointed out the difference between griefing and raiding, as they are not truly equal and there are some differences. But the idea is all the same 
---
I can get behind this idea. Not that I want to be a raider, mind. 
---
But I could see Raider Faction eliminating all the 'pretty' stuff from the build menus.
---
Pretty sure it exists for that purpose as well lol
---
They should name that challenge the ‚Äúno life atom challenge‚Äù 
---
Clean straight jackets seem to sell to other players for up to 700ish caps.
---
r/fo76FilthyCasuals  come join us!
---
Sadly you can't. I've tried. Ran into 3 random encounter mothmen and they aren't even parsifible
---
I've Dc'd twice after the queen died because of all the shit going on around me. I have had loads of ultracite, nuclear waste, and flux. Hopefully it went to someone good, cause I somehow seem connected long enough to hear the sound of my shit dropping, but then when I log back in it's all gone.
---
How full is your stash? 
---
Tonnes of weightless items?
---
Do you run heavy too?
---
In my experience on PS4, there are a lot of players mic'd up and willing to quest if you reach out to them.  I was keeping to myself for most of the early game, but after taking some team based charisma perks I started to invite randomly on a regular basis.  Other than a few young players with under developed social skills (have to be understanding) I have met and regularly travel with a great cast of characters.
---
Oh, that's no good
---
Thank you, another reminder to go grind caps to eventually buy a marsupial serum.
---
You're going to get downvoted to hell, but take my upvote, for what it is worth. I've logged more hours in 76 than in any game ive play for quite some time
---
Like equipping a level 50 piece of t-60 power armor lol
---
Yeah but the hunger/thirst and negatives just seem so meh
---
Nuka cola? I hadn‚Äôt heard about that yet. Mind filling me in?
---
Do you just took multiple at once to get the stacking effect? I can try with a strength bobbleheads that I have two of, but I‚Äôm not sure if it works
---
True.  But could it be that everyone got out of the vault.  Some people did not like having to forage and make due by themselves.  They saw an easy meal that Maria made.  "She was always so kind in the vault.  This will be easy." 
---
Seems plausible.
---
Soooooooooooooooooooooo good.
---
What does this have to do with the stories in the holotapes? And why are you still subbed here if you hate the game so much anyways?
---
Yeah, that's my thought. Melee uses all your strength points. Heavy weapons also uses all your strength points. It would seem there's good synergy, because you need max strength for both, but realistically, when you need to switch weapons, you are going to be in a fight, and going into the perk menu to completely swap builds seems less than ideal. Hello, I don't even want to be bothered to go in and swap in lockpicking perks. I couldn't imagine swapping builds in the middle of a fight. Maybe if they add hot swappable perk decks in the future.
---
I can't speak to the scorch queen but heavy weapons should fit your special pretty easily (there are 3 point cards in int and luck too though).
---
Judge heavy guns by the Gatling Gun though.  That's the mainstay.
---
It‚Äôs wonky for sure. Wait for the VATS sound to finish playing before shooting. That‚Äôs given me good results so far. Keep in mind that VATS doesn‚Äôt always recognize that there are sometimes small walls or branches blocking the path of your bullets.
---
I'm coming to you rn
---
Yeah, that's him. Cool, lots of random encounters it seems 
---
"Bethesda said something"
---
"Of course they didn't they don't communicate"
---
While you aren‚Äôt wrong, I‚Äôm kicked off at least twice a session from the server or an error with the game itself. Enemies still get stuck inside of walls and the ground for me when doing workshop defend quests, my game still gets garbage FPS if I so much as tap my fire button with an automatic equipped, I could go on. So this game really doesn‚Äôt exclusively fall under the ‚Äúhate bandwagon‚Äù phenomenon. That definitely occurred, but pretending what these youtubers are critiquing/mocking what have you isn‚Äôt a deeply flawed unfinished product they have way more work to do on is just a lie.
---
For me I just don't like the PA HUD nor any of the audio that comes with PA. It's bulky, clunky and is so incredibly distracting to me.
---
I have about 500 DR/ER between Vanguard Trapper pieces, mutations, the DR/ER perks and running blocker. It's an incredibly resilient build and if I'm dying to anything it's my own stupidity.
---
Naw, the YouTubers have done plenty to deserve scorn here.
---
Shhhhhh...we don't want the Mothman egg chefs ruining a good spot.
---
PSN: DrakeManTooth
---
Damn, i wont be on for a few more hours :(
---
I'm not sure here what you suck at the most, but i've narrowed it down to bethesda dick and trolling.
---
I dont want any more. The perks dont really do anything for my style of play.
---
Good luck dude. Tbh server hopping made the game so boring for me. 
---
But...you can still do it. Blatantly saying that you can‚Äôt simply isn‚Äôt true. 
---
yeah there is a prime receiver to shoot ultracite ammo  
---
Though there are also rare ultracite weapons itself  
---
Im using an ultracite gatling laser for example, it shoots green instead of red but uses normal fusion cores.  
---
ultracite weapons drop from scorchbeasts and queen   
---
I myself has only seen ultracite energy weapons, so the handmade is probably a normal handmade with prime receiver
---
Dont forget golf outfits.  Good cap source also.  
---
I redbox'd the game and bought it the next day. I've been havin a blast, just takes a while to get it all down. I got to around lvl 20 on my first character before I decided to make a new guy with a better understanding if the game and it's been a blast. I haven't spoiled myself by watchin countless videos on secret stuff or the best builds, just been soakin in the world. Yeah, it could have been a conventional fallout game, but I applaud them for trying something different. As a mainly solo player, it's nice running across another player or team and well al begin droppin supplies for one another and go on our way. It isn't bad, nor is it perfect, but it's right in that sweet spot where I find myself comin back day after day where otger games have just lost my interest due to how exhuasting they are.
---
Another comment pointed out that there is a difference between the two. In the heat of making this post, based off of what I read and such, people were calling people who were just doing an ol‚Äô raid griefers. I failed to highlight that in my post in hindsight. 
---
However the conversations and spirit behind the post remains the same. There‚Äôs a ton of grey area and it‚Äôs hard to draw the lines 
---
I am also pretty sure this is how it was marketed from the beginning as well
---
Or this was the introduction. For new Fallout players they got to see what the factions were about and the next 'chapter' opens up that world.
---
"Devs are actively making changes". Really, like what?   
---
Golf skirts and outfits sell for 25ish caps with hard bargain.
---
Same with ski outfits which i find most ppl don't bother with, 25ish.
---
By yes, straight jackets are the best.
---
I‚Äôll be on almost all day
---
I don't find it to be that bad. I've had them for a while so now I barely notice the difference.
---
Because I have to get my $60 worth of entertainment from somewhere don't I?
---
I find it‚Äôs best to stay away from all of the negative media. I know the game has issues first hand, I‚Äôve played it a ton. 
---
I like talking about it with people who like the game or reading stuff from people who also like the game. 
---
Best off in the more niche fo76 subs for actual discussions about the game. Let the haters hate. 
---
I still play and enjoy no mans sky. It‚Äôs fun. It has its issues but I play games to have fun rather than to impress some random dude in Reddit. 
---
I agree completely though. It‚Äôs absolutely exhausting. Not even irritating anymore, just draining to see the same 5 things repeated for months on end 
---
I dropped it somewhere by accident. I was super bummed when it happened. I saw someone else using it like 90 seconds later. Couldnt get it back.
---
That's hilarious. Like "a real gamer" was somekind of title, a prize. It just means you don't have anything else to do and that's OK.
---
And about my counter, I don't have to, I just said that your list was artificially made longer and that's true. There is no question about it. 
---
Real gamer heh, thank you, that was funny. My wife wonders what the hell am I laughing. Have a nice day, night or whatever it is there.
---
I‚Äôll be on for a long time don‚Äôt worry
---
That's the gaming community for you. Basically, find communities dedicated to the specific game you like and stick to those communities.. it's sad but the internet is obsessed with circlejerking and you cannot have any discussion about games that aren't "in"
---
I'm pretty disappointed with the gsme, sadly, but it's not some massive pile of shit like everyone acts and I'm not shoehorning "HURRR fo76 sux xD" in to every thread
---
You adapt lol this is true. Whata the negative on marsupial? 
---
This is probably a gift actually! Left by someone who'd built a higher intelligence(better durability) set and didn't need the old set. Even repaired it and left a core. What a guy
---
I‚Äôm talking about people saying you can‚Äôt enjoy the game, not that it‚Äôs just not a good game. I 100% the game is very flawed and not for most people. 
---
Most of the BOS recruits in Appalachia were US Army Rangers from the Taggerdy's Thunder unit.  
---
Weird, that's how I escaped from that exact situation. Maybe I was lucky somehow
---
gtfo you are one of the reasons why our reddit group is so toxic.

I can see you are still having issues with your character perks in Fallout 76. After reviewing your screenshot this does provide proof this is indeed a bug and it needs to be reported.  
---
at this time, we here at Customer Support does not have an immediate fix on this issue. We encourage you to help us report these incidents, and sooner or later there maybe a patch for this problem. I apologize for the inconvenience this has caused you. For anything else beyond that you can always reach back with us as soon as you can with those details. For now, we will go ahead and set this ticket to solved - but don't let that alarm you! A simple reply to this email can immediately reopen your ticket so we may resume our conversation.
---
Thank you for your continued interest and support!
---
I look at it as being in the same boat as No Man's Sky.
---
I liked some of No Man's Sky, but other parts I was concerned about.  I stopped playing and now enjoy it even moreso than when I first started.  The same is happening to me with 76.  I like it, I enjoy playing with my friends, I could care less what other say.
---
Make your own decisions and watch what you want for Youtube.  Don't let others change/influence your opinions.  
---
People were launching nukes after the hotfix on Tuesday
---
Reminds me of no man's sky...
---
I use a handmade and got the plans for the prime handmade receiver. Useless. Don't waste time with prime receivers. I switched back to the hardened receiver immediately. Not worth the cost for the receiver or the ammo.
---
You've deduced that I am the troll? 
---
Kurzgesagt and CGP Grey are two of my favorites. 
---
I'm both bummed and relieved that they don't post more. As much as I would love additional content from them, I'm glad they try and stick to high quality stuff, instead of churning out a 10 minute episode every week. 
---
I'm also looking for the location of Light Sturday and or Heavy Raider Armour plans. I know the plans for the modifications to the armour but do the plans for the armour actually exist?
---
Good to know - Thanks. One thing I was not prepared for coming from FO4, ensuring you eat and drink periodically....
---
I have been lucky so far and nobody has tried to grief my camp.
---
im so confused by this anti hate circlejerk
---
they have as much right to complain as you have right to not listen to it
---
Is Blocker worth it? I always thought it had little use. 
---
I think part of it is just the lack of other things to talk about in regards to the actual game. Compared to most other Fallouts (or Beth games) there isn't that much content, and most people have done the quests by now. There is no skill-based end game, or really any other kind of end game except for some RNG grinding for weapons that aren't really needed. All the friends I played with left around mid-december and don't really see a good reason to log in until there is a major content drop.
---
It's easy to keep on ranting about the flaws since it's hard to find anything meaningful to discuss.
---
I am just waiting for the human interest about someone who earns those 20 ATOMs years from now.  I will feel bad for them even though I am a dedicated gamer!
---
I currently have the helmet plans. on PC.
---
At least your theory explains why all the raiders are dead!
---
Also looking for some friends who add others with mics. 
---
I finally got my hands on one about a month ago. Yeah I also have a 2 shot explosive shotgun (non duped). Sad that I even have to say that. Anyway, sounds like you're getting that elastic health glitch. They shouldn't heal back like that, it WAS a known bug that I thought they fixed a couple weeks ago.
---
I currently have the left leg plans. on PC.  
---
I'm looking for the right arm plans.
---
Yeah I just read that comment.  It could be similar to raiders in movies. There are ones that just want the loot for survival and there are ones that want to shooty their way to the looty and force themselves upon the booty, too.  The latter is the griefer, if that makes sense without being too graphic.
---
Which doesn‚Äôt post? Kurzgesagt? I only just found the (thanks to another askreddit what‚Äôs some great YouTube), so I haven‚Äôt been short on material. 
---
Im a vats rifleman.  Really like the lever action.   Granted im using a quadammo legendary.  If i didnt have the 20rounds i probably wouldnt use it.  
---
Pc or Xbox ? :) if xbox, i think i might have a spare helmet plan, do you have a spare leg ?, think it was the left one, but will have to check when i get online :)
---
There‚Äôs already TSE harpoons in circulation
---
Dibs!
---
Don't take it too seriously. Enable push to talk if you have a mic, and if you don't, still leave chat on. It's a useful tool and player interactions have been the most fun part of the game for me.
---
White Knight rank 3 makes armor cost 1 of each material to repair. I tried lucky break and the weapon one out for a while and decided to go without.
---
I know an older couple who stopped watching Fox News because it started giving Trump negative criticism. It's just a thing people do; I'm not really surprised by it. People are going to seek out their confirmation bias to some extent; regardless of how well informed they are/are not.
---
We could put a little spinning light hat on their head just to be even more infuriating.  There isn‚Äôt really any punishment in the game for being bad, like there is in real life so we have to make it up. 
---
This weekend I killed about 10 legendary robots in watoga.  Weirdest thing I've ever seen, they were all clumped up by the BoS vendor.
---
Funny.
---
You're bitching about people bitching. GG
---
Games trash simple, the hate should continue til the game is actually good. People saying the game ia fine are just stupid.. This is not a AAA game but released it as one and bethseda laughing at the fanbase too.
---
 Who cares if the game will get better in the future, doesnt excuse that fact they've butchered the name of fallout completely. Lack of updates , fixes just to break more etc.. Could go on but ya know, people are in denial.
---
Yahtzee mentioned how bad he thought FO76 was, but didn't include it on his top worst games list. His take on why he thinks FO76 is bad makes sense, even if I don't fully agree with it.
---
Yes I took them at once and accidently crashed after half an hour. Duration got reset and so I relogged to realize it resets with every relog as long as curator is equipped (if you relog within 59min every time)
---
people are throwing a shitfit about the nuka cola rum and saying they got ripped off because the actual nuka cola bottle a case and not a glass bottle, which it was never supposed to be in the first place if you actually look at actual photos of it from before it released.
---
Some of them are just weird, like how my character is a disembodied head and hands with an invisible torso for 30 seconds every time I log in.  Then there's this grinding sounding noise and she actually grunts loudly like all her gear is landing on her when it loads.  And I now think that's what's actually happening since I recently cleared a daily for collecting a holotape just by logging in and having her inventory dumped on her.  It's just a crude intro the game that is shoved in your face every time you log in, and kinda sets the stage for all the annoying bugs that can follow.
---
I've also had receivers drop from Scorchbeasts that are at least level 68, but it's only a few times. SBQ seems to have a better chance.
---
watoga station i see them every second/third time I visit
---
I just got the Fusion Generator plans doing the Powering Up Monongah event once.  I did all the optional pieces to 100% with my friend, not sure if that makes a difference but at the end we both got prints for the generator.
---
Also, I thought (wrongly) that I could use it to harvest fusion cores like we do in the game, but that isn't true.  It just provides a lot of power for less space than the other generators you can build.
---
I got all of them, minis carnavore. I went to the mine right of whitesprings, when you load up its outside a cliff you can walk up and drop into the cave entrance. Walk down and face 3 random enemies, get irradiated by the water (stand near the bridge, you dont need to die just get close) and run back up to the entrance where there is a radiation contamination detoxed arch. Remember to takeoff/put on starched Gene's. Once you get one mutation there is a timer for about 15 minutes. You can wait and come back or server hop. I got them all in about an hour- hour and 20 mins. More rads=better.
---
actually, there is perk swapping mod.  [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124)

Hah that's a good one.
---
I should maybe teach new players how to build a good camp 
---
Hell I can deal with rads way easier that I can deal with Desease
---
Ah. I always have WK active as well, but just don‚Äôt like having to repair my armor much, as I‚Äôm not always near a workbench or I don‚Äôt want to fast travel.
---
You know what. This is the first time I've heard of anyone having this issue.
---
I bet alot of ppl complain but don't send reports.
---
I bought mine from some random player walking around for 5 CAPS.. woot!
---
i agree, its very annoying
---
it seems the pets are basically an always hostile turret, except they can run out of the camp area and die
---
the other annoyance about always hostile is that if your pet sees something and aggros to it, all your turrets also follow it...
---
Yeah fair enough looks worth the investment then as I'm only using a two shot explosive and not bloodied but given if I use my grog axe I can reach stupidly high numbers a bloodied shotgun build seems viable. Just trying to float ideas about as I'd rather not invest the time find out they are basically useless end game (looking at you heavy gun build)
---
Of course I'm a real gamer, that's why I have a super mario brother's collectible tshirt officially licensed from Nintentdo Japan. I also buy every official prerelease tricentennial millennium season-pass ultimate prestige edition and my wall is covered from head to toe with cheaply made plastic shit that looks like it came out of a happy meal. I have every single Funko Pop ever manufactured and I also have 12 subscriptions to Lootbox (gamer gear, am I right gamer friends?)
---
This is just stuff you wouldn't understand if you're not a real gamer.
---
Looks great!
---
Jon (MATN) and Oxhorn are the only one's I've bothered to stick with. They keep a good attitude about everything and vary their content. 
---
Though, sadly, I've been avoiding Oxhorn's FO76 streams since I don't want to spoil anything from the quests, haha. 
---
this is why i stopped watching juicehead and taking him seriously. 
---
Lol?
---
Sucks to happen. I've lost count of the amount of times ive lost something to a disconnect or some other stupid bug. Today alone i killed 5 3 star legendaries and got no legendary drops. Im now 100% certain that if you kill something too fast the server doesnt see that it was a legendary. Game is weird.
---
For some reason I've seen 4 different people nuke JUST the WV Lumber Co. building.
---
Thing is, it seems like that's the intention eventually. Like someone glitched into the presidential suite and saw on the terminal there that you can trade something (think they're called seals) for special rewards (like power armor paint).
---
There's no way this is true. I've only had a server with less than 15 people on it once, and it was weird. My buddy and I assumed the join queue for the world was glitched, and then the world just crashed.
---
Is nobody comenting obout how pain in the ass it is to gather plans again on a new characters?
---
Search this reddit for the word tips and you will find many posts with useful tips.
---
I always have Hazmat suit in inventory and binded button to wear it.
---
Bethesda warned everyone that this was going to be a magnificent shitshow full of spectacular bugs before the B.E.T.A. was even dropped. I'm done with the smug circlejerk. I shit on it.
---
If you read ops story, you are a piece of shit :)
---
I had a new Christmas player try and fight me. As a level 140 killing a level 8 it wasnt my proudest moment but atleast he knows not to go around attacking people now :D
---
Another solution would be being able place stuff that you have in your inventory with workshop mode and having it be static, which would make it better and easier to decorate anyway since in every Bethesda game when you decorate your house manually by dropping stuff you always have a chance that reloading the area will fuck up the physics for a moment and make a random item fly away or fall through tables for a split second
---
Just completed 'Fertile Soil' and saw the tool chest you're referring to. Unfortunately no building plans but got the 'light metal torso' plan in the room next door.
---
I've noticed the Snaptail never seem to change to nuked version in whitespring. There are so few sources for violet flux to start with.
---
it wasn't that hard
---
I've only seen the full set thread. Nothing for individual pieces.
---
r/fo76FilthyCasuals, home of the non-toxic, refuge for those who just enjoy the game.
---
Thats the same for me, I have seen them drop guns before but everyone I have seen is a 1* and its normally terrible. The best I got so far from the WS nuke ghouls is a two shot minigun but has nothing else on it.
---
When I get home from work, im going to investigate this watoga farm mentioned in this thread.
---
This game is worse then anything else in this price Segment.
---
And Bethesda Acts like Uwe boll makes his movies.
---
Dont know why they cant apologize here on reddit and Work Hand in Hand with the gamers.
---
Did they present future Plans for this game, like ubisoft with R6 or pubg/hunt Showdown or even battlefield 5 
---
Yup. Tends to happen from time to time. Some days my ghoul runs give me 10+ legendaries, other days i get 1. Its weird. I tend to think of high legendary servers as the "blessed" ones and try to stay on them as long as i can.
---
Isn't Curator supposed to increase duration to 2 hours?
---
I know the Utracite Calibrated Shock plans exist, currently have them installed thanks to a friend.  
---
Would love to know if the Explosive Shielding paint was in game, make my armor strong to explosive damage so I wouldn't blow myself up so much.
---
Yeah. I get he's a big fallout fan. But if you don't like something, there's really only so much you can say about not liking it. After a while it's clear someone is doing it for the attention.
---
He recently came out with a, Is fallout 76 as bad as it seems? It's like, wow, even the title is click bait. 
---
My main issue is that I have to jump through extra steps to buy their product for a friend. The fact that Bethesda support told me to go through a third party to buy a gift is ridiculous, I'm trying to give them my money and they couldn't even get that right.
---
Meow
---
Good luck getting a single hit in on a flying scorchbeast with the gatling plasma.  The projectiles are slow, not nigh instantaneous like ballistics or lasers.
---
The "Extra Claw" Mod for the Deathclaw Gauntlet refuses to attach itself. I have tried swapping servers, restarting game, restarting Xbox, but to no avail.
---
Pacifist mode solves for this.
---
How am I a piece of shit for crafting serums and selling them? 
---
You can. A tip: wait till your 45 and make the 45 one. 
---
You'll probably replace the 35 anyways
---
There‚Äôs a complete raider set in the gorge junkyard. Each time I‚Äôve picked that lock.
---
Many of my friends stopped playing. There isnt much left to do in game. I still play but Im close to taking a longer break aswell.
---
I see the empty servers, too. I think it could be because many have finished playing the game.
---
Same for me.
---
*half paying attention* wait, hold up...
---
Hell. Yes. Mad. Max. Shit.
---
When I heard there would be power armor customization, I immediately though about Ashur's power armor from Fo3: The Pitt.   
---
Still, very fucking disappointed and impatiently waiting for an Automatron sized DLC devoted solely to gnarly power armor. 
---
This should be a realization for the OP that if the sites and people are so wrong and/or misinformed about Fallout 76 then, frankly, they‚Äôre probably wrong and/or misinformed about other games. 
---
Wherever you go, that's where you are. I've not seen Fallout 76 mentioned a single time in the last month, outside of this subreddit. Not a single place I go to for news or information about games has mentioned it. No one I have talked to cares about it. It is, for all intents and purposes, forgotten.
---
If you run into this as much as you say, and I honestly very much doubt that, then you should probably reassess if your habits are in your best interest. They certainly don't seem to be making you happy.
---
You enjoy playing the game? Good on you! Then why aren't you playing the game instead of actively searching for people that don't like it?
---
I like that we're acknowledging 76 isn't legitimate. 
---
I had a 2 shot 50 cal machine gun. Tried out heavy guns for 5 different queens. It just ate soooo much ammo. I gave it away eventually.
---
Really hope two shot with explosive damage gets nerfed. It's unnecessary. 
---
/s
---
For the inventory section, a "mark for sell" option would be amazing, so I can identify things that I will vendor while waiting for cap reset time.
---
Do you dupe them/parts? I cant imagine 200caps is worth your time otherwise. 
---
Do you mean to say the state of the game at launch? The content promised vs what was delivered? Or the vast improvements over time after release? 
---
right, Fallout 76 is not a good game.
---
There's a couple swamps down there
---
Meanwhile back in FO4 land people are trying hard to disable the game breaking character and corpse (hi)lighting effects.
---
I gave up on the farming clothes. Drugs and bulk scrap is my thing.
---
&gt;Give Award
---
Someone is awfully mad they don't own every single Funko Pop ever made.
---
I bet you don't even have a real Nintendo shirt.
---
I'm gonna go a bit off-meta here, but the Plasma Gun with a Flamer barrel is mucho fun.
---
It burns fuel way too fast, and the durability isn't great, but it will quite literally melt anything within 50ft or so.
---
I don‚Äôt see anyone on your side of the fence making that clarification in any of these comments. And you‚Äôre able to enjoy a game even if someone on YouTube says you can‚Äôt. You just don‚Äôt watch that video.
---
If you have to call yourself a real gamer and discourage others, you very much are not 
---
I think at least one part of it might be because Bethesda didn't pay gaming "journalists" for good reviews.
---
Another heated gaming moment...
---
This \^\^ I see them here all the time
---
Make a farm or any place with like a garage. Duct tape, super glue usually there.
---
That's true.  I've seen that too.
---
I've also seen a few that blow up long after I've grabbed and smashed.  so who knows, maybe they all go...just when you're out of the area.  To add to the mystery, y'know.
---
Now I think or wish that you are just a troll(but a real troll).
---
Indeed yes. When I hit Whitesprings, Nuke or not, I‚Äôm grabbing golf skirts / outfits in addition to the other stuff - and the straight jackets if I decide to do the long way through the asylum.
---
Just like fallout 4, energy weapons use the same perks as ballistic. Depending on whether is has a pistol grip or stock, and whether or not it has an automatic receiver, it will be either gunslinger, guerilla, rifleman, or commando. Or heavy gunner, for the big guns. The scatter ones do not count as shotguns for the shotgun perks, as far as I know.
---
I agree 100% it's fucking dumb. People can't let shit go. It's whatever. I just ignore it all now and still have fun playing it
---
All it takes is flux which drops from the queen. It doesn't cost anything to make them. 
---
Thats the goal! I went through some of it today and am really disappointed i cant use some it. Cant wait for trading.
---
I'm saying this as a software developer myself, simple changes are often not as easy as they sound on paper, especially when you're working with another company's old smelly legacy code. I wouldn't be surprised if the senior devs are all busy working on bigger issues and stuff like this has been given to juniors/interns who are spinning their wheels trying to understand the data model and software patterns in the engine. Something as simple as a poorly designed Data Access Object can make a small change like "don't allow objects of type A to be modified by operations of type B" to take weeks of refactoring by a senior.
---
Component View -&gt; Adhesive  
---
So many things.
---
The rage I had when realising it. I'm still respecing that build begrudgingly.
---
help a lot
---
harper ferry vendor tends to have them, watoga vendor does sometimes also
---
I got 2 in 5 hops.
---
Mutfruit at West Tek. Tatos and corn at farms up above vault 76. 5mins farming and you get 60ish adhesive. Save a few to plant at your camp and get adhesive on demand. 
---
&gt;  I like holding workshops. Its pointless 
---
That about sums it up. 
---
I like the *idea* of holding workshops, but the current incarnation doesn't work for me. Not just because of the discos, but because there's no persistence there at all. Why build a workshop up at all? So I can occasionally do a tower defense against super mutants or rampaging animals/robots? 
---
Ostensibly holding a workshop is so you can farm some mats, but you can usually find them quicker just exploring. 
---
Personally, I use workshops as free fast travel spots to reduce the cost of fast travel. Other than that there isn't much of a point that I can see. 
---
Amazing go for 76 then offer them for sale, pages on there own to go on walls, the book as a whole (amazon self publish?) and or ebook! :)
---
The two shot part is irrelevant really. Explosive is the offender. Explosive makes it so you dont have to aim at all, just open fire on an area and everything is dead.
---
A regular two shot gun is still really strong, but two shot isnt the offender.
---
I only take Funkos of franchise I like, I don't have an official or unnoficial Nintendo t-shirt, I do have a nice Mario figure and a bunch of pokemon merch. Is this relevant ? No. Do we care ? No.
---
Are you completely insane ? Yes.
---
Next thing you're going to tell other redditors they aren't "real gamer(tm)" if they haven't pre-ordered the Witcher 3.
---
It was billed as an early access experimental title from the outset. Anyone claiming otherwise is a fucking moron or a liar.
---
I've gone back and forth on the game but my final verdict is that Fallout 76 is a hard fail.
---
I  came to my final conclusion night before last, which is the last time I played it. 
---
I thought that early game would be a grind, but would improve as  I leveled up. 
---
But I recently realized no,  not true. 
---
I had reached level 158, and I visited the Enclave bunker for what must have been the 200th time hoping to find one more calibrated shock for my X01 armor. 
---
It still wasn't there and... no. Just no. 
---
It was in moments like this that I remember how in Fallout 4,  all I needed was smart perk investment to get mods I needed, but in this game, everything is dictated by RNG, whether it's gun mods, power armor mods, or legendary weapon drops. 
---
Forming a team, hopping in and out of the server to make ghouls respawn at white springs for hours and hours to farm legendaries in the hopes that the right one will drop is not my idea of fun. 
---
The fact that you even have to do such things to get good weapons is bullshit and is symptomatic of a really shitty game design. 
---
I have a picture from the other night I keep meaning to post - someone ran a little nuking train and centered one on New Gad, one on Arktos and the other on Mt Blair.
---
You mean I've been a valuable member of the Fallout community and helped my fellow gamers to correct some of their incorrect information about this $60 product?
---
Does that make me more or less insufferable than those dastardly YouTubers who keep making mean videos about Bethesda?
---
Glad I could help to make sure people have accurate information.
---
2mutfruit. 2tato. 1corn. 
---
Obviously the vault dwellers were playing a lot of xcom before leaving the vault.
---
Out of curiosity - does the Beam Splitter actually do 5x more damage if you hit all the beams?
---
This same level of hatred was expressed when Fallout 3 was launched. It was so different from the genre that it couldn't be a Fallout ... what had they done. 
---
It is different, it isn't going to be for everyone ... and had more people actually looked at what was said about the game instead of just the title they more than likely would not have bought it. Instead they saw Fallout ... pre-ordered it and now are upset because it isn't what they wanted. 
---
really? cause he was using regular ammo with it
---
The industry is trending in the wrong direction when it comes to quality and value. If people let Bethesda get away with this, if we don't talk about it, then things will only get much worse. Stop being an apologist. Play the game if you like it, but don't try and squelch people trying to fight back against terrible game design either.
---
Isn't weightless a pretty bad perk for wood armor, because it weighs so little with the Shrouded mod anyway?
---
Once you set the farm, it is not pointless, it just work (use the Green Thumb and super duper perks).
---
When you say more rads=better, do you mean mutation is more likely with a higher dose? If so, doesnt taking more rads mean you have to starchGene + de-rad more often? What level of rads per second is best in the mine? 20? In your experience.
---
 The new year's nuke silo timer bug. The fps/speed boost bug. The explosive damage /immortal enemies bug. The issue with people constantly losing their camps every other login. The bug that duplicated camp items. That's just off the top of my head. 
---
Before you do this be sure to have dodgy (agility) and lone wanderer
---
Seriously, I wish more people were talking about how basic some of these things that are screwed are.
---
Like the level-gated plans being level-locked instead.
---
Bethesda did everything wrong and it's being milked on youtube 
---
&gt;cial N
---
lol you actually own a Funko Pop?
---
So the trash and animals only go for powered extractors? TIL
---
Boo-hoo, wipe my...
---
Yeah it should work like that. But NO not for me i apparently have som stupid fucking bug.. That there is no solution for.
---
Not for me it doesn't, they not raiders, they assholes who are bored. As far as I am concerned they can remove PvP all together and if I could have a private server I would play on that and not see a single person and I would be happy with that. I have zero interest in interacting with other players.
---
Raiders in FO4 with Ai which you could easily outsmart/kill, when you dealing with humans, it is different. if they were really raiding that's maybe fine but they not, they just there to destruct, annoy and grief, they not there for any other reason.
---
I agree most players are friendly and co-exist. There are lots of things to keep people occupied other than coming to destroy my base.
---
Sadly, I'm on PC. Thanks for the offer tho.
---
100000 times this.
---
If you make the 35 set you are going to hate yourself when it comes time to make the 45 set and you have no springs.
---
I REALLY want to nuke the Mega Rocket Stop, and see all of the cars explode
---
I picked up the Blue uniform (the Blue and Brown hats are missing from your list) this weekend, after a dozen plus runs looking for something other than the White, Dirty or Weathered uniform.   
---
I don't remember the exact spot. But it seems to confirm another comment in that there were mob spawns there. Itself a rarity.
---
PC market is a but more expensive but you can still find them for 500 each I believe 
---
"EVERYONE WHO DISAGREES WITH ME IS A FUCKING SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIILLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL"
---
How do you unlock the rad scrubber plan?
---
Amen. Was gonna suggest the same. Who the fuck wants to watch these idiots on YT 
---
I agree in the same sense that Bluegrass is very similar in composition to classical music.  I think it would have added a more unique aesthetic to 76. People have fond memories of the specific cowboy anthems present in Fallout NV, I think bluegrass music would have brought the same dynamic. There's a lot of themes of present themes from union uprising to homesteading in bluegrass lyrics. Very different from what we think of Country music these days too. 
---
I wish I had that much free time lol
---
You don't really need to explain that there will be discontent in a small and somewhat cramped vault where you've had to rub shoulders with the same people for 25 years, anyone that's ever lived with other people will know about the discontent. Hell, if you've ever worked in an office then chances are you've either written a passive aggressive lunchroom note or been on the receiving end of one. 
---
There's a lot to vault FO76 for, but this isn't it.
---
I wonder if the person who owned it left it there deliberately as a present for the player who came across it or was some poor sod who accidentally dropped their PA instead of placing it and disconnected before they realized what they did.
---
I still have one, I guess I had an extra? I hope they do this. More alternate currencies pls.
---
That is the most evil thing I've ever heard lol
---
I'd take that for mine, xbox.
---
No. Need a lot more than that to facetank as melee. Here is a melee tank build. https://youtu.be/PlllJp_Lv4k he facetank lvl 91 deathclaw for zero damage. 
---
SHUSH
---
I uh, thought you were being cheeky for a minute and wanted literal, mutuated-to-the-color-blue grass.
---
What‚Äôs more annoying? People being right about 76 being massively overhyped and being bad, or people complaining about people complaining that fallout 76 is bad? 
---
I could make that video.  But it wouldn't get any traction because I'm a nobody.  I'm trying to do a let's play series that stays out of the opinions and drama and just does the main story, partially just to prove that A. it exists and B. it's not as terrible as people would have you believe.
---
The best part is that the people talking all of the trash hardly have 1 hour of play time into the game. If that. Or they are basing their opinions on hearsay. 
---
1 doesn't quite do it for me. I also have 4 charisma, if you end up wanting to upgrade you can grab magnetic personality and it'll give you enough of a charisma boost to share rank 2
---
Can you keep a gatling gun together for an entire silo/scorch queen run though? I messed with a gatling laser and broke it (even with perks) in like 5 min
---
Not true in my experience. I use anti-armor/tank killer/piercing mag on my ballistic auto rifles. Testing various combinations of the three with Awareness indicates that it all stacks. Very consistent damage against pretty much everything in the game.
---
Odd way of looking at things lol.   Mario forces me to not play survival :(
---
that, or give more utility to 1h weapons..
---
Same. I‚Äôm 34 and annoyed as fuck that these people are viewed as a credible source for gaming opinions. 
---
How do you inspect a weapon?
---
Does it matter if u one shot enemys with 300 or 600 damage? Is it relaxed to have some more hp ( maybe to use it with radicool and get more strengt) and Sprint longer because with endurance u will use less ap for sprinting...u decide bro;)
---
2 Mut, 2 Tato, 2 Corn, 1 Purified Water.
---
Easy to setup at a camp with a garden of all three and a water purifier machine.
---
I can‚Äôt stop laughing, this is so spot on lmao.
---
Yes, I remember the Fallout 3 launch and I remember the NV launch too. It was almost as bad as 76. That game was a mess at the beginning.
---
Adrenal kicks in immediately as an fyi.
---
Ie at half health you do more damage too.
---
The price cut is what did it for me, I would say at least I got to play it 2 weeks early but the game played like shit and then everyone else gets in on a better product cheaper. Fuck Bethesda and their momma
---
Yeah, I was getting pretty pissed at all the hate, but then I logged back into fo76 and had a great time. YouTubers are basically hack journalists, they show whatever's going to sell copy. To be honest I got bored with "what is up, it's your boy..." YouTube ages ago. They'll keep it up until something else comes along, meanwhile Bethesda won't be sweating it and we'll get a continuously improving game world to fanny about in
---
This is how I feel about Halo and 343 Industries. They're actively fixing their mistakes and learning from them to make Halo an amazing series again but people won't give them a chance. They won't let go of the past and see that things are getting better. All they talk about is how much better Bungie used to be and how Reach was the best and last good game. Infinite will probably be exactly what these people want and they will still say Halo is dead and complain
---
Probably referring to most of the bugs having simple workarounds.  Or stuff taken care of in first couple big patches like busted quests and driving weight negative.
---
It does spin, but it also sometimes stops spinning. 
---
lol :)
---
Actually, it's implied that the bots and supermutants weren't enough, and only releasing the scorchbeasts on top of that was enough to go to defcon 1.

No, you're just insufferable. In fact you're just as insufferable as those same youtubers. 
---
Nope. Realizations only come from watching you tubers that tell you what to realize. 
---
It's not a "legitimate MMO". It's not "massive". But everyone keeps acting like it should have the same support that World of Warcraft has or something.
---
It's definitely a game though. It's definitely a multiplayer game. If anyone remembers what The Division looked like at launch, then FO76 wouldn't have come as a surprise.
---
TD had a backback glitch that would disable your ability to log in to that character. If you removed weapons attachments and then logged off, you technically had more inventory than your backpack would allow so it wouldn't let you log back in. This was a known factor, but Massive came out and told players that it would be **A FUCKING MONTH** before it was fixed due to how patching works with consoles/Sony.
---
Now Massive righted the ship and TD ended up being a great game with a good community, but it was rocky AF at the start. Online multiplayer RPG-style games that AREN'T massive multiplayer just can't be compared to legitimate MMO's like WoW, SWtOR, LOTRO, etc. It's apples and oranges.
---
Yeah seriously.  There's nothing I want in the shop.  And I would eat up any Mad Max looking shit
---
no but once you kill them they cannot retaliate against you if they have a bounty so you can kill them then turn passivist back on and go back to normal
---
He can‚Äôt bushwhack the Marshall, but the Marshal can bushwhack him. I usually do a call out if I‚Äôm about to jump a bounty, lawmen shouldn‚Äôt shoot first and ask questions later.
---
5 jumps so far, nothing yet
---
The fuck are you smoking? They took the servers down on the 2nd to patch in the fix for the nuke bug. It was literally an issue for all of a day and a half. 
---
That 'option' should be more clear to prevent people like us or others to keep wondering why they are not working on a preview or a feature to view our hours
---
anyone or even us wouldn't want to scroll through challenges unknowingly what to find or even exists, ability to view them in questionable ways.
---
We can only hope.
---
Its not that much more powerful. The second shot is just an extra pellet.
---
All of the above and the anger associated with the community at launch and for awhile after. Although the NMS subreddit did seem a bit more vitriolic.
---
I don't think I own a multiplayer game that I've never been disconnected from.  I might have gotten disconnected from fo76 twice. Things were back to normal 1 minute later.
---
The hate def seems disproportionate 
---
If you have the rifle perks, a combat rifle is what you want.
---
You're supporting a horrible game, and the reason why developers keep releasing trash.
---
i think i'm 46 and havent made it down to watoga yet, just got the BOS  quest to head to fort defiance so i'll probably go this weekend. 
---
I have always played pistol, sneaky sniper in fallouts but for 76 i switched to power armor/melee since it allows me to really experience the game without worrying about dying. I try to be conservative about what i tackle but so far i've only died once and that was on deathclaw island when i was level 10ish. It's pretty astounding what you can accomplish with a sledgehammer. 
---
While you have a very good point, God Believer or not, the Serenity Prayer is always a good rule of thumb.
---
Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change;

courage to change the things I can;

and wisdom to know the difference.
---
It would be wise to just let the haters hate, because haters gonna hate.  Don't spend your energy on them.  Spend your energy upgrading your Power Armor.

I hope it was gifted and not a mistake on his/her part 
---
OP is Mysteriously missing 9 bullets...
---
I myself break into hives when people talk critically about my favorite game developers. At least I haven't had the misfortune of coming across any of these "insufferable" people you talk about.
---
No Man's Sky was a team comprised of about a dozen people compared to Bethesda, the AAA company with a late number of games under it's belt.
---
Not all of the hate it's received is unwarranted.
---
I'm guessing the straw that broke the camel's back that led you to create this rant was [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/add2dq/if_bethesda_made_rdr2_instead_of_rockstar/?utm_source=reddit-android) on r/reddeadredemption

And yet it's *still* a younger engine than most of the ones out there, many of which date back to the early 1990's.

And if you want to get technical, it only dates back to around 2010ish, when it was built in-house by Bethesda: It's not Gamebryo.
---
The "age" of an engine doesn't make any sense, given that engines can be upgraded and reworked at will: Most of the engine problems people complained about in previous games don't exist in Fallout 76.
---
Disconnects 100% problem.  Certain balance elements + duping problem yes, for sure.  
---
Grindy mess, no.  The game actually feels real for once.  As opposed to Skyrim, FO4 etc. where you complete all quests, become an unstoppable deity and head of every faction and store every last bit of loot in your bedside table.  I think those complaining about the grind the most are the ones that put in a ton of hours and got Lvl 100+ before the first patches.  For all the stink that was put up for more resource scarcity at workshops, slower levelling, less ammo in Mutants etc, those changes have all been positive.  Doing things like managing your stash, stockpiling screws, fans, etc. are what you would actually do in the wasteland.  Leveling slower gives you more time to collect those resources you'll need late game, surviving, scraping together armor and weapons on the cheap until you finally have a solid CAMP, set of PA, Leg. Weapon, etc.  
---
And yes they have reassured us in every interaction that more content is coming and they will continue to balance, fix, patch.  See Jan. 1 Inside the Vault.  
---
TL;DR - Stability is a big problem, grinding not so much.  They have stated they have plans to continue to update.
---
Anglers, honey beasts drop adhesive. If you are in grafton, to the northeast there is a cabin. Once you fix the terminal in the cabin (one circuit and one steel I think) it will begin a quest to hunt 3 different beasts. Honey beast will be one, it shows you a low level honey beast spawn. You will also kill Yao Guai for springs, and one other mob that escapes me.
---
Also, check everywhere for tape and wonder glue. It will be in more industrial spots but with rng you're likely to find it any where. I've almost 400 hours in this game since october. Please feel free to dm questions! PC player if you need a clan.
---
The funniest part is the game isn't bad at all and most of the people that insist it is don't or haven't played it. And generally I've found the ones that do/did play it and dislike it all expected a different type of game. 
---
I was like what is this ? Oh üò≥
---
Just need to be high enough level to actually wear it now 
---
Haha, Could you imagine the sound of a half dozen barretts going off in rapid succession? That would be terrifying!
---
I should probably join a clan since none of my friends play this game
---
That's why I run a Luck 15 build. When I was level 20 on this character I was finding all sorts of things from loot tables that I shouldn't have even had access to until level 30 or even level 50 in the lowbie areas like flatwoods.
---
There's tons of original content, but you'll never see it because the YT algorithm favors click bait circle jerk videos. And it's not just content creators. Every day that I streamed Fallout 76, I had people constantly coming into my streams for the sole purpose of shitting on the game. Comments on the videos I did were full of them. Stuff like "why do you play this shit game?". Every video I put up that was just about how to do stuff in 76, or general episode gameplay, got tons of thumbs down. I was literally losing subscribers. It's not just the content creators. There's a very real hardcore fan base that Bethesda SERIOUSLY pissed off with this game. Personally I've stopped playing because the economy is ruined due to duping and no actions being taken to correct it. That was the end game for me. Still, I enjoyed the story and challenge from level 1-100, but end game there's just no point / nothing to do. Why should I grind for 200 hours to get my dream weapon when people have 1000 of them in their inventory from duping?
---
junk yards are inconvenience with the stoves and washer on the edge of map. Most time find all of them just sitting trading blows with a stove or tool box... Y Dumb dog it's a stove....
---
LOL Bethesda just wants money, guyz!  Aren't I clever?
---
If you have friends, have one scout and join on them
---
your post is confusing AF . read it yourself.
---
&gt;It still spins me out that after all these years we still are playing on the same engine.
---
Standard procedure in game development: The latest call of duty is built on the "same" engine as the original.
---
Some of these engines date back to the 1990's.
---
Engines can receive iterative improvements: "age" doesn't make any sense when two different iterations can have absolutely nothing in common.
---
Woah, cool. You on now?
---
Wow. Well said
---
I saw him yesterday!! I was by the Pumpkin House. Hiding in a bus from 2 scorchbeasts and I hear music and there it was!
---
Also... did it sound like Enclave music to you? 
---
if you change the defcon, then we wouldnt be able to launch nukes which was one of the biggest advertising points about the game
---
i agree with you and cringe everytime i see some comment from someone who hasn't even suffered through the game themselves and have no clue what it's actually like. but the game really is in such a poor state that i sometimes feel drained playing it.  i need more breaks from this game than i do from actually exercising or working or something.
---
No matter how much you enjoy the game if the following things are facts:
---
- it is an online game where you can dupe to your heart's desire even 
---
though you are forced to trade players because of massive limitations on vendor cap limits and weight limits
---
- it's an online game that regularly crashes
---
- pvp is a joke and also broken
---
- game is generally buggy as fuck
---
Any of the above simple make the game a broken mess, and people shitting on it are completely right to do so. And btw no man's sky doesn't get as much shit is because it's not a triple A studio's game.
---
Stop trying to validate this mess that fallout 76 is, if you enjoy it go play it but don't throw temper tantrums when people say the truth about it. Sure there are a lot of videos about it on youtube but none of the lie about the game, you don't have to lie about this piece of garbage to make it look bad.
---
All of this combined with bethesda's attitude towards the consumers is also very telling of what you can expect from them in the future, so even though i bought the game and had some fun with it, I'm completely fine with hearing ppl shit on it.
---
but it lets you use the cloaking mutation. which is pretty sweet.
---
That's why you have both, I don' think OP is suggesting only private servers. So events, workshops etc run on public servers, everything else you can run on private servers if you choose. Just like GTA, you can do a bunch of stuff on a invite only server and public servers are for the events that people interact with.
---
Personally I wouldn't be bored with private servers, I would have friends on my private server or people who want to work together. I would just like to see it as an option
---
No neither exe or swing speed is calculated into that, the dam increases you're seeing is from the heavy rocket mod. All-rise would be "better" appearing cuz it may 1 shot but for multihitting a large enemy the 3\* would be much better
---
Or you can watch me :) for real tho, youtube.com/hobogaming, sorry for the shameless plug but I've just recently started doing fallout 76 videos because I'm tired of every fallout 76 video being about how bad the game is.
---
YouTubers are still making videos about why they think The Last Jedi was a terrible movie, even though it's been over a year since it came out.
---
YouTube clickbait is one of the many cancers of social media right now, and it's way too easy to get their fanbase all frothed up over dead issues for that sweet sweet ad revenue.
---
Gatling plasma has a bug where you use rounds then switch weapons you can return to the plasma and it will be full of ammo again... just needs to reload. 
---
Gary, Gary.
---
Fuckoff
---
Another day another moaner who can‚Äôt seem to grasp free speech and freedom of expressions
---
These threads are ruining this sub 
---
Bethesda has never cared about the negativity they literally didn't send review copies of Doom out and it upset every media outlet the media been waiting to attack Bethesda over anything so they are going to let you know that you should hate Bethesda and everything about them
---
Yep, that's the problem. Kids rely on YouTube and the internet for opinions. I hear it all the time. Kids favorite saying when expressing their opinion of something is "actually that's complete trash" without an explanation why and it's usually about something that's subjective. People can like what they want and we should let them while enjoying the things we enjoy.
---
Yeah I can
---
Well, I don't take workshops for resources, I have more than enough of everything since I've honed my looting skills with 1200 hours of FO4.  Extractors in workshops are not the best way to get anything.
---
The only reason I take workshops is for the quests.  So I am not going to ignore the defense quests, that's the best reward from a workshop!
---
the most annoying part about the hate train is that a majority of the people who are still bitching about the game aren't even playing it anymore. It's painfully obvious when most of their complaints are non-issues after patches. Just move the fuck on. 
---
Yep, golf shorts and skirts are my main money grab as well. 
---
Not as nice as an explosive handmade certainly, but it does work. And it slows down the beast, giving everyone a better shot at it. It's durability is shite though, like all big guns
---
Not sure if you‚Äôve seen the griefer YouTube vids where folks either get you come to their hostel kill camps, or bait and switch you to kill you for your junk.
---
There are folks out there doing this for their YouTube live content. 
---
Ahh yeah, don't think I ever got around to digging through the secret recordings. Was just going off of the one terminal. My memory *sort* of served me here. :P
---
tyvm
---
And yet some people think that dupers should be left alone. That we shouldn't "ruin their fun".
---
‚ÄúStop hating a pile of shit I like to shove down my throat ! You meanies,‚Äù 
---
Lmao dude it‚Äôs the law of nature when you fuck up this bad (Bethesda) and don‚Äôt do anything positive after then it‚Äôs only logic that lots of people will start realizing how shit the company is and will ultimately fail. And new company will be formed to take its place 
---
well gee whiskers talk about a massive exxageration  
---
the youtubers I'm watching did a few vids and then followed up with a few more as Bethesda continued to pull some really dumb stunts and annoy its' community. i don't really understand why this sub is so hateful about negativity towards this game/Bethesda, it's not like it isn't earned and you continously admit that in your post. yes, it has a lot of problems and those problems are talked about. the thing is that people are begging to (once again) get fed up with buggy, unfinished releases and shady practices.   
---
you treat this game like some poor puppy that keeps getting kicked around by everyone but it just shows how ignorant you really are because other high profile games who are doing shady stuff lately are getting as much attention - just look at blizzard and world of warcraft, i don't remember a time when such a large part of its' community was so negative about the game.  
---
generally, people watch videos/streams about things they want to agree with so i'm not sure what's stopping you from finding some guy who sings praises about fo76. those other videos you can just skip and ignore, it's not like you're forced by anyone to consume all that media you seem so allergic to, jesus christ.  
---
people on the internet can get so soft.
---
I get it.
---
No Man's Sky at least put out something that wasn't an asset flip. FO76 is the side project to add multiplayer into FO4 but repackaged as a stand alone game and put into a new location.
---
If Bethesda had simply sold this as a Fallout 4 expansion that took place in another location at a higher cost than the regular DLC I think most of the hate would be unwarranted. It's clearly marked as an expansion.
---
But they didn't. It's Fallout 4 assets pretty much with some modifications.
---
Red dead has more bugs in it too. But people find them funny instead of a detriment to the game itself.
---
I place my camp around the whitespring area. I dont pay more than 25 caps going anywhere. I have 76 up north for those places and my camp in the south for the rest. It's not that long of a loading screen. You want a long wait try loading your inventory in Destiny 2 to swap weapons and then see what long is.
---
you have to select the text of spoilers to see the text
---
The bottom line is there is no solid place to search for large amounts of adhesive. The only steady source of adhesive is to grow your own. 
---
The one time I nuked the prime I just clipped the prime on the edge, leaving the caverns and 2 other nearby sites just outside the nuke zone.  Is it better to aim dead center on the other fissure, and if so why?  Just curious.
---
I'm going to visit this cause I always run out of stims super fast
---
I disagree. It is not the younger generation that invented this way of thinking. The baby boomers literally just elected a reality TV star as president...
---
I could see this working. There is already the side quest where the guards from the prison start hunting you down so they could use that coding.
---
Aim left of forward station delta and use FSD as a drop point
---
Where does one find lead extractor plans?
---
I realized the other day that almost all of my angst with FO76 was the simple result of hearing and reading so much hate online and irrationally buying into it. In reality, had I stayed away from all the hate, I think I would see the game no differently than I do FO3, FO4, and FONV: I love all three. If the time spent playing a game is any indicator, then FO76 must be my favorite game of all time; I'm at 191 hours as of last night. 
---
As an aside, I noticed more and more that a lot of people hating on the game have not themselves played the game. 
---
I find the brotherhood locations tend to have more duct tape and wonderglue than normal but other than that I find it to be completely random where I find it 
---
Atrocities? It‚Äôs a game... save that kind of outrage for real problems 
---
Gee, maybe take the hint and don't try to take and hold 5 workshops at once?
---
I own a medic and a two shot gatling plasma, both single star. Repairing them with weapon artisan gives additional durability but they never last long enough.  I carry a couple of gatling lasers as backup for long fights.
---
Cool. I wish the death-rad-mutation bug wasnt a thing. I'd be done. And I wouldnt have to risk forgetfulness ... I'm worried I'll forget to put Starched Genes on for my 30th run. :)
---
If you server hop between mutations to get past the timer, do you find half health sufficient to survive the mole men (which I run past) and get back inside? I'm level 98 so I'm probably fine with half health.
---
That‚Äôs what I would tell the Jews as I lm throwing them inside the gas chambers or the furnaces üòâ just let it go jew rat take it as it is I‚Äôll pass soon enough 
---
Can you possible believe that not everyone has the same experience as you?
---
On my purchased-last-christmas Xbox One, I hard freeze and crash or disconnect on average 4-5 times a day.
---
I will take pictures for you every single time if you really don't believe me.
---
I'll freeze buying something from a vendor. Or trying to trade. Or fast travelling. Or picking something up. Or placing something at a workshop. Or... There's no consistency that I can find. Sometimes the game just decides to stop working.
---
The best way to farm something is to pick up at least 1, then go to a workshop and craft 254 boards, then give your friend 20, craft 20 more, have friend trade you back the 20 so you have 274. At this point you'll be disconnected every single time you log in. So you can just wait for the disconnect. Log in. Throw the item you are farming on the ground. Wait for disconnect. Log in. Throw the item you are farming on the ground. Wait for disconnect....
---
What about dropping it? You can reclaim it after.
---
Ive landed directly on dozens of enemies with explosive vents and not once has it worked for me.
---
Literal means stupid that's an oxymoron. Ironically you're a redditor who is too stupid to make a proper sentence.
---
"Too literal to solve a riddle" means stupid. If you only perceive the literal reality of things you're stupid.
---
You simply can't do complex martial arts moves in PA. It requires a tiny bit of imagination which an incredibly literal brain could not conceive of, thus we've come full circle but you could at least be a tiny bit embarrassed about it.
---
Yea, NCCxPwnSausage Invite me to ur game and ill give you that
---
&gt;Yeah. I get he's a big fallout fan. But if you don't like something, there's really only so much you can say about not liking it. After a while it's clear someone is doing it for the attention.
---
There comes a point where it becomes an obsession though, and not a particularly healthy one.  It's good to be a fan of something and be passionate about it, but the moment it leads them down the path of going into rage mode because something isn't exactly what they expected, it's probably time to take a break from it.
---
Yea, I think I'm gonna switch to that one.
---
The game does not have massive issues.  It has a disconnect problem that happens periodically, just like most every other MMO, and they need to get that fixed quick.  But beyond that the game is extremely playable, and is not at all a grindy mess.  Posts like yours are what people are sick of, because it's patently false.
---
Nuke zones are there for hours. I had to learn that its okay to go back to you camp stabilize flux, repair weapons ect then come back.
---
I can't see a difference between what you're saying and this scenario: "The newspapers has said there is a sizeable group demonstration of people downtown yelling about how frisbee is a bad game, people who play frisbee are dummies, etc. I haven't seen them, and they're not in the park near my house, and it's just words. But I am suppressing my desire to play a game I like, *frisbee*, because of these far away people who I have not met trash talking the game I would like to play"
---
like, dude, FO76 isn't even like frisbee, you just have to sit in a chair and click a launch icon and you're in game.
---
why would you let other people control your actions? you paid for the game, enjoy it.
---
Origins is a bit of a stretch but it's a reference nonetheless :)
---
I seen challenges one day when logging out and decided to take a peek, its so much easier doing daily /weekly challenges now that im not just guessing what they are.
---
Its not really any harder to find the challenges than it is to find photomode.
---
Get curious when your bored, you'll find troves of info/neat stuff if you dig into the ui and game a little more.
---
There is also an ingame knowledge base that most people probably never use or knew existed.
---
Ha ha ha. I don't watch all his videos, but I saw that one.
---
It basically came down to this. Him complaining about being called out on things. Like when Bethesda had that data breach. He had a video out the same day, repeating all the claims from the Original post. 
---
Two days later, the full extent of what happened was reported, and it wasn't what people were saying it was. And certainly not the thousands of peoples credit card info being emailed out. Which is what his video was called.
---
It took over a week for him to put out a video updating the story, and then a few more days to go back and change his original video. Why not just take down the original video which was filled with nothing but rumors and lies you copied from reddit? Because that's one less video to your video count. 
---
These youtubers want to be seen as honest reviewers and critics. But they aren't. Most of lack any really understanding of what it means to review and be a critic.
---
And when you watch them play, they all come across as lazy gamers. They just want to shoot, kill, loot and repeat. Half of them don't even seem to fully understand how to do anything but that in games. 
---

T51b stat wise is the best, not by anything game breaking. Mods are the hardest to get.
---
The only thing that's better after nuking Fissure prime directly is a few more violet Flux spawns. My group stopped doing it that way ages ago. 
---
Just got in so gimme 5. You need the pulse mine plan by any chance?
---
I will say that there is some valid comparison in terms of the games state at release and the reception. The main difference (in my opinion) would the the way the game was marketed and what was promised by the devs. NMS promised *a lot* that it didn't deliver on at launch whereas FO76 didn't promise the moon. 
---
How does a mole rat burrow up 2 flights of stairs to get me? It does need to be cleaned bad.
---
How much budget do you need I tamed a death claw ad after about a minute or so went Agro again
---
Pick up every desk fan, globe and typewriter you find
---
I‚Äôll concede I‚Äôve misspoken. 
---
I‚Äôm not saying you have to grind, but frankly I‚Äôm at a point (50+) where it seems to be the only way to advance. I meant grindy because my gameplay seems to be - go to blast zone - kill - loot - drop all loot because I can‚Äôt carry - try to sell - repeat 
---
I do like that you can continue to fast travel to the 'retake the workshop' for free.  Btw, how does this mission show up, if at all, as an event to other people?
---
I know 'defend' missions pop up as public events, but I've never seen any but my own 'retake' mission.  If someone else shows up before me does it just turn into the usual 'take the workshop', just with all my stuff already built?
---
Server crashes from duppers dupping 
---
I got the hp recovery perk early.. but half health is more than enough, if you follow the rock flings you can get ontop the metal shack, or take a small left and be beside the shack with a hole in the wall. They barely hit me once. Then inside theres ussualy 3 radpups or wolf's. Twice there about aboit 5-6 mole men. Had to heal up for their barrage of missiles. 
---
I preferred 4's method where you could detach a mod and keep it.  As it stands if you want to detatch a scope from a rifle I imagine your character just whacks it with a hammer until it breaks because there's no other reason a mod should be destroyed when I can build the weapon itself from scratch.
---
I mean it does crash three times a day for me so not all claims are unfounded.  Why not just not watch YouTube?  
---
2 star and up items have multiple effects, inspect the armor to see a full list of effects it has. I have a 3 star auto stim metal leg piece that has +1 Per, Auto stim, and reduces food/drink weight by 20%.
---
It should not be if you are vendor hopping. Which is most of the scenario. Events tend to give you back + some on your fast travel investment.
---
.50 is pretty garbage for the hunting rifle. Lower damage, faster fire rate but I mean...I'd rather one shot stuff. 
---
Haven't seen a 308 for the combat rifle. 
---
Gauss rifle out classes either of them anyway. 
---
the red dead 2 guys are just salty their online is shit and they have lootboxes for ingame currency
---
If you use a recon scope, they're still marked after death. That's helped me when they're far away.
---
The game deserves it though. I know I will get hate for saying this in here. But just because you like the game doesn‚Äôt mean the majority do.
---
Would be nice if you provided mod name or link.
---
Pshh it took me 4 days to download fallout 76
---
What platforms are people playing that are having the most issues? Im on xbox and maybe i'm just lucky but I've only had a handful of disconnects which is much less than any COD I've ever played. Ive never gotten locked up and my only problem so far is i'm constantly overencumbered but my play style is a hoarder so.....
---
On PC? I can drop you like 3000 lbs of screws.
---
check out /fo76FilthyCasuals, hate free sub 
---
I second this! 
---
Gamertag: DingBingus
---
Except a lot of people that say "I haven't run into any bugs and I'm having a good time" have the balls to tell people that disconnect 4-5 times a day that they're dramaticizing a very real problem they're having?
---
Which is equally if not more shitty.
---
I want all servers to be a free for all with the option for passive mode if you dont wanna be "raided".
---
That sounds dirty 
---
&gt; There comes a point where it becomes an obsession though, and not a particularly healthy one. It's good to be a fan of something and be passionate about it, but the moment it leads them down the path of going into rage mode because something isn't exactly what they expected, it's probably time to take a break from it.
---
Or when you realize that being a dick about something, gets you attention. There's always that factor for anyone that does these kinds of youtube videos. They all do it for some level of attention. 
---
And when they see how popular other hate videos are, they all rush out to copy each other. Sometimes even quoting and stealing from each other.
---
They want their views to be respected, but they all copy each other. 
---
Component View -&gt; Screws
---
nah. if anythign they need to nerf the downsides of being wanted since there is no way to ge trid of it besides letting someone kill you, and sometimes people are too scared to try
---
I did the 'Powering Up...' events and knew of the generator plans rewarded from those, but wasn't aware other workshop events rewarding plans and have been vendor hopping for them until now. Thank you!
---
Okay, but why do you still play the game if it's such a mess? Why not ask for a refund or just write off the cost as a lesson learned and remember to not buy their next game (or wait til reviews or whatever)?
---
There are other threads with good locations or mobs that drop them (Yao Guai). Desk fans, globes, typewriters, and toy cars are your friends. 
---
Otherwise, if you have a healthy stream of caps, you can always buy bulk screws from vendors. That way, you‚Äôre not fixated on screws and just need to do what you can to make caps. Having Hard Bargain is recommended. 
---
Seems they know its a problem... I got lvl 5 gun thing and lucky draw, I might be able to get two cores out of my furious plasma gatling.
---
i used to offset my nuke so that the small building outside of the glassed caverns was out of the nuke zone, however 2/3rds of the time the queen would glitch out n we wouldnt be able to get the kill. centering on prime however, we've never had her glitch out. (this is on xb1 tho)
---
Oh, you don't need plans; if there's a resource node within your camp, the extractor will show up under "Resources" and you can build it on the node. 
---
You can see a map of all resource nodes here: https://i.imgur.com/9Rccgzd.png  
---
(NOTE: Some of the big clusters are actually workshops, so you can't camp there)
---
So essentially if the mob spawns are gone, then the outfit is likely gone too? I've been in there a few dozen times, and finally found the Blue one. And there were mobs present.
---
Activision selling reticle for a buck? Ah not worth it?
---
Blizzard focusing phones? Nah we just create few memes.
---
Rockstar making economy in RDR2 extra predatory and unbalanced? Nah singleplayer is fine, so this is fine.
---
Creators of Atlas create copy paste **** and screw everyone over? Nah they fix it its okay.
---
Seriously, Bethesda messed up with FO76 and lrts be honest lately been fueling a fire a lot. But i belive they are not only one, nor even the worst atm. And i dont see people hating as much as i do with FO76
---
Jim stole my sweet roll in gunsmith class. Anything he builds gets a gift from site bravo.
---
&gt; e violet Flux spawns. My group stopped doing it that way ages ago.
---
I did notice some of the violet flux areas that you'd miss out on if you didn't nuke the prime directly...  have a decent amount farmed now so less concerned about the flux itself.
---
Somebody who likes something allot if you. If you have any other questions don't hesitate.
---
Legendary exterminators spatula!  That will go great for my Spongebob character?  You on bazaar?  15,000 caps or $15 PayPal?  Go ahead and dup it a few times in case someone has a better offer before I get back online...
---
Especially since the nuka cola issue had nothing to do with bethesda or the game.
---
I‚Äôm lying?
---
Talk to me, engage. 
---
Don‚Äôt just bury your head in the sand. 
---
I went from a lacklustre attitude (after paying full price at launch) to actually playing a lot of it lately. I want it to be better. 
---
Is this game above criticism or should I just give blind adulation. 
---
for real, that shit's like some kinda 5-star legendary item. 
---
if you clip prime then you risk the queen going the wrong way, into the nuke. especially if there is someone not in your party running from that direction and kiting her into the blast  
---
if you center it on the other fissure, then she will not fly into the nuke zone unless you really really try to kite her there
---
YouTubers for me I‚Äôm down to 2-3. Cause they only focus on either lore or just having fun or camp building.

Everyone else I just tell the algorithm to ignore.

My current go to is razorgrain soup and cranberry relish. The later requires a bit of effort but I love the ap burst Regen and bonus exp is never bad. More perks means more trial and error.

I put up with assholes in real life enough already.  I don't need assholes in the games I play too.

That exists?

Everyone complains about the bugs and the problems about this game so much, but for me it hasn't been much different than any other open world games of this size.
---
I've played around 100 hours of Fallout 76 and I've been disconnected 4-5 times, had 2 graphics glitches (that went away after a few seconds) and the game froze once..........that's it.  Am I playing a different game than everyone else?  That's what it feels like sometimes.
---
I've played about 45 hours of Assassins Creed Odyssey and I've had about the same about of issues in half the game time (crashes/freezes etc.).  Seems normal to me for games like this.
---
I'm with you on this. Personally I don't understand the behavior of so many to buy a game, hate it, refuse to play it, and then smack talk it on every single social media post of the company, or those who like it or want to move forward playing the game.  As if liking or playing it is a sin and we need to shun the unbeliever. When did gamers become this?  Back in the day you bought a game and if you hated it you effing moved on with your life.  I don't know how people find the time to focus on putting this much energy towards despising things and voicing what's bad for everyone like a vegan or CrossFit clown at every opportunity, every single conversational crack in the door.  It's sad.  That's the only word I can find for the behavior.  I had a horrible dinner a month ago at a restaurant for a date night. It cost me about 60 bucks.  I put up one Yelp review and won't go back.  Other people like it.  Fine.  I don't feel the need to comment on every Facebook post of the restaurant.  That would be considered weird abberant behavior by most people.
---
I think the issue is that most people are (rightfully) pissed at bethesda. And because of that they think negatively of the game. It's the association ... Bethesda is fucking up, so Fallout 76 must suck.
---
But yeah, the game is good as far as I'm concerned.
---
It isn't a bad game at all. I think it's pretty great. But some aspects of the game's _state_ are pretty bad. For me specifically, duping and the lack of decent PVP are #1 and #2. Especially with duping I think the game's present and future economy and PvP are in jeopardy of total ruin but we'll see. Bethesda has yet to offer up any meaningful response so it's a waiting game for now.
---
The YouTube hate for this game long ago passed into absurd territory when the content recyclers were so hard up for something to make videos about that they each made 15 minute long self felating rants about how reddit was being mean to them. 
---
You‚Äôre really lucky man.  
---
I've yet to see any calibrated shocks, but I can't get into the enclave bunker yet either to check there.
---
Did they say you could do it at all the time or just that it could be done?
---
Ironically, you seem to be handling this pretty bad. Worse than most people.
---
yeah it's just...abysmal. he's putting out new videos that are literal clickbait now like "10 most interesting places FO76 has to offer" or some shit like that. but that video, the one of him bitching about people calling him out for his shenanigans...just really pissed me off. 
---
I agree, id be down for that. Turn off passive, now its open PvP. No slaps or anything. Turn on passive, back to how it was. I think passive mode should also eliminate or at least mitigate damage to CAMPS though. If CAMP damage was significantly nerfed they could make it still possible to destroy a CAMP but it would take a long enough time that the person could actually have time to show up and defend it. As it stands with powerful setups you can decimate an entire CAMP in a few moments really and it can take people almost a minute to load into an area.
---
I spend so much money on screws! LOL
---
Why oh why can we not sell ammo!
---
Let me know how it goes!
---
That was my fear. I hope for the best
---
FALLOUT 76 SUCKS: Getting disconnected now just as much as if there was no patch; more bugs in the game than in my backyard; when I play this nightmare of a game, it is only mostly to play with the people I made friends with (in it), other than that, I wouldn't give this game the time of day.
---
Overall Summary of everything I've experienced in this game, (not going to write it all here right now- would take way too long), and I come up with -0/10, and that in my book is being nice.
---
Have a real nice day.
---
I wouldn't mind some o that sweet BGS dosh. HEY BETHESDA, FALLOUT 76 IS HELLA RAD PAY ME PLS.
---
Do it doesn‚Äôt regen in under 4 seconds?
---
The issue there is that friends and the gaming press still watch youtube, and friends read articles that are sourced from youtube or reddit posts (or worse, articles that cite other articles that cite reddit as their source). So then it's "Wait, you're actually playing that? Isn't it \[hyperbolically bad\] for \[vague reasons\]?"
---
I'm not sure how much it's an age thing, though I'm right there with you at 33. But I've seen this with friends in their 40s and 20s.
---
I don't think the 10 pounds will do much to my 1700 lbs I am carrying .. but I am curious how none the less lol
---
I usually only pick up things I need, but I've been nomadic since launch because I fear the red menace finding where I live 
---
Not attacking Bethesda by saying this, but NMS might‚Äôve got less hate because it was an indie developer company with no real reputation. Bethesda have a very good reputation (despite complaints about 4 and skyrim being seen as decline for the series), so when 76 was in such a state it seemed like much more of a let down for many people. Equally though, NMS did cost ¬£50 or whatever IIRC so should really have been AAA standard.
---
Flatwoods! Haven‚Äôt checked that one for a good while, thanks for the tip. 
---
Ye happened today
---
I think people that are Wanted should be automatically attacked by friendly bots - go near Whitesprings, and on boy!
---
I agree, 3 disconnects in 2 days.  1 solo and the other 2 while on a team.  At launch i could forgive, but now?!  Come on...
---
R A D I A N T
---
How does someone making a 10 minute video on a site a billion hours of footage are uploaded every day prevent you from playing some game?
---
Just wait till you find out what the Korean YouTubers have been saying about people playing FO76 and you'll be even angrier.
---
Welcome to FO76, where the rules aren‚Äôt explained and legendary enemies drop shit gear 99% of the time. 
---
I spent nearly an hour powering up Poseidon - and then my game froze. I was livid
---
Honestly I think a lot of the noise comes from the PR disasters Bethesda kept throwing out with the PA edition helmet bag, leaking personal information and being caught out for outright lying about the game before released (as discovered after release).
---
Most of the flak I see is regarding Bethesda's handling of the issues, not the gameplay issues themselves. 
---
Did you watch Yahtzee stream it? 500 viewers, he had one goomba dedicated to nothing but reading chat out loud, and he had the AUDACITY to complain there wasn't enough social interaction! C'mon!
---
I've never seen anyone with more potential players who has less of an imagination and is less willing to put in any kind of effort. He should stick to his own lane - single players.
---
All i can see is endless potential for role play scenarios including PVP and how dedicated most of you are to grinding no matter what.
---
For the record Destiny 2 got about as much hate and had objectively way less content. Monster Hunter PC was unplayable for the 1st month or so.
---
Real role players vs munchkins is a conversation as old as the internet.
---
I think I got it after launching a nuke or after finishing some end game quest. I can't remember sorry. 
---
Pretty much this, I have been working on getting a full set of the weightless wood armor for just this reason.  
---
When you fast travel there you see a hole in a building with display cases and vases in it (can find marine armor plans here). Travel out the back door and you will be in a alley at the back of the alley there will be a deck he is on. 
---
PhilosophyTube is really interesting, especially for political philosophy. He's very left-leaning, so it's not *entirely* neutral, but it's fascinating just on its own, and if you fancy getting into Left-tube a bit, Shaun and Hbomberguy do a mix of videogame stuff and political commentary. ContraPoints is the top tier - slightly mad blond trans lady who dresses up in mad costumes to do philosophical shit after she quit academic philosophy because it was too boring. She's the best one.
---
Ha, I tried to plow through the main storyline, because a couple of buddies are already ahead of me and dropping nukes everywhere. At level 46, Watoga shouldn't be too tricky for you, but 1) you might want to save Mayor for a Day when you're past 50, and have plenty of ammo and 2) make sure you have a good amount of stimpacks, there are usually enemies galore in Watoga. 
---
re: Higher level enemies, it is kind of just certain types you have to watch out for. Feral ghouls, for example, aren't a major concern at any level, especially if you can find some high ground. Scorched also aren't that bad, just because they usually lack good weaponry. Super mutants can be tricky, because they'll often have rocket launchers (half the time they'll miss you, but instead hit a car that'll blow you up REAL good); anglers are annoyingly durable; and oddly, Mr. Gutsy is now the deadliest thing in the god damn Fallout universe. 
---
I did not mean that really, I mean any modern or current fallout from the last several decades that might in any way be relevant to this thread.  Anyone can nitpick, but it doesn't really affect the conversation.  I am pretty sure fallout 1-2 didn't have any concept of gender assumption either, since that wasn't really a topical thing 20 years ago.
---
Games have been releasing in broken or buggy states despite being AAA titles for decades, this is nothing new.  Definitely not an excuse, but it's not like FO76 was the first to pioneer this crappy tactic.
---
Also, it's up to gamers to decide whether or not to spend their money.  I pre-ordered 76 and I enjoyed it for a while, but now I'm taking a break from it until there's some significant changes and fixes to it.  Right now it's not worth my time.  
---
If people bought the game despite the warnings - even from Todd himself - they really have no leg to stand on and complain that the game is pretty much exactly what they were warned it would be like.  That's something BSW shouldn't take the blame for.
---
BSW should, however, bear full responsibility for allowing a game to ship that was in late Alpha, at best.  That is something that should have never happened.
---
Ultimately, I made the choice to put money down for it without knowing much about it, and I'm not going to try to shift blame onto BSW that they "screwed me", since the only person who can take the blame for my actions is me - the same as everyone else who bought the game.
---
Facts will get you downvoted, lol.
---
Its like with the bags. The ones screaming the most are not the ones who actually bought it.
---
Lower levels I was always in need of more adhesive, but having an area at camp to grow corn, mutfruit, and tato, along with water production, green thumb perk card was a good start. 
---
Combined with picking up duct tape and wonderglue and was pretty easy to always have enough. Ghouls often have these on them. 
---
There's a duct tape that will always spawn for all players at the overseer's camp, could server hop there if you don't mind doing that, a lot of hassle for one adhesive and searching around should provide enough. 
---
Thats why i only really watch a handful of gaming youtubers, Robbaz, the killian experience amd 1 or 2 others that are game specific like bestinslot for jurassic park evolution videos.  
---
I watch juicehead quite a bit too, i know he gets a lot of flak in here but i think hes an alright guy, he acknowledges when he messes up so that ok in my books.  
---
The youtubers i was put off of an unsubbed from were the ones that went batshit crazy when E3 said it was going to be multiplayer, and thats when i knew there was a hate train that was always going to be targeting the game in the hopes of making it fail
---
I‚Äôm on pc 
---
i like the game, bethesda really does deserve harsh criticism though. they're really scummy and i don't think they have an honest model for making money.
---
There is a mod that lets you basically do that in fallout 4 "Do it yourself". This would be the safest and easiest implementation of your idea. Because by the sounds of it your idea is similar to OCD placer and I don't think that would work out very well since it's still putting junk into the world, just locking it in place. Though it might O.O. I can't say I know how OCD deals with loading objects.
---
All I got to say is I bought Fallout 76 3 days ago... and I have put in 4-5 hours(limited due to weekend plans)! Not once have I crashed or glitched during gameplay and I‚Äôve had loads of fun!
---
I‚Äôve come across 10 other players roughly and 9/10 of those people were either extremely helpful in explaining the games mechanics or dropped a stimpack or so to help me out! That 1/10 guy said hello and went on his way. He was neither rude nor toxic!
---
The community is amazing. I used to play Ark and THAT is the definition of a toxic community. 
---
After believing all these terrible things I‚Äôve heard(and I have no doubt that at launch every complaint was viable) I‚Äôm realizing now that very few stand valid at this point. 
---
You just have to keep in mind every game comes with a glitch / bug here and there. Bethesda has given me no reason to be worried about launching a game and forgetting about it. It seems like they‚Äôre putting in the effort to make it better as time progresses.
---
Yeah, I agree, but with the explosive damage stacking with the rifle damage people are boasting 1600 damage with their Gauss rifle. It really is the explosive part that's ridiculous, and that's what needs to get nerfed. At least in PvP. 
---
I hate that too. I felt silly frankly paying full price for a game which dropped to 20quid a few weeks after launch. I was livid. 
---
Yeah it had been shat on - too much. But it has issues 
---
IMO, you are being too humble because it's a fact that Ashur's armor was too rad!  Current gen graphics would make it!  While the developers are at it... can we get some Road Leathers that don't look like they are painted on? 
---
Happened 3 times in 5-6 hours yesterday - this is not normal lol what are you playing it on?
---
If you're on PC I would take a plan as well if you're not to greedy üòÅ
---
I belong
---
Eh. I've been injured for 4 months now. 76 is what's keeping me from thinking about it. 
---
I love you mate (no homo). Finally someone who acknowledges the issues of the game but still dislikes the clickbaiting people do on the frontpage.
---
Okay I'll play along, so what is a "hardcore fallout fan" in the context of someone who likes the series a lot but was "disappointed" by Fallout 4 (and, presumably from your post, Fallout 76)?
---
Because I happen to like the series quite a bit and still enjoyed FO4 and FO76 a great deal. 
---
FALLOUT 76 SUCKS BECAUSE SOMEONE TOLD ME IT SUCKS REEE (I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY PLAYED IT BUT YEAH!)
---
Seems to be half these people. 
---
&gt;Even No Man's Sky didn't get this much obnoxious noise. 
---
Because this is Bethesda we're talking about here. We expected a lot more. 
---
this will not stop. It's an easy way to get clicks, and likes.  
---
See No Man's Sky and Sea of Thieves. People still talk shit about them but those games are now very much fixed and actually fun to play.  
---
Even PUBG is still getting shit even though it bounced back and is currently at one of the best states it's ever been 
---
I really want to play Fallout 76. I'm waiting a full year until it's worth my time and energy. If it's still a shit show I'll find something else to waste my time on.
---
The Harper‚Äôs Ferry vendorbot should have one. He also carries the advanced power connector plans too. I would definitely recommend getting both. The brick plans are 420 caps but I can‚Äôt remember the price of the other. The advanced power connectors have power poles, switches, and conduit which are all pretty clutch. 
---
I am :) that said I‚Äôm out of caps at the moment, so I‚Äôll need to get some more first so I can buy another one. 
---
Got it at Watoga myself
---
Not all weapons can have a recon scope and if you mark stuff and change, the mark is lost.
---
I always believe you should make up your own mind on something, how many resteraunts or foods would you have missed out on based on other peoples opinions, how many times have yu tried something because your heard it was good only to have it be awful.  Everyone has different things they like so you wont ever know unless you try it for yourself
---
I‚Äôve actually seen none of these videos. Seen plenty of weight tips, builds, perks and loot tips. I never went looking for the hate 
---
couldn't agree more. it's fun at times, but shit I get more crashes in this game than I ever did in my games in fallout4/skyrim with over 500 mods working at once, it's insane really.
---
That and the lag in the server is just not acceptable. I understand dupers, but bethesda has down nothing to combat them at all.
---
 or the server issues.
---
PC. When I fast travel I just get an infinite loading screen with music playing. Even closed the game with task manager and the music kept playing lol. 
---
I think that is their minimum level
---
Keep in mind:
---
&gt;Youtubers earn easy likes / views for surfing on the hate wave.  
---
&gt;People earn easy karma for shitting fo76 on gaming related subreddits.  
---
&gt;Clickbaity news websites earn easy clicks for soaking the game of piss.  
---
&gt;Also, it's warm &amp; comfortable to be part of a circle jerk.
---
Everyone is as much free to support &amp; enjoy the game as the next guy who never really played but constantly spread BS &amp; shite on it, whether if the hate is genuine or if it is used as a beneficial way for their own business.
---
At some point the interest will naturally vanish and everyone will move on to the next target, until then don't bother checking everything, cherry pick few youtubers that actually support the game and post interesting content (IDK who, but I'm sure you'll find), maybe you could stop checking news or gaming subs if it pisses you off.
---
I stash my junk and carry everything else. I have have recently taken all my junk and given it all to my alt character and started again. Never carry your junk, most certainly never carry your most valuable junk like springs, screws, gears. Only carry stuff you don't care about.
---
You can get other perks like truhiker to reduce weight on other stuff and weapons, but stash your junk.
---
Also there was a thread about junk which I thought I was useful, the guy discussed about much of each junk you should keep, it was pretty useful, then sell or dump the rest. I will find the link
---
Wait a minute... You can tame animals? What?
---
How.many double shot guass rifles have you shrugged off?
---
Can you possibly believe that not everyone has the same experience as you? It seems like a lot of ppl are saying "I had this issue so everyone else is going to too" I dont play on consoles so I cant really comment on that
---
tl;dr: they're becoming more like EA 
---
It's vastly oversimplified when put like that, but their behaviour (and what you've pointed out) really makes the comparison sing 
---
this is actually one of the most poignant posts ever made on this sub yet it got downvoted.  a utter lack of meaningful content means we can't discuss the fucking game itself or its story.  even the most interesting characters of the game are just shadows, memories, corpses.  Compare that to a living breathing Caesar, Mr. House, The Master, etc.
---
The only characters in the game is Grahm who just talks about meat and trading.  Rose who is unbearably annoying and MODUS who is pretty cool.
---
I was an OG No Mans Sky player. That game got so much hate the subreddit had to essentially be turned off for a day or two. Despite all the nonsense that 76 has gotten, and deservedly so (I've been a fallout fan since 3, and lived every single game in the series up to this very game), No Mans Sky was an even bigger fiasco and I quite often caught flak for preordering it from friends and coworkers.
---
Honestly, this game sucks. People are voicing their opinions. They have every right to say what they want, just as you do, so.... suck it up?
---
I have to go back to the 90's to find a MP game that has disconnected from server as much as this game
---
What's the wet medium?  I want to say watercolor, but some looks like alcohol inks.
---
WTB brain homey. 100 atoms.
---
That is truem. Just fyi i haven't played fo76 yet and I have played NMS, but omly a year and a half after launch. Despite all the issues, I still want to get fo76 as well. What i observe it is more as an outsider looking in at the moment.
---
Perfect reply, thank you!
---
I got a TSE laser rifle. Thing would break after literally 3 reloads. Maybe 60 automatic shots if you're lucky. I gave it to a fresh level 50. Felt kinda mean to be honest. Great gun but impossible to maintain. 
---
The problem is not watching them but scrolling past 40,000 clickbait videos
---
I don't, but I appreciate it
---
It took me some time to justify the cost, but it worth it for me.  Eventually, I stopped needing as many screws and springs became scarce for me. I still hit my favorite farming spots when I can to keep from running out. 
---
I made a 2nd just for a mule.  Might make a 3rd and 4th just for mules.  
---
That one is good but full of asshole dupers spamming stuff and then they only want irl cash. They are so many. I am just happy I am not on Xbox because that seems to be dupers paradise.
---
The dupers has stopped posting obvious ‚Äùi have it all‚Äù so it is even more annoying know when you spend time contacting a trader that after a while turns out to be a duper with paypal only.
---
Traded a few ‚Äùnormal‚Äù items om Bazaar though which was very nice. Only two shot etc.
---
I ran out of springs, have plenty of screws...  Is there a Toaster factory I have missed?  At least I assume toasters have springs.
---
Sure they do.
---
Blizzard put a several big ones down on their fanbase over the last year or so.
---
Cheers, that was a bargain!
---
Because basic game functionality is definitely something we should have to spend perk points on
---
There‚Äôs one or two youtubers that don‚Äôt trash it all the time but you‚Äôre right. The majority of the trashing it gets pretty annoying.
---
If your good no. The only reason I die without power armor is the stupid stagger ghouls do when you are running away
---
It's just 76 plays similar to FO4 on survival. I know a lot of people chose not to play FO4 on survival so coming to 76 is a bit of a learning curve for those people.
---
Ah, yeah, I'm on the other side. I was super interested in NMS when it was announced but I didn't have the money for it at the time (which I guess was a small blessing). Seems like they've done a decent job of fixing up the game to be more in line with their initial promises. 
---
As for FO76, I've got several different characters already (lvls 97, 79, and 15) and have played both in groups as well as solo (mostly solo). It's definitely in need of some more polishing, but I've yet to run out of content to enjoy and other than graphical bugs, some disconnects, and some lag, the gameplay itself has been pretty satisfying. 
---
Same here. I never watch you tube videos about games and never will. It is just some random person with a usually negative viewpoint and I could not give less of a shit about them or their opinion. It is amazing how peopke on youtube can make a living, it amazes me people actually watch them. What is even more astounding is that streaming gameplay is a thing. Who the fuck would want to watch someone else play a video game? Play it yourself.
---
Dude the game was made for trading. You can get shocks any day of the week by just trading. They are going for 2000 caps right now. That 2 days of vendor selling. 
---
Server hopping to fet ghoul spawns. Is cool, but not how the game was meant to be played. The weapons you are after are rare. The dupers fucked it up. But youre not supposed to be able to get unlimited guns from a nuke. I clear the queen sih and without tse weapons.  It a big deal. 
---
I will say this, you are a breath of fresh air. At least you played it til a good level then gave artuculate points of why you quit. Instead of the whining like other do who only made it to level 10. 
---
Actually my Level 50 T60 has better stats the 51 and the X01 you showed.
---
Also, Oxhorn is around level 70 and has maintained a very positive attitude about the game and seems to be enjoying himself despite the bugs. He is completely unaware of the duping issue. He's level 70ish and doesn't care about finding legendary gear at all it seems.  
---
I have taken it upon myself to start reading all the notes and terminals out loud as Oxhorn does and it has made the game much more enjoyable for me. I think the secret is the slower pace. Leveling, farming, grinding... all that stuff is soul crushing for me if that's the only thing to do. And to see how many people have given in to envy and greed and purchased or duped gear sucks. The game is hardly competetive in its current state and yet there is a rat race to hoard all the best stuff. 
---
Oxhorn's playstyle is where it's at. Focusing on the lore and slowly unraveling the story bit by bit. I think of the story as like a bottle that's smashed into a thousand pieces and assembling it back together takes time and patience. Hence why I think so many negative people are saying "there's no story" like it was a fact. They don't have the time nor the inclanation to go through it and that's fine. But there is a story and I like it a lot so far.
---
I only watched his review videos. They're a few minutes at a time. I don't have time to watch a streaming session.
---
In the FO2 cut content there‚Äôs a faction that dedicates to the homosexual rights, the faction is obviously a sarcasm to the real life activists. 
---
Also there is a bug with when you die, if you die twice and pick up junk on the way back to your first bag and die again, you lose your first bag, too many bad ways to lose your stuff, not worth the headache. You probably know this by now.
---
I carry about 1700lbs on me and walk everywhere, but try to never carry junk on myself and stash it asap, I still lose junk now and then from that bug above, but most of my junk is safe.
---
You've clearly found a way to equip Wild Wasteland.
---
Come on over to r/fo76FilthyCasuals.  It's like r/fo76, without all the whining and hate.
---
The Enclave first tried to do generic engineering to trigger Defcon 1 and that appeared to fail. Then they discovered a hidden Chinese factory that was building a Commie bot army and unleashed it. However that was not a enough, so they went to West Tek and reactivated the FEV vats to unleash the Super Mutants. Which also failed to get defcon 1, however at this point their scouts noticed a odd creature in the cave where they did the "failed" generic engineering testing. Which turned into the ScorchBeast Queen upon further enhancements. 
---
I'm glad you posted that because my constant freezes make me question my computer WHICH I JUST BUILT and handles all other games flawlessly. I can walk around downtown boston in F04 with graphics on HIGH with NO PROBLEM but this game? get out of my PA and FREEEEEEZE
---
JUMP and FREEEEEZE
---
UGH
---
Literally no one is ignoring the issues. 
---
I don't normally wade into these discussions, but damn man, why are you being such an apologist?
---
You victim blame him for buying their dumpster fire of a game, saying that it's standard practice now to release games like that and that he should have known better. Of course, pre ordering was a bad idea. But so was releasing the game in the state it was released. The company deserves to have their behaviour highlighted and their reputation tarnished. 
---
The same applies to the canvas bags. The publisher made a shitty decision. It deserves to be derided. Apologising and correcting the mistake only came about because people made a big deal about it.
---
Regarding the atom store, your comparison to fortnite is similarly terrible. You're comparing a triple A priced game to a free to play game. I reinstalled fallout 4 the other day for fun and was amazed to be reminded how much content was available in the settlement building menu. That's even without mods expanding the options. Fallout 76 locks so much behind terrible prices and a laughably slow grind for atoms. For the price of a paint scheme for power armour in fallout 76 you could buy a whole settlement expansion full of items in fallout 4. That's a really unfortunate direction for the game for anyone but a shareholder. 
---
volume control on output device?
---
The problem with that is a lot of print places arent cool with fanfic publishing for books, and not sure if I'd get sued or not if I put it up somewhere or how long it'd last of I tried selling... maybe be able to get away with doing the pages somewhere
---
I‚Äôll concede some points but there‚Äôs so many posters refusing to hear any negatives. 
---
Once again I‚Äôll say this game has really been shat on but it also has a lot it can improve 
---
The game is not in the exact same state it was on the day of launch, it seems that the disconnects are getting worse
---
It's like he's doing some half assed job to save his reputation. But I'm not buying it. Like in the Is Fallout 76 video really that bad, he makes it seem like that in the month and half, things have dramatically changed.
---
Not really. The majority of changes have been fixing things. Me personally, I never experienced so many bugs, that got to frustrated. I don't experience disconnects at the rate some people claim. (My favorite was 4 disconnects in one minute. Not believing that.)
---
There hasn't been any new content added. There hasn't been any major changes to any systems in the game. So at best, all he can do is review if the bugs are indeed fixed. 
---
Instead he spends a large amount of time talking about how poorly the game is rated, how stores are lowering prices just to get rid of inventory (he doesn't know why they lowered prices, but he's going to tell you why). 
---
It's all game bashing trying to be positive. Not falling for it. 
---
The game is definitely enjoyed by far more than they would care to admit. 
---
Workshops are a nice thing to hold while you're out exploring. 
---
When I log on I usually grab one with resources I need, set up extractors, complete the first defense mission, then off I go to do whatever else I want. 
---
I only go back during defense missions. Which also gives me an opportunity to empty extractors. You also get a nice stream of plans and stims.
---
Bonus point if you capture it with a team. This way if someone gets d/c'd you can just join back up. 
---
First point: right, because I'm not a robot racist; my point was clearly about taking orders and death threats from a peppy level 7 cheerleader I could kill without breaking a sweat, as proven by the fact that I've annihilated far tougher things of a far higher level. whoosh #1
---
Thanks for telling me what I "must be" doing, but you're wrong, and it's got nothing to do with anything. Rose's message about starting to like you, btw, is a bug with that stage of the quest. You may have noticed similar effects with other quests; or perhaps you haven't. whoosh #2
---
thanks for playing tho
---
Your pets can catch it? or you just got a scorched one?
---
I think OP idea was that you can set bounty on people who have killed you or destroyed your base.
---
Here‚Äôs a pic to prove it.

Cool story nerd 
---
A lot of fire here today. Some of us legitimately acquired our legendary items, however, they are very very rare. 
---
I am currently a legitimate lvl 102, meaning that I have never XP farmed at the golf course, and I have exactly 1 2 star TSE handmade. It dropped for me from a legendary during 'Uranium Fever', and I have never encountered another TSE anything ever since.
---
I have heard that most people prior to "Dupe-Gate" were legitimately picking them up at the golf course through loot/XP farming.
---
These are incredible! Thank you for sharing!
---
The fact is that the majority of gamers who tried FO76 aren't happy with it, and not much has changed to make me want to give it another shot. In my opinion, it's a terrible game - and i'll say it 150,000 times if i want to. Welcome to the internet. It completely up to you to watch the content or not. But fact of the matter is, discussion of such, the clickbait titles, the vids.. they all make decent revenue. You have to ask yourself who is the real 'hater' here... a couple comments on a YT vid or a guy who hits up reddit with a 750 word spew of saltiness? 
---
Ehhhh k
---
I haven't fast traveled in over a month. Best decision I ever made. Gotta stop at every location on the way to my destination. See things I missed on the first pass.
---
Sometimes when I post them on Deviant art I cut and paste the script into the description but I havent gone back and done it for all of them https://www.deviantart.com/drunkfu
---
Did anyone else get that one, nice ref +1
---
Yeah, check out nexusmods. 
---
I have yet to  be able to do it without a disconnect. Solo that is. With a team we've done it. But I've tried so many times and it disconnects. WTF
---
or when you turn music all the way down in the settings, you shouldn't have to listen to it when you start the game 
---
Haha, I feel like I‚Äôm in the same boat, there.  I‚Äôm cautiously peeking at his channel for new videos and thinking ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôve been there already I think this safe‚Äù
---
Also I‚Äôll always recommend Norespawns to anyone who loves building.  He‚Äôs got a lot of fun videos and is an all around delightful fellow to listen to.
---
Literally I've seen posts call this game flawless.
---
Yeah, that was basically the long and short of it. You get probably 15% more? It's not worth the convenience of fast traveling directly to the queen and fighting her without radiation. I still wound up with about 80 raw violet last night when we put the prime sit on the edge of the nuke.
---
Edit: with green thumb, which you should always be using when picking nuked flora.
---
i'm (mostly really) sorry i just couldn't resist any more &gt;.&gt;
---
King of the hill style i like it
---
xd got eem 
---
ugh, i was doing the order of mysteries yesterday and pleasant valley was FULL of level 68 Supermutant Warlords. i can comfortably handle 3 or 4 at a time but there was about a dozen of them all grouped up at the bottom of the cliff i was on top off. I was kind of excited though because it was the perfect opportunity to try out my new Daisycutter!
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
From the train station vendor? Or another location?
---
I get what you are saying - personally I think we should ultimately move away from the weight system completely regarding the stash - and instead move to a system of number of items slots for weapons/armor (like 100 combined) - with the rest of the stackables not contributing towards this limit.
---
This would be similar to diablo 3 or other MMOs limits on tracking items.
---

---
 &gt; These are incredible! Thank you for sharing!
---
Also instead of pack rat, look at strong back instead. Also if you a PA user, use the escavator PA and every point in strength gives you can extra 5 carry weight. I think I am up to around 445 carry weight with the PA.
---
My hope is we will get more stash and these issues will go away, but here is hoping.
---
No, criticism is great, I want the game to get better.  But it does not have massive problems.  It needs pvp balancing, just like every other pvp-centric MMO needs at release, and it needs server stability.  Some engine optimization would be nice.  But the gameplay loop is strong and enjoyable.
---
So many softies on here. Damn. There are barely any good multiplayer games that don't have at least some element in PvP of them now. Honestly, I think if you need to play PVE in order to play games and enjoy them you are going to start having a much more limited library that you will get to pick from in the future.
---
So white springs doesnt lag even without being nuked?
---
Nuked prime site doesnt lag while fighting SBQ?
---
You have never been kicked from the server?
---
Never had items disappear off a mob while you are looting it?
---
These are only some of the bugs all platforms are dealing with. If none of this has ever happened to you then you are the luckiest person ever and should play the lotto asap. 
---
Yeh I have a nice house it's practical and looks great but it feels not lived in 
---
&gt;We expected a lot more.
---
From a company that is literally known to put out buggy games and has a meme name about them based on said bugs. 
---
Not sure how that is possible as that was taken directly from game. Photos included.
---
Some screens would help. As would knowledge of build, perks, etc.
---
Individual servers do that
---
Yes. Thank you. 
---
327 comments and not one upvote 
---
Hey thanks!
---
LOL. Whoosh to you.
---
I think your just mad because you got figured out. Human, robot. The reason she can talk with you is because of the quest you first did with her anyway. 
---
Thanks for being whiny! Are you sure you have the right metal to survive in the wastelands?
---
May the *cores* be with you...
---
Thanks - good to know!  I'll know where to nuke next time.
---
As a reward for joining the order of mysteries we should get the hidden entrance plans for our CAMP. Not sure what else to call the folding wall (the one after the lasers). I could see the secret elevator/preservation center as an Atom Shop item. The motorized tapestry/room divider would also be sweet. I would love to make a 'den of mysteries' satellite office.
---
I would love the "read" option. Not having everything as black ink on faded, dark brow paper would go a long way too.
---
ya, it's very BGS :(
---
Fanboys of any media will throw a fit if you criticise anything about it. It's not exactly exclusive to FO76. Just try to engage more with people who are willing to compromise or concede some points rather than people who call you a liar when you list your issues. 
---
Rocking the same deal I am I see :)
---
It is so very good.
---
Keep 100 of each junk scrap and sell the rest. I never carry junk on me.
---
For real, I can‚Äôt tell if Juicehead even likes the game as opposed to staying on the fence about it
---
Don't insult my game
---
I'm special 
---
BabyRage Omegalul
---
Why pay any attention? 
---
&gt;I just want to see one video where Bethesda is actually being acknowledged for making changes to the game. ONE. Because everyone is acting like the game is in the exact same state it was on the day of launch and it's almost maddening.
---
I mean I twitch to like a whole 10 followers, whenever I play the game I always talk about the improvements over day 1 of BETA (even though I only played a few hours due to the download fiasco)..but still, that's an improvement..I have my fair share of complaints but pretty much every time I play the game im making some comment about how cool this or that is, or the lore behind something, etc...now I'm VERY casual gamer (still level 13!) but I do believe it's come along way since day 1 of BETA release, sure there's room for improvement, but I'm sure they'll address them in due time..
---
right now the biggest seems to be the duping....
---
It's 960 from a vendor in game. It's not alot if you grind the game and sell stuff you pick up. Also it's a high level plan for a low level player. Most people are selling them around 3k. 800 is a steal. 
---
I find it funny when people say 76 has ruined Bethesda forever, yet people instantly forgot how scummy Rockstar are with the micro-transactions and pay walls in their Online modes when they produced a great single player experience. 
---
People seem to bash on Bethesda for such dumb shit too, that almost every dev does normally, and they're no where near as nefarious as some companies, yet Bethesda right now are Satan's spawn to some people. It's ridiculous. 
---
Watch cat videos instead of fo76 videos? 
---
 Seriously though, if you are having fun does it matter that others aren't? 
---
 I have ups and downs but overall I like it. 
---
Well according to the lore, the scorchbeasts are not the reason that it is set to defcon 1 at the moment. The enclave knew about momma dulce's being a communist front and released the liberators in Appalachia to trick the AI into believing a communist invasion was imminent.
---
They had voice actors dude. 
---
Stash the junk, or scrap it then stash it.  I was wondering around over the weekend looking for a stash box, went to the north side of the town lookin for the Red Rocket, and died around the corner from a train station.  so wish I had searched the south side of town (or the frigging train tracks) I ended up loosing all my Black Titanium I had just managed to get from Mole men.  
---
Sounds like you just keep way too much stuff. There is a rare need for more than 100-150 of anything and that'll only take maybe 300 of your stash 
---
My favorite parts are the lies. I have some friends who don't wanna play the game because they heard lies. Like subscriptions and paid lootboxes. Its baffling how I try to convince them they aren't true. But YouTube wouldn't lie
---
Lol chill...most people hate this game. But how does it stop you from liking it?
---
THANK YOU! Jesus christ that shit was fucking pathetic. 
---
I got them yesterday, thankfully. Just hunting screws down now 
---
Thanks for your input. I couldn't figure out why I liked the game so much vs F4 but hearing you mention resource scarcity helps. I still think stash is too small, but manageable.
---
I remember a week ago there was 3 separate articles on snapchat cashing in on the hate train lol
---
I have good vision and both of these are problems for me too.  This is not just an accessibility issue, it sucks for all of us.  I'd like a corpse highlighting option in VATS.
---
Its just the sheer amount of them. Like if you look up a guide for 76 you get 40k clickbait titles and why the game sucks the next time you refresh the page.
---
That costs the same as a standard triple A title at launch and had a large shroud of mystery around it outside the outlandish things Todd said? Where did they ever call it early access? Please share the link.
---
My wife and I play coop on a ps4 console each, and we get the "invisible teammate" bug all the time. Very frustrating!
---
This seems to happen when both players fast travel, or enter new areas at the same time. 
---
However, I did stumble upon another thread which detailed a way to avoid this, when fast travelling or entering a building etc. Ensure to do this one at a time, wait until fully loaded into the area then the second player may travel / enter door etc. Seems to fix this 90% of the time! 
---
Yeah, slot in green thumb (I've got 6 points in perception, usually running the shotgun perk and glow sight, so I just switch out with glow sight) when you're done killing trash mobs and go picking. 
---
Think you may have failed to totally understand the hate. It's not just that fo76 is a bad unfinished mess (that some like which is their call as is disliking it) but rather that Bethesda and Todd have fucked up as a company in every way possible since launch.
---
Ita bigger issue than the game
---
Thanks for the tips! Is the Gatling the only one affected by that perk? 
---
You loaded in faster than the server. Someone already cleared them out and the server is corpsing them.
---
I'll have to check my perks... I know I have both of those, but not fully leveled probably (or equipped?)
---
No I feel responsible as a gamer who bought this for $60 to blindly enjoy it and lose sleep over people writing mean things about it! Its my CALL OF DUTY!
---
What'im trying to say is that if you have played the game (lvl 100 here) you gotta admit that this game has some serious problems. And really when saying" serious problem" I'm being nice the game is barely playable.
---
35 here. Used to work in arts criticism when I was late teens/ early 20s. I thought being the critic for a national required some super special skill - nope, just some guy. Sure they have *talent*, *writing skill* and *desire* to do it - but so do youtubers. Really there's no difference between a critic who writes and a critic who films except for delivery. It's as credable any other form of criticism. 
---
&gt; You also get a nice stream of plans and stims.
---
Stims I have aplenty, and the plans I usually get are worthless dupes. 
---
:(
---
You didn't answer my question. Just chose to deflect with a vague implication. Okay then. 
---
Just don't look then. You're not special. 
---
I am by no means an apologist, I just enjoy the game and detest seeing issues being overblown, much like the OP here. I‚Äôm Not blaming the commenter I replied to, but rather the market as a whole. Market conditions such as preordering as the default means of purchase have allowed companies to get away with this crap. The rising cost of game development has changed what we get for $60 in a game. The expectation is now that additional content will be sold after the fact and there will be issues. With development on multiple platforms for varied hardware setups, there‚Äôs simply no way to test all possible condition. Bugs happen even with the best quality control, and exploit crop up and need patching. That happens with every game/piece of software in existence. The solution to these problems is to simply not buy a game until you see it in action, which will force games to release in a better state. 
---
If you‚Äôre not OK with fortnite (which was initially a full priced game by the way) and it‚Äôs battle Royale micro transactions, consider the cost of its PvE micro transaction loot boxes, many items/loot boxes sold for upwards of $10 there. Call of duty runs it‚Äôs own lootbox system from a $60 game, and has for several iterations now. Halo had req packs, overwatch was $40 but still had lootboxes with crap odds and limited events where items were available to push sales. Destiny 2 now sells special skin packs for $15. Micro transactions in that range simply aren‚Äôt uncommon. Not only that, but fallout 4 had paid workshop DLC that funded the creation of additional items, and the atom shop skins (aside form a few power armor paints) are not included in the game. 
---
I don't understand, your statement is too...

(‚Ä¢\_‚Ä¢)

...General.
---
For some odd reason the Bos Paint Job Make T60 best Armor in the game...after your repair to 200..% and the fact it‚Äôs the cheapest to repair and maintain.
---
You're either a total tool or bethesda's little pr stunt on reddit. 
---
Yes I play F76, and yes I fully agree with the hate the game is getting.
---
How can you in good conscience think Bethesda, and F76 are the victims here. Why stand up for a company that fucks with you, do you get kicks out of being a doormat? If so that's cool but take that elsewhere.
---
Or just send Todd your fucking credit card and bank details. If you haven't already that is.
---
I was good for screws for so long! It was springs or gears! Now its leather, rubber and screws! LOL - constantly searching for parts! The Fallout way!
---
Oh this post again 
---
i play on a team of 4 and every single night at least one of us is completely invisible, another is long boi, another will have only 1 piece of power armor showing and other wise be necked.  its half of my in game screenshots.  HILARIOUS!  the completely invisible teammate is annoying....but the other is too funny.  ive wondered if it was because there were 4 of us in one spot all the time causing the problem.  who knows
---
Love how the in the comments we got the same old stuff OP was complaining about, lol.
---
Agree with OP by the way. I've listened to the whole diatribe, still bought the game for Christmas, still having fun with a friend. 
---
Sure issues, sure it could have been better but honestly we come from Overwatch and I'm a lot happier dealing with some disconnects here and there... then again. To each its own.
---
Cheers.
---
I agree. I am poor and I save up to buy a new game a year. I really wish it hadn't been 76. I could get it half off now
---
Haha I‚Äôm getting just as much hate as I expected honestly. However, there is a lot more stupidity than I thought. I‚Äôm getting called ‚Äúan Internet tough guy‚Äù for making this post about a role playing game lmao i think I hurt some feelings 
---
That's the kind of response a person that knows they got busted, but can't think of a good comeback says.
---
Just go and be angry over not being able to kill a robot in a video game. Maybe you can bore some coworker with this story? 
---
Can't run from the  gaming news? You need to check the channel you subscribe to. Unless i search for it fallout 76 news won't even pop up. Your youtube viewing experience is influenced by your viewing history. 
---
What level is it?
---
Its not a game its money. While I agree with you that is only a game. Nobody likes getting ripped off. 
---
No I'm sorry, they don't deserve this level of hatred. So many companies have done worse in the past and they never received this much backlash. I'm not disagreeing that Bethesda has seriously dropped the ball here and made some right questionable decisions, but this is nothing compared to other companies' actions. 
---
We need a drain for caps.  Pretty soon lots of people will be at the camp for caps.
---
&gt; by relogging 
---
Are you serious? Try and understand what is written instead of trying to pretend you have a clever point to make.
---
Ok, then listen to what was said then compare it to your in game experience.  If it matches, they are right...if not, they are just complaining.
---
Buddy, when/if it happens and it‚Äôs good then...great!
---
I just don‚Äôt like the thought of ‚Äúit‚Äôll get better‚Äù. They had all this time to make a game and just like a movie - the initial word about it can determine its success. 
---
Yes this is a ‚Äúlive service‚Äù but there‚Äôs been a negative reaction with the current content. If that hurts Bethesda then they are responsible. 
---
they don't have lootboxes. They have actual money being traded for ingame gold. which is worse because then you end up with GTA V. 
---
EARLY ACCESS IS A STEAM MARKETING TERM THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANY REAL MEANING. BETHESDA SAID THAT THIS RELEASE WAS AN EXPERIMENT AND THAT THERE WOULD BE SPECTACULAR BUGS EVEN AFTER RELEASE. PULL YOUR HEAD OUT OF YOUR FUCKING ASS YOU DUMB PIECE OF SHIT.

---
That's why I try keep it under the 4x .. it's painful, but I just can't stop myself from looting and I like to have everything handy. I am semi encumbered which isn't too bad. I would prefer not to, but until they fix the stash problem, it is what it is ..
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm trying to get at. Ps4 nuke zones run like shit. I can‚Äôt reason why the other platforms would be any different.
---
Gotta say, I've enjoyed the hell outta FO76 even if it is (and often because it is) a hot mess. It's a hell of a lot more fun than RDR2 Online. 
---
It's an *atrocitiy* of a game. Didn't know outrage was reserved for issues you deem worthy.
---
I'm sorry to be the negative one but the state of this game is horrible. I think we should be calling Bethesda out instead of complainers.
---
Thx for sharing, this is really helpful information, I think you may be the perfect person to give me some advice, I‚Äôve yet to engage a SBQ, I‚Äôve launched nukes twice on fissure prime but been disconnected both times before I reached the blast zone lol, anyway I have been keeping some weapons for when I do finally get a chance but I wanted to know if any of these typically cause disconnections or are not very good to take down the health of a SBQ and her mobs?
---
I have a TSE .50 cal (damage 176 fire rate 91)
---
Bloodied Gatling gun (damage 69 fire rate 500) although it doesn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs firing at 500.
---
Mutant slayer Gauss rifle, also has 33% vats hit chance +50 damage resist (can‚Äôt remember the stats but it‚Äôs lvl 45)
---
TSE The Dragon (damage 1044)
---
Tweaked radium rifle (non legendary) (ballistic damage 55 radiation damage 15 fire rate 75)
---
and I found an automatic Tesla rifle (damage 94 fire rate 91)
---
I also wondered if my TSE weapons would end up killing me if the enemy is too close as I‚Äôve been using them long range so far,  just in case of ricochet.  
---
Only mutations I have is adrenal reaction, speed demon, marsupial, and scaly skin (I‚Äôve been buying them at the bunker rather than farm them so I just have the 4 so far)
---
I‚Äôm level 115 so I‚Äôve a good selection of perks to chose from.
---
Any and all advice greatly appreciated
---
yes
---
its starting to get to a point where media sees the fact they can get views, and just latch onto that idea to milk it dry for as much ad revenue as possible. ive seen, as you and the OP say, easily 10+ youtubers all with the exact same videos complaining about the same things - yet over a million views? from people I have never even heard of before, either as gaming youtubers or fallout youtubers. its quite amazing, and its a boring snoozefest
---
Can't admit he got busted by many people about his complaints. Thinks whoosh is a magic word that makes people disappear. 
---
Whoosh!
---
Haha I‚Äôm definitely pushing some peoples buttons, already got called out on r/iamverybadass for sharing my perspective on playing as a Raider lol 
---

---
My spot has no resources but its quite and since its been there only two times in two months someone had it in my spot.

I know what you mean..I use my 300 dmg super sledge. One hit if I aim right.

Got it

That‚Äôs so badass.
---
Overseer Camp Cache
---
Ofc you have a easier time on the monster that flies vs melees you when using a TSE weapon. 
---
Thats when you switch to the tesla rifle or semi auto incendiary or furious.
---
But I do agree the rats and crickets have some of the toughest bodies. Crickets I can give a pass, they have a exoskeleton. Radrats though? We should be using bb guns on them DX.
---
the dwellers of vault 15 became different raider factions and started killing each other
---
Hows 100 caps each sound
---
You're doing something wrong. Crouch, VATS, mouse wheel down for head tracking, keep space-bar pushed and shot that awesome critical. I used to one shot everything with my instigating lever rifle, before getting my TSE. 
---
This is pretty much exactly how I feel OP, although I'd have probably included more obscenities. I think we're possibly seeing a new evolution in how products are consumed. I'm not sure if it happens with other things besides games, I'm sure it does, but we're finding out just how much influence the "influencers" on social media really have. I knew it was going to get bad when MxR (imo) uncharacteristically just raked 76 over the coals. I'm really shocked by how much hate 76 has gotten from people that have never, and probably will never play it. I'm a bit disappointed by how many content creators took the bandwagon clickbait route and just shat all over it. Then again, I guess that's what that "business" is all about.
---
Most of my problems aren't disconnections, they're actual hard crashes, frozen screen, the "ERRRRRRR" of death, the whole 9 yards. Often the game force closes itself.
---
I have digital download, with ~70% storage space used on my Xbox.
---
I've tried explaining the definition to others using it in the wrong context as well. Most people for whatever reason (see:ignorance lol), confuse stupidity with ignorance, thinking they are one in the same. My go to explanation is usually, "Ignorance can be fixed with a book, stupid is forever" to try to dumb it down for them. Still doesn't work most of the time, they still equate it to being the same thing.
---
You forgot the /s in your post
---
100% agree with you on this
---
The fuck? 
---
Hes complaining about people shitting on a game he likes let's not get ahead of ourselves. Companies need to know what Bethesda did isnt okay.
---
I was going to suggest Jon as well. He points out flaws in the game and doesn't sound shitty about it because he has a love for the franchise but not to the point of being a blind fan boy.
---
Well i like survival type games and this one seems to be the fallout version of that. I actuallu was given a copy of NMS by someone that hated it, heh. I think he said something along the lines "take this rrash, I don't even want it in my collection." He was sucked into the hype train early on. I am a bit older so i just tend to wait and see.
---
A 9yo and an 11yo playing fallout 76. Yeah that seems appropriate.
---
Upvoting purely for your neon lettering at the entrance.
---
X in inventory (on pc)
---
I love this fucking game. I ask people if they play it and they are just like ‚Äú I heard it was so glitchy and awful... blah blah blah‚Äù.  If I can get through glitches and still play, level, quest, explore, etc. Then Bethesda must of done something right . 
---
The community and players within the game ( minus the folks that crash the servers for duping ) is one of the main reasons why I play. Everyone here WANTS to play and wants to enjoy it. I have never felt the sheer joy within a game as I did the first time I launched a nuke and watched the mushroom cloud expand in the sky. Receiving all the thumbs up from the people that enjoyed MY nuke. 
---
Play it or don‚Äôt. But stop being such negative twats if you‚Äôre not going to give it a chance . 
---
You seem upset.
---
Sorry for being a buzzkill, but, Fallout 76 is a game which allows a level 52 player (wearing a Power Armor) to take down level 80 scorchbeast. Took 15 minutes, but, it is possible.
---
(I'm referring to my own experience while claiming a workshop at Federal disposal field HZ-21)
---
Yeah I feel you OP. This sub was initially created to get away from the Bethesda/76=BAD circlejerking that flooded /r/fallout (hell, /r/fo4 had to be created a couple years back because of the same shit, different game) just so that people could casually discuss the game. 
---
Like, yeah, I get the outrage. There are perfectly valid reasons to not like the game, as well as BGS. We have heard them about a thousand times on just about every medium that discussed the game. I get it. But if I want to share screenshots, funny moments, or things I somehow (gasp) like about 76 or areas I would like to see improved upon, why can't I find a community to share that content without hearing about how much people hate it and didn't buy it? Go talk about your outrage on literally any of the other gaming related subs where that is already the topic of discussion. 
---
Jetpack+marsupual+TSE = become a flying AC130 that never takes damage from your own weapons 
---
It's all the rage these days. OP said No Man's Sky didn't get the same amount of hate? Nah, it got 10x worse hate. 
---
We as consumers used to think of games being delivered as a complete project. How often during the times before easy updates did games arrive in a completely broken state? 
---
Developers are more often banking on hype to generate revenue and when those games don't deliver (and likely can't) they are going to get hated on. 
---
It sucks and there isn't much to avoid it, except maybe people need to vote with their wallets. 
---
So it‚Äôs other people fault if watch their opinion videos?
---
Just don‚Äôt watch them.
---
Just use the suggestions that are posted in every other thread like this
---
Are you so lacking in imagination that you don't realize that Rose is a Nanny bot that was hacked and had her programming changed to think it was a raider, before the whole scorched plague wiped out everyone in the area?
---
That's she's *mimicking* the things she heard raiders say before they died?
---
OMG, and then you dismiss everyone's comment with whoosh. Because you just can't handle being wrong?
---
I've used a couple of mapping tools. Might give it a go for this.
---
I'm surprised people actually responded seriously.
---
pretty sure the 10mm smg is an automatic rifle by default 
---
I think people just like to hate man... The society we live in today is broken... Go meditate like me and move on... I love 76.. that's all I care about
---
Well writers still have to get past the editor with a certain level of quality. Can‚Äôt say the same for you tubers. 
---
How can it not be a bug, if it is not a bug it is a terrible design, I should not have to lose my loot regardless when I die, especially when I am right here .. I think it is a bug because even with 1 bag, many times it is unmarked with just the bag sitting there .. sometimes I see two loot bags marked but as soon as you pick up that 2nd bag it becomes unmarked or despawns. I know this now, but still, doesn't make sense.
---
Either put everything in 1 bag or keep both bags marked, the first would be preferable.
---
No amount of bugs can detract from the friendships I've built playing this game. I guess I would be more upset if they weren't taking any steps to rectify the issues that are plaguing the game, but they are. I agree that the game has its fair share of problems, and it was released in a very broken state.
---
But for me I've met some of the best gaming buddies I've ever known in broken games. DayZ, Ark, Fallout 76. Now the latter is clearly not an early access release (although it sure does feel like it) but a lot of the bigger issues were fixed within a month rather than the other games that I played 4 years ago and still have the same issues.
---
My first thought too - "Grindy mess?  What game are they playing?".
---
Don't have to equip artisan (only when you repair) but just luck of the draw has been enough to keep me going (I killed 3 scorchbeasts, went through glassed cavern (another SH and a few Mirelurk Kings), then killed another scorchbeast and a half before it broke)
---
It never pops up on my screen saying it worked when using the gatling, but it lasts so long I imagine it has to be 
---
They are far more credible when compared to gaming industry "journalist".
---
Yeah, no argument here. It is indeed odd but hey. As GI Joe taught me.
---
"Knowing is half the battle"
---
Same. Played for 2-3 days with my buddy. We walked around and collected loot and then fucked with our inventory for a while. Immediately deleted the game. It's absolutely pointless and boring. $60 down he drain.
---
It spawned at the train station by Top of the World. Pretty sure that's still Forest. If not, that's my mistake. 
---
This.  If its not an upgrade, then sell, drop, or scrap it. 
---
Lvl 50, I‚Äôm only 26 so that‚Äôll be stored for a while 
---
That is true, I meant in terms of legitamacy within the industry though. Art critics aren't usually artists themselves. 
---
If you keep mods in your stash and craft something the game tends to scrap your mods for whatever resources they have. 
---
They can yell ‚ÄúWEEWOOOOO WEEEEEEOOOO‚Äù really annoyingly too. And cause they‚Äôre scorchbeasts, they won‚Äôt go away either, eventually they‚Äôll find the offender.
---
That was so well written and precisely the issue. Thank you for taking the time to put the real probelm into words so eloquently. 
---
I agree... A lot of people don‚Äôt even know.
---
I love playing 76, but let‚Äôs face it: the game was unfinished upon release. Features we saw in the trailers (namely player vending machines) are still not in the game as of this comment. It‚Äôs still buggy and somewhat poorly optimized. Does it make it a bad game? To an extent. Am I saying the game deserves all the hate it got? Absolutely not. I think what I‚Äôm ultimately trying to say is that 76 would have greatly benefitted from a few more weeks in the oven to iron out more of the crashes and bugs. 
---
Two Shot Lever Rifle (non explosive) is what I run around with 90% of the time.  One shots rats, molerats, even lvl 40 mole miners and 62 charred ghouls.  If I'm less than 50% health... got the adrenal reaction mutation.  Anything else just has too much health to one shot without an explosive.
---
My only thing against this is that WE EXPECT better from Bethesda, one of the most successful game studios of all time. Fallout has been a slippery slope since Fallout 4, and most of us who saw the E3 gameplay and trailers were expecting it to be finished, and actually work in certain aspects. Most people who make these articles are venting their dissatisfaction, disappointment, and frustrations with the game. The game has to get better or this will continue, and I promise that.
---
Marking his channel as "Not Interested" was a great move for my YT feed.
---
Use the blueprint feature if you can. It might keep it saved for you.
---
Nope, that's savage divide. There's maps that show each region and the level caps. Savage divide is 15-99 if I'm not mistaken. It's close to the border of the forest, but you'll get lots of nasties there that you probably aren't gear for yet. And yes scorchbeasts show up in that area, I've had two follow me from the mountains all the way down to the Whitespring resort. I had my base near the resort but gave in and eventually moved because scorchbeasts that spawned occasionally would decimate my base. They can kill me all they want (lvl 20 at the time), but having to rebuild my base constantly was annoying. 
---
Or Perhaps if we keep talking about it big game developers will stop releasing broken games with the "promise" of fixing it as they go.
---
Please tell us your ISP that doesn't exist, because we would all love to have none of our online games ever disconnect us. You must not have been gaming online very long. 
---
I pray my future underlings enjoy video games. The SAFEST way to stay away from drugs or whores. Lol
---
Haha. 
---
That's cause is a little pistols, but the rounds are anti-meterial. Hitting that tiny hand is hard too.
---
I see your theory and raise you one Dr.Braun
---
I came across a roaming vendor the other day. It was a super mutant that had a Brahim following him. He had more on him than the train station vendors. Too bad I don't know how to find him again.
---
A couple of my friends got the plans off the Scorchbeast Queen's body, I wasn't as lucky. 
---
I use the cash registers at the vendors to drop the ammo types I don‚Äôt use &amp; other items I want to offload for weight reasons  that I can‚Äôt vend and for plans that I already know.
---
Lol thats funny. Glad you flunked on something so simple to understand lolüòÇ
---
Wow, how is this not being downvoted to oblivion?
---
Every time I'm reminded that people still watch these folks, my first, immediate, thought is, "Why?" Unless its ACG for a review, I wouldn't watch youtubers if I could borrow someone else's time in which to do it...
---
Well put
---
Still waiting for Child of Atom paint for Marine Armor
---
Or make a non PA build... I don't use pa, no problems... I even wipe people out in pa..
---
Thx a lot. If you need help in the future PM me.
---
I was surprised after doing it. With xp coming slower and the game being far more stable than at launch its been a different experience.
---
I've enjoyed it greatly, more than my first playthrough.
---
There's no rush to the end so you take stuff in more. 
---
Layered on that is a new build of course
---
I've heard the consoles have been having a rough time. I've been on PC since beta and have been having a blast!
---
Hope things get better for you guys soon!
---
Did you get them on your level 69? I thought they were unavailable past a certain level.
---
It's about control. There's lots of crap on the internet, and if I choose to watch, itll bring me down.  Life can suck if you focus on negatives. Enjoy, and forget the people trying to bring you down. Period.
---
Side note: can we get a milk carton with Pete Hines on it? WTF happened to him? 
---
No problem! Enjoy! Gotta go make dinner now!
---
How about just legendary mods with known stats but very difficult to get materials needed to install it. 
---
Hi there! I crafted a Level 50 Hardened Suppressed Pipe Revolver-Rifle using a Forceful Stock that benefits from all of your Rifle Perks + Pistol Perks. .45 Ammo nothing crazy but with Gun-fu and Adrenaline this Gun is my go-to for everything including regular Scorchbeasts. 
---
I played around with Perks (Rejuvinated, Better Criticals etc) and Mutations ( Chameleon, Speed Demon, and Marsupial so far) and Firecracker Berry Juice (+10% Critical Hit Dmg). 
---
Nothing sees me and if they do spot me Escape Artist takes care of that. 
---
I use this gun at Whitesprings etc. I'm level 93 and have had a lot of success with this set up. My Specials are: 4, 8, 2, 6, 6, 15, 15.
---
I hope this helps! :D
---
Might be helpful to have a image, haven't launched a nuke yet, so not sure what you mean.
---
I should take my own advice as well but the secret is to not to take anything too serious, much less what people say or think. Most people are idiotic sheeple anyways.
---
I'll do you one better.
---
Why not just make Legendary effects, mods. Purchasable though vendors.
---
10k each with rank 3 hard bargain. 
---
I literally made a thread of exactly the fuck this and got bitched at by this Reddit because, "well the game is bad so we shouldn't criticize people, no one is actually talking bad about the game! Blah blah blah." - fuckkng horse shit.
---
I did. Started a low level, met players, they were coo, Im coming back and helping out.
---
Its ok to be defensive, but the people saying mean things will be praising this in a few months or so. Then they will look stupid.
---
The flapping of wings that just won‚Äôt stop! 
---
Yes, from the station vendor
---
I‚Äôve started a fresh play-through using this build. Level 5 and using only pistols + a whole lot of VATS. It‚Äôs enjoyable but I can see the need for damage mitigation. Since I don‚Äôt have any scoped weapons yet I need to get close enough that VATS has a reasonable chance of hitting, and that means I take some damage. I expect this to smooth out as I get the proper weapons and perks. Meanwhile it makes the encounters exciting!
---
Agreed, however Bethesda have done little to help themselves. They need to get it together, release a mega patch and some Craglorn-like high level content to get the hype train going. Maybe some good will in-game freebies too. Basically take a leaf out of ESOs book and turn this hatetrain around. 
---
Watch ManyATrueNerd. He‚Äôs the one YouTuber that seems to enjoy the game and not shit all over it at any given opportunity.
---
&gt; you just *think* this is my left leg.
---
* dude with 8-9 mutations
---
yeah, in my case I went the no base protection route
---
The process you just stated is extremely inconvenient, no one would do it. You could just nuke the golf course for guaranteed 10+ legendaries all randomized without having to do multiple nukes or trades for the flux you'd need for one. 
---
Not sure about the respawning one, because I don't die much. The invisibility/naked/distorted-model and broken friend's list bugs are common and would hopefully be fixed eventually.
---
Normally the issue with quests is that they're not really cooperative. Each player needs to complete each step individually, but if you're not the team leader then the mission sidebar and audible voices can trick you into thinking that you've completed a step when you haven't. Some missions are actually broken for coop, like Rose's deathclaw taming quest.
---
Well, and it is implied in one of the Enclave logs that MODUS sent a team there to reactivate the bot production to trick the DefCon sensors due to the presence of foreign assets on US soil.
---
Yeah. People receiving early review code and gaming rigs from publishers are definitely unbiased resources. Sure.
---
I have long said that gaming is going to shit because of gamers. If you draw a ven diagram demonstration of the overlap between modern gamers and the Most Gullible Consumers on the planet...you would only need one circle. 
---
Well dang, that's a lucky break there. If you've every played a Fallout game with survival mode (NV or 4) it's more of the same with a few tweaks. 
---
Since junk is literally the only thing you lose when you die, it's the  main thing in my stash box. you'd be crazy to leave it anywhere else. 
---
My biggest problem with PA is that it‚Äôs basically mandatory in blast zones with the only other option being the useless hazmat suit. I wish we could wear hazmat suits as apparel 
---
Spoken like a true gamer friend. Your comment brought tears to my eyes.
---
Enjoy your upvote.
---
Yeah, imagine being that kind of bastard like that guy. I politely refused telling him I'm short of caps. That's the guy that hates playing the game and decides to destroy it from the inside.
---
Shiiit, I found a bloodied one and now also have adrenal reaction mutation, I have turned my gameplay into running around with enough rads to keep my at some odd...55
---
Your intelligence stat, powersmith, and fix it good
---
Gotta be careful with Raiders
---
But you did the same thing. You basically started this discussion by saying that YOU never got disconnected so EVERYONE, you believe, is making a bigger deal of this than usual..
---
I don't think it's fair to say they're overblown. The industry is, as you've pointed out, in a bad place right now. I think it's better to highlight the bad faith actions that are becoming more common place because it's the only action that actually gets through to the companies. The only way their behaviour will be checked is by threatening their bottom line and that will only happen if the issues gain attention in the media.
---
Just a heads up, you don't need flux to add pre-constructed mods to items.  You just install it like you were crafting it.  It will give you a list of materials... but thats to craft the mod.  You've already got the mod in your inventory, so it will install that instead of craft a new one.
---
Because enough people here agree, I suppose. 
---
Um no and you're wrong? 
---
Way more than that, since the game has only been live for a bit less than 2 months :)
---
Had the same thing but I broke the loop by doing another emote.
---
Thank you so much, I actually found the wetsuit plans in that exact train carriage haha!
---
Why do people like this? Using radsponge+ghoulish my group is absolutely unshakable in radiation. Nuke prime always please. 
---
Also, muh flux. 
---
A bit misleading title after some discussion. There is a little difference between the two, though the essence is the same. 
---
Those who play this style for raiding stays within the bounds of what the game will let them do. If they can destroy your camp, they‚Äôll do it. If they can take your shit, they‚Äôll do it. If they can kill you because you decided to fight back, they‚Äôll do it. 
---
Griefers usually tend to over exert themselves and lose sight of the point In this case, doing pointless things like following somebody around just because they didn‚Äôt wanna engage back. (at this point I‚Äôd make some snark comment about how boring they are and move on)
---
But for those willing to throw down and mess around it‚Äôs all fair play. People do strike back sometimes. People do kill you sometimes. And they take your shit, and sometimes they return the favor. A whole lot of ways it can go. And it doesn‚Äôt have to be boring, y‚Äôall can talk and rp. Hell you can even make friends before you betray em. 
---
So once your fantasies come true, and the game is nice and fixed and it‚Äôs as balanced as can be, I‚Äôll come strollin down the road ready to take what I can from you. 
---
6 million caps. 
---
lmfao.  "literally everyone says this so it's clearly not true"
---
keep living in disbelief and keep wasting your time playing a shitty game buddy
---
not allowing fist weapons in power armor while also making hazmat suit builds extremely hard to pull off is very depressing to me since i'm a fist weapon build. i can switch out to my single 2handed weapon for nukes but i really dont like it
---
I appreciate where you're coming from, but your D2 point will only piss off PA users. It won't convert them away from PA. We're already seeing a good comparison with eating and drinking. How many of us will stop for a sec, grab a safe space, change to Dromedary/Slow Metabolism, eat/drink, then go back to full-speed run and gun? It's painful and while Bethesda probably thought that "people will prioritize what they want to prioritize", by punishing us with ludicrous rates of hunger and thirst, it's common to flip just to eek out what we can. Your forcing people to stop and get out of PA AND flip perk cards will only frustrate and annoy.
---
All that being said, I would very much like to see some kind of improved hazmat ability for the non-PA users. It's definitely frustrating to become overly squishy if you want to go into a nuke zone without PA.
---
I don't think inventory has any affect on the servers at all.
---
I believe the limitation is designed with the intent to keep us in our feedback loop. If you could have a limitless storage, you would stop collecting and searching the words for certain things because formerly you had stock piled a mass amount of them.
---
The system requires you to manage your space and not horde a pile that you could ultimately never touch.
---
Yes - basically everything that is stackable - most of the items in the game.
---
Granted a good portion of the stash weight is weapons/armor - but there is some junk and ammunition (missiles etc.) that weighs quite a bit more than this. Particularly the endgame junk, etc.
---
Keeping in mind that the stash limit was implemented as a workaround to limit the number of items the server has to track. These Integer items make no difference on the backend whether they are 1 or 1000.
---
No. I have seen people in hazmat in nuked zones many times. The inly reason I use my PA in nuked zones is because of the carry weight. If I went in with a hazmat suit I would be over encumbered to hell.
---
This is awesome. Love reading Min/max builds to see what people have accomplished and how they did it.
---
Those one star golf clubs and wooden legs were simply too powerful for this world.
---
I have a non PA character and a PA character both have resistances in the 500+ range for ballistic and energy. Only problem I have with non PA is radiation protection. Nothing needs nerfed you just have to do some research and build accordingly for either really.
---
Grafton Steel has a pad too, lots of hiding Super Mutants tho
---
I have never been back to 76 yet. Lvl 70+ now
---
Yeah someone else posted that there's a super mutant vendor. I've never encountered him. Sounds like the guy to find though 
---
Try south of whitesprings, over by the twin lakes. Im level 200 and this location has been my favorite. It‚Äôs fairly peaceful although once in a blue moon one or two scorched will spawn. Tons of passive animals spawn for free food, and the lakes can provide water 
---
See, this is what I've come to view as lazy gaming. And it's not all the players fault. But often what people call quality of life end up being really, I don't want to have to pay attention.
---
a good quality of life change would be perk decks. You set up a deck, you then have an option to save the deck, and name it. Crafting Deck. Melee deck. Sniper Deck. Scrounger Deck. Whatever. 
---
Go in into your perks and it there's an option to swamp decks. You still have to do the work, and as you level up, and get new perks, you can go in delete or update decks. Like blueprints.
---
But having unlimited stash is just lazy. Let me all dump it in one place, and sort it out later. Or hold on till later. But don't make me have to consider what I keep and what I don't. 
---
But offering something like, dressers that store only cosmetic clothing, so as to not take up room in the stash boxes. Sure, they only weigh .1 of a pound. But over time, with as much as there is in the game, and will be added, especially form the Atomic Shop, that's going to add up. 
---
Or refrigerators, that extend the life of uncooked food, when stored in it. But also with a weight limit. Say 100 pounds? Uncooked food often is a source of most of your weight. That's quality of life that isn't being lazy.
---
It's not that hard to consume gaming content and just ignore the FO76 hate, if you like the game why does it matter what others think?
---
The glowing ones get way more dmg if you have glowsight.
---
Eh, I think being wanted is one of the funner things in the game. Being hunted and evading larger groups while solo myself has got to be in my top 3 most enjoyable things to do in Fallout 76. And not because I enjoy griefing. It is the evading/survival aspect, as well as the increased difficult from not being able to see whose on the map, and from being at a disadvantage
---
So knock on ALL wanted players if you want, but those who haven't experienced and who won't due to a stigma are missing out on one of the best parts of the game
---
someone needs rank 3 white knight
---
for what it's worth it's annoyingly easy to trigger the camp damage thing. In fact they could have easily been defending your camp from something attacking it and made the wrong move. It's happened to me a dozen time. Sadly the game is to dumb to figure out intent and is to quick to condemn players who damage the bases of others. 
---
Well at least it was an area I don't care about too much about.  Hopefully this doesn't happen too often with quest NPC's.
---
I‚Äôm having fun with the game and all but no real performance dips in a nuke zone? Tell me your secrets.
---
The only reason I constantly walk around in power armor is for the +100 carry weight bonus. Almost feels like I can‚Äôt live without it now.
---
i get that, seems reasonable though to want to help. I mean, story wise, we've known each other most/all of our lives. We're all from the same vault, it would make sense to help out one of your sleepyheaded fellow vaultdwellers if you come across them in the wild. 
---
vats or melee
---
Go play something else for a few months.  You haven't been trapped in the game.
---
PS4 
---
LOL, I'm playing both RDR2 and FO76, and lemme tell you RDR2 has it glitches too, ironically enough! I'm not trying to sabotage this subreddit by bashing another game; I'm just saying I'm a 38yo gamer and will be until I die, or until arthritis won't let me one day, and I know things aren't perfect. The bitching is childish. Games aren't perfect and it's up to gamers to help developers make it "near perfect" as it can be. Developing isn't easy. With that being said, I avoid bitchers and move on with the game as is, with my merry band of friends, and know life isn't perfect so I deal with it....age does help.
---
Whoa. Just.. whoa!  O\_o
---
Weird.
---
My friend's camp is here and every single time I visit I have to kill 3-4 Mirelurk that spawn in the lake.
---
The absolute state of Bethesda fanboys lole
---
Somewhere around 100. I only have the 2 stars in the cap stash upgrade perk so once I up it to 3 I bet there will be more.
---
You have to be joking. Have you ever played a fallout game before? Do you even know what power armor is? It makes you a WALKING TANK. YOURE SUPPOSED TO BE HARD TO KILL. You people complain about everything 
---
Meh, it being buggy and it being a shit game are different.  If you hate this game and liked the other Fallout games I'd suggest you're jumping on the bandwagon.
---
If you stopped playing because of technical issues that's understandable.  The server disconnects have me ready to quit.  That said, the game itself is awesome so putting it in a 10 ten worst games list is ridiculous.
---
BETHESDA WILL SHOW THEM! YOU ARE RIGHT!
---
Still haven't got the plans for an arch.  As soon as I do I plan on putting that in the mix.
---
It's really not that bad. Yea, it's buggy, but Bethesda games are buggy in general. We were able to buy it off someone on let it go for $15. If we had paid full price I'd probably be disappointed, but I told my husband if we could grab it cheap enough I really wanted to get into the lore. To be fair I'm new to the FO universe. I mostly watched my husband when he played until a few months ago, but FO76 could definitely be worse.
---
I agree, there are way more efficient ways to get anything you can get from a workshop. I claim them to get a free fast travel point and to set up crafting tables, a stash box and a bed so that I can use it as a second camp when I am playing in the area. All the free plans are nice too (got the small letters last night!)
---
I agree with your sentiment and most of your points, but this?
---
&gt;Can't eat or drink in Power Armor
---
The helm is a separate piece man. It's not hard to take off. I could see maybe forcing someone to manually take it off (which won't happen ebcause you can't actually do that without another piece of headgear) but no eating in power armor seems silly 
---
Upvote to the absolute max.
---
&gt; I'm 33 and I swear that 4-5 years ago this wasn't even kind of a thing.
---
Our generation (you and me) grew up listening to pro-critics which I've come to see is far far worse than listening to youtubers. At least youtubers are kind of your peers and not some rich SoCal kids with a BA in creative writing that hate video games. Tubers aren't perfect but they're better than what we grew up with. Way better. I'll happy listen to what GameTuberJoe69 (made that name up) has to say before I give anyone at Kotaku or Polygon a second of my time. 
---
Wow, you dumb ass little kids will do all sorts of mental gymnastics to defend complete shit won't you? The game is broken shit that needed AT LEAST half a year of work and additional content put into it before it was released, even the fucking people who worked on this piece of shit bashed it by hiding low key jabs at it in fallout 4. Have fun being the poison that kills good games by spamming purchases and preorders with your parent's credit cards you brainless moronic sheep.
---
There is literally no negative effects of low level players attending the queen fight. Why are you complaining?
---
That's because it's a bad game...
---
I've just never seen anyone in my entire life put a hyphen between X and Box. I'm just teasin you a bit.
---
You need to write this rant to shitty YouTubers and not this sub. So many streamers and YouTube gaming channels are just clickbait and filler garbage intended for a younger audience (mostly children).
---
The "hate train" is minimal in this sub, mostly just people acknowledging that the game is fun but broken. You're aiming your rage filled rant in the wrong direction.
---
This is permenant? 
---
Ugh, they will? Honestly I‚Äôm kinda at that point of calling it. If Starfield really is the same damn engine I‚Äôm gonna skip it. Same for the next Elder Scrolls.
---
My next space game will be the Obsidian one. Outer Worlds I think?
---
I only here bad things about 76 from people that don‚Äôt even play it. 
---
Considering how costly it can be to maintain them, yeah, More.
---
I don't think legendary hunting rifles exist.
---
Seriously, who the hell thought of implementing some sort of pvp system in an online fallout game? Literally unplayable, none of the other fallouts had me fighting against enemies...ones I can‚Äôt beat anyway. Hmph, pouty face. I just wanna farm and dupe in peace, btw the games broken and servers suck cause it can‚Äôt handle my godliness 
---
I just took 2 strength bobbleheads in a row and they do not stack. The re-log bug works, but either it doesn‚Äôt work or it only applies to damage increasing bobbleheads
---
Word.
---
Bacon is also the best condiment. *nod*
---
If you keep your steel in bulk packs and crafted anything using steel it likely used your mods instead of your bulk.
---
Same on explosive weapons, turned to an ash pile.
---
I've played WoW, Neverwinter Online, ESO, CS:GO, PUBG, and Urban Terror (online FPS) for extended periods each. I've been playing Fallout 76 on PC since Thanksgiving, and I've had a total of 5 or 6 disconnects and 1 or 2 crashes to desktop. Never got the power armor glitch or carry weight glitches. I get a bit of video stutter that can be annoying during big fights, but other than that I have no significant gripes.  My son and I team up to explore the wasteland and are having a blast. 
---
From the perspective of somebody who has been gaming since the 80's: Could FO76 have been better? Of course. Is it the dumpster fire that so many people are claiming? Not in my experience. I'm having a lot of fun with it.
---
Never seen it. Just run the Jailbreak event at the penitentiary. No level limit and i got the plans first try
---
I like the rivers/lakes SE of the top of the world.
---
There's a junk node right close but if yuh go down a bit further you're far enough away from the enemy's that tend to spawn around there.
---
Also if you find the small lake with the row boat and mini dock there's an acid node just off the end of the boat to the right.
---
My base is literally build on that pond as the water isn't deep.
---
The whole area is central to most things too.
---
I 100% believe people are exaggerating issues. I've even had people say "that was obviously an exaggeration" (as a justification?) when I'd call them out on their claims. I'm just stating that the argument you brought up could be applied on both sides making it not a great argument?
---
I was just being the counter example to the disconnection issues, and to point out that fo76 gets way more shit for this than other mp games.
---
A lot of people just exaggerated the glitches and bugs one of the main things I seen people bring up is this one mountainside where the god rays are pretty whack, but they‚Äôre fucking god rays why the fuck does it matter to your overall experience.
---
I havent really been paying attention to that but it's something good to keep in mind and test out
---
I honestly can't read anything that starts off with "Fucking Shut Up". 
---
How do all of you end up on a server together? Most times I can't join 1 person due to the server being full?
---
But I like this idea.
---
They're far better than our classic 'credible source' for gaming opinions. But no, they're not perfect either. Really listening to your friends and reading user reviews is preferable. 
---
I've got 150 hours in the game and just found my first mouth harp.  Didn't even know it was a thing until I stumbled over it, but I always had this feeling my camp wasn't complete.  Hopefully there are plans for it!
---
Dont i know it... Rank 1 would be nice üòÇ
---
The body at the top of the stairs just outside the vault is good. As is Overseer's Camp.
---
i got one from a nuke zone i think. possibly from a super mutant. i remember thinking "this looks really cool and unique but theres no way i have the space for it" then it went in the scrap heap or vendor oblivion. 
---
Just under. About 40. It was close. 
---
I‚Äôm guessing I‚Äôm inferior to you?
---
I don't use VATS - I *like* playing FPS games. Aiming and shooting is a big part of the fun.  
---
I never played earlier Fallouts (before 4) because I didn't know you could play without VATS!  I thought it wasn't even FPS, when I read about how VATS worked.  Luckily, I learned that VATS was optional, because otherwise I wouldn't have tried Fallout IV either, which I enjoyed a lot!
---
The worst one is juicehead
---
When I was younger, I think I used to feel like I needed to be outraged at whatever gaming controversy was happening at the time.  It seemed cool to hate on things that were perceived as being stupid, or feeling like I was above them.  But as time went on, I think I started to feel that there is only so much contagious hate can do, it gets attention for sure, but if you're actually trying to improve something, there are better ways.
---
I'm not going to suggest that Bethesda hasn't done things that don't deserve negative attention, because the fact of the matter is that it **has** been a pretty bumpy launch, even for those of us here that like the game, but what separates us here in this particular forum from the masses of people who just use 76 as a discussion piece to be one of the cool guys and shit on it is that we're sticking around to provide feedback to a game we enjoy and see it grow, to see it improve. 
---
Something I think I've learned from playing games that were negatively received by others, is that even some rough games that are panned by critics tend to have gems in them that often go overlooked by others, whether willingly or unknowingly.  Now, if I don't like something, I don't play it, if I like it, I'll play it.  I don't feel the need to tell others how much better I am for not playing it, I might explain my point of view on why I like it, but that's it.  There's no need anymore for me to reinforce my point of view by looking up videos of people saying the exact same thing, whether it's positive or negative.
---
I'm glad the drama is dying down but the game is still broken as fuck. 
---
To be fair no mans sky was only made by 6 people.
---
Pretty much. Good point
---
This is why i unsubed from fallout. it was constant bashing from people who do not actually play. 
---
The most cringey thing around is a desperate plee like this one begging people to stop voicing opinions. Why not just ignore what people say about it and just you know play the game ? You wont hear youtubers bashing it in game because the only people playing are people who enjoy it. Players like you will keep bethesda on this downward spiral so thank yourself when things get even worse for elder scrolls 6 and starfield 
---
I play on ps4 and typically it‚Äôs a pretty full server when I log on.
---
Same. I had taken over the two closest workshops, then powered up Poseidon, turned on the core machine, and &lt;blue screen&gt;
---
there is currently only one high damage mod for guns. it's the hardened mod... which is depressing. because it seems all guns besides shotguns and rifles do crap damage.
---
What 8 1/2 year old graphics card can run 76 on high settings? The minimum specs are for 2013/2014 cards.
---
Hard Bargain 3 + Grape Mentats and you'll be picking up 28 caps (i think) per harvesting (with Green Thumb)
---
Counterpoint: Bethesda created a great, big world for this game, rich in lore and visual storytelling. Why would I want to spend what time I have in my tiny corner of it, defending it and myself from two-shot explosive rounds or mini-nukes, or constantly having to rebuild it because someone decided to trash it while I was on the other side of the map?
---
Funny thing is, I don't even disagree with you purely from a lore standpoint. The first major raider gangs in the series originated from a vault in California, back in Fallout 1. That said, forcing someone to server hop, so they can find a server where they'll be left alone to actually enjoy the game --- that isn't fueling any kind of story.
---
I also think the practical issue is that the mechanics of this game do not suggest a clear vision, to create a game meant to be *everything* to *everyone* \--- instead, it's a cluster of seemingly mixed messages.
---
Extremely long debuffs, disabled player radar, permanent wanted status until killed, and a loss of caps upon death --- all of these things suggest Bethesda wishes to discourage players from killing others outside of mutual combat.
---
...On the other hand, why allow slaps to do any damage at all? Why allow players to demolish other players' C.A.M.P.s? Why do some weapons have attributes allowing for extra damage upon players? Why are there perk cards that allow for extra damage upon workshops? Why allow for *increasing bounties* as a player's kill count increases?
---
To be sure, there are answers to these questions that **don't** imply an intent to encourage players to grief other, unwilling players.
---
...Nonetheless, it remains possible to utilize these aspects to do so --- and to date, Bethesda hasn't stated it's against any rules or policies. More to the point, if Bethesda wished to change these aspects, it presumably could --- but it hasn't, which also suggests they have no qualms with the practice. But it would be nice if Bethesda demystified their intent, just to end this argument one way or the other.
---
(TL;DR --- Forcing players to server hop or gather mats to rebuild does not create a story. At least, not a very interesting one. And the mechanics in this game do not suggest a very clear vision regarding forced PvP. Just because it's possible doesn't suggest intent.)
---
Good point. I still do the understand why someone would wanna watch someone else play a game instead of do it themselves unless you haven't bought it yet.
---
i got rank 3 white knight at 40 and i've literally never repaired my armor since. i'm 80 now and just found out i can repair armor to 200%, in another level or 2 i'll full repair all my stuff to 200 and i fully expect to never have to repair it again 
---
I had to look up to have an idea what I was supposed to do. 
---
Click on pipes and broken consoles. Who knew?
---
Maybe they did it on accident?
---
Thats a good idea though. I am constantly overencumbered and at 600/600. Im gunna start doing that
---
I don't have access to the map at the moment, but the cliffs west of Sugar Grove that look out over the entire eastern third of the region are pretty picturesque and can be mostly peaceful if you find a good spot. And it's pretty centrally located between Harper's Ferry, Whitespring/Bunker, and Watoga.
---
I have 15 luck, i regularly loot weapons at 130%+ condition. so the price on everything when i sell them to a vendor is pretty much maxed. 
---
Plus melee weapons have a % boost in damage for condition over 100% my super sledge hits for 300 when its at 200%
---
Ahh but the good doctor was a living person stuck in a simulation. The only other humans you encounter in 76 are other players who all came from vault 76. So they are all part of the matrix. 76 was supposedly a control vault what if the control was to see what would happen if people were let out of the vaults with no form of rules or anyone in charge of things?
---
I haven't played since the December patch because I crash every time I fast travel or zone into/ out of a building. I'm glad you enjoy the game but Bethesda deserves all the hate until they fix REAL issues. 
---
RELEASE GAMES WHEN THEY ARE DONE.
---
What you need is a Plasma Gun with Flamer barrel.
---
Make charred rat steaks.
---
No I mean what‚Äòs important when you craft it not when you repair it 
---
I definitely am taking my time. I actually found the Alpha Base holo a long time ago, when the quest popped I just fast traveled that way. I basically run to every landmark I find, clear it out, gather everything and anything, then move to the next one
---
Honestly, they're more valuable as reviews than most platforms. If you find a youtuber with similar taste as your own Its actually pretty useful. Much more so than a generalized review from some website. 
---
Nothing has really changed since launch. If anything, the disconnects for me (XB1) are worse than ever. 
---
That said, the hate train is way out of proportion, the base game is flawed but it's been fun enough for me to play since launch, and most of those fucks don't even play.
---
As said already about planting that glue garden at your CAMP...
---
But....
---
Invest 1 point into Green Thumb, Per Perk card.  √ó2 harvest.  You will use this perk a lot in Endgame mat farming anyway so get it now.
---
Cause he cant put out any DPS and wants to blame someone else.
---
Yes, and you are a very bad ass rpg player. Enjoy that life.
---
IMPOSSIBLE

According to Bethesda "millions", so at least two million units.
---
In 45-ish hours I have not had a single infinite loading screen.
---
I do get laggy servers sometimes (where it says "controls disabled" multiple times) and I have to hop to new server to fix it.
---
God help us all if mole rats did this. 
---
Ah, okay. That would make sense - I didn't know player level impacted the level enemies spawn
---
Well maybe its more of hording problem than a stash limit problem if you feel you have to loot so much?
---
I am as shocked as you guys, I did not freeze or crash. The 4 of us are on PS4, and none of us disconnected! 
---
I'm not sure how that's possible. Since everyone in the most gullible consumer circle is a stay at home mom. Not saying that some of them aren't gamers, but not all of them are.
---
Chill, I see people running from your warcry.
---
If you are providing a service you cant just leave for Holidays. What the...
---
The game lacks high risk, high reward content for endgame players. 
---
The magic of radiation, what it can change
---
Dandelions are poisonous .. but we eat those IRL D:.
---
I'm expecting some substantial bit of information to come out this week now that the holidays are over and everyone should be back in the office. 
---
Exactly my thoughts. People jump on the hate train because of the issues that this game has had. Am I one to say noone should enjoy this game? No. But will I sit idly by and act as if this is an acceptable game from a studio that I expect so much more from? Hell no.
---
I only wear a HMS and as long as stay hidden I have no problems, but I agree that it would be nice to be able to wear it over armor because when one GG finds me - ten of his friends run up to join the party.
---
Cute...
---
FYI:  Stimpaks, Rad-X, and Rad-Away are drugs.  Disease Cure is more like antibiotics.  I guess that you could argue that anything with negative side-effects are "bad drugs" vs. healing drugs.  But, overall, Fallout is drugged out culture...
---
I wonder if you could survive in Fallout without using any drugs .  You can heal by sleeping and eating, diseases will cure themselves, but the only ways to remove radiation/mutations are the drugs or the decontamination arch.  Finding an arch when you don't know where it is could take a while and by that time you would have likely died of low health/radiation poisoning several times over.  Finding the plans to build one would also take time.  I'm thinking that it could be done, but it would be a grind.
---
I've noticed I get triple drop rates almost when the server is lagging like crazy actually .gotta be quick to grab everything before u dc I dont even look what it is just grab and go ..I've even got plenty of 3s on non legendarys when it happens.
---
Saw someone nuke Watoga yesterday.  Was very disappointed.  Felt like the same robot spawns.
---
Thank you so much for this. I too have been absolutely annoyed by all this bs. Every time I see someone trash talking the game (and using things that have already been proven false, such as the ‚Äúmillions who lost their data‚Äù thing when in reality it was about around 60 people who only lost account user and passwords), I always try to prove them wrong but after finishing the post I always just delete it before posting for fear of the hate bandwagon downvoting me to hell. Yeah, we understand it‚Äôs a shitshow and you should damn well hate Bethesda but don‚Äôt hate the devs. They are trying to fix the mess. They are releasing update after update to hopefully bring the game out of the grave. The problem is the corporate Bethesda, not Fo76‚Äôs devs. Seeing your post not get thrown into the abyss is a welcome sign to me. I used to watch Juicehead and enjoyed his videos too but all his bait titles pissed me off to the point that I unsubbed his channel. 
---
Nah, I think the hate train is earned.
---
I want this too. Only don't call it guild. Call it faction to fit in with the game theme. 
---
I also want to be able to build co-operative camps, that give us bigger area to build. Not sure how that would work, if it would have to be an instanced space. I'm not keen on that, because I absolutely love the open world, and I love that my camp exists in it. But I also understand that it might be hard. Certainly a thought is that across the river to the west, there's plenty of space for that. Maybe instead of the area of your camp based on where you set your camp, there are area's a player made faction can claim, and start to build up their post war city. You claim an area, rather than placing your camp. 
---
When the Faction leaders log on, it places the "city" on a server that has an open spot. Maybe there's like 10 different spots west of the river for this. When the city is up, any player on the server can come into the Factions city. 
---
If there were several player cities west of the river, there could also be PvP between factions. 
---
Player factions would have access to stuff to build that normal camps don't. maybe robots that act as vendors. Maybe you can set up a robot to buy things from other players. For example, you could give a robot say, 1000 caps. And set what items he will buy from players. Gears, screws, ballistic fibers. 
---
Stranger rolls into town, finds the Bot, sells some junk. Your faction gets valuable resources, player earns some caps. 
---
I still maintain that this game is functionally no different from any other game I've bought by the company.
---
Skyrim and Fallout 4 had terrible bugs, glitches, crashes, etc.  On PS4 Skyrim came with the game breaking memory leak.
---
A combination of modern hipster youtube clickbaiting and disappointed MMO players have perfect stormed this to where it is.
---
Meantime, I'm 110+ hours in and looking forward to getting home tonight to play more.
---
OP, I'm with you.
---
That's really nice of you and I appreciate it but sadly I'm on xbox, the thought that counts though!!
---
Overblown was likely a poor word choice on my part, I should have at least clarified that I meant the issues are overblown in the context of this game.
---
Everyone is directing their anger over a broken game at the individual developers instead of the larger publishers/industry that is pushing this behavior. The issues of a game are attributed to the dev team regardless of their involvement in publishing/marketing/design decisions and that studio gets shut down, then the publisher rams another shit game through and the next studio gets ruined. It keeps happening, and to studios who were previously well liked. We saw the same cycle with mass effect, the newest diablo debacle, destiny, and so on. 
---
This issue clearly isn‚Äôt contained to to just individual studios, and consumers clearly disagree with publishers about what can be expected from a $60 game nowadays. We‚Äôve just reached a point where the ‚Äústop preordering‚Äù crowd has been around long enough that there‚Äôs no excuse for continuing to do so. There‚Äôs no reason to buy a game without being well informed, but people still do and get angry when it isn‚Äôt what they expected. Those people annoy the hell out of the ones who did wait, who did make informed decisions, and enjoy the game they bought
---
Interesting, I'm level 55 and have had that maybe once in my time with the game. 
---
Grafton Steel has one as well.
---
&gt;There comes a point where it becomes an obsession though, and not a particularly healthy one. It's good to be a fan of something and be passionate about it, but the moment it leads them down the path of going into rage mode because something isn't exactly what they expected, it's probably time to take a break from it.
---
Paging all *TROO* and *HARDCORE* FALLOUT FANS. 
---
Jokes aside, yeah, its insane how dedicated certain people are towards justifying their distaste towards a piece of entertainment. Its even more absurd how vile people act towards those who don't share their sentiments. The amount of "Bethesdrone/sheep/paid shill/fake account" accusations towards people who aren't in an outrage over the game is borderline t_d level antics. 
---
this is the dumbest arguement I've seen on this sub. rockstar didn't release red dead online for $60 dollars. it was a free addition to a single player game. the single player has no microtransactions. fallout 76 is a half assed multiplayer game without a decent single player to fall back on. comparing red dead online to fallout 76 is like comparing the frosting of a cake to an undercooked piece of chicken. not the same in anyway, no matter how much you want to justify your purchase.  
---
I noticed these guys for the first time the other day when nuking fissure site prime. I just thought "WTF is that?"
---
I concede your point.  Just a thought.
---
This game has potential.  Great potential if they can fix it.  I have played every fallout from 1-76, and let‚Äôs be honest fallout has always had bugs (I‚Äôm looking at you interplay.) That said this game is incomplete. Period.  The basic framework is there.  It has a wide area to roam, with many diverse locations. It has a basic story with plenty of detail backing up the general story and giving flavor to the surrounding area.  What is glaringly obvious is that it‚Äôs not complete.  Less than 50% complete.  Every main quest builds the main story and then nothing.  It simple just drops the story at your feet and asks you to just be okay with it.  Of course they will add more story as the game gets older.  The question is why did they deliver this as is?  There is absolutely no endgame.  Killed the scorchbeast queen? Cool here is your loot and a little notification she is dead.  No cutscene, no opening of another challenge.  All there is just a grind to get better gear so instead of one shotting a critter you can one shot a scorchbeast.   In short there is no challenge.  And as far as I am concerned that‚Äôs the biggest problem with this game.  Nothing in this game makes you say ‚Äúoh shit‚Äù in the later levels.  I freely admit when I first fought my first scorch beast it was exhilarating and quite an experience.  Now they are merely annoying and not worth the trouble.  If this game is going to survive, there has to be things that make people want to play together.  I could go on about the pvp or the imbalance, or the legendary weapons but really at its heart the problem is there isn‚Äôt anything making people want to play together in this game.   Without incentive to play together this game will die.  I hope it doesn‚Äôt because for the first 20 or so levels there was real potential.  Ending this wall of text I would offer a few suggestions instead of just gripes.  First offer some form of challenge that requires teamwork i.e. a super duper Goliath that is threatening white springs etc.  Next would be the nukes and nuked areas.  It‚Äôs ridiculous that the only two places worth nuking is white springs and prime.  There should always be a super beast in wherever you nuke.  Unique awards should be given for different areas.  And lastly sweet baby Jesus end the cap on stashes or at least don‚Äôt allow certain items like ammo, junk etc to count toward the cap.  The amount of time I have spent managing my inventory is insane.  This is my two cents and I hope that they continue to improve on this game.  It just feels like they are way behind and as someone pointed out in this thread, the game may be dead by the time they patch it into a finished product.  
---
Try the area east of Top of the World.  Low chance of enemy spawn, and close to Whitesprings, the mire, and Alpha Silo, and a short walk to the Train station.  There is a stream nearby for water, and a junk pile nearby for resources.
---
Look closer at that image. Look at it carefully and then tell me it was supposed to be glass. 
---
Lemme dupe those weapons.
---
What platform are you playing on? 
---
its does like 200ish when im melee spec'd so any specing will bump up that damage. i shot a vertibird out of the sky with one shot from one of those... reload sucks though. 
---
+1 for MATN.
---
Fun is a different thing. Bad games can be fun, jank has it's charms.
---
This game is objectively terrible and a borderline insult to it's audience. But I can say the same about some stand up comedians I like, too.
---
Had been farming Watoga for some Legendarys and suddenly 5 Col. Gutsys spawned in right at the high school. After dying twice in quick succession (thankfully getting me junk each time) i retreated to the train stations bathroom and logged out. Apologies to the Lvl 50 using the Train Vendor for likely drawing them to you.
---
How do you fair in Blast Zones?
---
1. Yeah. Possibly related to fast-travelling when the other player hasn't arrived yet.
---
2. Not seen that, although frame rates do drop in queen fights. Maybe worse on consoles.
---
3. I'm ok with the food/water consumption rate, even with Speed Demon and no Class Freak. However, I do find that I pick up less food and water when playing with a team. Maybe build your base near water and spam out soups at the start of the session.
---
I've been considering revisiting one of my completed saves in FO4 just to run around populating all the possible settlements. Maybe get a mod set specifically for settlement enhancement. 
---
Yeah that's a huge plus
---
I had been using a similar Pipe Rifle earlier, before I had all the Rifle related perks maxed up (I had to move some SPECIAL stats to do so, which took a lot of leveling up).  And it just wasn't hitting hard enough, so I had changed to using a Gauss Rifle for a while.
---
I had found a Two Shot Harpoon - but, it did literally ZERO damage to everything I tried it on.  I don't know why, so I discarded it (sad).
---
Since then, I have found ZERO Two Shot Weapons other than Two Shot Explosive.
---
TSE is stupidly OP and makes the game not fun, but I refuse to have my ass kicked by rats and crickets - so I'm "between a rock and a hard place" in terms of weapon choice.  
---
I almost wish Bethesda would say "fuck it, we suck too hard" and give up Fallout 76 to the community to mod and improve.
---
I want to be challenged by the big boss monsters, but I want to mow down pests like rats with easy one shot kills (that don't also blow me up in the process) without having to use VATS and Mutations.
---
I just want a kick ass rifle, when I shoot the rat, it's dead, no question - *way* dead.  I don't even want TSE guns to exist in this game, I don't want it to be possible to one hit kill PLAYERS unless it's either A) A Sniper Headshot, or B) if it's Melee, it has to be a "sneak attack" critical. [from *BEHIND*, or while invisible]
---
Rats are way too tough, and fully armored players are way to squishy - I just can't find a happy balance in this game, I don't WANT to be able to kill a Scorch Beast with one magazine worth of ammo (about 7 - 8 shots).  I don't want to take as little damage as I do from Scorchbeasts attacks, but I want to be WAY tougher vs other player Melee attacks, and get rid of the BS TSE weapons.
---
Praise the benevolent Jon.
---
Let's be real here. Pete is one of the worst PR guys in the industry right now. All he does is get mad and throw a name calling fit over any sort of criticism.
---
Yh just need plans for the back brace and im good to goüëç
---
I think watching people play got popular as demos started to fade away. Not to mention there are tons of non-gaming folk who are interested in games. Perhaps for their story or just interested in how it all works. I've never watched let's plays or streams myself so I can only guess. But I do try to cut genZ some slack. They like weird stuff, but so far they seem so less horrible than our generation (not that thats hard to do).
---
Get them all the time on PC. Probably 25% of my fast travels result in infinite loading screens. Have to kill the game and restart. Major annoyance. Seems to have picked up after the last patch.
---
By saying they limited STASH because of server stability, they basically admitted that their game engine is crap. I don't know if that is better than just saying they limited STASH space to force players to make tough decisions when it comes to what they keep and what they grind down to materials. 
---
&gt;Easy content is easy money.
---
The game (+atomic store) in a nutshell.
---
Honestly my biggest issue.  If I could put armor over the Hazmat suit, I wouldn't care about the rest.
---
I love it! Very vault tech ish! However I feel like the people might riot if they found out it was all a simulation, burn BGS to the ground and all of that.. 
---
Thanks for the tip. Hopefully we can get a few months on that sub before /r/fallout invades there too to remind fans of the game how objectively wrong they are for liking it lol. 
---
This happened to me two days ago.  Posted a "Help me!" Reddit. It went away, fortunately. 
---
To your 3rd point...
---
...after like, level 25-30? I never once had a problem with sustaining myself, at all. So I don't think calling them outrageously bad is really valid.
---
Perhaps it's your playstyle that is unsustainable.
---
Disagree.  I always shoot first and I have no questions.
---
If I show up at your door, chances are you did something to bring me there.
---
In the overlap area was it even harder?
---
Good advertising 
---
My Dream is Weightless Wood, 20% Weapon weight reduction, +1 Agi
---
Overrepair with weapon artisan and gunsmith rank 5 will help with this, I usually get to the normal 100% durability after a queen fight on my .50
---
I play the game without power armor and do perfectly fine. The ONLY time I EVER get in power armor is in a nuke zone or if I want to take the quick way down a mountain or cliff and just jump off. You already have to carry around fusion cores to use the armor which use up a sizable amount of carry weight depending on how many you want to have. I dont see why others using power armor makes you ang....wait, you got killed by someone else because they were in power armor didnt you? And now you're complaining online about as is the typical response of the self entitled
---
There's less to do in Red Dead online than Fallout 76
---
Worse than fallout 4, better than fallout NV.
---
You are a selfish crybaby and I mean that as well
---
Yeah it does. Not sure if there's a perk to speed it up? I usually pick enemies of at range, so it works well for that.
---
You know, ACG actually didn't put it in his worst games of the year list. I like watching his channel and was happy he didn't include it.
---
Google a map of junk piles on the map, place your CAMP there and put a collector on it. You basically get an infinite source of junk material (including screws). Just make sure you lock it :)
---
Post this somewhere else. Everyone in here knows this. 
---
I think you are correct.  More people would have probably posted its location here if it was able to be found/crafted normally.
---
They have the better memes and I love them for it.
---
On xbox, the game just isn't stable enough to fight her in the nuke zone. I kid you not, 5 FPS is "running really smoothly" for me. 90% of my deaths in there are from shit servers bogging down and when they catch up I'm dead.
---
I've found two, one not worth keeping, the other, debatable.  
---
The first was a two shot plasma minigun, it would break before you exhausted a core.
---
The second is a two shot grenade launcher, which, since it counts as a shotgun, kinda works with my build.
---
I wish there were a separate main story quest line for the evil characters (Raiders). Maybe introduce them to Rose sooner
---
Dude chill. This is just the current big name game to hate on. Once The Division 2 comes out they‚Äôll all move along to it, trust me.
---
Hell just the other day on the battlefield sub people literally made a list (maybe it was 2 lists) of 99 problems the game still faces. So it‚Äôs just cause Bethesda the big name is currently in the spotlight. Just tune out and breathe easy. 
---
Or if you‚Äôre prepared to go full sacrificial on this shit post this in r/fallout. Crash the hate train into the platform with all the salty mu‚Äô fuckers. 
---
There are guys in my office who are talking about 76 all the time, laughing at it. I asked them if they've even played it - have they fuck. It's really fucking weird to parrot an opinion about something over and over again when you have no experience of/with it.

I would put a level 52, 3 star legendary Col. Gutsy up against any other enemy in the game, and kinda wish there were an arena where we could actually do that just to see it wreck some scorchbeasts.  That thing completely ignored armor and had higher dps than even a super stimpack could heal at the same time so any sort of player animation other than running away at full speed was a death sentence.  I had to resort to throwing plasma grenades at it over a wall and it still took 10 grenades.
---
I've been called scum for defending the game. 
---
I believe this is the first time that a licensed song in a Fallout game mentioned the setting itself aside from ‚ÄúWashington Post March‚Äù, an instrumental.
---
According to this, it was New Vegas first kickstarted the trend of adding recordings from decades after the 50s (aside from BoS).
---
https://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Timeline_of_the_music_of_the_Fallout_series
---
‚ÄúBlue Moon‚Äù was from 61, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a Sin to Tell a Lie‚Äù and ‚ÄúRoundhouse Rock‚Äù from the 70s, ‚ÄúHeartaches by the Number‚Äù from the 80s, ‚ÄúIn the Shadow of the Valley‚Äù and many others from the 90s, and going all the way to 2009 for ‚ÄúSit and Dream‚Äù.
---
Your comment seems to sum it up pretty well. I had no idea that looting was different in nuked zones, and that there was an instance glitch. 
---
I wonder about the scorched queen though. I‚Äôve only helped kill her once, and I was the last of about a dozen people (not friends or teammates) to loot her. I still got my legendary (even though it was crap) and a bunch of other loot. Can anybody else confirm that she is shared loot?
---
hm, that's a good point. I mean, communicating with fans is literally his job though, the extended silence is getting bizarre
---
Don't get me wrong Bethesda deserves everything coming to them because of how they have mistreated fans with the overall release and how they have handled this whole thing (lets not even talk about the canvas bag and rum fiasco), but my God the game doesn't deserve it.
---
I know it is a cheap and tacky argument to say that another game is worse, but why is 76 receiving more hate than Red Dead Online?
---
I‚Äôve been having so much fun in this game from random unintended stuff that happens and I hope it doesn‚Äôt get patched either. As soon as I fast traveled though, the glitch went away, but I actually got it to occur a couple more times after that.
---
I think this glitch should officially be called the Wendigo glitch just for the hell of it.
---
I am level 40, and I never said I couldn‚Äôt sustain myself. It just seems I am always drinking and eating. 
---
It would also explain how you can"die" but come back.
---
More charisma helps, also need animal friend 3
---
Well its not like its undeserved
---
Yeah... I'm an asshole.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve sold them off for a while
---
If they changed the Hazmat suit to apparel, I'd be super happy.  I do still enjoy the idea of PA or Mutant though.
---
I find ppl don't talk about pre-50 performance with our without PA.
---
You're stupud not to run PA even if your final build is not PA.
---
I got raider pieces at 15, blazed thru to 25 as i could face tank anything using melee (doing a vats/rifle build with 3 str btw, no melee perks) then i made my excavator set.
---
2 days later I'm 37 because i continue to face tank everything. 
---
At level 25 i could EASILY kill max level whitespring ghouls.....
---
Its dumb and completely overtuned.
---
What do I get if I use the Portable Potty? 
---
I just use radshields mostly, sometimes my hazmat suit if need be. 
---
If you or a loved one has been disconnected from FO76, you may be entitled to compensation from the federal government.
---
Agreed!
---
I also max out rad sponge and share if in a team 
---
My whiskey powered punch hobo agrees!
---
About 600k on ps4
---
Yeah and you can buy legendaries from vendors that other people sold. I don't think it's a recent change.
---
The hate train for youtubers should probably apply some breaks as well tbh
---
It's that Damn radiation.  Without Rad Sponge and a group, you're either squishy or in PA.
---
I haven't noticed what OP said at all, but I came here to say what you said. When servers are in their last minutes of life 1-3* enemies start popping up everywhere. Not sure if it's by design or not. One weird common thing I've seen is dozens of 1 star protectrons that will infintely spawn in a town right before a server reboot. 
---
Automatic weapons would probably make it easy to kill groups of multiple rats, crickets, etc..
---
But I want to play my stealth sniper character - he should have not trouble taking these pests out - should be a cakewalk.
---
I didn‚Äôt even know RDO was hated. 
---
It is partly bandwagon jumping but then again Fo76 is 100% online. If the online has isssues that‚Äôs your whole experience. As I type this I‚Äôve just been disconnected. :/
---
I tried farming that Event 2-3 times during the last month and only ever got it to trigger once. Whats the trick?
---
What does that place offer? just curious.
---
I don't really like dropping it on whitesprings very much and am looking for alternatives.
---
The game fucking sucks 
---
And now I have more screws than Don Juan.
---
This NPC death bug has been popping up a lot lately. I've seen it all over the map and its weird and creepy.  
---
You'll see enemies just die as you walk around.
---
Points for repurposing the orange man bad meme, but yes, unironically yes. EA are a blight on the video game industry. They acquire good game devs, force them to implement insane P2W cash shops in their games and then proceed to run them into the ground before acquiring a new one. More than half of their revenue comes from FIFA player packs, and the shareholders notice this and seem to want more and more. Their spokespeople demonstrate they have no idea why people play video games time and again, all they know is that they make money by separately packaging in-game content behind a paywall, *especially* one with an element of RNG and actual in-game bonuses for very rare drops. 
---
How exactly does this hurt you?
---
What about just having a different weapon for this? I mean, it's not a one weapon serves all purpose kind of game. 
---
Ok. So where do we nuke China to get out ?
---
I disagree. I'd have no objections to a low level joining in an SQ fight. I doubt they're there to try and steal any glory. Maybe they just want a few extra xp, the chance if a decent weapon or whatever. Or they simply want to see what they are in for once they get to the stage they can actually take it on.
---
So they tag the beast a few times and hide, watching from the sidelines. They are learning. 
---
Yes the high levels will be the one to down the thing. But every bullet counts. 
---
Yeah server hopping for mods is epic endgame content. hehe.
---
Well darn it I have been tossing them on the ground when I was done with them, probably lost out on a few hundred caps...
---
I hear where you're coming from, but that would be like putting minimum SPECIAL required for weapons. Can't use a Gauss unless you've got a 12 Perception. Can't use a Grognak's Axe unless you have an 11 Strength. That kind of thing. I personally would vote against such a restriction (as if BGS would care what I have to say).
---
Also when you're in a blast zone and there are explosions...corpses getting blown all over the place.
---
Normal Armor &gt; Power Armor in Fallout 4 and NV. Have you played fallout before?
---
The what? I think that item is from other game
---
I get that a \*lot\* when I'm reloading gauss, it just plain dumps the charge I give it and makes me take even more time to get a shot off. It has cost me \*so\* many stimpacks.
---
I sure hope not
---
My boyfriend had problems placing his camp yesterday and we tried about 3-4 times to log out and back in to get a different server with no luck.
---
He‚Äôs always had problems replacing his blueprinted camp back down but finally realized it was due to the tent he had placed.
---
Best of luck!
---
Don‚Äôt repair your guns/armor at that level unless they are legendary with good perks. At that level, it‚Äôs best to just scrap and replace with new items you pick up.
---
yeah..whitesprings for example..i know i have a good chance to get defeated so i always go to that place where i can craft everything and store all of my junk..so i dont risk losing it
---
You can race horses or shoot people, wow so much too do.
---
From what I've read RDO is unplayable let alone getting into a server. 
---
That's a fair point with the 100% online - I will always be a supporter of any game that supports offline or private servers. (Wink wink, Bethesda)
---
I noticed turning the graphics down helps. I don't think the game is optimised to run on ultra. The game just bugs the fuck out and disconnects whilst it's trying to load everything.
---
I've also seen one with excavator, where the frame tries to 't pose' some, and the persons body crouches down, leading to streatching from the 'framed' parts that don't really move to the parts that do move alot and it's hillarious, like they are melting out of the armor and taking some of it with them
---
Sometimes I want to play the game without playing the game.  These times: C.A.M.P. building.   And, yes, every bit of budget is spent.  
---
Working on collecting all the Vault Tec blue/yellow/white stuff.
---
Does everyone in my party have to have the copy of the map, or is it shared?
---
What makes you think she was human?
---
They just need to put energy weapon perks for damage in the intelligence tree.
---
It's on the known bug list that endangerol does nothing.
---
There is a random spawn near the Charlestown train station that will have a vendor bot that sells them.  They cost 1K caps.
---
Probably the same way robobrains work or just taking a fake personality and replicating it in a bot 
---
I mean ... it would be the easiest to implement, lol. In all honesty at this point I am numb to server hoping because you do it for just about everything.
---
Crops for adhesive - farm hop server to server
---
Mods for anything - server to server hop
---
Fighting things over and over - Time to hop multiple times
---
I feel you. I do. But it would be quicker to farm than to rng build and end up with a ton of guns with effects you can't get rid of minus dropping them D:.
---
Wellllll that kinda worked. I was able to drop the two that I couldn‚Äôt before. I was able to pick 1 back up with my excavator armor duplicated on that one. The other one I still cannot pick up. But I guess I have an extra excavator now which is nice. This game is funny. Thanks for the idea though!!
---
I've seen this a lot lately.  I just figure the npcs are scared of me and elect suicide over the punishment I dish out. :)
---
FO76 uses GameEngine, like FO4, which is only 7 years "old". Morrowind used Gamebryo (well, technically, it used NetImmerse, which became Gamebryo in 2003). Even still, Gamebryo v4.0 came out in 2012, a few months after GameEngine came out.
---
I could gift you a furious armour piercing handmade. It's hogging my stash anyways. IGN same as here.
---
She talks about it lol they just used her voice and personality after the real rose died. 
---
I don't use/don't want to use VATS.  
---
Is there any way to get more than 5 round capacity in a Lever Rifle?  Because that's what I want.
---
Two Shot (Non Explosive) or Instigating Level Action Rifle seems like the gun that would let me be happy with this game.  Either faster reload (Lengendary extra star option/perk or larger capacity Magazine would also be nesc.  
---
Exactly.
---
Think of buying another product. Let's say a car.
---
You pay full price and it gets you to a and b.
---
But the media functions dont work, windows dont work but will be added later, spare tire is locked with no key, etc. How annoying would that be and the dealership has gone dark, disconnected.
---
I've bought $20 games with larger content and function. 
---
Dont get me wrong I'm still playing and praying, but new titles are coming up. It basically was a money sponge.
---
She was. She was captured at the attempt on Charleston. 
---
if you didnt go melee for your first character i'd say absolutely. if you've already slogged through the game without melee your second run will make you feel like a god. i got 2 pieces of vanguard armor at lvl 10 and that made me damn near invincible, get a good fast melee weapon like the death tambo or hooks and you will absolutely destroy everything you come across. 
---
Really, its that same scramble and hustle for views and dollardoo's, follow the popular trends save me from getting a 9 to 5 additude.
---
Oh ok. Dropping it worked for one of mine. It actually duplicated my excavator armor onto its which was weird but nice haha
---
My little brother got 76 for christmas and since most of the major youtubers talk shit about it he was gonna have the parents return it. I told him to just play it for a bit and if he hates it we will return it and ill cover the difference so he gets 60 back. Turns out he really likes the game and we play many nights weekly. Its ridiculous that the hate has been so huge that it even affected him to a point of not even wanting to play at first. Its a bummer, and at this point if more people are like that they are gonna need to put out hella game deals to get people playing it.
---
Maybe I just assumed because you can't break them down you can't sell them too. 
---
Perhaps most up your alley would be a solid combat knife then?
---
That's my point.  You're stupid not to run PA.  That's an issue.  It feels forced.
---
Well there are also perk cards for each class of weapon to boost damage. Better then nothing I guess.
---
I only ask because perhaps I missed it but I was curious about this as well.
---
You're not alone, I've felt the same many times. At this point the "FO76 hate train" seems to be related with some sort of group pathology.
---
PC also; for some reason, Lewisburg train station is very common for infinite loading screens on fast travel.
---
Somebody tripped over the Serenity Lane power cord.
---
Enough fusion cores in this game where you can stay in power armor and never have to take it off.
---
Well... More of a heavily armed Osprey.
---
If I remember correctly No Man's Sky was much much worse in both experience and the commentary.   
---
Time kind of makes us forget.    But I remembered how bad NMS was, so when they finally fixed it I did not bother to play it again.  The memory was too bad.
---
However I did play The Division once they fixed it and I play Destiny 2 now that it is fixed.
---
I will also play FO76 again once it has reached its figurative version 2.0 as well.   Level 87 is enough for right now. 
---
1. My boxing glove is literally doing several times more damage than my missile launcher. This REALLY doesn't make sense either. Sense isn't part of the equation, you're making that rule up. Unless you can find a BGS quote.
---
2. Not being able to use End Game gear in End Game is asinine.
---
3. It worked fine in Fallout 1, 2, 3, NV, 4. Apparently sense didn't matter then?
---
160s.
---
You need cap collector to get the numbers high
---
OK, something to fix the balance so I can run Blast Zones solo without PA.
---
Ok thanks. I maybe it‚Äôll be worth moving the points to have lvl 80 death claw at my camp lol. Any idea on how much of your budget they consume? 
---
I stealth melee face tank for SBQ. Totally viable with 1* unyielding gear your agility can be cranked so high things can't spot you. Fuck dodgy though, it just drains AP and prevents you from sprinting.
---
Because what good is a control vault if everyone is dead.
---
Look at r/unionmerchant76 . I don't know a lot about them, but from what I've seen, they seem to have a groups for different playstyles.
---
Skyrim, along with FO4 and FO76, are built on the Creation Engine, not Gamebryo. So if ES6 and Starfield use the "same" engine, it'll be that (which is only 7 years old), not the same engine as Morrowind.
---
Yup I started doing this a while back especially when I started getting heaps of radrat and mole rat events that are near impossible to finish. Some especially in the mire are worth doing the defence depending on what attacks (eg anglers for adhesive).
---
thanks for checking on it :)
---
M570 was nice enough to take me to a few places and I‚Äôve roamed around with them today. 
---
Ahh vendor bot responder. Time to Server hop. Thanks. 
---
I appreciate your reply, after all I wanted to see what people had to say about the matter. Of course I tugged a few heartstrings along the way. 
---
Just speaking for myself obviously, I don‚Äôt ever use fatmans or any ammo for that matter. I‚Äôm a melee build, and guns ain‚Äôt my thing. If I see somebody‚Äôs base in the middle of nowhere, I won‚Äôt attack it just like that. I‚Äôll wait for the person to come back. Or even better I‚Äôll venture out and search for people. I like to start with a conversation, get a feel of how I‚Äôd like to go about it. Some people I don‚Äôt bother with, but usually higher levels and people who are duping and such? I‚Äôll open windows that are closed, or leave spoiled goods on your table. Fuckin with those players is fun for me. 
---
And the story I‚Äôm pushing is strictly for me, in my head. Not the forcing players to farm mats, or forcing them to leave the world. I don‚Äôt feel bad about making them farm for one of each material needed to repair because...well...I have a feeling they were going to go out and scavenge anyway. if they hop that‚Äôs their choice. I have never attacked a camp twice in one session. There isn‚Äôt any lasting effect of story in the game world itself, and it would be awesome if there was. 
---
This game does not provide a clear vision, and the only thing I see that this community is pushing for is an online version of a fallout sims game. So that is why I‚Äôm pushing for alternatives, to change the paradigm that all people who like to raid use x01 PA and use mini nukes and dupe the fuck out of the game and such, and that there‚Äôs variety and flair, personality to players and their approach to the game. 
---
Until somebody from Bethesda or Todd himself says, ‚Äúhey, ya can‚Äôt be attacking other players‚Äù and takes the mechanic away, I‚Äôll continue to play the game the way I‚Äôd like. 
---
But as of right now all the tools are there. It is totally allowed. It isn‚Äôt encouraged, but it‚Äôs allowed. Thanks for your time 
---
If you didn‚Äôt use the free move then if you find a server without another camp in a near proximity it will rebuild it again. 
---
You might have chosen a too popular spot. 
---
Making changes to the game: patch the game, create new exploit. Allow player base to destroy economy with exploit. Promise new modes that benefit those that exploited the game.
---
Are you sure you want a video showing that Bethesda has been trying to do something? And I'm not trying to hate, I'm sad that they destroyed the game. Most the bugs could be worked around, and with friends it didn't feel too grindy. Its just not fun anymore, and I doubt Bethesda will ever be able to bring me back. We
---
I bought the fan last night from the atom store. It started spinning immediately when I placed it, but then it just stopped after 3 seconds. I put another up in another room, same effect.  Oh the light is nice on it, very bright
---
I think it spawns more plants in the region (like blackberries)
---
Her picture is in the security office of the capital. Next to the stash of hella raider armor. 
---
&gt;The fact is that the majority of gamers who tried FO76 aren't happy with it
---
I'm going to go ahead and ask for a source on that. 
---
This so much. 800 would be a good QoL change just to stockpile ammo components. I think every minute I'm fighting the queen turns into five minutes farming for ammo, yet I pass up so much steel and lead in casual play just from having limited storage. 
---
Bethesda benefits from our storage being what it is. 
---
&gt; Claiming that Morrowind and Fallout 4/76 are built on the same engine is an exercise in ignorance on how engines work.
---
That, and it's literally not true, either.
---
I can guarantee you that no armor can save you from a tse. And yes they made a change to the pvp system by involving the entire team in a previous patch, sorry you fell victim to that poor decision. Whether you use it or not, there is always a viable build. Personally I hate having to use it because it's just annoying to have to get in and out of just to use a workbench. There is no need for it to be mandatory, it is up to you, the player, if it is needed or not. And no, I'm not getting butt hurt, I'm tired of people complaining about things that are completely their fault and demanding changes be made to suit their own personal needs. 
---
Where else are you going to do that much damage for a half pound? 
---
Try being 51. I feel like ive stepped into bizarro world.
---
Saying salt is OP, but the OP is being salty about how all the salt from youtube is OP....
---
Whatever. I just like listening to old jazz/swing music while i shoot mutated things.
---
Was looking at your special distribution since you called it a "jack of all trades". My most used toon is aimed at this too. The builds are no pa heavy weapons with a rifle for cripple, melee with a automatic for trash and a variant of explosive gl with shotgun and gauss. How do you get around with only 5 int? I assume a majority of your builds use Explosive shot so you will have the demo card. 
---
Also do you feel that any tier makeshift warrior is needed for melee focused build? Melee does not break as often and is cheaper to repair in my experience. All in all nice job man. Wish I did more active mutation farming etc. Btw is your camp at the mainroad between watoga and bog town? If so get off my lawn hehe.
---
Yeah! There‚Äôs a perk that lets you tame animals! Someone described it better in the earlier comments 
---
It is... However, if you dislike it just don't use it. My third character is a cowboy and I refuse to use it.
---
Participate in all end game content and farming using Hazamat suit proto or armor if farming queens.
---
Many people agree with you in regards to needing a re-balance. Either change the stats, change fusion core drop table, or how fast they deplete. 
---
There‚Äôs more folk than bluegrass admittedly, perhaps leaning towards gospel.
---
Blind Willie Johnson was a pioneer of that though I am a bit irritated that his original records are very rare and costly to obtain. I believe he has supplanted ‚ÄúAnything Goes‚Äù as the oldest licensed song in Fallout though the former had a rather nebulous reputation as being recorded in both 1934 and 2004.
---
Tennessee Ernie Ford did a lot of gospel though I‚Äôm glad they went for his more country hits. His album Hymns was one of the first yearly top selling Billboard albums went they first started keeping track of them when the LP was invented in ‚Äò48.
---
A lot of the artists on the soundtrack are more country than bluegrass like Bob Wills, Johnny Bond, Sons of the Pioneers etc.
---
***
---
If I‚Äôm not mistaken, you can make a jukebox that plays only bluegrass instrumentals, but it‚Äôs not broadcast on the radio. They appear to be licensed from APM Music like the other Fallout games, but that‚Äôs a whole other road of discussion.
---
I completely agree.
---
The "just run none pa" ppl drive me nuts as they dont mention the piles of hours it takes (or thousands of caps to trade) to even be comparable when ultimately they fall flat in nuke zones.
---
OK, I want a Rifle that's specialized in killing Rats and Crickets then - OK if it takes 30 shots to kill a Scorchbeast.
---
TSE Shotgun kills everything easy - but I don't want that.  I don't even like that such a BS OP weapon exists in this game.  That's why I haven't tried to get one, if I had one, I drop it without even trying it out, I hate them that much.
---
you can craft items and shoot people, wow so much to do in fallout 76. is that really your arguement to how a full game is comparable to a multiplayer add on?
---
Yw!
---
That‚Äôs awesome! Thanks also awesome username 
---
I bought the game and I honestly regret it completely like the launch was absolutely terrible and the way Bethesda has handled it is terrible.  Bethesda is one of my favorite publishers and it's truly unacceptable that they'd do this.  It's definitely tainted my view on Bethesda.
---
I second or third the cliffs north of the Radio Array and Silo Alpha. Lots of mineral deposits and you can build a back deck with a view of the Mire all the way down to Fissure Prime. You can watch missile launches from the actual silo and see them touch down 2 min. later. It is close to centrally located for Whitesprings, Watoga, Harpers.
---
I was surprised by the missiles, you can actually see the booster stages falling away and it appears to be modeled on the Titan-II missile which was also the Gemini launch vehicle.
---
Alright I would actually love to see a screenshot of you running a Nuke Zone without Hazmat and PA and taking less than 5 rads per second. I'm not being sarcastic, it would be a gamer changer most of this community has confirmed it can't be done. 
---
Yeah. A random party invite can help you get somewhere easier. That‚Äôs why I accept random party invites for about 5 minutes incase anyone needs to get where I am. It‚Äôs a free fast travel and can get you places you‚Äôve not been. 
---
I absolutely agree with everything you said it's so frustrating to see nothing but hate for this game. I do love to play it and still do almost every day, that being said here is my only issue with the game; preorder value: I bought the tricentennial edition back in July (I'm a fallout fanboy I couldn't help myself) the few paints and $5 worth of atoms doesn't feel like it was worth the money I spent on the preorder, as well as it was a big slap in the face now that the vanilla game comes with the free 500 atoms. But I can recognize that is Bethesdas fault and doesn't make the game bad. 
---
And god your right I wish the devs would get more credit, if you read the patch notes they have been saying since day one that this game is made for THE FALLOUT FANS, every update they listen to our feedback and address our biggest concerns. 
---
Yeah, but after the bombs dropped,  at a ski resort.... by raiders?
---
OK I'll get one once I'm home
---
Happens to me a lot, especially when fast traveling (even though no one else is around). Not just enemies, either. I've had full cars fall out of the sky onto the ground, too (well, "out of the sky" is a bit of an exaggeration, but not much).
---
Thank you for the suggestion, I‚Äôve tried there, but they aren‚Äôt very active during the day when I‚Äôm playing. Also they have a lot of drama with people inside the group attacking shops &amp; bases. I don‚Äôt want to deal with that.
---
Oh I see. 
---
Yeah that sounds pretty unrewarding. Definitely should be better than the regular nuke grenade by a decently large margin. 
---
It's sad that so many weapons don't seem to work properly. More and more evidence points to a severe lack of testing for imbalances in this game. or hell... just even playing it in general before it was released. 
---
I 100% agree with the things you said.  
---
I had been thinking of making a smiliar post but didn't find the right words for it. I'm glad you did.
---
Wahhh people are sharing opinions I don't agree with wahhh 
---
Yes, but we did that. OP has a point, it‚Äôs just been too much. I know we all expect the absolute best out of Bethesda and were disappointed at launch but the game is being fixed and trust me they‚Äôre taking notice of the reaction for the future.
---
Let the hate die now. I‚Äôm sick of it too.
---
The ram ranch raiders have claimed many victims in their proud history spanning all the way back to the first beta.
---
I understand that, but why should I be limited to just trading items for caps. I would need more than caps to survive. That's what I'm saying. 
---
If I have stuff that I don't need and the vendor has no caps but has stimpaks (for example), I should be able to trade the stuff I don't need to the robot vendor. 
---
I believe a 5 cap bounty appeared on his head before he server hopped. Too quick to see though. The second Carlos hit the ground the murderer was gone 
---
I wasn‚Äôt suggesting that. But you could get a great melee weapon. And switch back and forth very easy so that you can fight those rats and crickets.
---
And her interrogation holo tape.
---
There‚Äôs a holotop recording in her control room that has the human Rose‚Äôs voice on it.
---
&gt;Give me proof of your first statement.
---
the Fallout playerbase. the statement "Fallout 4, but online!" can only attract so many new players.
---
&gt;Still, what they think doesn't matter.
---
indeed, the only thing that matters is keeping the game alive. and they need to cater to the right playerbase in order to do that- and that's not the multiplayer portion.
---
&gt;Damn, you seriously play this game for the grind.
---
I'll ask for the 3rd time: why do *you* play it? what hidden content there is that I'm missing?
---
&gt;Hitting 1 in 50 mobs? Either you haven't tried it, or you suck at aiming.
---
I'm sorry I'm not as good as you, because apparently, you can hit through walls. most people keep the ghouls inside the house. snipers can't "stand away and drink nukas".
---
&gt;And what about the in-game economy?
---
and then you wonder why I called you a mmo fiend. what fucking economy? this isn't a mmo. it's barely a multiplayer as it is.
---
Old world blues taught us that you can have a human live with out a brain heart or spine some raiders couldve been smart not all were brain dead 
---
I farm acid and gold at Hemlock Holes for...reasons...
---
I am at the point when I get the defense notification I just pop in, empty my extractors, and wait around to see if the attackers are anglers. If it's anglers I will exchange my bullets for adhesive, if it is anything else I toddle off and just retake the shop.
---
I thought it was a funny clip and I still love F76. I have had nothing but fun playing even with the disconnects and bugs. I have a lot of patience with these types of games though bc they don't seem easy to make/maintain.
---
Games like BO4 where bugs will get you killed or shots wont register when you need them to, I have very little patience for that.
---
Honestly, F76 had a rough start but I stuck with it and comparing the state of the game now to how it was at start, it's completely different and better. Yes, they still have a lot to work on but they are heading in the right direction and I see nothing but good coming.
---
If there are raiders out there who are being called griefers I haven‚Äôt seen them yet. I have two different types of instances of griefing or what I would call  douchebaggery so far. Both of them are pretty lame and have little to do with raiding as it clearly costs them more resources than they get out of it. 
---
The first are these clowns who are so impatient to access the vendor they throw grenades, shoot you, etc. or gang up and try the same thing. The way the game mechanics work, you aren‚Äôt going to kill anyone. These clowns are just queue jumping assholes and judging from their microphone chatter, not the brightest ones either.
---
The second was why I started building closed camps and locking my doors. Someone saved up all their mines and decided to place them in my C.A.M.P., wait for me to return, and then started sniping them while hiding in chameleon gear. This was the one time I have wished the PVP mechanics were not so hopelessly broken. I‚Äôve claimed this jackoffs bounty several times but the seek revenge mechanic is just dumb.  
---
If these are 'raiders', raiders are certainly lame in 2076. 
---
I think they looked in my containers in Sanctuary when I was playing FO4 - I'm a bit of a pacrat. XD
---
That's how I make my caps. 
---
You say "for sure," and I see others saying this too.  Just curious where you, or anybody, has proof of this?
---
No.
---
Go eat your steamed hams!
---
Or the turret never even opens fire at the enemy destroying your stuff right in front of said turret...
---
Placing them in elevated positions does seem to help with that, however.
---
People get so emotional about this game because they themselves enjoyed it or hated it, and want confirmation from strangers that they have good taste in video games.  I get the appeal of this game for some, but for the vast majority of people who played Fo4, it almost seems like a downgrade.  Both in story, dialogue, meaningful choices, and the list goes on.  For those expecting dynamic multiplayer experiences which depend on tactical teamwork and strategy, we are let down by ezkill explosive shotguns, no real rewards for holding forts or raiding, and the list goes on.
---
SO many issues in this game remain, and thats why the hate train keeps chugging.  If they add in those huge gameplay elements they've been spoiling, along with balance, and meaningful gameplay choices, I'd boot it up again.  But until then, people are going to look like entitled pasty whiners on either side of the aisle.
---
The bulk of the criticism isn't constructive, though. It's just memeing about how "Beth sux lol". 
---
And HALF of the critiques I've seen lately are related to bugs that have been patched away. The game's barely been out two months, and I think the patch team has done a pretty good job.
---
Was the canvas bag thing shitty? Yes. Also, literally every "special edition" item I've ever seen or bought has been cheap plastic garbage, do I wasn't shocked. That's why I don't but those anymore.
---
Were there bugs? Yes. Some bad ones, too. They've mostly been fixed. A few serious ones remain, but fixing on a game this complex always takes a while. And the game stopping bugs are gone.
---
Is it not like other Fallout? Yes. And maybe people didn't know what to expect. But personally, I find the isolation and desolation in the narrative a lot closer to fo1 and 2 in terms of theme, so I dig it.
---
My friends and I have had a lot of fun paying this game. I'd even go to say it's my best of 2018. And I'm baffled by this weird angry bandwagon that so many games have decided to jump on.
---
And to anyone who says this is the "worst fallout game ever"? Go pay brotherhood of steel, you petulant children.
---
When she‚Äôs landeded you want to put as many rounds on target as possible. The gat just doesn‚Äôt put out the same damage in a small window of time. The .50 is not an LMG with a .50 receiver. It‚Äôs an entirely different weapon.
---
Fake? What are you referring to here?
---
I did as well at 40, but then teamed with a 30 friend and together we could push through.  It's just so much easier with two to split enemies fire.  It did require coordination of quests.  So his availability left me ranking up but waiting on quests.
---
We should be able to make the like 4 or something moonshines.
---
What charisma level were you when you tamed him? (I would also like a carlos)
---
I have to disagree here.
---
This isn't Fallout 1/2/3/NV where the distinction was between ballistic and energy weapons. Ever since 4 the intent is clearly to make you choose between semi-auto and automatic guns, irrespective of whether they're ballistic or energy based.
---
What they need to do is fix they broken mess ASAP. It's frankly getting laughable - half these problems were present in Fallout 4 three years ago yet they still aren't sorted out.   
---
How is this even possible? I'm pretty sure that if I didn't bother to fix known serious bugs in 3 years I'd get the boot on the spot.
---
But Grahm just showed up lol, so I have him now 
---
I‚Äôve been dropping excess ammo and plans by vendors after I do my daily selling runs. Hopefully folks come by and enjoy the largess 
---
Haha keep it up big daddy bandit, I‚Äôm trying to hold down this front but too many people have gone soft. 
---
They‚Äôre too green for the foggggg
---
Maybe the game actually DOES suck and you and your brethren are in the minority. I'm sorry...but if it quacks like a duck, walks like a duck, it's probably a POS. I TRIED HARD to love the game....spent 50 hours trying to look past the constant bugs, server drops, dupers, missing textures, a half-assed wide screen support fix, broken quests, lighting bugs where sunshine shines THROUGH mountains...etc.  We are ALL entitled to our own opinions, but there comes a point where you can't keep your head under the sand anymore. Bethesda dropped the ball BIG TIME and we should not reward bad business practices with our hard earned money!
---
It's the thought that counts &lt;3
---
Yeah, but so are the daily posts talking about it here
---
Yeah, I agree it can be ok as ‚Äòicing on top of the cake‚Äô to crank out a few more materials while you‚Äôre out doing the real scavenging. But in my experience letting junk extractors be the primary method of resource collecting is too slow to be practical
---
You didn't read his post which admits the games faults over and over.
---
Nowhere did he claim it was a superior product. You are misrepresenting his post. Though the comment you replied to was quite sensible, on the other hand.
---
There is no mods, perk, or legendary you can apply to missile launcher, fatman, grenade launcher, etc. to make it even remotely match melee/unarmed dmg. There isn't sense in this game.
---
They should probably just fix the broken rad resist formula. It makes the 25RR legendary and lead lining  and perk useless.
---
With my set-up I can kill 6 Lvl 62 Ghoulies in 8-9 shots. The key strategy is where you position yourself. I don't kill SB in 8 shots - maybe more like 30? I don't like playing in "God Mode" but I do like my Character to have some sweet bonuses and QoL improvements - so my set up works for me. I'm a Sneaky Stealth player so I use higher elevations to get my advantage. 
---
And crossbows are used by no-one in game ... no Scorched, No Super-Mutants but they all carry them around for some reason!
---
It's a fair point, but after I stopped doing that, and left r/gaming, and r/games, I still run into hate train constantly.
---
However, to be fair
---
&gt; I just want to see one video where Bethesda is actually being acknowledged for making changes to the game. ONE.
---
That's because there hasn't been an changes in three weeks and that those didn't do much at all. The updates before that were mostly just a ton of nerfs. They didn't seem to fix people crashing the servers at all, there are just less people bothering with it now.
---
I've stopped playing at this point because I've hit 50, finished the quests, and roaming around for an OP exploding gun doesn't really interest me. I'm really hoping some things get fixed and the new weekly events are actually content worth doing (like raids in other games) and not just a chain of broken daily quests. I'm willing to wait it out a little longer, but soon it's going to be uninstall time because 45GB is a lot space to just leave sitting around.
---
Shit, I found one at the steakhouse... wish I would have known it was rare, I would have sold it...
---
Oh who am I kidding? that sounds like a lot of work, I still would have scrapped it.
---
If one has the pacifist perk equipped, can he still harm a tamed animal or he gets the same protection as other players and camp items?
---
Let's just hope this scared Bethesda into never making this same mistake with their premium releases.
---
I can sum it up for you real easy:  **Hate makes people feel cool; it gives them authority and power.** 
---
Should be fine, I have a 970 with your same processor but only 8gb ram. I do however have a gsync monitor which helps a lot for the times it gets down to \~45fps
---
I would also like to know this.
---
Why should we acknowledge the changes they should have implemented in the first place? Or any of their fuck ups, that needed so much 'press' to get fixed. I'm fed up of people defending companies that treat us like sheep.
---
I think the saddest thing about the whole "fallout 76 controversy" or whatever you want to call it is all of the other companies that have been caught up in it with no control over anything related to the game. I see adds on Facebook or Instagram for a fallout related loot crate, or some other product and the comments on the adds are ridiculous! People spewing hate at these companies for simply trying to sell an entirely different product, just because it's related to fallout. 
---
Then you get the complete opposite of that. The best example being the nuka dark rum. Yes I agree that a plastic bottle which houses the actual bottle of rum is not what anyone wanted, and was definitely a poor decision. But that decision, and product, was made by silver screen bottling company, not Bethesda. But everyone got upset (yet again I understand why) and directed their hate at Bethesda who had little to no control over the manufacturing and production of the rum. It's just really is exhausting. 
---
Also if your looking to check out a YouTuber who isn't hating on the game check out open world games. He's just genuinely enjoying the game, while providing news for it.
---
I have had a lot of great gear and was still able to go into Scorched Earth in a hazmat suit and never feel threatened. Maybe if they fix PvP this gear will be worth useful, but as it stands for solo play what you have is so overpowered to the point of making the game not enjoyable. I.E., "no difficulty = no enjoyment"
---
Yeah I agree that the game has had a bit of an improvement but there is some kind of hate meme on fo76 n Bethesda. Heh had a friend tell me that now I know how another friend felt about destiny 2 to which I replied with while destiny 2 did have a bad launch  the bad news came in at least once a month.
---
While fo76 has been getting bad news week after week. For now I'm just hoping Bethesda fixs 76 n learns from mistake.
---
Good doggy in endurance and set up water purifier in camp. I find so much canned dog food in the world (without can do perk). I only hold on to 20 at a time and I can't drink purified water fast enough I have so much I sell or give it away.
---
Looks like a vats stealth build to me.
---
I'm doing similar but no stealth so per/lck I'm putting to 15 instead.
---
Good overall.
---
I agree with this completely. I dont watch a lot of gaming vids on youtube anymore, and im staying away from the fallout community in general because they are mostly hateful fuckboys. 
---
The thing about this, that is so mind blowing to me. Is the sheer amount of straight up lies. Being told by all these youtubers, and being perpetuated by all these hateful nazi fuckboys. I can't believe we live in a world where such rampant lies can be accepted as the truth, just because you hate the same thing as the person lying to you. 
---
This is not just tainting, the otherwise amazing Fallout 76. This is a blight on the gaming community as a whole, and a swift kick in the genitals to any actual fallout fan.  It makes me really sad, and it makes me worry about the future of the gaming community. 
---
Robots randomly fall over dead when I'm walking inside the Whitespring, or the vendors drop to zero health without dying.
---
Sometimes my camp turrets drop to zero health all at once, and switching servers restores them to full health (repairing without switching servers is futile, as they drop to zero again seconds later).
---
I had the animal tamer (forget the actual name) perk maxed out, charisma only around 8 
---
There's a filter on your phone to turn off opinions you don't agree with from being shown. To turn it in
---
1. Take your phone out of its case. Skip if no case.
---
2. Flip phone over and remove back. If no way to remove shell follow alt method
---
3. Remove battery
---
4. Throw said battery off a cliff
---
Alt method 
---
1. Set phone on the ground
---
2. Grab a hammer and smash the fuck out of it.
---
Or you could maybe get a little more thin-skinned about a game that you like. Not everyone will have the same experience on this game. If you see a typical rant about game crashes or bugs, don't read it.
---
NemoTouchedDaBut lvl 115 on ps4
---
I read today that some folks put extra stuff in containers around the map. I think I'll start doing that. 
---
I think it works pretty reliably as long as you don't start shooting immediately.
---
I mean, That's how you're able to kill a Scorchbeast without a legendary weapon in under [a minute!](https://youtu.be/NWxnG3s1wAs?t=100)
---
I assumed that it's something to do with the NPC overcrowding bug. But idk, it happens to other stuff. Also sometimes if I kill an enemy from far away, when I start walking forward to loot it, the body disappears and another spawns in. RIP legendary mirelurk queen loot
---
You didnt play that dlc at all didnt you?
---
It funny how you cant defend any arguments and the only way you argue is with changing the arguments. 
---
Can't they just go back to RDR2 or smth and leave us? 
---
You sound really salty
---
the 2 grafton vendors sell them
---
Nothing. It turns out that rad suits and power armor have a hidden effect that reduce rads more then just rad resist ammout and it would take about 32k rad resist to match it.  Saw a whole post about it this morning just can't remember where.
---
76 caught more flak than NMS or similar train wrecks because it's by Bethesda, who up until recently had a fair good rep for releasing solid games that were well received by fans (hint, you personally not liking a Beth game doesn't change this, their rep before 76 was generally good).
---
Is it annoying to see, even as someone who dislikes 76? Yeah.
---
Is it gonna stop because you complained about it on Reddit &amp; got a lot of upvotes? No.
---
If you *really* find the scourge of 76 hate irritating, don't make a post about it
---
The same Fallout playerbase that is asking for bans to dupers and fixing on TSEs? I think they understand what kind of game they have bought. Still no proof.
---
I didn't know there was a "right" playerbase and a "wrong" playerbase. I'm starting to think you are a troll.
---
I play this game for the exploration, for the player interactions. Hell, I play it for this wonderful post-apocalyptic world the devs have created. Why would I do something boring in order to get something in the game? That would defeat its whole purpose.
---
I remind you of this wonderful thing called VATS once again. Even if you suck, you should be good as long as you use it.
---
There we go calling names again. I'm starting to see a pattern here. Look, I'm sorry that your head is so deep in the sand, I'm sorry that you are in denial; but this is an online game. You may play it solo - it still is an online game. You may not participate in the in-game economy by trading with other players - there still exists an economy in the game.
---
Interaction isn't forced. Doesn't change the fact that you are sharing a server with 23 other players. Like I said, you can ignore them, but that doesn't mean they cease to exist.
---
We need some kind of system because explosions move corpses an make stuff harder to find as well.
---
Yes Please I would love to see it. I am in a foresty area at a lead node and not quite sure how to make it more pleasant, I sort of gave up due to budget constraints, but have the itch to rebuild and try include my 7 water pumps and harvestor and clean it up a bit .. used to have a cool place at the golf course but had to rebuild so many times I gave up ..
---
I'm an avid reader and yet I generally dislike audiologs because they are pretty jarring having to listen to them and play. So I end up stopping what I'm doing so that it can play out, which isn't that great.
---
It's mixing two rather different activities into one and not many people are in the mood for both at once. It's one or the other, I read my books when I'm not in the mood to play a game and vice versa.
---
I usually listen for the flies ... and then realize it wasn't my meat pile.
---
The game is very mediocre, a lot of the criticism is deserving. My thought now is why does criticism against the game bother you so much? If you like the game that should be good enough for you.
---
When you die anything in your junk tab drops and becomes free to grab. 
---
This is incredible, well done! ( I need to get that White Knight thing!)
---
I really don't think the negativity is totally unfounded. I stopped playing after about 10 hours. But I can understand that you're tired of hearing people ripping on something you like constantly. Maybe you should look outside your normal YT viewing circle? Maybe there's someone else who makes videos that's still passionate about the game. 
---
If you never read any media and just played properly, in a vacuum it's a good game lol. Everyone loves the hate bad wagon. Easy internet points
---
there's also a bug in VATS that when ur crit meter is full you can hit the button to use the crit (Y on XB1) then exit VATS and then go back into VATS and fire. It'll crit which guarantees a hit no matter how low the percentage but will not use the crit meter so it stays full... So you hit no matter what and for crit dmg but your meter does deplete either. 
---
I got the arms and legs at Grafton Train Station. Still trying to get the chest.
---
I have hopes for this as there is a "Functional Still" in the Mire 
---
If we stop talking shit, then Bethesda will just assume we are over it and then will calculate the time it takes for the general public to get over a massive failure. With this calculation they will make another broken shitty game, take the blunt beginning backlash, then after that is over laugh their way to the banks because people like you want to complain about other people voicing their opinions. 
---
yep ive been using perk load out, better inventory, and component view, and health bar since they came out. Ive been playing since beta. I havent been banned . I would say stay away from the lockpick and reskin they were rumored to be cause of ban yet no one has confirmed.
---
I was reluctant to buy the game at the beginning. But with all the crap that was on day 1, i still found it fun. And its been getting better and better. The hate is truly misplaced (aside for the collector editions crap)
---
I dont think the point it that anyone care about youtubers, i think the point is they are just saturating the market with lies and hatred. 
---
I don't disagree with the intent behind the post, I just want to mention that NMS *definitely* received this kind of hate, for at least as long as Fo76 has so far, and a fair bit longer still.  And honestly, I think it's a healthy thing that it hasn't died down yet, as this sort of issue (half-finished, half-assed games released at full price) is becoming something of an epidemic for AAA devs.  If the exposure and the outrage dies off because of a few good patches months down the line, then this will become the new norm.
---
Do you *want* an industry where games are only actually playable 2-3 months after release?  
---
Annoying as it is, I'd rather have endless outrage than that bullshit.  Outrage is about all we have aside from not buying the game, and it's pretty clear there's not enough of us that actually remain informed to affect sales in a meaningful way compared to those who just buy them because 'Its Fallout' or 'It looked cool in those ads'.
---
No, it is not like saying that because you took it to extremes that mischaracterize reality. Windows 10 vs Windows 1.0? Seriously? That‚Äôs 30 years and 10-11 generations of development. Vs. Gamebryo &gt; Creation, which is just one generation.
---
This doesn‚Äôt even cover how flawed Gamebryo was from the beginning either.
---
By the way. When I get people who resort to dishonest stuff like this just so they can be argumentative, I cut them off at one chance. You blew it, so bye.
---
Yup, golf outfits are my go-to for easy money. There's usually one just sitting on the ground in the train station next to Top of the World. 
---
thank you :3. I'm currently running now PA so it be great to find a way to play nukes in WSP without hazmat suit. 
---
But, tenderizer rank 3...
---
it's funny how you edited your comment by adding arguments after I already responded. because originally it only said "there is more to do in fallout 76 than red dead online" such an insightful argument you made before you added shit.
---
The games shit m8. Not worth the $60 you spent. Sorry not sorry.
---
Yeah, only thing that stops me from doing that more is the ridiculously low weight limit of some boxes, but always good to give back. But, TBH, I‚Äôd really like to be able to break down ammo for parts, especially mini-nukes and missiles !
---
I believe it, I have been called a paid shill for not even defending the game itself, but for pointing out that a users comment  trashing the game and complaining #CaNvAsGaTe didn't answer a different users question about help with managing his inventory weight lol. 
---
It's literally memetics at this point.
---
"Damn idk if I like '76"
---
"That guy thinks 76 is bad?"
---
"I heard 76 sucked"
---
"76 sucks?"
---
"76 is trash!"
---
"76 bad"
---
"76bad"
---
You get the point. At this stage it's 'fun' for everyone to just not even give it a chance because the hive mind who can't make up their own decision have let others decide for them.
---
Granted, there are those who *actually gave it a fair shot* sadly, they seem few and far between.
---
I did but Its just a metaphor I'm not saying the raiders were any sort of doctors 0s Klein or moebius but there has to be some sort of intellectual raider who knew how to replicate human personalities or straight up transfer them but yes the lobomites had fake hearts coils In there heads and reinforced metal spines but still the brain is gone 
---
I "randomly" lose shit all the time. Because I'm an idiot and 2/3's of the time I realise I just fucking dropped the loot like a dolt.
---
How did they lie about the game before release?  A lot of criticism is justified, but they were pretty good about detailing exactly what the game was far before launch.
---
Exactly. The raider leader, David, based Rose's personality and voice off of Rosalyn, his (ex?)girlfriend.
---
I want to say line in the sand is the only one that triggers upon approach. I have been the only one in the bog when census, its a trap, distant thunder and so on have popped while I am just standing in watoga.    
---
Here is to hoping you are on xbox and you stumble upon my cache of plans I store in the blue cooler in the train station there. As I am missing only 2 BoS vendor  plans (may not exist have heard you can get what i am after but zero pics to back it up) A few of the whitesprings plans and that is me forgetting them. Heavy combat torso and T-60 right leg.  Then the ones you get from the queen but I do not count them in my farming rotation.   
---
Simple rotation check vendors if an event is on that you need go do it, then quit game reload into  a new world do events near you then recheck vendors and cycle like that it saves on caps. 
---
Lol Fallout 76 is terrible lol 
---
Cant spell BAD without EA
---
With some good luck.
---
Use one point of rad-sponge and share it. As long as you have a friend near by you won‚Äôt take rads in nuke zones if you have any type of PA on. No need for radaway or rad-x
---
yeah i have been noticing more crashes but not a crazy amount for me. it‚Äôll probably crash either 1-2 but there are times where it doesn‚Äôt crash at all. and that‚Äôs what i‚Äôm going to start doing, ima let them update the game a bit more and then get back into it
---
If you park you camp behind the golf course and set your turrets to spam the spawns I will go out of my way to not only destroy your camp but if I find you on my server I will proceed to kill you for being cheesy.
---
Other than that I usually leave people's camps alone.
---
You're sitting here complaining that you die from shooting explosive rounds at your feet? How about you trade up your TSE for something that isn't explosive and not complain about misusing or not understanding the effects of the weapon you've chosen. 
---
&gt; 14% upvoted
---
Everything appears to be in order.
---
There honestly isn't another viable option in a blast zone.  PA or Squishy Hazmat suit.  Also my Hazmat suit gets shredded very quickly in the Blast Zone, I have White Knight level 3 but I don't think that covers apparel. So either I'm forced into PA, I skip blast zones or I die a ton.  And you're giving me crap for having the audacity to want a 4th option?  How dare I?  I must be a super self-entitled snowflake.  Please sir, I shouldn't have been allowed to purchase this game!  Please sir, give me your address so I can send you my man card right now!!  My wife and children can't even look me in the eyes anymore because I wanted a 4th option!!!!  The horror!!!!!
---
In the first row of legendary affixes, shared with two shot and instigating, there's also double and quad ammo capacity. I'm on PC and have a Quad lever action rifle if that makes you happy, it's really fun because you can shot 20 times before reloading. However you really need to start using VATS, it's a core mechanic of the sniping system because when paired with proper perks like better criticals, four leaf clover and grim reaper's sprint, it makes you feel like a goddamn Jigen on fire. There are also mutations to improve your perception and critical damage, like eagle eyes.
---
See I‚Äôm gonna do the healthy thing and just wait a little bit until some stuff gets fixed, I‚Äôm not gonna scream my head off about the game. Not against you op.
---
Seriously this.
---
I honestly don't know if I'll be happy unless I get a direct statement from devs about what happened with these guns.
---
It's really, really, *really* bad how terrible they are relative to other options.
---
It's common sense. More data to process = more impact on stability
---
Yeah, I think I read a post that someone else made that said, keep the Hazmat suit as-is and make us able to put armor over the Damaged Hazmat suit (500 rad resist).
---
Agreed. It appears that way to me.
---
I noticed this last night. A few things on the server I was on would just die when I got closer. Maybe they were already killed by another player and the server was just being buggy.
---
ah ok, thats the last quest i gotta do
---
Cheers m8
---
Why are you booing him, hes right
---
I'm Charisma 9 with max animal friend, I could only pacify a level 50 sloth but I read they need to half your level to tame them and I'm level 67.
---
So what should you do if your tired of people complaining about something you disagree with......complain about people complaining.  
---
Just because you want to overlook a lot of their issues doesn‚Äôt mean other people will.  
---
And comparing a no name company that produced no mans sky to Bethesda is a joke.  
---
It'd be nice if enemies didn't attack your camp as a result of it existing and always focus fire your crops/generators.  And if defenses (including guard pets) were more proactive in protecting your place instead of only being reactive....some of the time
---
Oh ok.

* VATS is screwy with two shot weapons while this can be improved with hip fire accuracy buffs it's still not brilliant
---
* tormentor is primarily for scorchedbeasts

* Mutations are OP and fun use class freak and starched genes in every build

* Green thumb and travelling pharmacy are QOL and can be swapped if you don't mind having to swap them in and out when over-encumbered/in a nuke zone

Were you able to loot the mothman?
---
Looks cosy. Must feel like coming home every time you return to C.A.M.P.
---
Yeah thats it. A scorch beast fell out of the sky on me over the weekend. Forgot to mention that. My tactics are generally stealth
---
Because it would be too easy to get caps then, or to amass items. Look at how much ammo is worth, in your pipboy. Now imagine trading a huge stack of 308 to a vendor... You'd clean their inventory out. By limiting it to caps it becomes a progression barrier. By having an inflation of sorts you get a small return back on what you sell, once again feeding into the progression barrier. If it's too easy to get caps and stack up on stims, ammo, etc from vendors.. It defeats the purpose of crafting it and trading with others, thus rendering the game economy useless.
---
It's annoying that you can't trade item for item, but it seems like it's there for a reason.

I'm trying this tonight. My wife would like to feel OP for once.

Loved the Bluegrass mod on Fallout 4!!!!
---
I mean..  Does anything really matter?
---
Is this a mod that allows you to quick change your perk cards???
---
I've had this happen to me a number of times, but it usually doesn't last very long. The server usually ends up crashing, at least for me.
---
Also this thread made me realise that I (now at lvl 65) have been playing a lot more simplistically than everyone else here!
---
I do mine right in front of the vault 76 with the vault in the background.
---
Also as a note, you don't need the Atom PJ's, there are 7 options, you just need to do 5 of them
---
Pre-Dec 11 Update.
---
Your first pic makes me laugh though!
---
And her corpse in the jail cell.
---
I do. I think part of it is people server hop A LOT
---
Thanks, I'm PA 1h melee now and just looking for something perhaps more challenging.  Going to try to score some armor with +agi.
---
I loved the counterpoint from /u/Secretly_A_Skeleton
---
&gt;If Rockstar made Skyrim, every mission would start with a half hour of banter and you'd be coerced into working for the Legion even though you know they're just gonna betray you.
---
I think it's prepping ya for Valhalla Val hallen.
---
Oh yeah? How do you enable text chat? How do you see the total weight of each inventory screen? How do you save perk loadouts and switch between them?
---
Unless you're referring to something else entirely. 
---
are you playing on console or pc?
---
I tried it with stimpacks and I only got 1. I think it only works with drugs, or is bugged.
---
If you have rad resist armor, stack radshield &amp; radx that's 1800 radiation with the weekest armor,so pair that with a high resist armor and it's easy,then have a team with rad sponge &amp; ghoulish you're golden
---
Watch the initial reveal and listen to Todd speak about the graphical improvements to the engine, most specifically "sixteen times the detail from Fallout 4"
---
it's been in since the start so there was never any release notes about it
---
That happens in closeness too. I kill around 10 glowing ones and only 3 bodies were left. I came back 20 minutes later and another body appeared
---
Very bad use of sarcasm, it's quite over done. I never said you shouldnt ever use power armor, I never said that it cant be an option. What I am saying is that it is a very situational piece of equipment for a lot of people, myself included. I only ever use it in nuke zones. Why? Because it is needed and makes sense. Would you survive ground zero of a nuclear strike in just plain clothing with some metal protective pieces put on? Absolutely not. Would you survive in a hazmat suit? Yes, but you would be very squishy, as you've said. Would you survive in a walking tank? Absofuckinglutly
---
You run out of your cap quota pretty quickly. I usually end up dumping them on the ground after selling off what I can to nearby vendors.
---
I don't get how reading about a shitty game is exhausting, and people say the game is in a "good state" rn, but ihl have yet to see a post stating what has been fixed and what qualifies as a "good state" of the game, if it was fun now, wouldn't word of mouth begin to spread? Wouldn't you be able to clearly explain, or at least give reasons to why the backlash is unwarranted. Instead all we get is "it's exhausting" and "it's in a good state now", with no actual valid examples to support this. 
---
I don‚Äôt give a shit what they think but it sure would be nice to find something I‚Äôm searching for in the game without several pages of bitching being pushed to the top first. 
---
Man, I ran both vendors the whole day and got arms and legs 5 times each and not a single chest.
---
I've yet to see any evidence of mod users being banned.  Third party software like Cheat Engine and mods are two very different things.  I still avoid the server side stuff, just in case.
---
Bethesda deserves all the shit they get, tbh. I'm sorry you're upset, but giving shitty AAA companies shit for their terrible business practices sustains me :D
---
&gt;The same Fallout playerbase that is asking for bans to dupers and fixing on TSEs?
---
pretty sure that's the online portion. you should visit other communities, because this sub is a cesspool of like-minded individuals.
---
like you!
---
&gt;I didn't know there was a "right" playerbase and a "wrong" playerbase.
---
cater to the online playerbase: game dies when they inevitably move on. meanwhile, people still play Fo4 religiously despite all the shit it got. so yeah, from a financial standpoint I'd say there's a "wrong" playerbase.
---
&gt;I play this game for the exploration, for the player interactions.
---
so you *are* a mmo fiend. because there are better options for "player interaction" out there. and exploration is limited by the map, by now you should've exhausted it unless you're really slow-paced.
---
&gt;I remind you of this wonderful thing called VATS once again.
---
didn't know VATS could target from behind walls. oh, wait- it can't.
---
&gt;Interaction isn't forced. Doesn't change the fact that you are sharing a server with 23 other players. Like I said, you can ignore them, but that doesn't mean they cease to exist.
---
they might as well. Bethesda crafted the game in a very specific way so interaction isn't forced at all, bar assholes blasting your camp. it reminds me a lot of Dark Souls, except I'd say DaS is even more of a multiplayer experience due to forced invasions.
---
still, nobody in their right mind would say Dark Souls should have a "healthy economy". economies rely on real money in the first place, except everyone here bashes on rmt. do you think EVE has a healthy economy because it's oh, *so* fun to play with make-believe currency?
---
Thanks for the replies. 
---
I had my camp placed near the bridge at the first overseer's camp, i know its a popular spot, but if taken i join another server and it usually works. 
---
This time there was nothing at my spot and nowhere near it, so i guess its some kind of buged. 
---
The auto-stored blueprint when you reset your CAMP for free could not be placed probably because of some item looking over the edge of the roof, already lost like 3 hours building time due to that (when i build another high-rise that could not be setup from blueprint because of missing support).
---
But this time I was so sure I did not had things look over the edges, even my turrents where placed dead center on the platforms. I also had 3 water purificators (for some free caps income) and some crops.
---
I might just build an open shed or something with basic necessities and no art on the walls (that way not needing complicated power line routing to make it look better) until the next patch this month, i hope they do fix the camp problems of prohibit building of 1-base-buildings-with-stairs right from the start..
---
You are now God
---
I run TA 100% of the time and still double-load as much as possible. Also have my camp pretty centrally located so it's usually &lt; 10 caps to at least one of each vendor faction.
---
Caps are caps. Even if they are easy to get, they are even easier to spend. And I'd rather not have use more game-time than I need to farming them. I play solo so there's honestly not a lot of other Charisma perks that I would need to switch out. 
---
Woke eyes red headlamp
---
just 5 photos right at the vault door?
---
No it doesn't, so why complain about it? Live your life, whether it's in a video game or the real world
---
Yes, but my 3 star version gets buggy in parties.  Sometimes I have keep setting it to share for it to work and remove roads from my part and me.  When it does work it's amazing in a nuke zone.
---
thank you
---
On PC, the server disconnects about once per hour on bad days. Every few hours on good days. Sometimes the game itself crashes. For weeks on end, the only way to actually close the game was to open the task manager and crash it yourself. I can't even count how many quests and events have been bugged in which I had to log out and log back in to fix it or to be able to just start it over again from scratch. With all the disconnects, crashing, restarting, and fast travelling, the game can feel like it's loading half the time. I have no idea how people have the patience to server hop to find the items they want on vendors.
---
Like most Fallouts you both love the game for its play and hate it for all the bugs and glitches. I honestly expected it before Beta was even announced. Hell Fallout 4 still has some of the same bugs from Day 1 to Now. They were even nice enough to bring them to F76
---
It all depends on method of use and amount used honestly.  I personally keep a book of herbal medicine and have found some...interesting things.  Like the Berries of Nightshade (belladona) are poisonus, however, the leaves of it, when prepared properly can be used to make a tonic/tea that can help your heart health, when the poison works by stopping your heart.  Or the fact that Rhubarb stalks are edible but the leaves are highly toxic.
---
tl:dr; nature is weird and different plant parts can have different effects/toxicity
---
That's very encouraging! I hope that remains the case, since the mod community does such a fantastic job making Fallout, Skrim, etc, more enjoyable to play. 
---
Traveling responders vendor bot spawns across from the Charleston Train Station, but there are a few other random encounters that can also happen instead of him.
---
Looks amazing! Nice job!
---
Oh so your fully reliant with needing others to be able to do what you say.
---
So you don't have a self provided method for doing WSP nukes without the aid of teammate perks.

Using a mod that prevents losing, selling or scrapping  favourite gear.

Seriously though, I'd be less mad if they just acknowledged it was an issue they're working on fixing relatively soon. 
---
I cant justify holding onto a 3\* legendary laser rifle unless it is going to be useful to me in the near future. The carry/stash weight limitations simply don't warrant it. 
---
As best as I know, the first synth ever encountered was in 2229 in Diamond City. Vault 76's reclamation day was in Octoboer of 2102.... so yeah maybe if you bribed the queen to relax for 127 years that could happen
---
Maybe the hate train would slow down if they stopped fucking up for just a single week.
---
Ever since the release, they just can't stop fucking up. New patches bring new bugs, false advertisment, problem with pre-order bonuses, shitty pre-order products, "holiday deals", stupid automated comments to the community.
---
Bethesda is the one fueling this train.

I agree having another party member sharing Ghoulish along with Rad sponge is great.  Nothing like an in combat heal over time.
---
That's how I felt with Metal Gear Solid Survive; ace game on an ace engine but the critics hated it since before launch because it wasn't "a metal gear title"
---
I found a bug where you start the defense keep some enemies up an walkout side the zone an allow it to set to retake an quickly walk back an finish the retake. It bugs out an gives exp an loot for both the defense an retake after. I've got so much from this because each defense essentially becomes 2 rewards instead of 1.
---
The simulation is breaking down. Awakening DLC confirmed!!
---
Do players get become Wanted after attacking a person's pet at least?
---
I had a TSE handmade at one point as well. However, this was before the explosive legendary bug got fixed (and I thought it never would be).
---
So I dropped it.

i was in there and they are specific Presidential Tokens and only 1 is required for each thing. I like OP's suggestion here. I've not done one single Enclave Event since I finished that quest and moved on to the next... I don't get any notifications when killing the queen or other Legendary bosses like I did before I became General so it just seemingly ends and no more commendations are needed. I like the idea of having to earn commendations to spend on things.
---
Where‚Äôs the second vendor? If you‚Äôre on the PS4. I can wait next time I get the plans for chest and invite you over.
---
... just realized how the hell is wood armor and rolling pin in the legendary roll but hunting rifles aren't?
---
I sympathize with 100% of what you are saying.
---
Sure, there are things *we* can do to help ourselves *(don't pay attention to Fallout-playing Youtubers, filter out Fallout related content in our newsfeeds, etc.)* but the selfish point I have is why *should* we?
---
Also, from what I've noticed, not everyone experiences even 10% of the glitches reported 3,000,000 times each by everyone with a bullhorn. It actually took me until this month to really experience *any* of them *(other than T-posing and server crashing due to exploiting douchehawks [&lt; that word was in my phone's dictionary though I've never used it but I dig it])*
---
Yeah, that means I experience glitches now -plenty of them too- but Bethesda *is* working hard to fix what bad they admitted and apologized for. Yeah, being critical can aid in a more efficient recovery, but I guarantee most of the hate thrown at Bethesda is *not* there to aid there efforts in any fashion.
---
For reference, I'm a PAE owner that had the lovely experience with the bag situation. Due to reported delays, I ended up paying $275 just to get to play the game at launch with my friends. I have my complaints, but I also love the franchise too much to want Bethesda's morale to dig it's grave, fill it with acid, and hop into it.
---
Winner winner chicken dinner
---
Why are you taking hate on a video game personally? It‚Äôs just a game. Other people don‚Äôt like it and some people think it‚Äôs fun to hate on it. Who the fuck cares. No one is forcing you to watch these videos and no one in game is harassing you about playing so why does any of this matter?
---
Uhm, not really. Make them look like idiots imo. Maybe they themself belive it gives them authority and power. And if they do belive that they just dont look like idiots anymore, they are.
---
You have to wear different outfits, click on the challenge and it will tell you what you need to do, that's why you probably missing it. You have to collect and wear different outfits. I keep all the outfits, so next time I just take the photos
---
no prob, the best one imo is the perk loadout. its so nice to be able to swap to crafting, full looting weight reduction,and sniper loadouts with a few button presses. This is how the game should have been released.
---
Dude f*** them. You are the same kind of player I am, and it's nice to see other people talking about this in a rational way. If they didn't want us to exercise our Free Will with in the game they wouldn't have given it to us in the first place.
---
Click the challange to see the list of things that can count. Most require an outfit and group.
---
Because you‚Äôre such a good example of a Good Samaritan. I‚Äôm not sure you are aware of what game you are playing. Has every character you‚Äôve met in Fallout been a pacifist? 
---
It'd be nice just to be able to upgrade our turrets' levels.
---
Fo76 gets a lot of hate not because its the worst game, but because of all the small shit that keeps popping up.
---
It seems that every week there is something new. Data leak, Canvas bag, Nuka Cola, the actual Nukes. Its always in peoples heads. A bad game is forgettable. Fo76 isnt forgettable because of the games that came before and the constant stream of fuck ups.
---
Its not the worst game of 2018, but constant reminders of why its not a good game inflates the negative feelings towards it.
---
out of curiosity which ones are you missing?
---
I can't fast travel because I'm overencumbered ALL the time :)
---
I mean if the world went to shit I might just pillage someone's shack for supplies. It would be the hill I probably go out on but. Ey. What can you do. My team plays mercenaries and queen killers, we take any bounty even if it's just 10caps on someone level 6. Its a wild wasteland. 
---
I do to. But it can be overly...simple, isn‚Äôt quite the right word. Try PBS Space Time. I live that channel.
---
If it's anything like the Brahmin Pen respawn, about 25 low-value items worth (things like small plants, basic chairs, etc.)
---
&gt;why do you even take the time to play and record that whole spiel for literally no gain to anybody.
---
They gain ad revenue. Everyone else just loses 12 minutes of their lives watching click bait bullshit.
---
Mmmm a sweet roll...I‚Äôd kill for a sweet roll. 
---
I forget about it all the tiem but every now and then I'll get a mob that I just gets get to stop hiding or forwhatever reason just can't hit and then I'm like ohh wait my crit meter has been full for hours LOL! Crit hax FTW! 2-3 crit shots later and annoying mob is downed...
---
Thank God atlas came out so that could be shot all over instead. Been playing 76 since launch and loving it. Atlas is such a shitshow LOL
---
Group just means you need to be in a group. They don't really have to be in the pic. Mine worked with a guy in the group that was offline. Lol
---
That is a good point but they also had Sony to back them. 
---
For me it was just how much was over promised.
---
to be fair, I didn't follow fallout 76 so I didn't expect as much that could be why I am more biased.
---
Yeah, was just saying that it looks like they have a similar idea in the works just wasn't finished by game's launch.
---
Just FYI, that dog is on top of the bluffs across the river, opposite Harpers Ferry.
---
Yes lol, on their social media and website.
---
What system
---
Shoot I'll trade ya there's always alot in the severs I'm in. Would prefer less myself.
---
They are only gonna release garbage for a while so everyone uses up their easy earned early ones on crap an has to pay up to get the good stuff. I definitely agree with need some apocalyptic stuff in the freaking wasteland..
---
Xbox 
---
Nice! I'd like one that would be an exclusion list for junk you don't want. Put it on the list and you'll never pick it up. 
---
You gotta be kidding me right....? Who likes a game that can crash up to 3 times in an hour?
---
I'm not even gonna talk about the wonky quests, the crappy events, the guns that don't work, the lackluster co-op, and the textures (oh lord the textures), but for the love of god who enjoys a game that can crash multiple times per sessions? Who enjoys this shit?
---
I'd love to see more of this stuff. I might even buy atoms if they put in some properly apocalyptic gear.
---
It‚Äôs exhausting to be so emotionally invested in a game. 
---
That‚Äôs not accurate, I‚Äôve found him near the top of the world.
---
Oh there‚Äôs a real economy for this and I actually wouldn‚Äôt mind - if someone puts in the farming time, yeah sell your wares but 10 quid is extort-oh. And you just know it‚Äôs duped 
---
fatJuice head also promoted the infinite carry weight EXPLOIT and dares to be surprised if the game is experiencing issues!
---
think about it, you use a exploit for the carry weights which means loading in lots of items which puts a strain on the servers which increases the likelihood of bugs and crashes!
---
Great post! Thanks for the tips.
---
"Country Roads" is a great song, and "Oh Shenandoah" is also fine in this game. "Wouldn't it be nice" for me is the worst song on the radio and fits the absolute least. At least with the other two songs they tried to make it sound like the other songs on the radio. "Wouldn't it be nice" sounds like some surfer plugged in an I-Pod to my power suit, elbowing me and winking saying "remember that commercial for this game?".
---
Oooh, molotovs. Good idea.
---
My fusion cores reset to 100% every time i rejoin server. Sometimes i can use broken weapons also 1 item bug in my camp
---
I wish people would just shoot ceilings when fighting enemies so other people could get the kill. That's what I do and it's honestly not that hard. 
---
Thanks for the tip! Just got two demolitionist cards and the damage has gone up to 541!
---
It being a meme doesnt mean it didnt cause frustrations or accumulate frustration over time. Generally this was balanced out by the story or world that people enjoyed, one in which a lot of people now personally feel is lacking from 76. That plus an increase in prior bugs, compounded by always online and multiplayer.. it's kind of just a powder keg waiting to blow. 
---
I love this game. It's my favorite game. Everyone has to hate on something yea know. 
---
We dont care dont watch youtube and stop bitching here. No one wants to read this shit
---
I never said that.
---
A "stim" bolt would actually be pretty cool. Allow for a healing role.
---
T60 jetpack and T60 calibrated shocks.  I got the rest. Hell I even have an extra t 51b jetpack on me now.  The only other thing I will need to farm out is combat helms to destroy to learn how to make them I may just buy 5-10 off someone to do it. I have the metal helm done already.    
---
Whitesprings is the urns pics and the expensive tables but I can buy those at any time I please. 
---
Fallout76%off
---
I think the budget increases after using the perk points. Either that or it just randomly jumps up. I had been at max budget for awhile and I checked back yesterday and I all of the sudden had some extra. Can't guarantee where it came from though.
---
I have been dumping my extra plans at the overseers camp in the overseers stash box. 
---
I wish Youtubers would be more apt to take a rational approach and just say that.
---
Maybe some have, but too many haven't. I can't remember who but someone said this recently. Bethesda already had the shell for FO76 done or better said, they did one of their internal game jams where they test out new things and show off internally and one of these resulted in a multiplayer version of FO4. The core was decent enough that they likely decided to pick it up and run with it. It was given to the Austin dev team and a few people from other locations were assigned to assist. 
---
It's clear that FO76 didn't really have dozens of studios ALL contributing to it full time. This is Marketing speak. In reality they likely tapped 1-3 or so people from each of these side studios and said, "meet with these guys and help them get this worked out". 
---
Bethesda then put their marketing and accounting people together and looked at the financial return of launching this as an expansion to FO4 or as a standalone. Obviously standalone would make MUCH more money so they opted to carve it out. To meet the timeline assets had to be reused with a few things getting an update to fit the new location. Because it's easier to sell a new location than to sell FO4: Multiplayer But Still in the Same Boston Location! That just won't fly with the public. 
---
So there we have FO76. The core is FO4 + multiplayer and a few tweaks. 
---
ooohhhh, yeah i missed that. thanks.
---
Yes! So there are two paths. The path to the left it always freezes I went right and followed the planned (proper way) route. I guess if you deviate and go the way that is supposed to be the exit path you freeze. Probably that way to prevent farming the final area or just simply a pathing bug idk.
---
How do people manage to trade between alts, sign on to two accounts at once?  
---
Saw Grahm the other day in watoga, he had a right load of old rubbish. I'm still looking for the barn plans, no one has them.
---
No new info for weeks now with the holidays, all they said was last week was an update "soon".
---
Hopefully we hear something tomorrow/this week.  The game seems like its losing a lot of players recently due to just nothing new and nothing being fixed or even talked about since Dec 18th.
---
Then rad sponge and ghoulish so you never need radaways
---
In the developed world, where i live, it is possible to buy Liqour on Sundays. From 6.00am to 11.00pm actually.
---
Switzerland that is.
---
My statement stands, if you wanna provide a Service you cant just close for "Holidays".
---
If there are Days where it is not allowed to work because of Laws thats another thing. But even then, there are always exceptions.
---
But Nukes went Down after Christmas, hell, even after New Year.
---
"Sometimes, it just doesnt work"
---
That'd be close enough to a direct statement to me.
---
It'd go a long way for me to see Bethesda eat crow about the state of weapon balance in this game. It is clearly not right. Just admit it.
---
Yeah. I might actually listen to holotapes more closely if the game had a way to sort them chronologically of a way to keep track of what is played or not.
---
...and/or not bugging out after you have invested time and energy into setting up the conditions for the activity. 
---
Oh trust me I don't do it
---
On the other hand it wasnt the main office who made 76. It was a newly acquired branch not used to working with the syatem yet.
---

there's your one video OP
---
I can craft a set of marine for you if you want..  
---
or I can craft you a set of the better Combat Armor.
---
Either way, if you supply mats I will make either set for you.
---
no, either two shot OR quad ammo not both.
---
Tarberrys can be found in the river by the overseers camp, what else you looking for?
---
I'm inclined to agree, I personally enjoyed the game even if it was of lower quality than past entries. I traded mine in however in protest of how quickly the price went down after release.
---
Game UK had a guaranteed return price of 35 quid. The game hit 25 in UK within 10 days. Made sense. 
---
I hear you, I wish you could break out of the animation, or if they would speed it up a bit.
---
Every time someone moved their CAMP with turrets the damn game would crash though!
---
That's it thanks!
---
Nope.
---
Incorrect it wont.
---
I've been in a few that run smoothly and some that run like crap. It all depends on what's going on in the server.
---
Maybe your inventory is increased, now that you have all that extra room :)
---
Happy to be of help, hope you have a good time on FO76. &lt;3 
---
It's not ones and zeroes, it's the cumulative time you spent acquiring then organising them.  
---
feelsbadvaultdweller
---
Thank you for the offer though. It‚Äôs much appreciated 
---
Blocker performs better as pure melee. You'll have better overall results with your build running Barbarian just due to distance with gun use.
---
Ban them from you game and your account
---
Send a Col. Gutsy and his minions after the law breakers!
---
It is still a good/fun game to play in my opinion, BUT the performance/stability issues, duping and exploits need to be fixed ASAP - yes they happen, but for a AAA game to have so many issues upon release is crazy. It also stops them from developing more features or story onto the game because they have to fix it first. They will continue to get negative PR from this until they fix it.
---
This seems to happen when I fast travel to a place very close by, like going from the enclave bunker back to the clubhouse. 
---
I've dropped to zero health a few times. Nothing apparently wrong with me, but my health gets slowly drained away. PITA
---
Like-minded individuals, indeed. Those who understand that, despite the delusions of some, Fallout 76 is *online*. Seriously, I don't why you try to even deny pure facts. I guess you are trying to make yourself feel better.
---
Try to tell Overwatch, Siege, GTA Online, RDRO, WoW, etc., that the online playerbase is "wrong". üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I play MMOs, FPS, RPGs, Survival horror (Dead Space games are my favorite). I don't know what an "MMO fiend" is. Sounds like a term some edgy teenager made up.
---
I don't know what to tell you about the sniping, man. So I will resort to a very common Internet saying that I'm sure you'll understand perfectly: "git gud". This is about making all builds with pros and cons, not just with pros. If you fail to understand that, you must be pretty ignorant about how online games work.
---
About the economy part... wow, you really don't know what you're talking about, do you? Economy works with *any* type of currency available to the parts involved. That's why people are jumping on the Bitcoin - technically, it is "made up currency" (as you call it)... but oh boy, do **professional economists** keep an eye on it. I wonder why. 
---
Same happens with the currency inside a videogame. Did you know that several Economy students at Uni study the economy flow of World of Warcraft in order to understand how economy works as a whole? 
---
Seriously, just stop. You are embarrassing yourself at this point.
---
After all of the Fallout 76 crap I will forever be skeptical of anything Bethesda. I use to be I'd buy anything without question just to see what new experience they'll bring me. Gone forever like my Virginity I won't pre-order anything from them again
---
Right but they also said weekly updates and to keep us posted but nothing has happened for weeks. I'm looking for new info.
---
Was this on xbone last night? I as bouncing servers and saw three nuke zones. I stuck round for that! Leveled up about 12 times in there pretty quickly lol Got some real nice pics for the photo album too
---
If I re edit then I‚Äôd feel as if my standpoint is unnatural, I‚Äôll admit I did overlook some aspects when comparing the two, griefing and raiding. Those who see this will know. 
---
In hindsight there are a couple differences, mainly within the realm of what the game allows, and players overexerting themselves going out of their way to give somebody a bad time. I wouldn‚Äôt call it consensual raiding but when a player engages back that‚Äôs an open invitation for me. If they ignore me then obviously they don‚Äôt wanna fuck around like that. Most of the time I like to get to know a player, he‚Äôll I‚Äôll even share plans and recipes as I always seem to have double or triple of em. And then I make my choice. I don‚Äôt just blindly go in guns blazing. Don‚Äôt even use guns. 
---
Overall the entire concept is misunderstood and bastardized by exploiters and true griefers. It is common talk that separate pvp and pve servers are one of the best remedy‚Äôs for all sides.  
---
I‚Äôd like to see the (fallout) world burn, but with a splash of finesse and charm. 
---
A lot of these grand plans were trashed by the system.
---
Player Vendor trading may bring this back, but only if we get larger stashes.  Otherwise we have to specialise, maybe.
---
I wish you were joking but the game actually deserves the hate. If you think the state of the game is acceptable your part of the fucking problem.
---
I've noticed a trend over the past few years where games are released as a shell or base for what is to come and the players and community kinda dictates how the games become developed based off what the ppl want. Maybe I'm dumb but with modern gaming and the ability to add/remove content and the amount of time to develope these things plays a role in the state a game is launched in.  I'm enjoying fo76 alot tbh, more so than 4 which was pretty fun for me and well. I hope BGS hears us and we get some of this ironed out. I think its impossible to release a title in our current time that is perfect at launch and needs no updates. Not that BGS did no wrong but I think we will see some other bad launches and prob complete failures soon any way
---
Dude have you not heard any holotapes or met Rose? Some of the holotapes are very well voiced and make them super dark and emotional, especially the Survival Story tapes. Rose was a robot but had a human voice and is probably one of my favorite and the most entertaining voices to listen to in all of Fallout 
---
I've played every Bethesda game since Morrowind and have never seen this bug happen.
---
If it did exist in previous games it must have been much less common than in 76
---
I just wonder if PC copies sold more than console versions. Because, previous single player Fallout games sold on consoles more than PC. 
---
That happened to me when moving my level 15 guy to Watoga for handmade rifle plans. Was all fine until a lvl 60ish came in, respawned all the scorched around me at their level. Must've been hilarious for the other player to see a lvl 15 old man running towards them and the door, with a load of scorched on their heels. 
---
But, they did help me out and that was pretty fun tagging along and reclearing it, using whatever weapons I found until they broke. 
---
Maybe I'm just an old fart but I never really got into watching some Joe Schmoe nobody acting like they were a game guru.  
---
Of course, I still don't understand how some of the most toxic, immature shitheads can be some of the biggest streamer personalities...and I'm a marketing guy. I've got a 25 year career in this business and am co-owner/founder of a marketing firm...and that still escapes me.
---
That's Xcom, baby.
---
Yea, last week they posted, and its every tuesday so tmm should be the next. They also said they wouldnt be posting the two weeks of holidays
---
I do have a gsync monitor too. Thanks! 
---
I have a quad handmade and a two shot handmade... but I haven‚Äôt seen the two combined before. Would be nice!
---
Good to know, thanks for clarification ;)
---
There's the syringer
---
It would take HEAVY balance changes.  Damage between players would have to be reduced by almost 60-80% in order to achieve a satisfying time-to-kill.  But then you've got stimpak spam, armor piercing spam, assassin+sentinel stacking, armor piercing, ect.  They copypasted most of the mechanics from fallout 4, a game wholly designed around a single-player PvE experience.  It does not lend itself well to PvP at all.  
---
The key takeaway is that player-vs-NPC effects would have to work vastly different from player-vs-player.  And I don't see that gettign fixed any time soon.
---
=( rip
---
That's awesome! I hope to do this this weekend. Thanks for the post!
---
I saved this post to use for later thank you
---
So much besides routine quests:
---
- Nuke new places
---
- Try to find those rare legendaries
---
- Re-spec to a new weapon class
---
- Participate in the trading market
---
- Complete plans for anything or everything
---
- Help new players
---
- Unique base builds
---
How many levels did you gain, and what loot.  People wanna know!
---
Sorry, that was meant as a rhetorical question, not specifically addressed to you.
---
I completely agree with this. 
---
And to go one step more (with possible later updates) ... each faction should have their own special currency. 
---
No problem man, GT: NCCxPwnSausage Message me when you want it
---
Also, I don't know how many people are aware of this, but the No Man's Sky creators did a lot to go back and fix the game after release. The state the game is in Now, is what it should have been when it launched. 
---
Fallout 76 on the other hand, most likely will only be fixable to a certain extent, because its using an outdated engine that simply isn't capable of addressing many of the complaints. The fact that a AAA studio wouldn't use an engine that is capable of performing the way it should, is a serious indicator of either gross incompetence or corporate greed. I'm willing to bet on the latter.
---
It's more his  favorite YouTuber(s) have devolved into click-baity "FO76 sux lolz" videos trying to grab more views. I'm still on YouTube a lot, but I've had to unsuscribe from all my gaming channels but one because every other video fell back on FO76 when they had nothing to talk about but needed those sweet sweet views. It was practically spam.

very true, like how taro leaves are highly toxic if not prepared correctly and how potatoes are edible if cooked, but not sprouts.
---
I have the same bugs! I have a water purifier in my stored that I can‚Äôt scrap or place. I‚Äôve also loose fusion cores when logging in and sometimes I have extras on top of the recharge.
---
Not to mention the perk cards granting more damage to other player structures, and weapons amplifying damage against other players. 
---
I guess some people really do wanna play a Fallout Sims Edition video game lol
---
My pleasure; best of luck on your endeavors in game. üçª
---
Thank you thick one 
---
Play the way you want to play. Go where you want. Sadly, there aren't a lot of in-game reasons to stay on the far west side of the map, but you won't ever be forced to leave it, either.
---
Don't worry about the leveling function. Just have fun.
---
If you like it you like it...ignore ths haters...had publicity is still publicity...i personally love the game and being able to play it with my friends
---
While we're at it, don't defend if another player claims the workshop you already claim, it will only cost you caps for killing the person taking the workshop from you. PvP in this game costs too many caps. Bethesda, when we kill players stealing our stuff, don't penalize the defender, thanks.
---
More beginner tips:
---
* start a camp next to water as one of your earlier priorities.  purified water is good for selling, drinking, and making adhesive.  as an added bonus, you won't have to run very far to get dirty water for boiling
---
* tato + mutfruit + corn + purified = adhesive.  all of these things can be found in the north west corner of Morgantown airport
---
* junk extractors are *awesome*.  build your camp next to one if possible.
---
* stockpiling ammo is a great way to fill up your stash and your inventory.  drop the shit you ain't using, particularly fusion cores, missles, 40mm grenades, mini nukes.  Actually, you can always just drop missles and 40mm grenades, they blow anyway.
---
I've had a few fun interactions in PVP but I do think the system is pretty broken and poorly thought out.  The mechanics are awful and with all the god tier explosive weapons, take zero skill once you get one of those things.  Kind of makes it not worth engaging in most of the time, which is a real loss IMO.
---
I guess but like whitesprings. The ghouls spawn in at new player arrival. I can show up right after someone and have tons of decomposing stuff around and havr all new ghouls respawned (this sucks if im already clearing it and someone new walks up causing a respawn). 
---
So in the tunnel I know no one had been there for an hour cause there was 10 people in my game and they were screwing around with a nuked zone. Ps4 doesnt have alot of people per session. So I dont think that was the issue.
---
Nope. Had it equpped as my primary, waved at somebody in a train station, crashed, relogged, pitchfork gone. Troubling times.
---
If anyone has the jet pack for the x-01 I will pay 3000 caps for the mod but has to be on PS4 
---
Why would you want a rifle that has less damage and requires more ammo for you to craft? What would be the advantage of a quad two shot?
---
This is not true at all. For a while when the stash was small, I would walk around like a pack mule with 1200+ pounds on me and my game would crash upon opening my inventory, stash, or using a crafting bench.
---
After I liquidated all of my crap down to about 250 pounds, the game ran smoother than ever before
---
 No idea. I just know one day I was maxed, and the next i wasn't. 
---
Was also thinking of a "Copper Pot Tank" mod for the flamer that would let you give the flamer much higher initial damage, but lower burn damage, as well as letting you use bottle of moonshine as fuel.  Or maybe just a whole new flamer weapon jury rigged out of an old still and uses a jug of moonshine in the same fashion as a fusion/plasma core.
---
So true. Once they got its working great then came D2 and started the whole process over again
---
Really I don't get it. I used to play Ark quite a bit and the idea of playing on an all PVE server seemed boring as hell to me. What is the point of playing with other people if all of their interactions are completely predictable just as if they were in NPC? 
---
Been doing it on PlayStation too
---
You realize if Bethesda didn‚Äôt have a scandal almost every week from launch the hate wouldn‚Äôt continue. Not only that the updates are barely fixing the foundational problem which is the creation engine itself. Fallout 76 will forever be broken to some extent because of this. It‚Äôs their laziness that‚Äôs killing them by simply not wanting to build a new engine or not even using unity/Unreal for the time being until they do. 
---
Well ain‚Äôt that somethin. I‚Äôm looking forward to finding out what the pvp mode has to offer. Maybe implement something for players to do while they‚Äôre bored so that our energy to raid is placed somewhere else that‚Äôs beneficial to all
---
Ugh shame you aren't on Xbox I have the bolstering and a unyielding sturdy leather I am willing to let into the world but I would never give up the combat. 
---
Actually i dont understand where the problem is. I¬¥m a hardcore fallout fanboy and played every part of the fallout franchise from the beginning. Skyrim ? Hey, great game, i loved it.
---
But the truth is, and hopefully also the braindead people will come to the conclusion, that this game is shit. 
---
Thats it, no other explanation needed, because even talking about this is so ridiculous stupid, that i dont want to spend any time on this game. Let it die.
---
No, the game really is that bad
---
ah ok if you're on ps4 i can craft the combat armour helm so if you want i can craft em for you
---
What?! Why did you post here lol this is an old post...
---
Sinfonian94 on psn.  Level 124 I think and lots of psn friends who are very helpful
---
I‚Äôm on a junk node east of the overlook between Watoga and R&amp;G stations. I recommend it. 
---
Try actually rotating/moving your actual CAMP piece to find a spawn point that works if that‚Äôs the biggest worry though. 
---
I got lucky early game both with a quad pump action and then a quad double barrel. Not as cool as the handmade but certainly seen it's fair share of carnage. 
---
Springs and gears are like this too
---
Welcome to the Destiny community...
---
We have experienced the same exact thing.
---
I stuff the Cash Register at the Vendor Bots and any suitcases in the Station.
---
OP mentioned repeatedly how "people act like the devs have done nothing to improve the game since release" and they pretty much have done nothing, that part is pretty delusional. If this were ESO or WoW they would be discussing balancing weapons and builds, and stabalizing server economy by now, but instead we are continuing to have game crashes and seeing duped weapons in the vendor inventory for the upteenth time that should have been ironed out in the beta at *best*.
---
Or even a 20% dmg increase to friends, have it play like Ana from Overwatch.
---
Appreciate the tips! I normally hold onto ammo, as I do give out any I'm not using upon request, but can say without a doubt that most explosive ordinance really isn't worth carrying without a properly tiered weapon. Cheers, and good luck in game! üçª
---
This happens quite a bit to me, unfortunately they're all 1* stuff which isn't very useful late game
---
Oops! Well I‚Äôm sorry my advice made you lose a set :(
---
It is nice having an extra set of excavator armor thoughüëç
---
I just didn‚Äôt like how pathetic the Brotherhoof of Steel was in 76. Like come on...
---
Well, I see a lot of people on servers all the time. Usually I can't join my friends and they can't join me, cause world is full
---
It would make a great perception perk tbh. 
---
The only legendary to be seen in watoga is a low spawn rate patrol bot; which rarely drops a legendary in my experience. 
---
If you are both there, a green trashcan or locker works well.  I ise deaddropsto transfer between alts when I have friends online.
---
Succulent, corner pocket!
---
I got wanted because I broke a punji board...the area I was exploring didn't have anything else in it that was a camp item. Just a random punji board in a shed.
---
Iirc magnetic personality only affects teammates so you would have to share magnetic leaving rad sponge off the table.
---
Hmmmmmz that could be it you know
---
I was in the same boat. What system are you on? 
---
You can get BOS combat armor plans from the 2 vendors in Grafton, as well as mods for them. It will take some server hopping, but it works! Also, they don;t seem to have a level cap, because i JUST got my arms set last night at level 95. I know it;s not an answer to your original Cranberry bog issue, but I figured it'll help!
---
I second this
---
Maybe some folks just feel lonely and like having ‚Äúreal‚Äù players around to hold hands and sing kumbaya /: I wouldn‚Äôt know...I would understand a hub or a trading post or even a city where everything‚Äôs dandy, but for the entirety of the game? No...we need separate pvp servers or some alternative to remedy this divide. 
---
God yes. A few of us where I work play it and this one guy was so shitty about it to the two of us who enjoy it, so now we just ignore him and enjoy it anyway. No one cares about your gaming elitism brandon let us have fun.
---
In a bit I'll make a video walkthrough and YouTube it. 
---
Its the min max that its not good for if it doesn't buff damage its not useful
---
I have a level 50 All Rise and will sell it for 300 caps. Will be on later after 7pm CST. GT is Mercedes Jennz.
---
I preordered the 80 dollar edition about a month before the games release, I was really looking forward to playing the game. I was never able to get on in time for the beta times, fast forward to release and I go to play and it says I never bought  the thing, they took my money, let me download the game, all I wanted was to shoot things while blasting country roads...10 outa 10 real sad.
---
I‚Äôm the best at Fortnite
---
Cause then you dont feel lile a cheating fuck.
---
Source: traded for TSE Handmade
---
There was totally a graphical improvement, and it‚Äôs noticeable.
---
Mutation shop? Details please!
---
because then nobody on your team can run the low health mega damage build and everyone is constricted to power armor/hazmat instead of better gear
---
I read it just fine, thanks.
---
If OP has already gotten an All Rise I have a level 50 All Rise and will sell it for 300 caps. Will be on later after 7pm CST. GT is Mercedes Jennz.
---
I'm 99% sure I got the Fury recipe from Uranium Fever. I'm also 90% sure have a spare, so if you are on Xbox I can hook you up.  I probably won't be on until 8pm pacific, but send a message to Kasv0tVaxt if you want.
---
You can't do anything but wait for them to patch this garbage resist system to be like FO4 were it actually could match Hazmat or PA if you took the time to farm the items and use the chems.
---
It isn't about fallout 76 it's about bethesda. It used to be a company bringing fun, maybe a bit broken. But still fun games. And even though it was broken it wasn't along the lines of unplayable. This is basically a shout that we're sick of being deceived by companies like EA and Bethesda. 
---
I see...
---
If you get the no inventory screen or loading icon, look away so the inventory screen goes away, than look again, than look away and back again. Usually on the third or fourth look back the inventory will populate and you'll be able to loot.
---
I notice this all the time on my extractor at my camp, I would check it first and it would be empty so I would check my purifiers and go back and the extractor would now be full. I noticed if you looked away and back a couple times it would populate, this works on the SBQ too.
---
Hope it helps.
---
Make an alt character you don‚Äôt care about.  Place the camp in the same place.  Transfer the scrappable stuff through a dead drop or a friend.  Never craft with that alt.
---
I like using the stinging mag instead of the drum but want to maximise shots between reloads. I‚Äôve never cared for exploding weapons and don‚Äôt want to level demolitions to get the most out of the TSE
---
Bravo! Good sir. 
---
You don't even have to be in a group, just invite a random and it will work... The invite doesn't have to be accepted, pending invites apparently count as being in a group. 
---
Its crashed once in one week for me and I have a shitty pc.
---
I‚Äôm level 60 and have done nothing to the follow overseer quest. And have not explored the entire north of the map, yet, but just do you. Just be careful of the ants if you explore to much south east

Check it out. Trust me.
---
The only reduction perks I use are Pack Rat (obvious choice there), Bandolier (Because I tend to carry thousands of rounds), and the one that reduces shotgun weight and gives reload speed.  because shotguns are fuggin' heavy.  
---
I live in power armor with calibrated shocks so i don't need to manage my inventory quite that much, but i use a few perks to keep the weight down where necessary.  I've also learned to be a bit more disciplined when it comes to what I loot and what I hang onto.
---
Honestly I‚Äôm waiting for more patches. After killing scorch queen I got bored farming ammo mats so I took a break to avoid burnout
---
Wow, you are only level 48 and think you're done? I don't think sandbox open worlds are for you, since clearly the only thing you have done is quests back to back. 
---
I have a level 160 and a lv. 90 and I feel "done" but have done a lot to warrant that feeling. Well worth $60. My friends also quit playing it seems which actually killed a lot of my fun.
---
Near the top of the world station, on the road between the lake and the station. Graham also visits from time to time

Thanks ill do that
---
Only 3? That's a good day of playing for me!
---
&gt;Fallout 76 is online.
---
online doesn't necessarily mean multiplayer. factually you're right, 76 is multiplayer by definition, but then so is every phone game that's singleplayer but has a community button coded into it.
---
all the content can be soloed, there's no forced interactions or content gated behind parties. most of the game is singleplayer-focused. this is why people often say 76 has an identity crisis and doesn't know what it wants to be. ultimately, Bethesda is gonna have to choose one. and I don't think it's gonna be you.
---
&gt;Try to tell Overwatch, Siege, GTA Online, RDRO, WoW, etc.,
---
all "proper", actual online games, yeah. completely different from Fo76.
---
&gt;I don't know what an "MMO fiend" is.
---
people who'll play anything that's remotely mmo-like and/or try to force it on games ("healthy market", etc.). kinda like what you're doing right now.
---
&gt;"git gud"
---
I could be level 5000 with all perks and maxed perception and I'd *still* not be able to hit from behind walls. that's the original argument, that explosives should be nerfed because people can't tag ghouls. well, every other build, not just melee, outpaces snipers in Whitesprings, no matter how gud the player is. so, using your justification of balance, everything should be nerfed until snipers can compete with them.
---
&gt;That's why people are jumping on the Bitcoin
---
that currency that's worth several thousands of real dollars? exactly like I said? that a market needs to be backed up by real currency?
---
&gt;Did you know that several Economy students at Uni study the economy flow of World of Warcraft in order to understand how economy works as a whole? 
---
no surprises there, its market is backed up by real currency as well.
---
just fyi, to get that i think ALL you have to do is try going in and out of the nuke radius like one time. or hop in and out of your power armor. happens to us all the time. applying radiation when entering the nuke radius is like the most broken aspect of the game somehow.
---
From what I‚Äôve gathered talking to other users on this post, the best remedy would be to have separate servers for pve and pvp. 
---
As of right now however, whatever mechanics are allowed will be used. Perk cards that grant more damage to player structures, weapons that grant additional damage to other players in pvp, are all available in the game. People just don‚Äôt like when they get their perfect post apocalyptic nuclear wasteland disrupted by a completely high out of his gourd survivor turned Raider psycho who wants to feed on their flesh and sleep on their bed.
---
While there is a bug with legendaries dropping, anywhere east of the Savage Divide can spawn random legendaries; that being said, on top of 3 confirmed Power Armor spawns, two vendors, non-violent enemies, excellent lead/steel/aluminum farming, and Enclave events, WhiteSprings Golf Club doesn't stack up in any category other than levelling.
---
The game engine and the server that provides the networking capabilities are two different things. Since this is an always online game, you can't separate the two so it just gets bundled in with the "crap engine" philosophy. The game engine has nothing to do with disconnects, that doesn't even make any sense. The server side is where most of these problems are.
---
Sure, there's lots of glitches and bugs that are due to the game engine the game can run perfectly fine and if the servers are shit, the game will still disconnect and crash. And on the flip side, the servers can be immaculate, but the game play is broken or a technical disaster.
---
If there was a toggle to go offline, I guarantee that 90% of the issues people complain about would disappear 
---
As far as I know, yes.
---
Not bad at all, you might even be happier being higher level so you get quest rewards that you can use long term later on. Don‚Äôt worry about the main story, there will be plenty of time for that later.
---
My only advice would be to be careful playing at higher level too close to low level areas/other players. You may spawn in higher level enemies that other people will have to deal with. Shouldn‚Äôt be an issue in the forest area though, enemies seem level capped. Go to locations on the map that have a picture of something, those are usually named locations with cool stuff. 
---
stuff like this confuses me...FO76 ain't just a meme it's a real thing that's happening. people are reporting and clowning the game because Bethesda decided not to take the game seriously. im pretty confident things like bugs, the bullshit atomic shop and other isses are still prevalent in a game that still doesn't work. 
---
i don't understand those who get so uptight about people's reaction to a broken &amp; bad game and not the developers and company behind the broken game, the false advertisements, the 16 times the detail...i wanted this game to be good after the all the doubts we had before release but god damn Bethesda really forked it up. 
---
I dont even bother with the workshops because we cant even keep it (i have no problem with not keeping) besides i can material's without it easily 
---
Thanks for help !! Do you happen to know the time when the scorch beasts would respawn?
---
I have both turrents are a waste of budget.
---
You got one thing wrong. It's TOAD Howard not what on his birth certificate.
---
Well the original plans of a lot of people myself included were highly inflated. They say ‚Äúonline fallout‚Äù and we think we are going to get a single player game (ie infinite storage, huge settlement building) like we have had in previous titles but that‚Äôs just not possible on an online game running off servers. 
---
However I don‚Äôt think an increase to storage would required really, unless your only buying/selling bulky things. If it‚Äôs just caps that‚Äôs fine, hell I‚Äôd trade 3 purified waters for a damn spring or screw lol. But with further development I‚Äôm incredibly excited to see what 76 turns into. 
---
That being said a huge issue that needs to be addressed first, because it‚Äôs literally crashing servers and wrecking the gameplay is dupers. When they have thousands of pounds of gear, its crashing servers because they have to process it all and they aren‚Äôt meant to handle that. 
---
However these are all just my opinions of course 
---
I don't know what you're smoking but vanilla Fallout 4 looks far better and has less graphical glitches, at least in my experience. The textures in 76 are dogshit and it barely renders anything even 100m away. Didn't Todd also say they'd improved that?
---
I'm not even saying I want different servers, just a system that works.  There are some very fundamental flaws in the current system, starting with damage scaling, god tier weapons, etc... It's just a hot mess.
---
I have no issues with living in a world where my character would have to defend himself more often but the current system is just not very enjoyable.
---
it is ridiculous my YouTube feed filled up with fallout videos barely any of them have anything positive to be said and are just hating. some of these channels are built on complaining and I guess 76 is their new home.
---
Well I am on rn and have 1473 caps. If I need more then I can get some and back.
---
This is amazing!! You are truly skilled!
---
good suggestion
---
i dont fear scorchbeast queens or legendary enemies... but i am terrified of having to defend my workshop from a level 6 ghoul that wandered off into the woods a mile outside the event area
---
No man's sky was from an unknown developer, with an unknown IP, and an unknown concept. People heard it was bad so the regular audience of the media either never bought it or stopped playing immediately. No one kept watching the "This Game Sucks" videos because no one cared, it was a solid flop on all points and everyone moved.
---
76 came from a solid developer, an established decades old IP with several chart-topping games, and the concept fans had been asking for. Everyone wants this game to be good and there's still a solid player base actively enjoying what ended up getting made.
---
 It's because people are still vocally supporting 76 that any opposition is still around feeding off of controversial content. Every time someone posts a video about how bad it is they collect a huge volume of people telling them they're wrong, and the same for every positive video. If content creators stop getting such massive engagement from these meme-y  controversies people can just stay quiet, enjoy the game, and hope it gets better.
---
I think it it's because we expected better from Bethesda
---
Following this, is there a list somewhere of what legendaries slot into which stars? 
---
I've taken to helping out anyone in need of help as to curb the burnout; it's let me experience earlier quests and activities that otherwise would have been forgotten with the pure grind to high tier endgame. 
---
That‚Äôs...completely true. And a lot of people have very emotional, visceral, angry reactions to it,

---
they patched that out a while ago I think. I don't know how it works now, but it's not per player anymore. people where abusing it by quitting and rejoining the same session.
---
54 with no perks for it.
---
Heck they spoil so fast, I want a freaking refrigerator...
---
We can make a Laser Gun from scrap but can't repair a refrigerant unit?
---
I think of my "Mules" as specializing.. The Foodstuffs mule is level 15, has "Good with Salt" and only logs in for transactions... Like only opening the fridge during a power outage to make dinner..
---
Same here
---
YOU'RE CLEARLY A PAID BETHESDA SHILL SINCE YOU ARE NOT COMPLETELY TRASHING THE GAME! LITERALLY EVERYONE WHO ISN'T TRASHING THE GAME IS PAID FOR IT!!! /s
---
For real though, the game is fun, it will survive. It's not doing as bad as the hype would lead you to believe. 
---
There are many of em but these ones are mine
---
One of better ones sir!
---
2 shot cryolator. Mmmm the slows
---
Were you on PC just now?
---
No lie there mate, this sub is filled with people in denial that this game isn‚Äôt a colossal wreck as much as it pains me too say  
---
*nod* as mentioned I have multiple accounts, have with every MMO I've ever played.
---
sometimes said scorchbeasts spawn around fissure prime (abandoned bog town workshop) instead and just harass a poor lvl 51 player instead.
---
Game has been going on sale super cheap as well (and you clearly bought three for resale)
---
Uhm, I think a lot more has been complained about then it being online only. 
---
I think it‚Äôs as memed as it is because of the prestige behind Bethesda. They‚Äôre a beloved company with amazing titles so the expectation is high. And honestly after years of getting nothing but Skyrim ports, and then this? It‚Äôs just too unacceptable.
---
That being said, LET THE MEMES CONTINUE
---
I think despite all the disagreements on this thread we could all agree that something needs to be done to improve the system so that it may benefit all conflicting parties. Whatever that may be, hell if I know. 
---
Nope, the game is still bad. Nice try at astroturfing, Bethesda. 
---
Lol, i made a 2nd character when my first hit level 6. i made my 2nd account when my 2nd character hit level 61
---
I've had a couple of dead settlers spawn in my power armor his head was stuck in my helmet and his body was dangling in the air above it
---
My heads fine, you might want to try removing yours from Bethesda‚Äôs ass.
---
There's a holotape in her office in Top of the World where a guy named David is talking to his side-piece, Rossalyn.  At one point, he gives her an order and she mocks him for treating her like a robot.  And then he calls her Rose.   
---
Rossalyn's voice on the holotape is exactly the same as Rose's voice.
---
What's really interesting is just how well Rose seems to emulate humanity.  It must have been a serious labor of love for David to put all that effort into recreating his dead girlfriend's personality.
---
I won't be on until after 7pm CST (at work right now). If that's too late for you (unsure of time zone) I can always hop on between 6 - 7:15 am CST tomorrow morning to trade before work.
---
The updates are happening crazy fast, too.
---
I always compare it to Destiny 2.  My biggest complaint with that game was the limited vault size.  But Bungie said they weren't going to make any QoL changes until after the game's first **paid** expansion, which was three months after release.  And this was a company experienced in doing this shit.
---
Meanwhile Bethesda increased the stash size three *weeks* after release.  That's fucking ridiculous how fast that is.
---
Then someone says, "Yeah, but people complained about Destiny 2 as well."
---
Yeah, but my YouTube suggestions weren't clogged with videos shitting on Destiny 2.  It's not the same at all.  Fallout 76 is a much better game, and it's getting a much worse response.
---
Fallout 76 is the least buggy Bethesda game I've ever played.  And that includes the sixth rerelease of Skyrim where there was absolutely no excuse for the bugs.
---
The haters are full of shit.
---
Dude have you played fallout 76? It's awful! Imagine if McDonald's was like fallout 76. 
---
not just now
---
The main reason this wouldn't solve the issue is because there are already damage perk cards for the energy weapons. Laser rifle damage falls under rifle cards and so on and so forth. Separating energy from ballistic only makes it to where you'd have a harder time using both energy and ballistic types of the same gun since you'd have to spec into two different Special traits to do so. 
---
The main issues are how much damage these guns do and how fast they break. Not which Special trait is needed to increase their damage. 
---
Also there is armor pen but no energy pen which is a catalyst to the imbalance between energy and ballistic. 
---
I didn't have a problem with anyone messing with my camp until this weekend. Been playing since the beta too. I got a notification that my camp was being attacked and I look at the map and see someone wanted there. So I fast travel and now there are 3 wanted guys there all teamed up and destroying every single item in my camp. 
---
I try to take them on but of course they instantly kill me despite me being high level with power armor and everything. I respawn and they leave. I then fix my camp and one of them comes back and he is not wanted anymore. He starts jumping around my camp and my turrets are shooting him and causing no damage. He doesnt show as wanted so I dont attack him. Can't figure out why my turrets are going after him.
---
I leave to go fight in a nuke zone, come back, camp destroyed again. 
---
I;d say take your time, and enjoy.
---
While that's true, once you get to the point where you just about oneshot everything whether you have those extra perks or not however it matters very little. Whether you deal 2000 damage or 2200 damage to an enemy with 1000 health isn't making a big difference in terms of your gameplay, while the inability to pick anything up does.
---
I agree it's not fitting into the mind of a min-max'er, but the benefits are hard to argue against.
---
See I‚Äôm solid on junk. I just run low on ammo. Mainly shotgun and .50 ball. Hover around 1200 .308 all the time
---
It would help if the corpses fly's would light up inside a blast zone. And it would even make a lot of sence... 
---
Guarantee bone of these work and if they do, won't actually be very good.
---
Actually i pre ordered it and i just realized their beta codes.... for the beta.. thats no longer active.
---
Most people arent level 182+ :p
---
How much budget does it take?
---
If you take over Hemlock Holes maintenance, there's a decent chance you'll have to defend it against 3 waves of Lvl. 15 anglers. Each wave usually comes with a Lvl 25 albino angler, but the workshop has some good defensive positions if you dont want to be down in the fray.
---
I might get there some day, but as of right now, if it has a use, my OCD tells me to pick it up!
---
Melee
---
THANK YOU!!! Bethesda may have released a half ass product but are making up for it, slow but they are. Just appreciate it for what it is and leave it at that!
---
I almost exclusively play alone due to all my RL friends quitting, lol. But I honestly prefer it.
---
Caps are caps .. but when you've got nothing worth spending it on. Caps are just .. caps. My camp is on the right side of the map and I pay about 34 to get to the south west - north west {I can walk the rest} same goes for the south. I can't say I feel inconvenienced by the fee in comparison to wait time.
---
My time is more valuable than caps. 2 + load screens is no beuno to get to one location for me.
---
You have to understand that youtubers are catering to an audience.  If they didn't get views they wouldn't bother making those types of videos.
---
A lot of people were put in a tough spot with 76.  It was a very divisive game and some people ultimately decided not to participate despite being huge fallout fans.  When news broke the game was in a terrible state (completely Bethesda's fault), they were relieved and ate up all the YouTube content ripping on the game.  They continue to watch those videos for a virtual pat on the back, "good job for not buying this game", because deep down they are still curious.
---
It doesn't help that Bethesda and Todd Howard are a literal meme now.  That status was 100% earned for repeatedly making broken games and even acknowledging it from time to time.  Its not funny anymore, its fucking sad.
---
In regards to the stash limit given how many people are duping guns right now it‚Äôs likely we won‚Äôt see another stash increase until that bug is shut down for good. Unlike junk guns are treated uniquely (not stackable) this means each one each one takes a chunk of server memory as opposed to junk with is just a number next to one object. 
---
That was the full game, including beta access. Beta was not seperate.
---
Negative. The closest would be outside the doors
---
You can‚Äôt say definitively that any game is ‚Äúbad‚Äù or ‚Äúgood.‚Äù An opinion, no matter whose it is, is not fact.
---
There's a difference between constructive criticism and endless memes about issues that have been fixed for weeks.
---
One can be useful, and one is *always* annoying garbage.
---
No one is saying that the game doesn't have faults.
---
The annoying thing to me about the way this has gone, is that game studios may learn that it simply isn't cost-effective to fix a game that's being dumped on like FO76.  They may go the way of Mass Effect: Andromeda, and cancel any possible DLC or expansions that may actually *fix* the game (see D3:Reaper of Souls).  Studios may end up deciding to ditch a project in favor of starting a new one instead.  This may even be the right *financial* decision, but it would be *terrible* for the people who actually want the game to work.
---
Mass Effect: Andromeda is actually a great example of how the toxic community can sabotage a game.  People memed about the terrible facial animations for *months* after they were fixed.  I honestly think the last time I heard about that game's misgivings was after people were sure that there would be no DLC for the game.  If anything, the way the community responds can *motivate* game studios to ditch a game when it receives bad reviews.
---
I have no problem with constructive feedback.  It's the endless trashing on the game, the brigade of downvotes for anyone who goes against the hivemind.  That garbage doesn't do any good.  Endlessly dumping on a studio that is legitimately trying to improve a game doesn't help anyone.
---
"exactly how they told it to be"
---
You know, except for the massive number of bugs and general instability. 
---
thanks - I will give that a try. We are often loading at the same time, so that can be it. 
---
Lol you just described a scenario where almost everyone you know and every place you look tells you that the game sucks. Have you ever stopped to think maybe that is the reality? I highly doubt this high of a percentage of people would bash a good game just to bash it. I've never said anything negative on the game because I've never played it, even though fallout is my favorite gaming franchise. The reason being, I'm sick of spending money on shit games all the time. If even half of the things being said is true than this game is totally unacceptable from a company as well known and funded as Bethesda. Instead of milking your fan base for money, spend the right amount of time to release a fully completed game that the fans will enjoy, even if it breaks away from the beloved old style of play (single player). I actually love the hate for this game because it gives me hope that the consumers will eventually get through to dev's to stop trying fuck your customers to make a profit. We live in an era where games are released half way down and we play them for 2 years while they continue to finish the game. People even defend it with "I understand these types of games take time" fuck that. Than take more time making the game. I can deal with little patches here and there to fix minor bugs. But I'm over paying full price for broken, half playable games because companies that we love (or used to love) release a shit game to milk customers for money. 
---
Well I don‚Äôt know where to post if anyone can help me I would be happy 
---
Not defending it puts you at the risk of having your structures be destroyed by whatever is attacking.
---
Nah if I see a problem and I find it annoying, I'll speak out and cling to other points of view. Unapologetically human. 
---
Similar place just north of Mountainside Bed &amp; Breakfast if y‚Äôall wanna build another one for your friend. 
---
Well, it's not just about the grand anymore. Don't forget about the false advertising and information leading, I certainly haven't. Don't forget about the absurd microtransaction system and prices, I certainly haven't. 
---
Yao Guai have springs. Wendingos drop screws. 
---
Police Molerats!
---
Finally someone said it.
---
It is odd there are certain games I feel more comfortable playing on the console. I PC game a lot also but Fallout is a couch and veg game for me.   
---
Oh and I am having fun nearing 500 hours total across 4 character. 
---
Don‚Äôt listen to the other person. They‚Äôre wrong. Pets do NOT follow you.
---
No clue if its a glitch or intended. 
---
For what its worth: when i join a server that some one else across the country is already on(ie its gonna be slow to me im sure) i see some loot appear on a mob before being changed to what i get. 
---
Its almost as if the npc has a default loot pool that is getting over written on death....this is the only other explanation i can think of. 
---
I mean, the Mistress of Mystery vo actress definitely gave a beautiful rendition of an older woman who did radio plays in her younger years. The cadence, the emotion, it was beautiful. 
---
melee can (probably) output a higher dps but it relies on you not getting found while literally hacking away at the queen.
---
shotguns can potentially output about the same damage but it's random and depends on how the server feels about your explosions. on the other hand, it's infinitely easier not getting found.
---
I agree 100%.  I'd like to see them fix "it".  But srsly, good luck to them because it's not just the mechanics they have to change but all those crazy weapons out there that are great in PVE but break PVP entirely.  Level 15's one shotting level 180's because of a quad shot legendary = lolz and a broken system. :(
---
I might be able get on around your timezone but if not tomorrow is fine with me.
---
What kind of underarmor are you trying to upgrade?
---
Wait so the beta codes also give the full game?
---
I've done it twice over the past week (new player). I didn't realize there was an issue with the quest until I was frantically trying to load the hopper, while under fire from a horde of robots, and lost all of the ammo for my primary weapon (460+ .45 bullets). I was level 11, only had two guns, was trying to finish it with a scoped .308 hunting rifle. Luckily a nice 50+ guy came along and helped me finish it.
---
I wasn't sure what had happened, so I tried it again. When loading the hopper, the ammo for my equipped weapon was in the list to transfer, as well as my fusion cores.
---
TLDR: I'm pretty sure it hasn't been fixed yet, you just have to load the hopper slowly.
---
Or you could not have such a personal attachment to a v i d e o g a m e as if it were your child and just not care about that. Game is minimum viable junk at release and nothings changed much about it. Now, beating a dead horse is a different story and I agree with that but not to the level of this emotion.
---
Some decor/clutter/junk packs would be very nice! 
---
GAAAARRRY
---
the speed demon mutation speeds up reloading i think 
---
I only melee with a TSE spatula
---
What would a good damage be mine is 310 with rads 
---
Right but its a ga r bet that anyone in this sub isn‚Äôt here trolling and producing trash memes. 
---
I‚Äôd heard plenty of people getting pissy here if you‚Äôve anything remotely negative to say
---
Yea what the hell is going on
---
I think green thumb and woodchucker are totally underrated. Two perks I never remove unless I have to do a specific build.
---
This is on your end(client), the inventory UI had a memory leak. The issue seems to be fixed in one of the latest patches. 
---
Better than just getting a server crash. 
---
it makes the queen stronger
---
Thanks mate!
---
yep - one of us had to reload to become friends with the deathclaw.
---
Sidenote - i feel so bad now,  knowing that was a a deathclaw quest spawn. I had a house there and thought I got lucky with a natural death claw  spawn, and my turrets would always eat it up when one would spawn when a player came by... now I know they were trying to quest!
---
Will you on at that morning time tomorrow in your timezone? 
---
Just like the micro transactions in GTA Online, which I still enjoy today along with many others for the record, people will eventually forget to complain about FO76 and the people who like it will just stick around to see it repaired.
---
Cry all you want this won't stop until
---
A. A new game comes out that takes the non-drama YT'ers attention (basically expect no earlier than February provided bethesda quashes the cap and item resellers, cuts atom store prices to 1/10th, and doesn't fuck up any updates between now and then)
---
B. We get private servers early. (A lot of the issues go away if you don't have to share a server with a fucking duper, but so far this isn't happening till like November)
---
C. Bethesda pulls a "realm reborn" and slavages the game into something players expect from a game that bears the title of fallout (only way this happens is if you join us on the hate train it's not loud enough yet)
---
D. The heat death of the universe (these are former Bethesda fans we are talking about they are a stubborn lot you really shouldn't have brought your whaling bullshit here)
---
Really what I want to know is why this salty post has so much reddit gold and upvotes behind it normally posts trying this hard to pick a fight don't make the front page... Say... You're not one of those fucking gold farmers are you? That would certainly explain why you're so frothy it's basically because there is money in it...
---
No worries if you can't. I was half joking.
---
BTW the Scribe power armor paint is for T-60, ya?
---
This is honestly so hard to believe imo
---
Tons of the hate is warranted, was I should say... but yeah I wish people would move on. Need a few more big releases and potentially another major fuck up. Most days I play with little to no problems but it‚Äôs far from being on the level of polish I expected, all these years of releasing buggy games dumb ass me expected Bethesda to do better this time. I still play, have an insane amount of time in this game as I love Bethesda style and fallout in particular but damn it they should be updating it weekly until it‚Äôs no longer a glitchy mess. 
---
She flew out of the map, past the fence, on her death.  She was at the delta base when she died...no loot for anyone...
---
Or we could just summon her and take her down like we've been doing? Like they always say, "if ain't broke, don't fix it".
---
not everyone has the know-how to find dupers giving away free stuff. lots of people also can't afford to play for months hoping to drop a crappy explosive weapon.
---
if the price is good I don't see a problem with it. you people wanted a healthy market, no? well, that's how a market is born. through rmt.
---
Awesome. I appreciate the tips 
---
PS4, and I was at white springs first for like 15 minutes, server hopped once and then everything was dropping legendaries, all one stars. Had it for about 10 minutes or so until stuff quit spawning. Sold stuff and went back to my camp and I got disconnected 
---
It's telling that of all my friends who play videogames the ones who've played the game either like it or think it's meh and the ones who've never tried it talk about how it's absolute dog shit.
---
Your spot on with YouTube too. So many of my favorite channels just saying "it's shit" but not explaining why beyond the initial issues with the beta and release.
---
I don't really care though, I like playing it and that's what matters, I'm willing to overlook the issues and others arnt.
---
I think this is especially true concerning certain Youtubers. They all praise the game, post info, gameplay, tips, 10 things you didn't know, and as soon as the majority shifts toward negative it turns into "why this game is worst of all the games that exist, grim future for this developer, bla bla bla".
---
Honestly they need a good punch in the face. With a chair. Remember to install adblock plus.
---
I have no trouble hitting and building crits, even at long range with pistols. With concentrated fire, even if you are really far, and the first one or two miss, by the third shot, you are hitting every shot. If you sacrifice a little AP and put a long barrel on instead of a short, you get pretty good range anyway.
---
Really? I had no idea; this is groundbreaking, cheers! üçª
---
Say it to the other 90%+ people who can tell you this game is bad. I mean when almost all tell its bad it is called normaly bad. Get it?
---
I'm here! üòÅ
---
How Todd, how?
---
If there was ever a redditor that was secretly reselling TSE's on ebay...
---
The Initiate rank is the only in-game tank variant, and it is only available for T-60 yes
---
People like you are the reason that video game companies get away with bullshiting their customers.  
---
Instigating rifles seem to be a gift from the devil as well. 
---
In my eyes, there is still a lot of room for improvement in this game. It‚Äôs still a baby, and I think of how different fallout 4 was from its inception. 
---
I see a lot going on in the future, but I‚Äôm afraid that at some point even my enthusiasm shall falter and lose the drive to push this game in the right direction alongside everybody else. 
---
As a community we banked on having the modders out there tailor the game to our liking, but now bgs is on its own. 
---
I can only hope that discussions like these shed light on the status of the community, and open doors to new ideas on the way to a remedy. 
---
Oh dude. Sorry. I had the mod box but now it‚Äôs gone. I never sold it or used it, I must‚Äôve scrapped it.
---
Heh that's crazy =)
---
................. 
---
Are you currently a diseased Plague Walker (Mutation)?
---
At a certain point, you gotta realize that the video game industry and the media is different than it used to be. They get the views and clicks by shitting on FO76 and while most of it is legitimate in some form or another, it's just the game to shit on now and will be until the next shit storm of a launch blows up. I'd expect more hate until Bethesda actually addresses some of the critical issues like dupers and lag. Also they have to actually make the game enjoyable.
---
Just because you‚Äôre an apologist doesn‚Äôt give you the right to silence everyone else.
---
Keep running on that mental treadmill buddy and jack off to how good you think fallout 76 is because the rest of the world certainly does not think that way.
---
Are you sure you have your monitor power switch on the ‚ÄúON‚Äù configuration before playing, my dude?
---
My game doesn't crash, hasn't since last update.
---
Still works for me as of last night. I waited for someone to leave the front area. went there and it had full of roating and new ones. Even after nuked area(after the red goes away but glowing ones remain) the night before. I circled twice.
---
PS4-DiamondDollJeane
---
Servers have been super laggy the last few days, lots of server disconnects and a few error screens.
---
Also fast traveling to team members is not working correctly, it keeps landing me quite far away from them no matter how many times I try.
---
Fallout 76 is a great Game! I can‚Äòt tell that to  Just Survive thats started good and endet in a PvP and low Survival Content PvE Version. Fallout 76 is really great!!!
---
There's a mod for it for FO4. It is very cool.
---
Nope I just have speed demon
---
&gt; There is hardly ever an original thought from any youtuber
---
You've been hanging out in the wrong corner of Youtube, then.
---
I find tons of awesome, original content on Youtube that isn't at all copypasta.
---
This isn't why the game engine is crap.
---
It's crap because stackable items suffer from a critical buffer overflow issue that cannot be easily fixed.
---
So they have tried now 3 iterations of work arounds to prevent it from being abused allowing players to dupe.
---
You would think it would be a simple(DO NOT STACK OVER 255) code would fix it, but they never considered it so its not hardcoded in. I speculate each line of code intrinsically relies on the items being stackable infinitely and as such we get partial fixes that dupers can easily work around. 
---
I'll add your GT and if you're on, then cool. If not, no worries. Some other time.
---
Oh yeah, might have seen that one but it was like getting constant melee hits from something invisible...? I even molotoved myself a couple of times to see if something was stealth nearby but nada.
---
Are you saying rank two actually requires level 31? Cause if not you could totally not pick a perk on 29 and have it on 30.
---
Nope, they said there would be a rocky start, but the alternative was ‚Äúplaying it safe,‚Äù and they didn‚Äôt want that. 
---
Not so much an issue but more of feedback thing (playstation), someone should look into the vendors to make sure they are functioning properly. I have been looking for the T-51b Jetpack plans at Watoga daily for 2-3 hrs each, longer on the weekend for about two weeks now to no avail. I understand rare but this is beyond excessive to me at least. I got about 200 hours into the game so I have been chipping away at plans from events and such in-between nukes but it by all accounts there is no event I can do to get the plans so at the moment all I can do is server hop to try and get them...  
---
Sounds good
---
are you sure it wasn't because enough time had passed? because the ghouls do respawn, it's just not tied to new players joining anymore.
---
at least I don't think it is.
---
Compared to a TSE shotgun?
---
Nah
---
Which they literally told people was going to happen weeks before the beta even started. 
---
It‚Äôs still their opinion. There‚Äôs 10% of people that still think it‚Äôs a good game. I‚Äôm not defending the game here or trying to say it‚Äôs one or the other, I‚Äôm just saying that a person‚Äôs opinion is not fact.
---
Energy guns used to be the Cadillacs of the Fallout universe! Turbo Plasma rifle in Fallout, Pulse Rifle in Fallout 2, Vengeance in Fallout 3. There was such a delicious variety of energy weapons in NV, but I found them really quite poor in Fallout 4. In 76 it's even worse. 
---
Plasmas especially get the shaft. They've got boutique ammo and break if you look at them wrong. At the very least they should dish out huge amounts of damage. As it is you're better off using a pipe rifle. At least it won't break the middle of a fight
---
Shoot and loot. I don't get paid if they come along peacefully, nor do I get to steal their lunchbag...
---
Ur on PC?
---
That card only has 1.5gb but min req is 3gb. How are you getting high settings out of half the mem needed to run it?
---
Here here Bethesda has hardly done anything to actually make up for what they've done it's all low effort appeasements to the lowest common denominator.
---
It has become its own self perpetuating joke
---
the real sad part, it shows how far Bethesda has fallen to the dark side 
---
Do you ever open your stash and have to close and reopen because nothing showed up the first time? That's the server saying, "nope, not ready." This was never an issue before the stash limit change. There's a lot we don't know about how the game prioritizes it's load order. Computers are incredible things. They don't make mistakes. We do. The server crashing is because something incompatible happened in their load order that causes the server to humina humina kerblat. Therefore it's possible that it could continue on even with this player having so much inventory. Only there are consequences. The server is now focusing on loading an incredible amount of his data which means it's not able to focus on yours. So he's smokin cherry pie and downing nilla wafers while you're trying to figure out if you're walking or swimming through Watoga.
---
When the servers start getting backed up with data it shows. You can literally watch the servers trying to catch up especially in silos or prime nuke zones when you go to take something and you have to pause for 6 seconds before it acknowledges your action. Or when you have to wait for your mob to drop loot for a half hour because it's determining everyone's stats and rolls and whatnot. Even in Harper's Ferry when a super mutant dies and it drops 26 frag grenades. You likely won't end up with 26 frag grenades when you pick them up. That's just how many he had, but the server had to process deleting his inventory and replacing it with a loot table and somewhere along the way it's getting mixed up.
---
They discussed the possibility of increasing it further if the servers could handle it. So whats the verdict here? More stash? Trust me, I have NO idea how I managed with 400. I'm consistently overweight with 600 stash and 300 player weight. I would love a solid, 400 for junk, 400 for weapons and armor, and 200 for aid items. But I love being able to use my stash box more :P
---
Also, ‚Äòmolotoved myself‚Äô sounds kinky now that I read it
---
perhaps they could introduce new, more rare laser weapons that do better damage.  
---
Like take rifles for example.  Atm there's what, just the laser rifle, right?    
---
But for rifles you have hunting rifle, combat rifle, lever rifle, handmade rifle, and 3 different pipe rifles (pipe rifle, lever action pipe, 6 shooter rifle or whatever that's called.  So 7 different ballistic rifles and 1 laser rifle.  
---
So add in a few new laser rifles with increased rarity akin to lever and handmade, and make those the top end laser rifles that are competitive with their ballistic counterparts.  
---
Same thing as above for laser pistols.  
---
I am.
---
I get it. I only make a run for straight jackets when I have nothing else to sell &amp; my vendors have reset. Mostly I sell chems and inert flux now.
---
Bloody mess on a hillside and you can just forget it.
---
I mean, a game can‚Äôt be that bad if the trailer used West Virginia for the song
---
Yeah, that's what did it. I couldn't even laugh at it. 
---
Absolutely not all of the hate is unwarranted. I agree with the reasons why people don't like it. But you never see the objective reasons why the game is bad - all you see is a video or article saying "this game is bad" multiple times with a bunch of fluff that never goes into what's exactly bad, what needs to change, what has already changed, and what still needs work. 
---
It's fine to have a strong opinion on something that deserves criticism, but how about actual criticism and not just making ZZZZING style jabs for everything?
---
What an awful, cringe, and biased post. 
---
I did this the other night, loaded in and sprinted to the door to get inside. Loaded inside with about a 75% red bar, lol.
---
I would love some.

Morgantown Railroad has a PA in there and across the field next to Mama Dolce's is another building that has a PA in it as well. Also rightoutside that building is a fusion generator that sometimes has a FC in it. Great places to find cores in a rush. Just don't be mean and steal the cores without taking the PA. Enter it then destroy it if you dont need it so another one spawns later for someone else. 
---
And David Thorpe was leader of the Cutthroats Raider Gang. Very interesting storyline. Especially when you learn how their paths intertwined with the other factions. 
---
Lol how so? If you don‚Äôt enjoy a game, don‚Äôt play it. If you‚Äôre not sure if you‚Äôll enjoy it, read the reviews/don‚Äôt preorder it. Literally a solution to company‚Äôs bs.
---
It has been fixed when scrolling through the stash box. Any other issues I am not sure of.
---
I could only deposit 3-4 items before I had to close the UI and reopen my stash before depositing more gear. That issue has been fixed. 
---
If opening trade with dupers had an 80% crash rate, it would happen when they open their own inventory. I cannot see people abusing the coding on the buffer overflow dealing with an acceptable 80% chance to crash in addition to all the others we have to crash. 
---
I completely agree that so many issues with this game remains, but the thing is people arent making posts saying "This is a serious issue I'm having- let's get attention surrounding it" 
---
Its recycling the same unconstructive, useless banter video after video, post after post.
---
You cant say that people arent being super ridiculous and pointless with a lot of posts and videos, just as I cant say there arent people who are delusional about it being an amazing and perfect game.
---
As for it feeling like a downgrade, I've been mentioning that it isnt supposed to be a traditional Fallout. Not saying that it's amazing at what it's trying to be, but if you go into it playing it for what it is and rather than what you want it to be, there is a good hundred hours of fun in the game.
---
It's not supposed to have thousands of hours of content, at least not yet. I hope it will get to that point eventually, but even if it doesn't I'll still have had fun with this game and got my moneysworth (After I find someone to buy my power armor edition collectables, that is.)
---
It's not amazing, by any means, but it isnt terrible. Aside from the bugs and issues everyone is having, of course. 
---

I‚Äôve really started using the ability to mark mats that I want (ballistic fiber, lead, that sort of stuff) and that helps me decide what to keep vs what to  leave alone. 
---
Ahh
---
Tbf pvp is an intended aspect of the game, whereas duping isn't. 
---
I never really had much of a problem with the game, other than server issues. Even that wasn't a huge deal, since it didn't take long to log back in, and it saved automatically fairly frequently. But every time I gave my two cents, I got downvoted into oblivion, so I eventually just shut up about it.
---
The worst is that scorched drop so much shotgun ammo and with the bloody mess perk its so hard to find the bits, at night, in bushes/ grass to get my ammo lol
---
I think its about keeping companies accountable. I know it sucks to have your favorite game getting dumped on, but as long as there is some kind of news, it will be reported on. 
---
You can find those at Camp McClintock and Sugar Grove 
---
I've dropped at least two of these. This is the first time I'm hearing they're rare. They were scrap metal in a minute. Eh.. I don't think that will change.
---
Maybe... FO76 is bad? That bad?
---
I would happily pay upwards of 500 caps to get some great junk items 
---
3rd Workshop makes my game crash. Every time! Wish I could capture and complain about defending all my workshops at once. 
---
They could just add the Raider Booze Still from the Nuka World DLC, it would be perfect.
---
It's hard to enjoy a game when it's been terribly and obviously half-assed. And you have to be a complete idiot not to see that. You're funny.
---
Ya the 95% bug is annoying. I have a feeling it's something like vats calculating from your head while your weapon is behind an object entirely blocking the shots.
---
Easily reproducible to empty dozens of rounds standing in one spot missing every "95%"
---
bethesda bad
---
cdpr good
---
praise geraldo
---
Thank you for saying what a lot of us have been thinking. Yes some dicey shit happened in the beginning. Yes making some noise got the train going, and we are now back in sync and getting fixes based on feedback. I heard rumors the bag situation is even being taken care of. WE CAN STOP NOW! Hopefully this will die down because it is truly *exhausting* trying to stay away from the hate. It's a good game. If you don't have the patience to follow the journey, that's fine. Go play a more polished title like RDR2. No one is forcing anyone to stay. Leave the rest of us to enjoy what we want to and how we want to.
---
My husband watches some youtubers that actually like 76 and gets a lot of update info from them. I think their names are JustDom and JuiceHead. The videos of theirs I have seen have been all good and positive üòä
---
Safe travels ‚úåüèª
---
They're saying "booo-urns."
---
That's not true at all.  He can bitch about the commentary on Reddit.  He can make Youtube videos about it.  He can write a book about.  Rant at open mic night about it.
---
Nothing restrains him from doing these things, or requires him to "get over it" and accept/ignore comments that he doesn't like, you fucking bully.
---
I love the Fallout game so how come I don't like Fallout 76? I even live in Charleston West Virginia
---
Not to mention that the current method of duping closes the entire server for all players based on the actions of 1-2 players' inventories.
---
You do if you want to put them on the PO
---
at least for the xo-1
---
no one forced them to release a meme. however, they released and sold a meme. this was their doing. people are just enthusiastic about it because they're tired of being disappointed. bethesda did this, no one else. 
---
The game was a massive betrayal of the goodwill Bethesda has garnered they've spent a long time being regarded as better than what they really are so now they are feeling the karmaic feedback of taking that for granted. They deserve every ounce of salt.
---
When EA won the not so sought prize of becoming 'Worst Company in the World' two years in a row by popularity contest its not like EA was actually the worst company in the world, they're in competition with insurance companies bankrupting individuals, banks behind the crisis that caused homelessness, unemployment and if you want to be really dramatic, death and so o and so forth- a lot of real live companies doing a lot worse harm to individuals than wasting 60 dollars on a sub-par game from a developer that used to put out good ones. At worst you can say they turn kids towards gambling but even if EA had gambling ads aimed at kids running 24/7 on twitch streams and cartoonnetwork I still wouldn't put them up in the top 10 of worst companies ever. 
---
Giving them that title did set them on the path to try and right the wrong PR-wise and for a few years EA actually did good and was looking to turn a new leaf. 
---
I mean they've since dropped that act and are now worse than ever but it was nice for a bit- point I was making is consumer outrage can cause change, sometimes, even if it doesn't last... So its not like this'll be worth nothing, if we're lucky Bethesda will work on actually finishing the next title they put out to score some good will.
---
&gt;Ultracite laser rifle somehow does even less damage than regular laser gear, and still struggles with durability.
---
It does less damage per shot since it fires faster. Which makes it straight up worse, given how do the DR works IMO.
---
I use travelling pharmacy and thru hiker, along with perks for no chem/alcohol addiction.
---
I have so many drugs.
---
So many fucking drugs.
---
Mmmmmmmmm...
---
Drugs.
---
(No seriously I carry around hundreds of every drug and give them to children, I mean, newbies.)
---
Add another 0. 
---
2k is close to the baseline that I see for melee without min maxing 
---
Yeah no I'm not session hopping. I can feel when they respawn. There is a cue, the game will freeze for a spit instance when i cross it. Because i sneak I can feel it more. I do not fast travel. Normally I hang out at the shops till people leave then go over there right afterward.
---
Pretty much this. I have plenty of other people to watch, but it seems like nearly everyone is trying to cash in on the 76 hate. I could handle a few videos, but now I notice small digs at the game even in unrelated, non 76 videos.
---
But to the people like Oxhorn who still just kind of do their thing in the midst of all this? I greatly appreciate it. I've had to unsubscribe from /r/Fallout because now you can't even discuss stuff like Fallout 4 or New Vegas without someone moaning about 76/the state of Bethesda.

Accurate description 
---
I got lucky and have two TSE handmades that I got via trading with folks. I‚Äôd gladly sell one of them for real money if someone wants to pay me hahaha
---
Had that happen a couple of times too
---
i can't imagine putting in the time &amp; money to fix all the shit this game has going for it is worth it at all for bethesda, i expect this game to be abandoned very soon
---
Maybe because 76 is vastly different from every other game in the franchise? It‚Äôs pretty much a spin-off. It‚Äôs not hard to understand. 
---
&gt; EVERY top ten worst games list has Fallout 76 at the top, along with a diatribe that just says it's a bad game without going into why it's a bad game, even if other games on the list were objectively *worse*. 
---
You know what I do instead?  *I just play the damn game*.  Sure, it's a shit-fest a lot of the time, but I spend my time *playing* it, not *reading* about it.
---
Let me ask why you're so attached to what people think about 'your game'?  It's not your mother or your girlfriend.  Let it go and either enjoy it or not.
---
You want something serious to bitch about, turn on the evening news once.
---
That's actually fair, kind of stopped watching "news satire" shows after the Trump election for the same reason. It's not that they're wrong to say Trump is bad, but talking about that gets old quick.
---
Pre-war, yes. Which is why Huntersville happened. (Spoilers, not going into it).  
---
Post war, they were trying everything they could to get Defcon set to 1 so that they could finish nuking China.
---
Here you go: http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects
---
Exactly. I originally had the min max idea. ‚ÄúAlright I‚Äôve got to figure out what weapons I want to use and then take all the damage perks for them if I want to see the end game.‚Äù Nope Nevermind I happened to open 4 iron fist in perks and I just punch things with anti armor knuckles and half the time I unequip iron fist for more weight reduction. I use heavy Guns and will say both stabilized (armor reduction) and one man army (crippling and stagger) are worth it but haven‚Äôt had the need in the slightest to take any of the damage boost. Even if I do I will take the first level of the 3 Heavy Gunner perks and spend 3 perk slots on +30% damage and not the 9 needed for +60%. 
---
I've got jet pack and 2 calibrated shocks in my x01 and used zero flux or any other mats to do it.  Just bought them from the vendor and installed them.  It shows a list of needed mats(most of which I didn't have), but that is just to construct the mod.  Since I already had the mod in my inventory it just used that and none of my parts.
---
I'm not gonna say I wouldn't like to get more energy based guns, but that's not really the issue.
---
They need to fix the armor penetration not applying to energy damage, durability for certain weapons, the hitreg on Plasma and possibly some damage buff on Laser guns. All of these are either major bugs or balance issues.
---
Then they can start adding more guns.
---
Sounds good! On Xbox right?
---
I would understand and sympathize with this a lot better if the devs just *said* as much. Case in point, Bethesda said they would start communicating with us (lol). When? How? They have told us nothing of the dupe issues or even the stash limit, so here we are left to speculate about what they're (not) doing and why.
---
Wait a minute, the bag, release date, data leaks, and the price point were all decisions and mistakes made by Bethesda Softworks, not Bethesda Game Studios. Softworks has as much to do with 76's actual development as they do with Doom's. People like pretending they're the same company just because Bethesda is in the name. 
---
I really think this is one of the biggest problems with the hate. Half of this stuff isn't the fault of the people actually responsible for the game. 
---
there needs to be extreme backlash so bethesda knows they can't keep getting away with this shit forever
---
&gt; I could care less what other say.
---
So you do care, even if it‚Äôs just a little.
---
"Starched genes" luck perk
---
If they fixed there game. If it wasn‚Äôt a AAA studio with a dev team and money to make a good game. They short charged this game and over marketed it. Maybe it‚Äôs the gaming industry finally had enough paying top dollar for a game that‚Äôs not finished or optimized. It‚Äôs not acceptable and gamers are standing up finally.
---
I agree with everything you say but the publishers have created this mindset and acceptance of paying real money for content through the proliferation of loot boxes and mtx.
---
What's the difference between paying 10 bucks for an outfit on the official store or 10 bucks for a weapon you want from third party? 
---
This has existed in online games forever. Bethesda's bug ridden code just makes it easier. 
---
Preach! I'm sick of it too brother. A bunch off asshats just trashing games to generate views. Utilizing sensationalism to draw in clicks. People need to talk and about what they know and like rather than crapping on a game they don't even play. It's the same thing with gaming podcast. I don't give a shit about the games these people don't like. And it's so pretentious and delusional that they feel like they're providing a service by blindly criticizing video games.
---
Get the lvl2 starched genes perk in luck
---
Lol I'ma have you start jumpin n with me when I'm on I'll gladly take it haha
---
Carlos was only a level 30, I‚Äôm level 62 so half your level would make sense 
---
I would like this idea. Maybe get a robot companion after completing the quest mayor for a day? I just worry that our robots would start attacking people's turrets at home bases and get us a wanted level
---
&gt;  only shots that hit drain condition
---
Is that how it works? Is that why the Tesla Rifle seems to last forever?? I need more data on this!
---
FWIW - At level 25 you get a good quest to get plans for your own suit of Power Armor, and that's probably more effective than hoarding parts until you can use them, wasting inventory space. Also realize that fusion cores and all other ammo now has weight. Fusion cores weight about 3 pounds each, so you can probably max out around 10 - they're fairly abundant. Same with missiles and mini-nukes; if you're going to use them, keep around 10, otherwise, ditch, because you can't sell ammo. 
---
&gt;but the only ways to remove radiation/mutations are the drugs or the decontamination arch

---
How old are you?

But they must be near you
---
My dude
---
Yep!
---
100% agree.
---
I still found them usable in Fallout 4, here they are pretty much useless (Plasma straight up is).  
---
Although I did prefer the Gauss Rifle and Bozar in 2.  
---
I am a few levels past you and have been feeling the same. I went back to the main quest, but I am nearly done with that now. Bethesda has said they will be adding new content in the future. Since it is an online game they have the option to add quests instead of packing the game full of crazy things to do like they have done with Fallout 4 or Elder Scrolls games. What we got was what software developers call the MVP, Minimum Viable Product (oh the irony). I am expecting they will be fleshing the game out more in the future. I expect I will move on to something else for a while and come back after they offer content updates.   
---
I think they could do some really cool things to develop the story, like Destiny 2, but you know..good. An expansion could be that the Scorched have been destroyed, people are moving into West Virginia, and leaving vaults. Now your job is to take care of growing Raider populations. Something like that. 
---
So for something to be multiplayer, it has to be forced? Quality argument right there!
---
I'm sorry if you haven't heard, pal, but Bethesda already "chose". And judging by your comments, they didn't choose you. So hey, enjoy this *multiplayer Fallout*, just as Bethesda intended it to be!
---
I'm starting to see a pattern here. You've come from: "no F76 isn't online", to "okay it's online but not multiplayer", and finally to "okay it's online and multiplayer, but it's not a *proper* online game"; I can't wait to see what you come up with next.
---
You heard it here first, boys. A build can't shoot through walls! OMG buff now plz bethy!! 
---
I see that you **still** fail to understand what balance means. Look, in Battlefield, for example, Snipers are a good class, and many people like it. That's because they are balanced with the rest of the classes. They have pros and cons, as it should be. And I have yet to see someone yelling "omg snipers cant shoot through walls, maeng!!1 they should nerf every other class bcz of dis!!11!". Because they are not stupid, I guess.
---
I truly hope you are not an Economics student, because oh boy do you have a lot to learn. Look, this is from Wikipedia, a source that I'm sure you are very familiar with: "Economic transactions occur when two parties agree to the value or price of the transacted good or service, commonly expressed in a certain currency"; the currency doesn't have to be real at all. It can be caps. When I trade some of my junk with a guy for another product, for caps, or even for a certain service, *there's an economy going on*. And when it isn't only us, but thousands of players trading everyday, what do you have? Come on, I will let you answer. You know this one.
---
There's an Armorer perk you have to have. It's under Intel.
---
I'll make a new character if you'll be my Psycho dealer ;)
---
They‚Äôve been off for holiday they probably are just returning to their offices now. They reply to comments and posts here fairly often. 
---
That happens to me too, so I tried this for like 9 mins, then I said screw it and left
---
That's a plan for a BoS mod for combat armor. You need the piece of armor first. Then mod it.
---
Few quick thoughts as a lvl 102 stealth sniper:
---
1. Overall, I think this build will be fun, and effective enough.  A lot of perk swapping though 
---
2. Note that unlike fallout 4, I don‚Äôt believe shotguns benefit from rifle perks, so the overlap isn‚Äôt really there anymore.  I definitely used shotguns early on because it‚Äôs easy to get a silencer, but eventually replaced with a fast non-auto like combat rifle.   I never felt shotguns were worth perks.
---
3. I saw it in the swap section but Escape Artist is really key
---
4. Overall this build does well solo but it‚Äôs tough in nuked areas.  My experience is you can get back to ‚Äúcaution‚Äù but still won‚Äôt get sneak attacks, and the ones you do immediately ‚Äúheal‚Äù back right away.  The meta is more about getting hits on mobs there so build is probably irrelevant.
---
5. You probably want more luck.  VATS for headshots and crits are how to take your damage to the next level, OP duped legendaries notwithstanding.  Very useful in PVP as well.  And luck perks overall are so good.  I ended up using the respec feature to max luck in the end. 
---
Hope this helps,
---
Damn, thats weird. Im a 100% sure I do need to pay the mats
---
I think he got a bounty on his head. He disconnected from the server suuuper quick so I‚Äôm assuming he did. I Feel bad for the guy if it was an honest mistake 
---
Now you just need some crafters and a cook or two. You could open up your own Vault-Mart. 
---
Just because you are full of your own shit with your criticism doesn't mean that I'm a shill.

A 9 y/o sister and 11 y/o brother know about drug dealers and this story in general sounds like something a 14-16 y/o kid made up
---
I'm level 86 and whenever I see a defence event o always fast travel to it for them sweet free plans! But the amount of times I've helped a low level defend a workshop for them to get scared and log off.
---
No, level 17, I do not want your workshop. If that was so you'd be dead before you even saw me üòÇ
---
I have it maxed out at 3. I‚Äôm also level 65. Is there another restriction I don‚Äôt know of?
---
You must have whacky wasteland perk on 
---
I like how you cant gun butt in VATS.  JK, I hate it.
---
This game reminds me so much of Halo Master Chief collection. If you arent familiar, the game was broken as soon as it launched. You would wait in lobbies to find a match for hours. There were probably thousands of threads on issues it had. To make it worse, 343 put out a few early updates to at least let you get into a game (sometimes), then just went silent and left the game broken for a few years!
---
Itbwas basically a huge tease. A great, exciting idea of a game that failed at launch and took years to rebuild. Fallout 76 is a fun game. I enjoy playing it whenever I get the chance. But being kinda new (level 25), theres only so many game crashes, non working missions or other random bugs ill be able to stomach before something else takes my attention away...
---
I could totally see my younger nephew and niece  say the same...they say a lot of stuff...cute things, scary things, and funny things. 
---
‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm chaotic neutral! You have to accept it!‚Äù
---
No, you‚Äôre a fucking asshole. And we don‚Äôt.
---
r/fallout
---
Enjoy, Enclave.  Ima stick to the majority.  76 is a sad, sad game.  They should be ashamed. 
---
Yeah I don't understand the logic behind that choice.  You would never suspect normal armor isn't viable in "endgame" locations until you get there.  Other than movement speed, there is no advantage armor has over PA.  I guess if you stack a bunch of legendary effects but most are kind of boring for armor.  I think most people like wearing it for aesthetics/RP/hate being in clunky PA.
---

What's wrong with spending 500 Atoms on a TSE weapon?

I just imagined a completely hairless Danny DeVito smothered in Purell slithering across the floor 
---
The repair applies on crafting I believe
---
Wow, I feel like such a dumbass.  
---
*tips caps your way*
---
No mans sky was boring, empty, nothing to do on launch. But at least it tried something new. 
---
Fallout 76 literally took Fallout 4, stripped it down to the bare minimum of features, and added multiplayer where no one even interacts with each other. 
---
It's a Fallout game and the Fallout fan base is huge and has many dedicated fans. For Bethesda to release a game like this and call it Fallout, is very disheartening, especially since it was so low effort and they clearly did not care much for the game, releasing it in the state that it did. 
---
It shouldn't be so easy to accidentally do.  Or really it shouldn't be possible at all.  Store in stash or scrap should be the only options, and scrap should automatically split off all equipped parts, so you don't accidentally lose ones you might have wanted.
---
It's just too easy to scrap or drop things you really want.
---
Much different game, with much a much different platform.
---
I cleaned house at the Wade Airport when I checked it out. Seemed every building had some kind of adhesive in it, plus a boatload of supermutes added to the caps stash
---
You can buy them from other players for stupid cheap. I got to around level 80 before someone else gifted me a TSE.
---
Seconded
---
I like Bethesda so wouldn't expect such a shitty product.  Are you reading your own words?
---
Example. North of the clubhouse those lines of buildings. Two sets to be exact that are connected by the porch. After you go past the unit with ginseng in it the game will pause or freeze right before the stairs once it unfreezes I can hear the ghouls spawn spawn in and start moving around. If its already cleared the game wont pause/freeze
---
That‚Äôs the reality of the wasteland.
---
Resources aren‚Äôt abundant and food and clean water are hard to come by.
---
You see it with the groups of raiders after the war through holotapes and notes.
---
Not everyone is going to be okay with being a scavenger and a farmer.
---
Why toil endlessly to scrape by when you can just rob someone else?  Especially if there is no law enforcement, or laws on general, to stop you.
---
The real issue is that PVP is broken, TSE weapons are way over powered and through duping are everywhere, and that base defences are useless.
---
There needs to be an anti-griefing system.  If someone kills someone else then there needs to be an option for the dead person to opt for pacifist mode, on both their sides, for the rest of the session in regards to each other and their camps.
---
OR, pacifist mode simply means no one can hurt you or your stuff and you can hurt anyone else or their stuff.
---
I don‚Äôt know if Bethesda is capable of coding such a system though, in regards to CAMP objects anyway.
---
Acting like that's what they actually did lol
---
I actually farm Watoga robots. Most are simply legendary but even one star items can be really good. In fact last night I got nine legendary robots from one run and one was a two star. 
---
So if your going to do the monster mash clean up the robots on the way in. Make sure to kill the non legendaries to encourage respawns from their pods.
---
Thank you for this.  I'm a week into the game and enjoying it immensely, weird bugs and all.  Haters gonna hate. 
---
No Idea, hell the last time I moved mine it was 161 then I moved it just a little bit more since i missed a couple of features I wanted in my area and it was 141 caps.
---
Did you guys see the 4 horseman Power Armor leaks from a data mine? That stuff looks gnarly!
---
Sometimes it seems an invisible enemy is attacking me. I don't stick around the area to see if it'll keep happening of if it was a one-time hit.
---
The stagger/cripple perks definetely outperform the outright damage ones. While they obviously synergize well, I'd say you're making the right call. I remember back when I regularly used a Shotgun with Enforcer... It was silly how anything but a Scorchbeast turned passive from having every limb crippled after a couple of shots.
---
I think I've used a Strength point or two to get to level three in Pack Rat, and I got dealt a card for Thru-Hiker in Agility that I use. However, once you get deep enough into the game, you should be able to suss out what materials you need - you have them tagged - and be able to resist picking up the oodles of metal buckets, torque rods and other heavy items that weigh plenty but aren't that valuable. So, it is generally better to focus on other perks. If you've got a somewhat lean character loadout - two or three weapons, 10 stimpacks, 20 food items or so - then you should still have 100 to 200 pounds of carrying space, depending on whether you're using regular armor, power armor or Excavator power armor. 
---
You need therapy. 
---
Damn. That sucks.
---
I don't know anything about overwatch, but that sounds cool
---
For me the game at times is very enjoyable but as a whole it's not as interesting as it's predecessors and there is tons of blatant laziness on Bethesda's part.
---
You are a life saver mate. I've been trying to figure out why my Spotify suddenly spiked in volume and deafened me whenever I went through a loading screen. 
---
The shortcomings of the game, developers and the merchandise have been covered all they needed to at this point. It's been heard. The complaining endlessly is way past fulfilling that purpose and is just negative noise that should have run it's course. I didn't buy it because multi-player Fallout isn't for me and I was still sad it turned out so faulty. I can't wear a vault boy branded tee shirt anymore without people I don't know making a point of talking to me to lament how shit 76 is. Bored of it. And shouldn't need to avoid gaming reddits, social media or YouTube to not hear all the yapping. It's really really old and done.
---
nightkin are rare
---
OP must be very curious, and very enthusiastic. Haha 
---
I know that feel.  With fallout 4, i played with the "Weightless Junk" mod so i tagged and picked up literally everything I could.
---
I think they got the fucking memo by now is the point. Now it's just beating the fuck out of the dead horse
---
I got this bug as well and none of the other PA chassis bug fixes work. Relogging fixes it for a bit when I ezit and reneter armor it just happens again
---
I'd recommend not using Lone Wanderer (4) in conjunction with Action Boy/Girl (3).
---

---
This likely means reallocating the points spent in Agility to something else like Bloody Mess (in Luck) or to Str/End for more utility.
---
Todd Howard wouldn't lie about the game either, right?
---
My generator behind walls, and covered in a roof seems to be the first thing that is destroyed. NPC's can seemingly somehow still get to it. I USED to have a door to it, but apparently NPC's can unlock level 3 locked doors somehow to get to the generator. They were absolutely obsessed with it. They even ignored the spike boards I placed on the ground.
---
Go to camp defiance, if your part of the BoS you can spawn an event there called "line in the sand" you gotta protect a sonar emitter against scorched and a couple SB, and there is an AA there to help you. If your lvl 40 ish its not too bad.
---
You generally get 2 full cores from doing it and takes 7-15 mins maybe and can be done once an hour, i think you can do it sooner but I dont think you get rewards til after the 1 hr cooldown on the event. I like to start my play time with that event and just pick up cores as I need them exploring.
---
With the event and a couple spawn points you can easily get 6+ cores in an hour vs 1 per hr at the posiedon place.
---
There's some nice pics over on r/Fo76creations if you're itching to see more.
---
That's a mod anyway, not a piece itself. Increases rad resist on combat armor
---
The game is shit. I put 60+ hours into it because I like Fallout but 76 is shit. Online Fallout was never going to work, i expected bugs and bad gameplay but it was so much worse.
---
Use diluted stuff
---
&gt; I made a post in this sub saying how I just couldn‚Äôt get into the game and many replies just told me to move on.
---
Okay but what did you expect the community to do?  We can't fix the game, we have to wait for the devs to fix it just like you do.  If you have constructive feedback, feel free to post it.  But if you're just post number 342987 complaining about the exact same thing we've heard about over and over again... what do you expect?
---
Your complaints aren't irrelevant, we've just heard them all before.  Over and over again.  Hopefully Bethesda is working on them.
---
&gt;I just didn‚Äôt want this post to be one big victim support circle jerk where no actual negatives can be spoken
---
Uh, don't worry about that.  I have yet to see a single post like this that *didn't* have a counterpoint as a top 2 response.  And that counterpoint is always some iteration of the following: "The game still has huge issues... it's good for Bethesda to hear negative feedback... why are you complaining about complaining... Bethesda deserves all the hate they are getting..."
---
No one comes here claiming that FO76 is a perfect game.  The victim support feeling you're seeing happens because a lot of us feel exactly like the OP.  The complaints are getting *really* old.  They aren't constructive feedback, they're memes.  They're just easy money and karma for people who don't even play the game any more.
---
What's more fun than shitting on something? Everyone shitting on something. 
---
Wendigos also give you screws. Farm the wendigo cave for screws and you get all sorts of goodies as a bonus.
---
Never before has a thought of mine been so eloquently been put into words by someone else, bravo.
---
wow ive never had to defend against scorchbeasts. was it a certain workshop?
---
One person presented a reasonable argument that I agree with.
---
However, you never substantiated the idea that OP claimed it was a "superior product". He simply didn't.
---
Exactly, take workshops around the corners of the maps for easy cap discounts, I usually dont even put the extractors up unless its something I desperately need. 
---
That's exactly how I played.   
---
I discovered every location and looted every container that I could in one zone, before moving on to the next one.   
---
I was level 95 with over 225 hrs played before I finally completed Cranberry Bog.    
---
You will definitely out level certain areas, but there will always be challenges awaiting you.   Even at my current level, 115, Cranberry Bog scares me.
---
What games have you bought for $20 with more content? 
---
Not trying to pull a ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù, genuinely want to play a game like that and always in the market for new games. 
---
Still have serums?
---
I always give a quick wave or heart emoji, that usually works.  Occasionally they freak out and shoot me a few times, but no matter :)
---
Hating on a game you haven‚Äôt ever played is meta af bro
---
Yeah the past week on PS4 has been annoying
---
Yep I think this is what people call beating a dead horse the fallout 76 hate has been beaten to a bloody pulp 
---
I crash two or three times a session, lost my best weapon last night after a crash, constantly spammed by scorchbeasts, never find good loot, constantly managing my stash, I still love it and have nearly 200 hours played of the damn thing.
---
I think they need to be a bit swifter and more open with the updates though. This should be getting micropatches weekly and megapatches monthly or even fortnightly. And if they cut the price of everything in the Atom store by like half I would probably buy a bunch of stuff to demonstrate my support for ongoing development.
---
I've had a problem with toilets clogging excessively for me lately. Guess I'll just start shitting on the floor. Thanks buddy!
---
These YouTubers are morons.. you can tell by how long it takes for them to read and choose what loot to pick up. 
---
Pretty common. results may vary sometimes in good for hours then 3 dc in ten min. At the end of the day with all the dcs and glitches you really hafta just look the other way otherwise your gonna have a bad time.
---
Left game to give them time to make this playable.  Yes I noticed this prior to leaving.  Came back recently.  So far, no dcs happening but my camp is always invisible.  Turrets seem to disappear completely but are still taking up storage space.
---
I'm REALLY trying to enjoy it.  I love the game but hate the experience.
---
Hell, there's already moonshining stuff in the game. Just make it useable.
---
Starches genes but it's rare to get
---
They are proud of actually patching their game (lol), ask for feedback about what we would like to see in the game and "many patches such wow, believe me".
---
That's not news, that's the absolute bare minimum anyone selling software has to deliver. Yet they act like they're samaritarian, unbelievable.
---
They didn't even incorporate f4 and beta feedback and knowingly carried mechanical and technical flaws over.
---
How disconnected are they? It's not about additional content, we got a broken fundation here.
---
It's time they start being honest and transparent with us.
---
Another good spot is Camp McClintock. Lots of clipboards and a bonus of ballistic fiber.
---
Says the shill.
---
Commenting this after my 5th crash in new vegas in 20 minutes. It's been ongoing.
---
To be fair, i don't really want to be forced to hop between vendors all day just to keep up a wage to explore on. 
---
I've seen 4 here at once myself. It's pretty nice!
---
I wonder if it's only meant to work on regular leather and not heavy leather? Would be really annoying but maybe that's it.
---
How many crashes are legitimate and how many are malicious dupers literally trying to make the game worse? You'll never know exact numbers, but this shit needs to be brought up. Theres dupers with 10s of thousands of pounds on their characters lagging the servers to shit, it's TRUE. 
---
Honestly RDRD2 wasn‚Äôt that good change my mind....
---
Starched Genes Level 2.  You'll avoid new ones and keep old ones.
---
RadX will suppress those mutations for a short time.  But you can't lose them with that card enabled.
---
&gt; Jack of all trades build
---
I bet it's because of Explosive weapons 
---
&gt; Uses legendary explosive weapons
---
A build sorta becomes moot when you all you gotta do is leave a crater where the enemy was left standing...
---
I don't think alarm Clocks or toasters have screws....  I have screws on search as well and those don't come up for me.  I will say that hot plates were the most overlooked thing for me before I had search on.  Clipboards too... "Battered" have springs, regular have screws.
---
Ah but if F76 is a construct to train synths then it could be set at any time. Maybe we are all a programme running on a computer in the Institute during the events of F4. It's the only way I can see to explain all the retcons and strange design choices haha.
---
I just want to be puuuuuuure
---
My team mates are all high level and they are the nicest people.
---
Funnily enough, I got the Legs last night from a Grafton
---
Monster near Hemlock Holes!
---
I have on the PC this past weekend experienced some random disconnects. Usually I was in Whitesprings before and after a nuke event. So I attributed it to the mass amount of things happening with 10 billion robots (it seemed) and enemies. I'm still troubleshooting my PC to make sure the network and graphics aren't to blame but other games run fine (although they seem less strenuous - like Overwatch and ESO). 
---
That would be a really great argument for the recon mod on power armor helmets, if they actually worked -\_-
---
Yesterday I experienced something similar. The event ended and we didnt kill the Queen, but she didn't despawn.
---
Maybe I'm just a hoarder or something, but I have something like 2,000 springs, and probably 3,000 screws. I grab every typewriter, desk fan, toy car or truck, globe, or hot place that I run across. It all adds up.
---
As for springs, clipboards, flip lighters, typewriters, and watches are all over the place, and cameras and toasters aren't that uncommon, either.
---
I have probably 10 items on my mental list that I automatically grab while I'm out and about, whether I need it or not.
---
Don‚Äôt be such a wimp?
---
I'm a bit late to the party, but they tend to be found in desks, filing cabinets, and safes. Look for those containers in locations that would have something to do with either the military or manufacturing of some sort.
---
Funny story, I had a 3 wave workshop defense quest at the abandoned bog town featuring Gutsies and there was a scorchbeast nearby.  So I kite them over to it and it proceeds to gradually tank all of them.  There were no legendaries, but a regular scorchbeast can absolutely wreck ten or fifteen Col. Gutsies without much of a sweat.
---
Bah!  Bah i say!
---
All you ever hear about are HIGH lvls helping LOW lvls.  Pfft!
---
Why don't low lvls help out us high lvls for once?!  
---
Tackle a scorchbeast and distract it so we don't need to repair as often!  use your bodies to block missiles and jump on grenades!
---
Humbug!
---
If you get the plans to craft Halloween Skeleton Outfit, they sell for a ton. Mine sell for 55 caps each with Magnetism + 1 other person in team, herd mentality, 3 charisma, and 3 hard bargain. Without another person in the team and just 3 herd it's 52 caps (but I am pret, without hard bargain I think it's like 42 caps?  
---
They cost 2 cloth and 5 plastic to make each. I've been able to get the amount to EXACTLY 50 sometimes, not sure what triggered that, which made it easier to just sell 4 and be done at each vendor. Otherwise I have to sell 3 and sell 1 witch out fit for 42 caps leaving me with 2 caps to vendor 2 junk items.
---
Litterally no one knows anything about these updates... OP is exactly right. We don't know anything about how these systems will be implemented and the changes they are going to make, yet you're so pessemistic about everyhting in FO76 you can't fathom that Bethesda can do anything right. I think the did a lot of things wrong with this game. That said they also did a lot of things right. But you're hyper focused on hating Bethesda and their game now. 
---
They just missed the boat not having explosive bolts. It could have been a double pop culture nod.
---
Some geniua thought it was a great idea to have "invite to team" and "get out of your power armor" on the same button.
---
When I first played this game I defended it and wanted the best for it but in November a little bit after thanks giving I was going to making me a set of x 01 armor. I had all my junk on me when I was heading to the munitions factory 
---
I play a LOT... I've found 3 explosive weapons. None are Two-Shot. First ever was a double light machine gun. Second was a double barrel shotgun. Third was... an Assaultron Head... and it is the worst weapon I've ever used. Quite a novelty, though.
---
I'm in no way saying that the game doesn't have its problems. Because it has a LOT of problems. I played for about three weeks and ended up spending more time in RDR2 because there is objectively more fun to be had in their unfinished online beta than there is in 76. Which is....saddening.
---
My main complaint is that there's too many "pointless yelling and pointing fingers" reviews and videos. There's very few actually pointing to the issues in the game and what needs to be done, and essentially WHY the game is bad. It's just a lot of repeated "dis is bad" language. 
---
It's not that it doesn't deserve the hate - it's that I'm a little tired of seeing it everywhere I go, in everything I do.
---
I don't mean to diminish exactly what this company has done in the name of cash grabbing and anti consumerism, and I am sorry if it came off that way.
---
Harvesters are absolutely unnecessary.  I get more than enough junk from my regular loot collection as I play.  And you don't need more than one small water purifier to handle your thirst, purified water is also very easy to find and is often a reward from events.
---
I'd go with the cool house every time.
---
That‚Äôs the right way to play 76 IMO.  Explore your heart out!  Also don‚Äôt be afraid to take and defend workshops in the starting areas.  It‚Äôs good XP, plans, stims, and the first time I took a shared workshop I immediately got all the basic plans for free (ie crafting stations).  
---
Also don‚Äôt worry if other players show up when you are defending they are probably there to help and get free plans from the event.  Good luck!
---
Lvl 32 psn is biffpipp
---
I've not seen it myself, but it happened on the ManyATrueNerd / NerdCubed video at Dolly Sods.
---
Aside from perk cards and maxing strength, Bloodied weapons combined with adrenal mutation while being at low health adds a lot of damage. Taking whiskey and fury. Melee/unarmed bobblehead. 
---
The ideal melee weapon is a grognaks bloodied axe with swing speed and reduced weight 
---
Once player vending becomes a thing I'd appreciate something like the recruitment beacons in Fallout 4. Like a tower you can build to either broadcast a message or just show up on other player's maps. That dynamic could be a lot of fun, traders could use it but so could raiders to lure you into a trap. Or raiders could skulk around traders, hoping to pick off those coming in to trade. Shit this sounds like a ton of fun, let's do it. 
---
You shut up, Bethesda shill. It should've never been a 60 dollar game kid.
---
Sun kissed n photosynthetic perk cards in endurance are great ways to cure rads n health respectively. They work while the perk cards are active n between the hours of 6am-6pm. Have some issues today with these cards though maybe a server issue not the cards themselves. 
---
I think it should cost more commendations for stuff. 20 for a jetpack? Thats like a couple hours work lol.
---
I‚Äôm not sure about that I freeze at random points, once I beat the quest exited the area and was on my way when the game crashed. When I signed back on I was in the shack about to start the quest again. Other times it‚Äôs just at random points while fighting the scorched. I‚Äôm thinking that the area is just broken and that I‚Äôm going to have to hope I get lucky one run. 
---
I probably messed up my username, why i picked just 1s and 0s i dont know
---
Only applies to the last Kill in my experience, except when it sometimes gets stuck on the first, but either way it doesn't help when you just capped 20 of them.
---
It also doesn't help that some corpses simply de-spawn within a few seconds, and the meat piles sometimes drop through the mesh, gone for good, along with the legendary item you worked so hard for.  
---
I thought items on the atomic shop would come the same as the American patriot suit : you can craft both the dirty &amp; clean version. I could be wrong but I'm pretty sure I saw datamined i.e. the dirty version of vault-tec PJs and some others outfits, no idea why they're not sold with the clean version, well unless they want to sell them separately...
---
Look at all this crap.
---
What if robotic police spawned near people WITHOUT bounties? What then?
---
Jesus. If the fucking game was meant to be a PVE hugfest, PVP wouldnt be possible at all. Sure, maybe its not for you, but dont sit there theorizing ways to make the game YOURS and fuck everyone else. 
---
Remember your playing fallout. It isnt supposed to be a rainbow land with frogs hopping and bunnies playing in a serene meadow. Raiders, cannibals, mutated psychos, etc are all part of the lore and universe - yet other players are "dicks" when they shoot at you? 
---
It's impossible to get them from the Enclave vendor. So what you are telling me is that I all I  have to do is another player who found some, has been sitting on them for weeks, and is willing to sell and/ or trade for them? 
---
Yeah.
---
That sounds way easier than trying to find them at the vendor. 
---
Only outside as a previous poster mentioned. If there's been a nuclear blast there, you might die pretty quickly if you can't get inside fast enough.
---
Have you played the other Fallout games?? Did you have HALF an idea of what to expect when you play a FALLOUT game??  This "game" deserves all the hate its gotten and MORE because of how much of a disappointment 76 turned out to be.  Bethesda released an UNFINISHED game that many paid $60 or more for, this alone is a huge problem in the gaming industry - who else but the actual PLAYERS will hold these companies responsible?  Bethesda shit on their fans, they shit on Fallout fans, and I hope they never make a fallout game again.  Obsidian master race baby
---
F76 served its purpose. IMO it was never meant to be a full-scale decent fallout game in the first place. It was a cash grab and a way to get Bethesda more staff for their bigger more ambitious products, and that is what F76 should be seen as. 
---
What is the exact affix for making your weapons lighter?
---
Besides the overseer's childhood bedroom, I also got a "Letterman's Jacket and Jeans" in a locker at the school near Grafton. 
---
Could it be that Bethesda where getting lazier and lazier since morrowind, and that it reached a critical point of laziness so it exploded and all the Other things surrounding the game just makes their goodwill burn away faster. And one last thing, From my understanding people are angry at Bethesda/zenimax and not the game itself. Just the PR the Marketing the In game store, the code for lootboxes, The broken nuke codes, The nuka rum, The server integrity, oh and the canvas bags.
---
I saw them there last night!  No meat on them, but I had the perk card that let me search again.  So much steak!
---
:o are you on a 56k modem?!
---
SBQ are a lag fest, I almost wish they dialed back the visual effects on the radiation cloud so it wasnt quite so hard on the system. I also wish your rewards were rolled on sooner, it might make the inventory pop faster.
---
Imo it feels like the game doesnt roll on whats gonna drop til the enemy is actually dead. Like how you kill the odd scorched and see one inventory as the body is dropping and a completely different one by the time the body hits the ground. Crowned enemies do this too me often.
---

---
Still my current build and when I am playing with friends we still down the queen in 45 seconds. And we all have the weight reduction perks on. So Min/Max be damned gear and competency is a much higher value then a few % of damage.   
---
(also the trick is to pop an overdrive right when she spawns)   
---
The other thing is to try and be somewhat kind and not steal all the whitespring loot but to love tap everything and that requires you to remove your damage perks.   
---
So yes weight perks are amazing, and if you are a rifler and non PA user make sure to get at least 4 armor pieces with 20% weapon reduction, hell it even stacks with other weapon reduction perks anyways. 0.27 .50 cals anyone. 
---
It may be broken. I always froze as soon as I went left. Guess I got lucky the one time I went right and it didnt crash. But when I did crash yeah I always got teleported back to the shack when I reopened the game
---
No, it's a good thing. The game actually encourages it but doesn't tell you. What I mean is that the enemy levels are above the Forest's, higher than the player character if you blindly follow the quest but there's basically only the main quest for content
---
Better yet, an RV in the Ash Heap.
---
'That Blue Serum is the best serum ever!'
---
Took me a sec to realize molly is molotov. 
---
I'm using this now and i'm gonna say "poppin a molly" when i throw one. 
---
of course.  If my wife tells me I need to care, I do as she says.  
---
Ugh. Juicehead. The worst of the youtubers. There's nothing he won't capitalize on for clicks and attention.
---
People were already disappointed with the questionable writing and quest design from Fallout 4, then they essentially removed those two elements entirely - which are the very same aspects which made Fallout a beloved franchise in a effort to milk money. Yes, Bethesda is a business, but they can make plenty of money without feeding shit to their costumers. This angered a lot of fans.
---
Another point is that Fallout 76 is the *least* rated AAA title from the last 20 years (perhaps forever).
---
Can we just be honest for a minute?  I'd bet upwards of 95% of people who bitch and moan about nearly every fucking game that comes out (I'm looking at you: F76, Atlas, PUBG, NMS, Sea of Thieves, &lt;insert any game that isn't a game of the year contender&gt;) don't actually share this sentiment.  Sure, when someone says that they've had enough of the constant moaning someone always pulls this "Well it's important the developers know how much we dislike the game so they don't do this anymore...", but I'd bet when you are memeing and circlejerking over it you aren't thinking about that.  People just bitch because that's what people do nowadays and I wholeheartedly agree with OP - it's so fucking annoying.
---
Sure are! They're junk items that scrap for 1 steel.
---
What console are you on? I got the plans on xbox, already learned them
---
Yes and there are people sick of people like you as well. There are legitimate things about how poorly this game was made and how there are many issue still right now. If you can‚Äôt handle it, stop paying attention to those people and just enjoy the game without hearing other people‚Äôs opinions on it. 
---
Players with high bounties...i noticed several with 1500+ cap bounties that walk around with non-bountied players on all sides so that you yourself become wanted when you try to engage them.  
---
Had someone come into camp and start melee/shooting us to initiate PvP....they had pacifist on so they didnt become wanted and while they were annoying it would have just caused us to be on the wrong side had we returned fire.  So check to see if you're being damaged before you engage.
---
Had an instance where (i in pacifist mode) was shot twice and killed by someone when i was not in PvP not trying to initiate any such thing.  Was shocked that the damage killed me that quick but it happened.  
---
Good news - only encountered 2-3 tool bags since starting playing.  For the most part everyone has been awesome and fun in game.  I wish we could have teams of 6-8 people instead of just 4 because we often have to run 2 teams due to meeting really nice randoms with mics and venturing out together!
---
When group farming - use pacifist mode and a tesla rifle.  you will do just enough damage to get loot but still allow others time to get in their shots/hits.  
---
Ouch
---
someone here mentioned they didnt leave the forest til level 45..im level 38..and i only have a minimal camp..so im always at the overseers camp and surrounding areas
---
I really want to see unique creatures to nuke zones.
---
That would make things interesting.
---
Not just buffed versions of existing enemies (though they should happen too), but, new creatures unique to each area in a nuke zone that have been ‚Äúdisturbed‚Äù.  
---
Like a snallygaster brood mother (thanks dragon age!)
---
Cerberus mutated dire wolves.
---
Giant robot scorpion (yay old world blues).  (Or something like that, some sort of ultimate defence robot for watoga along with a boatload of military robots for defence in case of nuclear attack or invasion).
---
I‚Äôm gonna keep upvoting 76 hate just for you 
---
Don‚Äôt blame Todd though. He‚Äôs just the main director of most of the games. He‚Äôs not the board of directors or the CEO. 
---
The bug never went away. The bug they fixed was the "stew can" not being given out to the server.
---
In fallout 3, you literally have to kill your fellow vault members to leave the vault. 
---
is there only 1 legendary drop (meaning first come first serve) or is avail for everyone (i know the other loot is avail for all of the players who earned xp for defeating the enemy)
---
‚ÄúKeep 76 out of your fucking mouth‚Äù
---
Hey /u/QuantumDrej. Do you know when I ever see this sub on /r/popular? It's when people like you cry over FO76 getting shit.
---
The release sucked, the bag sucked, the rum sucked and people are pissed at Bethesda for fucking it _all_ up.
---
My decision was not to give them a fucking cent.
---
Did you have fun with FO76? Good for you. Now go back to FO76 and play that and have fun, instead of whining on a sub that will upvote you into oblivion (heh) because "muh criticisms".
---
&gt;Even No Man's Sky didn't get this much hate
---
Ya, but Hello Games is an indie dev and Bethesda is a vet in the industry. I think the extra hate is understandable--although I agree it's meme'd into TES: 4 and whatnot.
---
FO76 buyers got scammed and can't accept they were suckers so they  blame youtubers lol
---
Amongst all the madness, I thank you for your comment. It‚Äôs kinda hard trying to justify the known bad guys of the game. Lol 
---
you havent been there when ESO got released have you?
---
It was the same shitfest, but it was overshadowed by the huge content(grind) that was already in the game. I still remember the crowd of 50 - 100 folks sitting on a rock and waiting for the main story mission to actually be proceedable, which was mandatory at that point.
---
I was a fan. Was....
---
buy it back?
---
I've had my camp not place a fair few times as well. It's always warned me that it wouldn't before loading in, unless under the circumstance I listed (joining a friend's server).
---
We miss TB. Well written thread OP, I'm enjoying the shit out of the game, fuck this money making bullshit the internet has become
---
I still play. I have at least 10k hours in online play from video games and flight simulators. This a conservative estimate.
---
Mine says ‚Äú16‚Äù but costs me 66 more often than not
---
2 disconnects and a crash xb1, in the last 30 minutes.
---
God I love redbox.  It's saved me a huge amount on bad or short games.
---
hah yeah. There are so many 80 atom challenges that are completely broken, so the initial atom boost you're supposed to get at the start isn't even happening. I'd be surprised if they bothered fixing these tbh. The way it is now, by starving players of easily earned atoms, they're just encouraging purchases in the store with real money.
---
grahm was in the whitesring nuke zone last night lol
---
Thank you for backing me up, lol we‚Äôre definitely in a minority here 
---
at least we get to upgrade our guns without paying $20 ;)
---
If you're PS4 I can give you an Instigating Super Sledge. It's not much but okay replacement. Gonna make an alt just for doing the quests at lvl 50, you might consider similar
---

I was partial to the Pulse because the very first time I ever fired it, I barbecued my target with a critical shot. I always made sure to slip my man Cassidy a Gauss, though.  
---
Best guess is that it's a 95% chance to aim correctly, then your shots hitscan with their normal accuracy divergence.
---
What good changes have Bethesda made to the game?
---
You live by the sword, you die by the sword.
---
 attempts were made to hype up the game by inviting influential youtubers out to play it and showing off their canvas bags.
---
Now, when the game was released it was found that that canvas bags were only for the YouTubers, and not for the average person.
---
they chose to use YouTube to create hype, when you do that you have to deliver or its going to backfire on you in a big way.
---
I had this as well. Take all armor and the fusion core out of the chassis. Drop the chassis on the ground (drop not place) then re enter it and re equip all your armor. Fixed it for me. I think it was the fusion core for some reason.
---
&gt;There needs to be an anti-griefing system
---
Killing a player and stealing their stuff isnt "griefing". If you are going to throw ideas out about how to fix problems, you need to understand the difference between PVP and "grief" play. 
---
The perk card that reduces the weight of energy ammo also reduces the eight of fusion cores. 
---
This asshole-tier justification ironically justifies why there are raider assholes.
---
So...well done I guess :)
---
I bought at launch and really didn't experience many bugs. My gf and I have picked back up playing it this past weekend and have experienced more bugs in two days than I have since launch. Several disconnects, massive lag during nuke events even if not at the zone, creepy power armor morphed bodies, entering power armor but getting stuck while doing so, invisible teammates, camps not rendering to the point of not even being able to enter it (I was literally walking directly through stairs that were showing on gf's game but non-existent on mine), wildly varying ranges on weapon damage for seemingly no reason (no buffs gained/lost), invisible enemies that were only visible to one teammate, vendors not properly reflecting sale prices or the amount of caps they have, dropped items disappearing, rapid respawn of massive groups of enemies (can't say I hate this one, but still broken), items disappearing from inventory after looting, and unending stamina when running. All of that in probably 3-4 hours of play, and I am sure I still missed some.
---
I think that would put the two on par with each other
---
Xbox?
---
Had a super mutant spawn inside a hill when I was defending the Waste Disposal place. I ended up killing it by spamming grenades on the ground above him over and over.
---
When I was that young I played far more violent games... I grew up just fine... I think *shrugs*
---
@OP
---
Funny/adorable convo though. Glad you guide your siblings in the right direction.
---
I've played for 140 hours so far and I feel I've pretty much exhausted all the content the game has to offer so far. It's mind boggling you're at 525 and all solo. 
---
What the heck do you do? LOL
---
-look at ground between legs
---
-open pipboy
---
-drop 1 .38(or other useless item)
---
-if you see a bag, proceed to drop quality item, if not, drop another useless item and repeat this step.
---
Interesting. I've noticed the \~8 people did not shoot at here while she was in the air. I was the only one hitting her up there. I had to so my Vampiric Gatling compesated for my health loss. When she landed, people then started hitting her with explosive weapons (plus melee, I couldn't really see it). Maybe the others were waiting for her to land and thus it took them more than 30 minutes to get her lose 30% -&gt; regen -&gt; lose 50% health?
---
Well you jumped way too high with a Yao Guai.
---
Now you need a deathclaw to sort him out for sure.
---
Then you‚Äôll need scorch beast who on the death claw will feast.
---
Then you need a mirelurk queen to which scorchbeasts are mighty mean.
---
Then you get a cat
---
i drank some and became radiated
---
Always, and I friggin mean always, when in a group, sneak off to someone's base and hide a cat poster.
---
Flamingos and moose painting are also acceptable.
---
I don't know. The state of the game is pretty bad.
---
De-equipping and re-equipping my duster makes me appear again every time, even when multiple allies say I'm invisible. My friend does this with their shirt&amp;jeans outfit and it seems to only work every now and then, and sometimes only reveals them to a select number of us. 
---
Could go on the market and see if anyone duped it
---
There's another atom shop item titled Vault Tec Combat armor, this is the one you should have bought.
---
Lock yourself in a room with strangers for 25 *hours* and tell me you don't want to kill at least some of them afterward.
---
Fallout 76 is trash. Can't apologize for that 
---
i disagree.
---
Rad sponge with friends and u wont need chems im nuke zones either
---
There's a difference between buying a $60 game and a $20,000 car that doesn't have the main essentials to a vehicle.
---
Fallout 76 works. There's bugs, but you can still play it. There's a story, gameplay, exploration, and pretty much everything else you expect in a "RPG", (except choices, since Bethesda is going in a different direction). I can't use a car that doesn't have windows in winter, but I can play Fallout 76 without a hiccup once in awhile.
---
But what about the non-carbon based corpses?
---
Feel OP‚Äôs pain though. I have been using a miners helmet with an bright white light. I like that it illuminates where I‚Äôm aiming and helps me see a lot. 
---
Stay away from bottom or right of map stay towards west part and north until you level up 
---
Ripperoni. Watch the bots though, I bought a L50... oh shit, whats it called... The fire SMG, in watoga yesterday.
---
I didn‚Äôt mean to imply it was sorry mate.
---
With griefing I was literally trying to refer to actual griefing where people kill someone, take their stuff, then stalk them constantly killing them again and again and destroying their camp.
---
Obnoxious seething hatred is the new thing. I am afraid that's just how it is now. Cringey videos and clickbait is financially viable because it feeds out-of-control spiral of hatred. Why would people stop making money? People aren't going to spontaneously start having calm, measured, reasonable responses on their own, and as long as the clicks keep coming and the money keeps flowing, the cycle will continue.
---
&gt; Legendary Wooden Arm with the Weightless legendary perk.  
---
Top-tier for a stealth character.
---
#FUCK FALLOUT 76
---
Get fucked and stay pressed
---
Not sure if it counts but the entry starter edition for final fantasy 14 the mmorpg is $20 and has lots of content by itself without the expansions albeit with a monthly fee of $13 for an entry subscription or $15 for a standard subscription. 
---
It also has a free trial that let's you level all of your classes to lvl 35 on one character so you can try it out for as long as you want until that level cap before you purchase it.
---
Here's where football can come in as an analogy. Some teams complain when the other team runs up the score. The good team's answer? If you want us to stop then do something to stop us from scoring.
---
Aka, if you want to stop hearing the hate then stop searching for it. Also if Bethesda wants to have a good game then do something about it lol.
---
Huh, didn't know it had songs from that late in it, TIL. To be fair though they fit perfectly in with the older stuff though at least to me. I hear what you're saying though.
---
It is a bit tiring. But in a way I might be a little glad about it. Big publishers generally rely on us, the consumers collectively having the memory of a goldfish. And so they shaft us. Backpedal, then shaft us again later. Because there is almost always little to no consequence. 
---
Now hopefully their company and product getting lambasted, and the issues with it not being instantly forgiven and forgotten will encourage some smarter corporate decisions. So if there's any good in all of this, it may be that at least...
---
Personally I'm just a bit bored with the existing content, with PvP being a flaming wreck and having exhausted the PvE content. Also awaiting them fixes.
---
Pc? 
---
This shouldn't be a problem if you have the raw materials to make it instead of bulk materials
---
Original. It's super frustrating.
---
&gt;But holy fuck, guys. I went and looked. Even No Man's Sky didn't get this much obnoxious noise.
---
lol I was here when that car crash went down, people turned up to their offices dude.
---
I'm really sick of people like you, sorry to say it but you support a company that doesn't give a fuck about you rather than your fellow man making noise about a company that should be knee deep in shit and finished by now, the bullshit they've gotten away with over the years because it's expected for them to put out trash all because they cashed in on a story IP that is amazing is fucking stupid.
---
It‚Äôs the same concept as micro transactions.
---
I hate it 
---
Yea.  This works good.  But 1 thing i noticed with TS it doesnt work as good anymore.  
---
My Lever action gets bugged as well and holds about 800 rounds.  I never have to reload.
---
I do. 
---
Shotgun in pvp because I'll just back up and pump once or twice 
---
Where in Watoga?
---
Right, totally agree. The problem on this sub (well, most subs for pvp games) is that the majority of the sub seems to think that any form of pvp is grief play. 
---
People bring it up when discussing other games because it's the current gold standard for failure. It'll be the punching bag until another game dethrones it.
---
I agree with the Three tier perks being wrong... Like Slugger, 1 point is +10%, and each other point is 5%.  So I usually design my melee to only take the first point in each.  So while I only get +30% damage, it only costs me 3 points as apposed to +60% costing 9 points.  
---
Atlas in in early access, has 40-60x more viewers on Twitch at any given time, and costs half this game. Did i mention early access?
---
But most hardcore fallout fans didnt like 4......
---
Like there's actual choice in Bethesda's games.
---
The good ole **a)** Yes **b)** Yes sarcastically **c)** No (secretly meaning yes) **d)** Angry yes.
---
The right side of the map workshops seem to have that chance.
---
I've had it happen at Spruce Knob (tho it kinda bugged and the SB spawned waaaay east closer to like Top of the World), also at Dolly Sods camp, and Berkeley Springs West.  I've also had them do random flybys not associated with defense mission.
---
Yup. Here you go... works great and you can even name your loadouts: [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124)
---
This would be my strategy... Except I have the issue where whatever perk I share gets unshared as soon as I leave the perk screen, so my team gets the benefit of my rad sponge perk, but I don't.
---
Dont worry. They need people like you.
---
They need people like you, so they can point their fuckin' fingers and say "thats the bad guy".
---
Shameless scarface reference. 
---
xbox - play with full 4 person team nightly.  absolutely have invisible players after fast travel/going through load doors constantly.  At least one of us will look naked, one will be invisible, another will be elongated with 1 piece of power armor showing.  LOL.  the visual glitches are hilarious and messy.  invisible is the only one that makes me mad.  
---
last week i was shooting my handmade at enemies but my team mate saw it as bullets coming out of a sledgehammer....took video to show me.  didnt hurt game play so we just kept going.  
---
its almost like the server cant handle us all together
---
I'll buy your prime handmade?
---
Absolutely nothing!  Do whatever you want, and play however you want.  All this gate keeping  is fucking ridiculous!  
---
Int is pretty useless in the long run. For terminals, having certain amounts of int will give you more available guesses. That's it. Int states that you get more stuff from scrapping but I havent seen a difference when going from 10 to 40 int. 
---
Ints sole purpose is increased durability. Basically, just get enough for whatever perks you want.
---
And thats the main problem. It took me hours to find any, no luck at all. I went from the overseers camp down the river to Flatwood, still no luck.
---
I feel like the only change that SPECIAL really needs is just perk loadouts
---
That's dupers causing server crashes. Bethesda needs to figure out how to manage the assholes ruining it for everyone.
---
stay off reddit and don't read people's opinions.
---
Saying that on the 10+ day of a completely unnecessary shut down may have given such attitudes credibility, the same goes for the 40+ days of near nonstop crashes and bugs. Do a really bad job people will continue commenting on the really bad job you've done.
---
yep!  It was very cool when I realized that the reason Charleston is ruined is because of those two.  She went down to raid on the 24th of December, and got caught and thrown in jail.  He blew up the dam the next day  (Christmas), with a mini-nuke.   It's unclear whether the floodwaters killed Rossalyn or not.
---
The jacket is sort of a maroon-red color. That's the one you'll find in the overseer's bedroom and that I found at the high school. Not sure if there's another one. 
---
I don't remember what it says on it.
---
People snipe it for fun, dude. Hunt the bastard down
---
Same thing can happen with the fusion generator because of the attachment point for wires. I run into issues if I put a flat roof above that thing.
---
Glitches aside, didnt they also reuse a lot of assets from Fallout 4 and skyrim? Dont see how there can be much of a graphical improvement if you're using old assets
---
LOL on my list! I shall clear my junk and sacrifice myself for the cause!
---
Did the same with the Blade of Bastet and the Voice of Set two days ago. I wasn't aware that they could be upgraded. :/
---
First the pack Brahmin just fell over dead and then the bot just fell over. Maybe someone was silenced sniping from a distance lol. Never saw anyone 
---
A lot of it comes from people who never even played the game. Just youtuber fanboys. I have run into problems, but none have caused me to mot be able to hop back into what i was doing.  I do feel sorry for someone who launches a nuke then dc or crash.
---
I've accidentally kited SBs into my camp. And one time, into somebody else's camp. Sorry about that, guy, if you're reading this.
---
They sold a full priced game to us that wasnt finished, they deserve all of the hate. If we let developers/publishers get off of the hook with this, itll become a standard. They need to hear our voice, sorry if youre tired of hearing it, but many of us were very unhappy. 
---
No mans sky got worse hate actually. And if this game is the same as all the times I tried to play it then it‚Äôs still unplayable. I‚Äôll have to see if most of the major bugs and problems have been fixed. Aside from the issues at launch this is a great game though. But it was unplayable 
---
I want this for all factions with different stipulations
---
Brotherhood of Steel could be more about turning in laser weapons, technical data, and killing scorchbeasts
---
Free States could be about turning in resources for hoarding as well as killing certain scorched and cryptids
---
Responders could focus on team based play similar to sunbros in Dark Souls
---
Raiders obviously would give rewards for killing others and stealing
---
In fact I would love to see a kind of summoning system like Dark souls. Low level responder is continually attacked by a raider? Call in a BoS member or Responder! Someone is attacking camps in the Mire? Call in a free states memeber? Taking on a SBQ? Call in the Brotherhood of Steel and enclave for help. Clan rewards gained for helping out.
---
Hop Charleston Fire Station weight-room for lead and equip scrap master after running up on any random super mutant camp for steel (recommend Grafton Steel). 
---
In about 20 minutes you can farm enough lead and steel to last a couple sessions. 
---
I mainly use a Gatling gun. Super Duper and Ammosmith are a godsend. 180-360 5mm per craft.
---
Definetely the best legendary effects to get on armor. However, in 200+ hours of playing, I found one that gave me a 20% reduction on junk about 100 hours in, and literally moments ago my second one giving me 20% on food and water. Sadly both were for the left leg, so RIP. They are probably either the rarest of effects, unless I'm just incredibly unlucky!
---
I see this all the time with melee weapons. guy comes up swinging a hammer and its a damn lead pipe or sickle or vice versa.
---
There is a event called PATROL DUTY (and only this event at this location, location has multiple events) at the Eastern Regional Penitentiary. finish the event its kinda a long one both worth it will give you a random plan almost every time (Mostly weapons)
---
DO NOT do this
---
It has "sixteen times the detail"
---
I play unarmed outside nuke zones and 2 handed inside nuke zones. You might get lucky or buy a melee weapon with swing speed or my personal favorite instigating. With instigating I can one punch everything except SB SBQ death claws and mirelurk queens. And lets talk about never needing ammo. Also vats teleporting can seriously help you traversing too. I can skip entire floors by jumping and hitting vats next to the enemy I pop up right behind them. 
---
I caught my sniper let me tell you. I took his sixty caps for my time
---
At least Bethesda has been active on social media and such. NMS's team and creator just disappeared for a few weeks after the games launch. Plus NMS got a ton of shit for the not sending review copies out because they knew people would be cancelling pre-orders left and right if they saw what the game "had to offer" at that point. 
---
At least you got to keep the stuff ! That‚Äôs my plans for the night then üòÇüòÇ
---
Aight I'll try that 
---
All Hail Mr. Pebbles! Had a friend cover the entrance to my base in them at one point, it's simply the best art in game. 
---
I'd prefer to have the "Notes" tab back - you should be able to click on a note, read it, and the text is saved into that tab. 
---
They tell us about the game not being able to track large numbers of items, but then don't put a feature that they had in previous games that takes read items and stores them in a way that doesn't need global tracking. That's FO76 developers in a nutshell right there.
---
Seriously, this past weekend, see 3-5 mixed lvl teens to 160+ huddled in a corner of the map or by vault 76, then suddenly lag waves over and over, every 15 seconds a new lagspike and getting the "controls disconnected due to network instability" or w.e message. 
---
Duping needs to go away in a hurry. 
---
Maxed out my vendor sale caps from a 10 cap bounty once. He was pissed. Turned up in my camp as I was bulking it all, screaming at me.
---
I don't think it'd be that demanding.  You simply draw a line from all the free spots the player is able to travel from to their destination.  If those lines are longer then the line from where the player is currently at then they go directly to their destination, otherwise, you use whatever the shortest line is from the available free spots.
---
Yea, I got the t-51 jet pack from him as well.
---
Last time I‚Äôve heard a voice was back on day one of the beta , I‚Äôve muted the fuck outta everyone 
---
It automatically makes a blueprint of everything connected to or sitting on a foundation and puts it in your Stored tab when you move your camp. Other stuff like plants and purifiers will also get stored, but individually, so you have to place those again.
---
Uh no.  I now go dead center as it stops lvl 20s from hiding in the shack and only coming out to tag the queen.  
---
If you can't handle the radiation then don't bother coming.
---
LMAO, I got a bad feeling about this.
---
Are you accusing gamers of being hard to please and whining! Bethesda did poorly sir well all i did was exaggerate it, how dare you attack me with truths! (I also love sea of thieves nowadays, game is fun as hell)
---
Seems about right. I was lucky to find these 3-star legendaries after grinding Whitesprings forever....no explosive weapons found to date though. :(
---
Did you not see the majestic horse testicle physics?
---
Thanks you too!  Xbox?  I‚Äôm on there often
---
The main roads is where he spawns. I built my camp on one and waited till he came by,  took a long time
---
1. Starched Genes lvl 2 perk (Luck perk at level 30)
---
2. Store your junk and die intentionally a few times (I did this from level 12-31 because I had marsupial and couldn't live without it)
---
3. Sun-kissed (during the day) or Rad Sponge (on a team). Both are perks with specific terms
---
DO NOT use a decontamination shower or radaway 
---
At least Youtuber's is making money
---
As a person who doesn't necessarily find fallout 76 to be worth the money they spent on it, I find people who rant about the hate to be a bit cringe themselves. 
---
I wish I could edit the title.
---
I agree that it's easy to get sucked into the general toxicity around the game, and that can detract from actually enjoying it. I play this game a lot, because I do enjoy it for the most part, but MY GOD the number of gameplay affecting bugs is staggering. I've personally encountered:
---
- Hard client crashes and disconnects (which are most likely server crashes). Together these total about 2-6 times a day I potentially can lose all quest/event progress.
---
- Stuck water filter that permanently takes up camp budget
---
- Item duplication when moving camp (up to 100% of last camp if the stored blueprint is duped. Generally have to scrap all extra just to get under 100% to build anything new)
---
- Can't exit power armor bug
---
- Game state gets bugged so that you can't view any quest info (data shows no active quests)
---
- Corpses straight-up disappearing
---
- Enemies returning to 100% health when shot. (really fun with 3* legendaries)
---
Not even considering the tons of QoL stuff that just sucks or otherwise really needs improvement, or the cheats and bugs that people are abusing that crash the servers in the first place. And all this in a full-price AAA title. So yeah, it's a lot of fun to play but can also be really frustrating, and I think it's important for people to know just how bad it has been, and especially for Bethesda to know. I'm glad they've been slowly fixing things, but this is all honestly stuff that should have been ironed-out pre-release.
---
Upvote for the f Trump.
---
Subnautica alone is proof. I mean, that game is a fucking masterpiece. Factorio would be another example too though if we had to give one. 
---
To be fair, Dunkey never made a vid about it. I at first wanted him to, but I think he and Leah foresaw the hate wagon that was going to be unloading on it by everyone else and stayed away from it, and rightfully so imo, else I may have had a similar opinion of his channel as you seem to whilst I fell in love with the game. 
---
Even tho I'm only level 76, the game is fun as hell so far and I'm not stopping anytime soon, despite some of the problems which to be fair, haven't been major issues with me. Bugs or glitches, outside of the nuke at the turn of the year, I just said meh and moved on to the next thing, and that next thing typically worked. 
---
TLDR; my fave YouTuber didnt and I'm glad he didn't hate on this game I now love like everyone else. 
---
Haha smart man! Knows where all his customers are
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.

There is a pristine tri fold American flag on top of a cabinet in the "presidential" room at Whitesprings (the room where you get the sword for the Order of Mysteries quest)
---
Nope, leave the world while inside, you'll find yourselves outside on rejoining.
---
I went and solo'd Site Bravo and launched my first nuke last night. Teamed for the mutation perks and was in party chat. Quest completes a d nuke goes up. I fast travel to whitesprings to enjoy my reward. 
---
Teammate says, 'hey dude I lagged out.".... "Oh no, it says teammates world cannot be found." 
---
I'm like no worries, I'm still in the loading screen. 
---
2 minutes later. 'Server Disconnected'
---
WTF Bethesda. .. why u no liek me??
---
So fuck them too. I'll talk all the shit I want.
---
If only someone hadn't already built such a thing for games on this very engine...
---
The real question is, what were you doing to the robot to get them?...
---
never seen that one coming. 
---
I think there is a difference between the average Raider Gang and griefers, but I think I'm both biased and in the minority...
---
Most raider gangs would take prisoner, extract "tolls" or "protection" fees, etc.. Because a dead mark only pays once..
---
Solo raiders as psyco's I by, but the average griefer in '76 is just that, a griefer, and calling them a raider is a disservice...
---
Hell I've got a couple new in game friends that keep trying to RP raiders and extract tolls, sell drugs, and generally do "Raidery" things and no one will play along..
---
When I was doing the Brotherhood quests, there was a camp southeast of Watoga with a few Col. Gutsies and Robobrains. I tried to sneak up and activate the beacon, and a scorchbeast showed up, so I just hid behind the tent and they murdered the shit out of the scorchbeast.
---
I don't know what to tell you. This conversation happened this morning. ü§∑
---
They both have birthdays coming up this month so they'll be 12 and 10. I think they're smart and mature for their ages but I figure I'm biased. üòâ
---
&gt; being hunted is one of my most enjoyable things to do
---
Then you get one-shotted by some guy with a explosive instigating black powdered rifle and realize it isn't worth it.
---
Maybe just maybe it's not overblown and you are in the minority in enjoying the Vidya game. Maybe you should, and I do not intend to offend, but calm your tatas and enjoy the game. 
---
People are allowed their opinions. 
---
that is true...location/location/location
---
OMG Yes it is
---
It won't stop.. this game is amazing and I've already put over 500 hours into it.. noobs can hate on it as much as they like it's not gonna stop me from playing what is currently "THE BEST GAME IN THE FUCKING WORLD NOOBS!!!" .... that's my opinion 
---
Yesterday I did a power plant event with a friend. Then the world server crashed and we lost our progress. 
---
Naw bruh the game is pretty fucking busted.
---
I got a bunch of plans from a new years bomb drop  and literally after I picked it up and opened my inventory the game crashed. I lost the resources and the game rolled back to before I picked up the plans. NADA. 
---
Watch Juicehead and ReviewtechUsa video is going to make a video about the post
---
Right, common stuff. I'm talking about without moving your camp though. I'll edit and specify in the main post. 
---
Get weapon artisan and repair it to 200%
---
Get al rifleman perks and anti tank for armour penetration.
---
Get demolition perks to increase damage and increase spread.
---
Shoot mob at distance and watch them all die...then spend 30 seconds reloading.
---
I play on pc, otherwise I would in a heart beat!
---
Waited?  Did set up a chair?  Lol.  I think I'll wander the roads, I just feel like I'll be walking and he will probably be on the other side somehow.  
---
Yeah took some of the spotlight
---
You can even sell loose junk but most stuff just isn't worth anything so I just leave it in Flatwoods for some noobs to find it. 
---
Well it's not just on the game but PS4s team chat too. 
---
I mean, does it matter this much? It‚Äôs not a great game, and if it bothers you this much then just  look at other subreddits, sure the circle jerk can be annoying, but damn. 
---
What system? 
---
It could just be that they've been covered in goop that contains the diseases and thats what you're getting infected with. That makes the most logical sense to me.
---
Nah i kept playing and he just came along. I just used my camp a lot at the time.
---
&gt;@OP Funny/adorable convo though. Glad you guide your siblings in the right direction.
---
Haha! I thought so too.
---
&gt;When I was that young I played far more violent games... I grew up just fine... I think. shrugs
---
Yeah, and they play with my parents and uncle so they're not unsupervised. They're smart kids. ü§∑
---
That's fine. Let there be "Raiders." But stay away from me and my game. I'm an adult and dont feel the need to be dealing with childish individuals.
---
Yes I know its "part" of the game blah blah blah, but it childish and annoying. When it comes my way I just server hop and continue about my day/game. 
---
If a person has nothing better to do with their time than to "roleplay" as a raider, so be it. They can do what they want, but like I said stay away from me and if you bother me you wont get far as I'll just disconnect and jump into a new server.
---
Naturally, there are multiple regions. Also, naturally there people blaming the game for their own shitty internet. It's hard to tell. 
---
Me. I have very minimal connectivity issue - no more than any other online games I play would have. 
---
No one gives a shit avout Fallout 76 anymore. It crashed, it burned, it faded into obscurity like all failed products should.
---
I just straight out sold the Voice of Set ... its not very good.
---
You can select the free standing objects to be included with the foundation based blueprints.  
---
Heck!  Well happy adventuring to you anyway. üòÅ

I love how every excuse defending bad game mechanics is "because it's a survival game". I could care less if it is or not, it still means it's a crappy experience for players.
---
If that doesn't work you should just grab a new chassis 
---
Try the laser splitter so it might end up being like how TSE shotguns work, maybe. Laser weapons do really piss poor damage.
---
Hey man sorry I just saw this message if you still need help getting a couple suits message me on xbox. I'll be on tonight but not tomorrow
---
Beats taking a level 135 down to 10% and get disconnected never to rejoin that world again.
---
Seriously.. what gives?  Doing 'Heart of the Enemy' quest yesterday, and about 1 hour into it I DC from server.   I was at the final part (trying for spoiler free here), and walking up to where you literally finish the quest... no sh\*t..  I do not see the quest marker.   Go into the 'Daily' quest tab and it isn't there anymore...  Nothing like starting over.  Every time I fast traveled until quest completion I cringed.
---
For a while, I had a camp on top of the cliffs to the south of the train station by Top of the World (Pleasant Valley Station?). About halfway between the train station and Beckwith Farm.
---
I never saw any creatures hanging around, and it had a great view:

Enter the Gungeon isn‚Äôt one with a lot of content but has hours of gameplay and tons of replay ability. 
---
&gt;cute things, scary things, and funny things. 
---
YES.
---
It's never dull around here and we wouldn't know what to do without 'em. 
---
OwO
---
Added PSA: don‚Äôt build your camp at that pond. It won‚Äôt allow the trigger to work. 1/3 times you server hop there‚Äôs a camp there. 
---
Exact same thing I noticed, thanks!
---
I take everything so bodies disappear.
---
Then drop what I don‚Äôt want to carry or scrap into containers 
---
Did you have a system for acquiring all the mutations you wanted?
---
Is there an update to this master list or is this the latest?
---
Bet he regretted that üòÇ you know what is really annoying is all the damn camps at that pond. I seriously want to take each base out I see there because it doesn‚Äôt allow a bot spawn 
---
Perfect, this is the kind of raiding I am ok with. At least I get a warning and a decision on how to handle it. üòÖ
---
Even with a camp there? I always run down and back and have never spawned anything when someone has a camp there.
---
Yup 
---
Have you ever met a person before? Some of them are straight fucking nuts and are only not eating your eyeballs because the boys in Blue would shoot them. 
---
Furthermore in a less negative opinion of humanity, people react poorly to times of crisis and will quickly do whatever they think they need to do to survive.
---
If it's level 50 I'd love to replace it.
---
No you gotta find a server with no camp
---
Well it IS awful.
---
You just said a lot of things that point to the fact the game is bad but can‚Äôt handle the fact that shit talking comes with the territory of being a bad game. 
---
Grab your ankles and kiss your ass goodbye.
---
Game state is bad.
---
Bethesda is messing up way more than they need to.
---
Some of the hate is needed. 
---
But most is unneeded.
---
(I stopped playing the game but still follow)
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure I just got one two days ago when I was last on. Idk if I censored it or not lol
---
Hadn't seen that, but I guess "unforseen bugs and issues always come up" means "we'll be porting bugs over from the fo4 game engine as well as tons of stuff we never bothered to fix because people just made mods"
---
Hopefully once kingdom hearts 3 is here most things will blow over.
---
Deposit your junk. Go check it out. I often time just give all my overflow junk and ammo to low level players. If he decides to start greifing you or trying to make you hit the base for a bounty just log out and switch lobbies. 
---
Ah, the other definition of "duped". Was confused for a second
---
Most players I've run into any genuinely nice and genuinely do have good stuff to give you. If you're worried, drop your favorite junk at a communal stash (e.g. in a Red Rocket) and then head over. Because the worst he can do is kill you and take your junk.
---
Also, be careful if they offer trades. Most people just drop bags which are pretty safe, but some people are quick to add things to trades I've heard. That said, a level 126 player can go farm legendary guns in nuke zones anytime and would have little incentive to steal. I wouldn't worry too much.
---
Lol, I went to his camp and that's the weird thing. He packed up and it disappeared leaving me glitching all over the place. 
---
Now he's messaging me saying I need to fast travel to his new location to see his other camp and he'll give me an even better weapon! 
---
...still didn't get the first one?
---
HIve mind is always going to jump on the bandwagon. Meanwhile, i'm having fun smashing things with a powerfist and watching them explode into a bloody mess.
---
I'm a huge fan of the old games, 76 is a massive departure from everything that made fallout great to me - but I don't care, i'm still having fun.
---
it could be better, it could have still included the heavy decision making / dynamic and changing story Arc's and mechanics to support solid RP.
---
But it didn't.. Oh well - still fun though :D
---
I continue to ignore those telling me not to have fun, not to enjoy the game because it's bad!
---
Because the reality of the situation is, I'm still logging in most days to smash things in the face with my buds.
---
Coming from someone who likes silly cosmetics here and there, I completely agree that this is needed. 
---
Post apocalyptic and dystopian settings are my absolute favorite and I want to be able to indulge in that fully. I absolutely love the idea of skull helmets from different enemies and even outfits made from their hides that maybe give different bonuses. I want to look like a savage warrior that has digressed back into the primitive tribal state as I feast on corpses and run around with my speed demon/marsupial mutations swinging an ax or something. 
---
Not much more to say here. You make a great point. 
---
Tbh, they did lie about the game features
---
Looking for speed demon, healing factor.  
---
Have about 1000 caps on me for now, materials, and some gear if need.  
---
&gt;Even No Man's Sky didn't get this much obnoxious noise.
---
Bethesda isn't some no name developer that got in over their head. This is everyone's big dig at Fallout 76. 
---
You can check my post history if you want, but I tried to be as positive as can be the first month or so. Defending the game and looking through the faults for as long as I could. 
---
But end point, Fallout 76 deserves all the hate it's getting. The way Bethesda marketed the game, the way they refused refunds, the canvas bag ordeal, the leaking of user information, the Nuka dark or w/e. etc. 
---
Bethesda has made it abundantly clear now, that this game may have started development with good intentions, but has ended as a cash grab. There is no excuse for a developer such as Bethesda, to release a game on consoles that does not properly work with the hardware for longer than 4 hours. Taking off the "fanboy glasses" and "I didn't just buy a shitty game for $60" Kevlar vest. 
---
This game is garbage. Are there redeeming factors. No. 
---
Are there aspects that can be fun for a short while, yeah. 2 months in and I'm done. Sucks, I really wanted to like this game. And yeah, I got a decent bit of hours out of it. But was it really fun that whole time or was I looking for the fun and that's what propelled me further. 
---
Honestly, that's probably the best thing about this game. How close that feeling is to a real post apocalyptic setting. 
---
We navigate a bleak and desolate landscape hoping to find any semblance of the world we had been promised. 
---
I'm guessing they don't play melee build. If so, maybe don't tell them about the Party Boy/Girl perk.
---
Why would you care? Like if you really really like the game why do you need other people to validate your opinion. Complaining about other people complaining about a video game is one of the most childish endeavours one can pursue. Just be happy that you find joy in the game and ignore the hate train if itnbotherw you so much. It's also pretty darn ironic to try to invalidate what the majority think about the game. It's an opinion about a video game and while I'm sure fallout 76 fans feel like they have it rough, you have to realize that fallout fans think the same thing about themselves.
---
Tl dr; vast majority of people think the game is poopy and they have every reason to think so, just as anyone who think the game is 100% awesomesauce can think that. Neither side should try to invalidate the other's opinions because it's stupid and subjective 
---
I mean I enjoy the game, but it‚Äôs still kinda shit and needs to be fixed.
---
Oh yes. I always steal from them... 
---
Damn you caught me it's all a lie! 
---
I agree. But you Already have a perk 'Travel Agent' to down the costs. Plus a little smart placement of your camp goes a very long way. 
---
And Lets not forget the workshop make for yet an other possible free fast travel point. 
---
If all this doesn't alowing you to 'figuring out the most effectieve way' I don't believe you have tought this over right. 
---
There are plenty of thing I love Bethesda to take an other tought about. But this isn't one IMO. 
---
Exactly. Every discussion about 2018 vaguely mentions Bethesda as the Big Bad of the Year, despite there being bigger offenders (like RDR2 Online MTX schemes or R\* employee exploitation). Even discussions about Activision-Blizzard being the new EA (which is itself ridiculous) keep mentioning how Bethesda is even worse. And yet, most of the time they are very vague in what exactly is the wrong thing. If they mention something, it's something that is still not worse than the average of the gaming industry. Basically the average gamer got the idea that "Bethesda = bad" but they didn't even bother finding out why. It basically became a big online hoax.
---
Oh I meant to hang on my wall
---
Would also be awesome if atom shop items counted as bare minimum cost to budget.... my budget is maxed out so there's very little I'm buying unless budget is expanded or rebalanced... of if they bless me by removing this cursed large water purifier from my stored
---
Luckily spaghetti boyism mostly affects canines it seems!

Anti armour perks and receivers will do it.

Lever action in particular.

Better if you can get anti armour legendary too.

No messy explosion.

If you're a raider then I guess I'm superman. Thanks, passive mode.
---
That said, we need PvP/PvE servers.
---
TAKE THE RICHES ACCEPT THE POSSIBLE DEATH YOU HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE!
---
Moving camp is the reasonable solution for this.  The whole point of the camp system is to get the players immersed within the world (either by building or coming across other player camps). A few caps is a fair trade to work around this and not have to change the games model for every single player.
---
This. If you're someone who would spend money on a fancy power armor skin, and someone who doesn't care about a duped weapon, which would you choose? A tiny 4 post bed that does nothing for you or an OP end game weapon?
---
THANK YOU, jesus it‚Äôs absolutely exasperating, the circle jerk is out of control
---
Super rare, unless you have a good RNG seed, did him 100 times in one day and managed to get one good plan.
---
Does the game have issues? Yes
---
Are they crippling? No
---
Admittedly I don‚Äôt recall Destiny having anything like the connection problems like 76 does. But Destiny broke things up into much smaller areas. And there was a lot less to do in Destiny. I completed the core story and first two expansions in a few weeks. After two months I was so bored with the game. I never did anything with a team that wasn‚Äôt automatically assigned.
---
Fallout 76 has some work to do, but I‚Äôd play this than Any of the other games I have access to.
---
Yes and this game is rated M-17+. 
---
stop, im already running into problems having to switch servers
---
Jesus that‚Äôs insane
---
 explosive legendary affix is not applying properly for energy weapon. 
---
I agree. The point of a money grab is to put in the least amount of effort possible for the most amount of profit. They have successfully done this with not only their game but their other FO76 memorabilia. The reason Gaming Companies keep getting away with this same garbage is because people "STOP" talking about it. So it fades into the background giving them the opportunity to do it again. EA is a perfect example of this producing games like Madden , FIFA, Battle Field, Battlefront, is HOT DOG SHIT and has been getting worse every year but that community has been so accepting, noncommittal, and quiet for so long that this is the games they have to play now, They use to make great games but once they started to fuck up people were just like this, "I'm tired of the hate" "Other companies have bad launches" "Shut up already we get it" apparently they don't get it, we have seen this happen before but you want to stay silent. 
---
Bethesda already has our money and now are slow rolling fixes for things that shouldn't have made it to the final product. I get people are tired of the constant hate but they deserve it as well as we need to stand up for ourselves, we are the ones with the power not the billion dollar companies that keep serving us up hyped pieces of trash. If we stay quiet the gaming community will be plagued with games like the Dumpster Fires EA gives.
---
I‚Äôve been playing SWGOH for years and that shit‚Äôs free.
---
Perfect Storm. Good gun but i was dumb and got it at level 15 :/ so it's useless for me.
---
Judged it as lame based on exterior. Saw the inside. Realized initial judgement was wrong. Extrapolated and reconsidered entire life's worth of snap judgement. Existential crisis.
---
Thanks for the knowledge drop. Never knew there was plans for that along with it being at that vendor! 
---
Did you notice the reference to Fallout 1 though? They included the Super Mutants.
---
Its sad how bad launches and unfinished product are becoming the norm, it seam like it's happening a lot more in the past few years with the defence of "oh the Devs are working on it"
---
The problem with "on existing object" is that when you place things down, the game has a kind of "calculation order" on what to be placed first to last. The problem is, certain objects can be placed on certain objected but when they game recalculates replacement, it does so vice versa and trigger the error. 
---
Rugs are very usual culprit for this. When you build your camp, you place a rug first and then other things on top. But usually you can't place rugs once you place your furniture. See the problem? If you have furniture on your rugs, when you move camp, the furnitures will attempt the place first, then the rugs bug out and now you can't place anything.  
---
Was it named Fisto?
---
Yep. No matter where I see No Mans Sky mentioned, this comment comes up. I still play no mans from time to time and enjoy it, but over 3 years later and theres still hate for it. 76 hate will never go away, just enjoy the game if you can.
---
If you lead the shot slightly, it's actually not that hard
---
This game is by no means what some hoped for but I agree that the hate it‚Äôs receiving is absolutely ridiculous. I happen to enjoy the game.  Many have been wanting a multiplayer fallout for a while. Bethesda, being known for narrative, single player games, listened to a majority of their player base and actually attempted something out of their comfort zone. Yes the ridiculous market tactics were scummy, but look at companies like Daybreak and EA and then try to tell me Bethesda is money hungry. And as for the bugs and glitches: This is a HUGE game. All big games, ESPECIALLY multiplayer ones, come with a lot of bugs in the beginning. While they could‚Äôve waited a bit for release, they pushed out a product that was unfinished. That‚Äôs a mistake I can forgive them for, because I KNOW that Bethesda, judging from past games, is going to fix the product and add content. And all of the people saying that this is a disgrace of a fallout game and not the sequel they wanted, they should maybe realize that Bethesda said that this was not an official part of the series, rather a new experience, and they should wait on the next one that‚Äôs still being developed. I like fallout 76, and I want to see it go far, but people who have never played the game are ruining the reputation. It‚Äôs to the point where I can‚Äôt even suggest it to a friend without hearing,‚Äù I heard that it was horrible online.‚Äù I fear that a good game with great potential is going to die and be taken down due to people hopping on the hate train. 
---
"Psh, nothing personnel kid." \*fast travels away\*
---
The only time my friends and I notice an unusually empty server is when it's getting late and we've been on for several hours, it seems like they try not to put new players in servers that have been going awhile. Could be wrong tho.
---
But since it‚Äôs a AAA company, they can fix the bugs quicker and more efficiently. 
---
The game is FAR worse than anyone is complaining about
---
Should have a every single copy thrown in a volcano
---
It's a great idea to take the first rank of perks because they're multiplicative with each other and everything else. You're actually getting 33.1% more damage for 3 points or 72.8% more damage for 9 points.
---
I do the same with Slugger, because melee isn't my main focus but it's still good to be able to one-shot nuisance monsters without wasting ammo.
---
PEOPLE DON'T LIKE WHAT I LIKE!?! Better post a massive copypasta about how I love bethesda and it breaks my little heart that everyone is being mean to them.
---
Same deal as destroying the cores. Look for them scattered around (or fix broken cores at a bench, if you have those), and then go up to a computer and you should be prompted to install your cores. You'll need 15, if I recall correctly.
---
But a select structure/multiple items and store function seems pretty useful. 
---
"Explore Appalachia for 7600 hours" 20 atoms

Just walking to the Phoenix vendor from the train station i frequently run into a legendary protectron. Totally worth running around a bit to see what's there, haven't noticed anyone doing this. Super casual if you did the gaia quest that makes the watoga robots stop attacking you on sight. 
---
This is a good point. Ever since they nerfed the Mirelurk Queen's spit the only things that can take a bite out of my ass are Col gutsies yet it sounds like they are shooting a pipe gun at me
---
Now y'all understand how no man's sky fans felt
---
No worries that's the exact reason I posted :)
---
Glad to help.
---
Scrap and Bulk all junk, sell all bulk stacks past 10 and all non-bulkables past 100.  It‚Äôs a decent way to make caps and it‚Äôll fix your problem.  Good luck!
---
Yup this is it! Hard to kill... Amusing to watch... For a while. Spaghetti dog seems like an appropriate name. 
---
Still don't know what exactly causes them to happen, was hoping someone more in the know than me would just know it straightaway :/ Seems like something to do with the engine based on the above convo
---
I did that the first few nights then realized as long as I gasket for donations that I‚Äôd end up with enough supplies. 
---
Aside from being hard as fuk, and getting disconnected from the servers occassionally,  my kids and I are having a blast playing Fallout 76.  Don't know what everyone is fussing about. My only complaints are that some online players are dicks.  Especially when they are stronger than me.  As a true fan of the Fallout series this is another fun adventure.  
---
Damn. Thanks for the tip. That would have helped. I made it out safely but it was a wild ride. 
---
Agree. I am the hater btw and I think that the reason many people and I still find it fun to hate on (not really hate on, but just shitting on this game for fun which in turn provide incentives for some youtubers to make shitty videos about this controversy) is because of posts like this. 
---
People enjoy these kind of salty rants and this post just adds like another month of fo76 hate train ride. Welp, at least it will be entertaining for me regardless. 
---
Maybe I'm missing something, but I've only seen one PA, and all the enemies are violent. Unless your definition of Watoga is much larger than mine.
---
Are you serious?
---
I feel like yongyea is only making vids about fallout 76 or Bethesda..... I just miss TB
---
You're gold, I set gsync+vsync in nvidia CP and run fullscreen of course, medium textures and everything else low except certain fade options like actor and object fade
---
Cool stop by the clinic. My fallout name and reddit name are the same. 
---
I get what you mean... but I don't think your going to get much traction with your no chit-chat, chat.  You may be better off joining a popular discord and putting up with chit chat (may be the only social outlet for some). 
---
Yes, last couple of days have been bad for me on my XBOX. 
---
There's a mod for that. It alleviates the inconveniences of lock-picking and crafting (assuming you don't forget to switch load-outs...) but doesn't enable any perks that aren't focused directly on damage.
---
Sounds like arty, big boom with maybe 1-2m splash.
---
That mindset is exactly the reason why I don't think that Bethesda or Zenimax will change. I can understand it getting tiring to only hear about how bad the game was at launch, but the reason is because people want publishers (and the more important investors) to know that when games are bad, we make it known that they're bad. It dissuades people from buying the game. FO76 needs to be the disaster that it is to show the bigwigs that when you just push out a game early or unfinished, people will notice and force the game into the ground. FO76 may have had some fixes coming it's way, but it won't ever be enough to make up for a company as renowned as Bethesda for pushing out an incomplete bug filled mess. The post-launch anti-consumer decisions with nylon bags and plastic bottles for very expensive products was just the icing on Bethesda's shitty cake of bad decisions. Regardless of how people talk about the game, don't feel bad to have fun with it, just because a large majority say it's bad doesn't mean you can't have fun. If you truly like the game and enjoy your purchase, that's great. The large majority of buyers and players did not though, so the game needs to fail. Only to be a message to Bethesda, Zenimax, and other large game developers and publishers, that the consumers will NOT accept a half-baked product.
---
Click the Edit by your username, and then be annoyed because it only shows half the flairs.
---
The game is fully balanced around PvE at the moment so PvE isn't really fun if youre the type that likes a fair fight.
---
This man is woke. 
---
Even though they did, it's just PR damage control for releasing an unfinished game. Actually sounds more and more like they had a pretty good idea of how bad it was going to be.
---
If your on mobile, click the 3 dots st the top of the sub---&gt;change user flair

What about the diseased protectrons that spawn in Watoga? :)
---
Apparently they're all shiny and new.
---
I use batteries included at rank 2 because it's crazy how heavy fusion cores get.
---
Aight.  Ill should be on by 6-6:30 EST if thats cool.  
---
Thank you very much
---
People just love to hate, most of the hate probably comes from people that haven't actually played it. 
---
I own the game but uninstalled it today because of lack of free HDD space, I'm confident Bethesda will keep improving the game. 
---
Given time and I'll get back to it later, I enjoyed the previous Fallout installments, Bethesda deserve better. 
---
Now go and do what HelloGames did to NMS! 
---
IT'S LEGAL IN MOST NON-EU COUNTRIES!
---
Anything to be pissy about.
---
I had 15 then it showed I had zero
---
The Problem is that it‚Äôs always Reclamation day, so things can‚Äôt change. :P
---
can confirm that jetpack was purchased 3 days ago at enclave bunker at command center vendor.  it didnt show for me or another teammate - but team mate 3 saw it (we were all there same time) and bought it for me!  luckily he wont give up his excavator armor so he was happy to grab/resell it to me.    Side note - cant paint the jetpack so it wont be colored like an ATOM skin if you have one.
---
Also, in the science/medical area of the enclave bunker you can purchase mutation serums.  i believe these give you the beneficial effects of the mutation only.  they are typically 3400 or 3600 caps.  you will want maxed out Starched Genes perk though so it doesn't cure when you take rad away
---
Your fix worked but only after I removed my armored bos jumpsuit and did your steps
---
I have no idea who actually would argue weight reduction perks are terrible.... I play with a wide range of people/levels. Ranging from 240+ to fresh spawns. Not a single person has argued against: Pack Rat, Bandoleer, etc. The only way I'd image the argument going is I would rather have a BUNCH of perks for additional DPS. My rebuttal I guess you just want to not be able to carry anything or walking everywhere lol.
---
2 hours later nothing 
---
If you complete "Mayor for a Day", all the robots in Watoga don't initiate combat with you unless you attack them; there is also a high chance for a legendary in the Watoga Emergency Center; I'd recommend checking there!
---
I had that once in fo4 but only when I was sneaking. Made my sneaking build shit
---
i considered that but i eventually just limited myself to like 6 cores at a time.  despite sprinting and using my jetpack all the time, i never seem to run out.
---
What is this, roleplaying in a Fallout game? In 2019? Unheard of.
---
&gt;No Mans sky didnt get as much hate
---
Yes it did
---
a bad guy with a nuke can only be stopped by a good guy with a nuke
---
Bingo.  Once they solve this, a good 75% of the crashes will go away.  Then they can focus on refinement.
---
You Bethesda fanboys are still crying about this shitty game in here? Just drop it already. Go play Red Dead or Fortnite like everybody else and just give it a rest, literally nobody gives a shit about Fallout 76 at this point, it‚Äôs been universally accepted as a complete and total failure of a game and it really just needs to die already so Bethesda can learn their lesson and go back to working on games that their players actually fucking want to play: single player open world RPGs. 
---
Bring on the downvotes, they don‚Äôt mean anything anyways. 
---
Been doing it for about 2 hour an hour after this post and before 
---
i dont think they have given them yet?  
---
If they have, I would guess use bethesda launcher.  
---
Login with the email you have set up when you first started the game on ps4  
---
Ahh, that explains a lot ;)

---
I have a problem and have 30. Maybe I should cut down.
---
Yes, I have a vampiric gatlin plasma. It isn't the best, and it breaks quick as hell (even with perks), but it's fun to use.
---
Don't be an apologist for a corporate entity too stupid and greedy to make something worth playing. They don't give a fuck about you beyond how much you spend in the atom shop. 
---
I guess I don't understand how a larger number in the "quantity" column for that line of code is enough to lag the server.   
---
When you loot a stack of 1,000 it's not processing 1,000 lines of code, it's just running 1 line of code with a "1000" in the "quantity" column versus a "1," right?  If it handled it any other way there would be a huge, huge delay any time you moved large stacks, and there simply is not, at least with ammo or steel (biggest stacks I have).
---
If you could elaborate a bit more I'd really appreciate it!  I always thought the stash WT limit was so they could milk us for Atoms.  And why is it limited by WT?  Surely the most impact on their server is how many unique lines of code you have in your stash, so if you had 1000 unique items versus a single stack of 1000, I promise the guy with a single stack of 1000 is better/easier on the server yet he's blowing the WT limit.  
---
If I play for 60 minutes I will crash to desktop at least twice, and get disconnected from the server another 2-3 times. This is unacceptable. This game wasn't marketed as a beta, or "early access".
---
I'm not duping, or exploiting, or hacking, or modifying the game files, I'm just trying to play but large portions of the game are inaccessible to me because of the crashes and disconnects. 
---
Launching a nuke? Inaccessible. Running a nuked zone? Inaccessible. I'm guaranteed to crash shortly after the first time I enter any nuke zone. The **only** way I can experience that content is in a party with someone else so that I can re-join back onto them.
---
Workshops? Inaccessible. I crash or disconnect entirely too often to earn any appreciable amount of resources from them.
---
What's exhausting is all the people telling me to shut up, that my problems are lies or that I'm somehow causing them. I tell people to steer clear of this game not just for its problems, but it's "no criticism allowed" community who is quick to accuse or blame you for voicing criticisms about any problems the game absolutely does have.
---
sure.  FYI - they EAT fusion cores...i use to maybe go through 1-2 in a several hour play session....now i will go through 3-4 in a single session and I have the perk that doubles your fusion core use.
---
Yes, but can we buy them from him?
---
Or do you lot own them due to Ts&amp;Cs already?
---
If you ask me, it should never stop. 
---
Gaming companies became greedy to an impossible point. Seems to me that they understand that their greedy practices won't fly for too long, and everybody is trying to cash in as much as possible before the ship sinks. 
---
Fallout 76 came out of nowhere, and it was advertised as it was something revolutionary coming. What we got was obvious asset flip that probably got scrambled in few months.
---
Everybody should be hating this kind of stuff as long as possible. Its a disgrace what they tried to do.
---
No idea then. Maybe a scorchbeast sprays them? 
---
Cant find anything to support your claims, got a link to a source?
---
Damn I'm PS4 well nothing to do about that I guess.
---
Just keep making them and scraping them and you'll keep unlocking mods. Takes quite a few though.
---
Not dumb, but would like a simpler version.  Just a box that I can build not connected to my stash (if they already exists, my bad).  I know I can just drop stuff into the overseers cache, by my group likes to share plans and ammo, would be nice if we could all just dump or grab from one container.
---
:0 
---
I couldn‚Äôt tell, there wasn‚Äôt a lot of other players at white springs at the time but the only other one that was there didn‚Äôt seem to be running around crazed like I was so maybe it only was occurring for me. 
---
Absolutely. For handguns and shotguns, the ammo is pretty light, but mini-nukes weigh around 3 to 5 pounds each, missiles are a couple pounds each, flares 0.1 pounds each... Check it out on the ammo screen. 
---
Haha you‚Äôre hilarious. Yeah, let there be ‚ÄúRaiders‚Äù in a Fallout game. There‚Äôs a game called Farming Simulator you might like, there‚Äôs a new DLC coming out this year that‚Äôs supposedly the bees knees. Completely Raider free. Lmao 
---
And ‚Äúpart‚Äù of the game? Dude, it IS part the game. There‚Äôs perk cards that specifically add more damage to player structures. There are guns that are meant to do more damage to players. 
---
Not gonna say what game to play but uh...ya know..this one seems like it might be too much for ya. Maybe they should make a server hopping mode since that‚Äôs what your kind likes to do anyway. 
---
Fallout:NV and Fallout 4 on PC still get stuck loading, crash the game, and corrupt your file. 
---
Now you understand how people who liked Mass Effect Andromeda felt like back in 2017.
---
10 on my first try, but at Watoga station.
---
20ish at my 2nd try because a friend wanted one too.
---
What legendary effects does it have on it? 
---
I can just see it lifting it's hind leg :)
---
Our group one shares rad sponge lvl 3, and one shares ghoulish lvl 3, not very often any meds get used at all.
---
Ok, you're hired.
---
Better than letting them play New Vegas... Fallout 76 is pretty tame all things considered, compared to it. Try explaining Cook Cook's plot points to a kid.
---
lel. Get a load of this guy.  Top kek
---
Needs a better lube protocol imo.
---
Look for me. Lol I'm always wanted
---
Just message them to somebody on PS4, then download the PS Messages app and click them. They save to your library and you can share them from there :)
---
Means you already collected those items, they patched the ability to farm specific items, go to a different location to collect them.
---
Put your camp next to a steel or lead deposit to farm them.
---
A better idea would be to have the ability to scrap ammo for materials to make different calibers of ammo 
---
I've used that combo for many hours. Only had that issue once. Logged out and back in. Fixed it.   
---
Also a weird thing happened that was effecting it. I got a challenge for Killing X creature at night. It was like noon by sun position. Strange things....
---
Meh, they lost me as a customer when they went MMO.  Fallout 4 will be the last for me as long as the new ones are MMO's
---
If they disappeared from your inventory there's a good chance you died or walked out of the area that your supposed to use em in. If thats the case the only way to proceed is to repair the 15 broken ones you got from the mainframe. 
---
I had to unsubscribe from Yong Yea because every single one of his videos was about 76. He made like half a dozen videos on the dark rum alone. He shits on Bethesda for everything, even when they try to fix stuff. When they sent out the new canvas bags he complained about how it took too long, despite it being done in under 2 weeks of the games official release. It's sad how much he's milking 76.
---
This is off topic and will more than likely get you downvoted.
---
You on PS4? How much to mod my t51?
---
I know, ill need to upgrade anyway
---
What‚Äôs your handle? I could make a nice contribution for a few serums and do not want to give to duppers. 
---
Hahaha I couldn't hit the upvote quick enough!
---
No worries! There‚Äôs plenty to be found! I appreciate the help 
---
I did this for Skyrim!  Love it!
---
Umm...I've been in vaults...not hard to do
---
YouTube it...
---
I downvoted 
---
Oh, I didn't realize you can gender, I thought just appearance.
---
Fallout: NV I can agree with, but I only played 4 on Xbox, so I don‚Äôt know much about the file bugs. 
---
I'm just down for ps4 friends to play with, cuz only low lv kids try to team up. No offense to kids, but I don't like them for real. 
---
Does he have some good stuff for sale, plans?
---
Just tried it, it is the same, stutter is still there :/
---
So no then? Ha. If I would have a place to drop shit to help others I'd do it in a heartbeat. But then you remind me of the server stability. So maybe in the future?
---
My GT is AngelOfDeath116. 
---
I am PS4, and I'd do it at cost if you have the materials (I don't have the flux).
---
You know you complain about her being a weak npc that you could kill so easy, but the only reason that's true is because of game machaics. In a real world scenario, where you aren't immortal and bullets and lasers actually hurt you, she could kill you before you even drew your weapon. "yeah but I have power armor" you say. Cool, but again real world scenario, you're either one of the original vault residents, meaning you're at least 50 and probably much older, or you're a vault baby who has never even seen power armor and wouldn't know how to use it. Or a gun for that matter since the dwellers were never given any or trained on them. Yeah she might be annoying at times, but rose is way more badass than you, but the only reason your character is even still alive is because of god powers.
---
I've run across this as well. I think it's looking wanna should be there by default then updating with the actual instance. If it were fast enough you would never notice but with server performance lately I've seen it more (PC)
---
I think the one positive of all of this is, you only end up playing with the most die hard of fallout fans. I think that really helps the immersion. 
---
I don't miss the deluge of trash talking 8 year olds that you encounter playing Red Ded, or R6 Siege for that matter.
---
But I do feel your pain. I've had to explain to all my friends "get this game in two(ish) months, and you'll never know why it was ever shit on." And when you lay it out for them, that its been getting regular updates, the response is usually "oh, so like no man's sky? Ok I'll give it a shot".
---
Yeah, only i hope to god it doesn't take them a full year to fix duping, netcode, or infinite carry weight.
---
You'll also want glowing recipes, glowing caps stash, and there's one that allows you to hotkey perk combos.
---
You‚Äôre ruined already.
---
It‚Äôs time to reroll irl
---
Plus side is more stuff makes it more expensive to take.  I just keep a couple big BP's to plant everything I could ever need in a satalite camp.
---
What fluxes you need? I can give you serums for service if you want bro?
---
Accept it after 25 years in close confines they want to shoot you on site.
---
So you used a bunch of explosives and blew a hole in a wall and got into a vault?   Because that is exactly what this guy said.  If I‚Äôm wrong then I‚Äôll apologize for my statements
---
yeah.  its pretty shit on fusion cores.  awesome to get out of the trenches in watoga nuke sights though.
---
my understanding is marsupial works in your power armor so if you can afford it that would be a lot better than eating fusion cores.  i may go that route myself and put the medic kit back on the chest piece.  we shall see.  just a matter of coughing up that cap amount for the no-negative serum.
---
also if you have any friends/team mates then server hop with them if you must.  i find we rarely show the same thing at the vendor so that helped find it much faster.  i had spent days looking.
---
To me, Fo76 looks better than fo4 on my non-4k 55" tv (ps4 non pro).  I can stand on a mountain in the western forest and see the top of the world.  I can watch rain roll in and watch bravo s fly in the distance.
---
That all said... It is glitchy.  But when it works its amazing.
---
It's your first Nuke zone, don't thank Bethesda yet.  
---
I'm probably going to be in that boat when Dragon Age 4 comes out.
---
I'm afraid.
---
sometimes, yes. But again, could say the exact same thing for any newspaper, tv program, games website etc.
---
Lowest common denominator and all that.
---
Fallout new Vegas
---
I've had bodies disappear into grass a few feet away from me.  It can be hard to track them when I'm still being shot at.
---
It'd be kinda neat if the VATS activation could include a brief highlight of all nearby corpses.  It costs AP even if it can't lock onto anything, so may as well make it function like a corpse radar as well.
---
I stopped playing after nuke hotfix, the game crashes even more than before, didn't think that could be possible but....
---
+250 Damage Resistance while reloading
---
V.A.T.S. critical shots do +50% damage
---
Damage increased by 10% if you are mutated
---
I can‚Äôt do regular hours when you see I accepted your request that‚Äôs when you can stop by. 
---
Channels that usually get 2k views make a "Fallout 76 sucks" video and get millions. I don't think the hate train's slowing down anytime soon. 
---
From what ive noticed, no the axe has no mods, and the damage is a touch lower I think. dont quote me on it. 
---
got any good discords?
---
Do you mean the scorched? The scorch beasts are those flying bat things and there is a lvl 50 one that flies over the airport during an event there.
---
I‚Äôm not sure what the time is for the scorched to respawn. They usually do every time some one new pops into the area. Or you can server hop to keep killing them and getting supplies. Make sure you pick up their guns for scrapping as that will unlock new mods at the crafting stations. 
---
Another great place to go at your level is the Poseidon energy plant and do the event that pops there, Powering up Poseidon. There is a Power Armor set that spawns there and a loose fusion core occasionally. To get them you‚Äôll need to pick up a set of keys that spawn in the plant. It‚Äôs also really good for xp.
---
If you‚Äôre having trouble with monsters and are feeling squishy, try getting a chassis and some raider Power Armor (level 15 min).  That should help you feel quite a bit beefier. The set I got from server hopping at the west gate bridge. You can get the key to it from Camden Park in one of the cars on the rollercoaster.
---
Sorry for the wall of text. And if you need help I play on PS4.
---
Great info. Thank you.
---
I want it climb the tallest mountain 
---
Yes I have, and I agree there is some compelling voice acting in the game which I appreciated too. However if you look at the credits Fallout 4 had literally twice the number of voice actors as 76. Thats cutting costs in half...
---
Thanks for the correction. 
---
After level 50 you will be able to re specialize.  I would recommend that you get one character able to clear out content, then make new characters with specialized builds.
---
I think some discoveries are glitched e.g. i never discovered alleghany asylum only fort defiance so it shows as incomplete :(
---
I end most night with more than I started with most people have way too much of something that they are happy to share. 
---
YOOOOO I JUST FOUND ITTTT 
---
Hurray!!! awesome :)  enjoy!
---
3rd star Reduce weapon weight by 20% this additive with weapon weight reduction perks up to 90%. If min/max I find 4 weapon weight reduction with 1 junk weight reduction is best when out farming goods.   
---
If a strict riflerer do 5 weapon weight as that extra 10% ends up being a lot when you carry 5 rifles. 
---
Because negativity generates more clicks. You post a negative article both sides click to attack or defend. You post a positive article the attackers won't click on it because they don't agree where as mostly the defenders go I hopes of being able to actually talk about the game with others who also like it. Yong Yea, Legacykilla, and Upper Echelon I find are the worst. They see to only ever report anything negative. Some would argue that's what gaming journalism is supposed to be, but those same people also want regular news to stop broadcasting negativity as it's too divisive. 
---
Really on the king? What about them? 
---
r/fo76filthycasuals

I bought the game in December, well after reading countless posts of rage, reading the reviews that trashed it and carefully considering if it was even worth the 50.00 (CDN) sale price.  I decided to pull the trigger, because I like Fallout for the setting and the environmental story-telling more than the myriad of other issues it seemed to have.
---
I don't regret my purchase but I would agree that the game itself is seriously flawed in some areas in ways that should not be present in a major release.  The bugs are wild, the crashes are way too frequent and some of the gameplay decisions are crippling for fans of the franchise.
---
So, does it get a bit too much hate?  Yes.  Does it deserve a 52 MC score or whatever?  Probably a 60 something honestly, and I do like it.  It needs fixing, and I hope they do invest in it rather than abandon it because the framework is still there for something better.  Also, abandoning it might have a further-reaching consequences for people that bought this on good faith that they 've enjoyed what Bethesda has been offering until now... Just sayin :)
---
Ez thanks 
---
I think that main issues with ME:A were inexperienced devs, the somewhat pointless spin-offy nature of the story and general hate against both EA and the franchise for 3's ending. Even tho it was a solid game, half of the internet had decided to hate it even before it was launched, much like with FO76 now. I hope it's not as severe with DA4.
---
I‚Äôll be able to swing that. My psn is Tackleberry_G 
---
Just at work right now but I‚Äôll be on tonight if you‚Äôll be around?
---
I've seen them advertised on here, but have not tried them out.  I use discord for other games and like the format.
---
if you dont get one i can prob get one th next time i see it. i see them all the time at watoga. people sell them after completing the quest
---
Yeah this comes up a lot in some friend circles I have, every time it happens I just say "At least it wasn't as disappointing as fallout 4" and then there's just a general 'yep' from all parties involved and the conversation moves on to something else 
---
PLATFORM : XBOX ONE X

Noticed an issue with the Extractors sometimes not reporting mined resources correctly :
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/y92NPz3
---
Extractor shows no mined resources, but if you hit the transfer button, the resources are actually there.
---
What really sucks though, is once this happens any mined resources I collect no longer get added to my inventory and I have exit the server. 
---
Also noticed a lot of floating objects recently when deleting an object below it (e.g removed desk and toolbox remains floating) : 
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/7NdACG3
---
Really like the game otherwise. Got huge potential for improvement, expansion and to be a real cash cow for Bethesda, but cant wait for some of the more common game ruining bugs to be ironed out. Having anxiety about upgrading my weapons or trading, for fear of having the game lock up, really isnt cool.
---
This is AMAZING! Wish I could up vote 76 times...
---
Well a nuke is one of the ways to get inside a vault accidentally 
---
If nukes are involved everything goes out the window. The most insane bugs I‚Äôve run into are within the 2 minutes before the nuke hits or the 2 min immediately following.
---
I can go 6 hours without a hiccup but the second a nuke is launched it‚Äôs pretty much 100% dc/freeze/bluescreen/etc
---
I put my points all over the place but want to move to a sniper build and use rifles like the handmade. I would have to change many perks. 
---
I would LOVE this. There was a mod for FO4 that did this, and it was an almost necessity. The descriptions of the mods explain almost nothing for how they actually work. 'Improved penetration' does exactly what? And why is there no mention of AP costs, especially with scopes? 
---
With FO4 we could setup a target, I always just used a turret, to see what each mod actually did (before I found the mod). With FO76 that is not an option. We definitely need to know this. It could easily be combined with the existing crafting perks.
---
You can outsmart griefers. Take two mentats and see me in the morning.
---
This has been suggested since fo3 but they don't seem interested in implementing it.
---
ITT: the exact circle jerk OP is complaining about.
---
Top comment is literally ‚Äúbut but we have to make sure Bethesda KNOWS‚Äù and the top reply compares it to buying a car. 
---
Same, working then I'll be on later.
---
PSN Mr_Pipboy
---
I watched that as well and was genuinely surprised that he didn't rip into the game as hard as I thought he would. Instead, he was fairly calm and objective about it, for Yahtzee, anyway.
---
I think he actually hated Assassins Creed: Odyssey more than 76. I haven't seen the top worst games video yet though.
---
The game is totally deserving of criticism. Especially from people who paid full price at launch. Bethesda need to know that the customer deserves better. Fanboyish defence of genuine issues helps No one 
---
I was down near the Nuka-cola factory , i was just wondering down the road and there it was just in the middle .
---
I didn't approach it for about 3 minutes wondering if it would go off it i approached , i didn't get anything from it blowing up 
---
So you're saying you've never defended game mechanics that frustrate other people because you understand the design intent?
---
PS4 unfortunately but that is super cool of you to offer. Thanks for the info as well!
---
Yep. I *was* a guy... until I found a neat dress to wear.
---
That‚Äôs just one example, another guy was bragging about how some dude tried to take some base over and put dozens of nuke mines down to keep him out so he shot one and they all blew up in a chain reaction...
---
All I can figure is they are young teens looking for attention or something 
---
Containers with different settings on who could access the contents would be nice. One for team, one for team and friends and one for anyone.
---
This is true for the most part lol.  You lose out only a tiny bit of productivity potentially but save a lot of time.
---
Not sure if the rewards are different either but they do seem similar to me as well and I've done multi-workshop farming a few times now (since the returns of one are so small...)
---
&lt;agrees with OP&gt;
---
Idk man, the game is ‚Äúabsolutely terrible‚Äù and basically the worst thing ever, yet I can‚Äôt stop playing it! 
---
Iv'e had to unsub from 3 Youtubers because i'm getting annoyed every time i turn on Youtube to see a new video bashing on this game in my sub feed.
---
I already know the game is a buggy mess, but i don't need to be reminded that daily.  
---
Really?  Wow, I've never seen it once
---
Dunno, sometimes the turrets at Harper's Ferry spawn with what seems like two-shot, explosive &amp; anti-armor effects... as I ragdoll onto the hood of a slightly-aflame Corvega.
---
I already made comment but I really gotta say it. This is the most immature and childish post I've ever seen. Even fortnite fans dont whine like this when big meanies who dont like their game make fun of them. This is really embarassing and I haven't seen something this cringey since sammyclassicsonicfan's video https://youtu.be/GsbGh8HPkMY
---
Unmodded grognak axe has the same damage as an unmodded super sledge, super sledge has 1 mod(heating coil). All Rise is a normal sledgehammer with the heavy rocket mod and is outclassed by both grognak and super sledge legendaries.
---
Has had? It's still ridled with bugs.
---
Original post said nothing about no PA. Though any armor with some rad resistance will do. If there is no rad resistance you might need two points in rad sponge
---
Defenses are events though, and claiming the workshop is a quest. You can earn atoms by completing events. Also, I've had more workshops become unclaimable because an enemy is stuck underground. I've never actually had it happen during a defense. And if it did, so what? I assume the event would never end, so you would never have to actually defend it ever again. In theory anyway.
---
whoa...i heard it was only for the X01.  you can use it in the others?! sweet :)
---
also saw your note below...how dumb is this, it will scrap your MODs when crafting before it will go to un-bulk an item.  i think it should have a warning before it would touch anything not in the Junk category. maybe they'll change that in the future 
---
Damn, nice. Thanks!
---
Don‚Äôt blame the guy for cheating. Blame Bethesda. 
---
It can be a simple in-universe fix. Make corpses with loot on them radiate flies or green smoke to represent odors of decay.
---
I mean. Previous fallout games also had charisma/bartet perks apply to robot venders. So, that is probably forgivable.
---
The vending machines, however, have no excuse. Vending machines dont even have any AI in them.
---
Weirdly enough yeah. It‚Äôs just really hard to get that idea across through here with all the different perspectives and skewed view on griefing and raiding haha 
---
And I‚Äôm not a huge asshole, I‚Äôll share plans and recipes, get to know ya, then I‚Äôll try throw down if you‚Äôre willing. If not I‚Äôll move on to the next, plenty of other folks on the same server to play with. 
---
Sometimes I don‚Äôt even pick up the obliterated players junk. One time I even left a Comrade Chubs in their dropped loot. I‚Äôm just trying to fight something other than AI. 
---
If anyone has the jet pack for the x-01 for PS4 let me know I got a good deal to get one off you for caps 
---
Maybe you‚Äôre seeing all of this because it‚Äôs a bad game? Lol
---
It's lag- game loads the item and then changes it's mind and corrects if you've already looted it or it's instanced and somebody else has looted it recently.
---
You see it all the time if you're serving hopping at places like the service entrance to the enclave bunker- click on that enamel bucket next to the door all you want, it 'aint going anywhere.
---
Hey with all the people now going in to the staff room, anything that is said to be found on a vendor that is not confirmed by an image of said vendor with it I have to assume they cheat. I mean the odds are 50/50 after.  Hell I am starting to think there are more cheaters now than legit players.   
---
All we see are posts about the dupers so it is the mood of the reddit. 
---
You have a 24 hour cool down on world items for each player now regardless of server hopping.
---
So you need to hit a few locations up if you‚Äôre trying to farm and server hop until they appear for you the first time.
---
You mean like the posts that ask about something in this game, then in another post in another part of Reddit they say they won‚Äôt play the game even if it was free? Yes there are lots of them.
---
Might be a dumb question but do you need both starched genes and class freak? I thought they could be swapped around once you have the mutations?
---
The Forest
---
No clue what the game is like now.  I gave up on it weeks ago.
---
Glad I could help.
---
Truth
---
Tell your friend to use the Search bar.
---
Your game doesn't crash, guess you better hey down voted! Fuck sakes....people are ridiculous 
---
I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôve seen his review but Noah Caldwell Gervais has a really interesting positive take on FO76. He basically says he was more frustrated with FO4 because it was trying to be something it wasn‚Äôt with the terrible dialogue options and pointless level up system. FO76 was a much more honest albeit flawed game. I personally think this game will be similar to no mans sky and the future updates will provide enough content to hopefully restore Bethesda‚Äôs good name.
---
Good to know, thanks 
---
I would love to have a container you could build not tied to your stash, even if it held half as much. I could totally hide it by my base somewhere, even if it meant it could be looted, I would use it anyway.
---
No way....never ever have I heard that..sooooo glad you came and told us about this. Whew just crazy.
---
I don‚Äôt disagree, almost every problem with the game was way overblown. I want you to know that I love Fallout I think Fallout 76 is, at the very least for me, a good fucking game. I bitch and moan because I care, I shit on FNV because I love the game (likewise with Fallout 76), I want Fallout to improve. If I wanted to let Fallout crash and burn (like those fucking children at NMA) then I‚Äôd happily sit back. I can‚Äôt do much of anything to affect Fallout 5, but it‚Äôs worth giving my opinions even if my thoughts are never ever considered by Bethesda.
---
"lel"

Kids these days. 
---
lol , i was a bit nervous as i didn't know what damage it would casue , luckily it was very minimal and i just went on my merry way . It took me ove a minute to decide which wire i had to cut .
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN75s\_wh5HE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN75s_wh5HE) in the vidoe you can see me going for the green wire until i read a post about the red wire , was wondering if there was some pattern or generic wire to cut 
---
That event is probably my favorite. And oddly it is rarely populated, I think people see that it is a versus event and they decide not to give it a chance. It needs like a "for fun" tag to go with it or something. 
---
 It would be like trying something new, liking it, leaving the restaurant and having a million people who have never stepped foot in the restaurant or seen or even smelled what you tried standing in the parking lot screaming how stupid you are for liking what you tried because some food reviewer you never heard of who gets paid to complain said he didnt like it. And you cant go anywhere food related without seeing people talk about how bad said food is, and if you mention kinda liking it people shame you. Just look at the comments in this thread and how simple replys from OP are getting downvoted. Its really fucking stupid and this new outrage culture is the most annoying thing ever. It doesn't stop with fallout 76, its every video game or anything that can have an opinion attached to it. People are addicted to this new recreational outrage fad. I hope this shit passes by soon but I dont think it will, best thing to do is avoid anywhere with a comment section or anysite that lives off clicks. 
---
Grief him before he griefs you 
---
Juicehead was clickbait before 76, what, has your opinion changed on him now that he makes videos criticizing 76?
---
While I have not tried this myself as I dont use mines, I think you may be able to trigger multiple mines if they are set close enough to one another to set each other off. I know some of the explosive devices I have encountered in the world have triggered due to another explosion, such as a car, etc.
---
This is super common in online games. I love Bethesda, but it's clear that they, more than most other studios, do not take notes from other successful games. 
---
I must be extremely unlucky then, through the whole game I've found maybe one tarberry from looting.
---
I'm still scratching my head at a power armor mod that increases UNARMED damage. Is there an unarmed weapon that works in power armor? I've tried several now, to no avail.
---
I'm always annoyed seeing the damage they cause with there tiny pea shooters.
---
Its just the ballistic ones too, the laser ones actually do alot less damage.
---
Weh 
---
How is it hard to get when it is a perk that you pretty much unlock when you level up?
---
Get ready for the Sonic 06 effect. Every review of a Bethesda game for the next 10 years will make a brief comment on 76's existence lmao
---
Note: I rather like 76... but..
---
Like most PVE/PVP games, one of the two always suffers because of the other. To be honest it's simply not really possible to have both work well in my opinion.
---
Not only are one shots common in PvP when you engage, there common later on when you don't...
---
Go look up 10k damage weapon builds.. Yes you read that correct. 10'000 damage.. per shot. Not even including Armor pen or Sneak attack.
---
I can one shot a high level that's not even engaged and kill them through the PvP non-engaged damage reduction.
---
\-
---
I really really like this game. But the PvP Is garbage.
---
Phrasing...  
---
Thanks for the laugh though have an upvote 
---
You need to acknowledge that you can enjoy a game that is just poorly made and executed. Almost every aspect about fallout 76 is flawed, but that doesn't mean you can't have fun in it. 
---
That would be fantastic, anyone have the setting? 
---
People have failed and succeeded with all three wires.
---
I picked red and ran. It detonated but I was safely outside the radius.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if the outcome was based on your luck stat instead of which wire you picked.
---
I know... I would have never suspected my game to crash because it never does
---
Wont shup up. Game is garbage. Suck it up
---
(an adult here) I‚Äôm around for teaming up! Would like to farm nuke sites with a group. My PSN is the same as my username.
---
I'd also like to request an end to the RDR circle jerk. 2nd most over rated game of all time.
---
I was actually intending on dropping a junk gun that was one slot above it. When I went to go drop the junk gun the game glitched and when it came back the 3* was gone with the junk gun. Guess I should always confirm a bag even before dropping useless guns just to ensure this doesn't happen again.
---
This.
---
Found a 2s laser gun. Turned it into a rifle with the thingamajig that makes it shoot 4 beams or w/e. Even with weapon artisan, two magazines of 36 fusion cells and bam, weapon broken. Even without quad beamamajig, it breaks waaay too easily. 
---
...a shame, too. I liked using it instead of my main guns. 
---
If that's at school, there better not be a shitty 1\* pistol in there.
---
Weight reduction perks are awesome right up to the point where your needed to actually do dps
---
It is only 1 point at a time but...
---
Have you done any nuking yet or farmed Whitesprings during a nuke? 
---
You can easily take 5-10 levels per nuke at around 40-50. I was level 84 earlier today, dropped a nuke and did some legendary farming at the gold course and I hit 91, took about 20 minutes to launch the nuke and then spent then about 1.5 / 2 hours in the nuke zone. Wasn't even a very efficient run as there was a group farming there as well so some would prob say my levelling was slow on that run.
---
Ill check out the fire station  good idea
---
Raiders don't log off the second they start to get their ass handed to them. Griefers do. Guess how many Raiders vs Griefers I encounter? Haven't met a Raider yet.
---
Ahh. Ok.  That works also.  Thank you kind gamer.  
---
I mean I would love an option on PS4 to directly look at them from Playstation.com or the app on my phone.
---
The method you mention is the one I do use but as it currently stands, Its...long and still requires me to be at home when I do that stuff.
---
#I'm at work. :(
---
Not everyone is an asshole. 
---
Definitely depends on how you play, that would effect a lot of things. Here's a breakdown for you or anyone else who's interested assuming you take all mutations excluding Empath, Herd Mentality and Herb/Carn(this is my current mutation build) Edit: Also note, this is after maxed Class Freak:
---
Str -2
---
Per 0
---
End 0
---
Cha 0
---
Int +5
---
Agi +3
---
Luc 0
---
**Here's all the mutations with their various positives/negatives and how to counter the negative effects:**
---
*Adrenal* \-- Max HP -12.5 -- optional: lifegiver perk, 1st level gives +15
---
*Bird Bones* \-- Str -1 -- optional perks: Radcool, Party boy/girl + professional drinker -- carry weight loss also countered by Marsupial(+10 after factoring strength decrease).
---
*Chameleon* \-- Weightless armor(check your vendors, everyone sells this stuff and you can find some pretty good pieces)
---
*Eagle Eyes* \-- Str -1 -- optional: Radcool, Party boy/girl + professional drinker -- carry weight loss also countered by Marsupial(+10 after factoring strength decrease).
---
*Egg Head* \-- Str -.75 End -.75 -- no effect, rounded down.
---
*Electrically charged* \-- Grounded's Energy Resistance
---
*Grounded* \-- Energy Damage -12.5% -- optional: various damage perks -- This mutation is totally optional, the energy resistance is nice, but there are other ways to build your resistance without the reduction to damage.
---
*Healing Factor* \-- Chem Effects -13.75% -- nothing really counters effect, but healing is totally worth it.
---
*Marsupial* \-- Int -1 -- with Egg Head(Int ends up at +5!)
---
*Plague Walker* \-- frankly a lot of diseases suck, still avoid them, but if you happen to have one, it gives area damage increasing with amount of diseases you have.
---
*Scaly Skin* \-- AP -12.5 -- +30 AP from Bird Bones -- +17.5 AP overall
---
*Speed Demon* \-- Hunger/Thirst +12.5% -- optional: All night long -20% hunger/thirst on first level
---
*Talons* \-- Agi -1 -- Bird Bones(Agi ends up at +3)
---
*Twisted Muscles* \-- Gun accuracy -12.5% -- Increased Vats accuracy with Agi boost from bird bones(however much 3 agi gives?)
---
*Unstable Isotope* \-- Damage to player -- unknown, very small amount, unavoidable damage(scaly skin counters this to an extent)
---
*Herd Mentality* \-- may be worth taking as well as the end result would be -.5 to all special, which if it works like the other mutations would round down to nothing. I haven't tested yet, but someone else may be able to confirm?
---
*Empath* \-- I, like you, play primarily solo, so this one does nothing for me at all.
---
*Herb/Carnivore* \-- There is benefit to this, I haven't decided if I want to bother yet, but right now leaning toward herb, since you can have constant food with a garden and cooked meat sells for tons(which I usually have aplenty).
---
I completely get avoiding certain mutations, and getting just the ones you want is really a pain. But hopefully this might help someone in their quest to freakishness.
---
I have nuked but my damage was barely effecting the glowing ones that spawned. I died any time I ran into them. The problem isn‚Äôt with my weapons, as they‚Äôre the highest I can get atm. 
---
Bro. Everyone knows about the mash. Its a popular 3* farm.
---
Nobody pvps there.
---
But no yeah, its a graveyard smash...
---
Ya better hurry, im told it gets on in a flash.
---
I‚Äôm referring to the image at the top of the post, where you can enable what junk each item possesses. I‚Äôm sorry if I read the post wrong.
---
Maybe he meant Queen? 
---
BUT MY DUFFLE BAG 
---
Happened to us over the weekend.
---
I log my Jetpack server-hopping merchant alt in whitesprings wearing a hazmat suit every time because of this, and it works wonders!
---
...Except for that one time that I logged in when a nuke was literally 2 seconds away from impact. At least I had a good laugh about that one, I guess the game wanted to show me that nothing is sacred.
---
I‚Äôve ran into the responder vendor not near grafton firehouse once or twice also never anywhere else, and I‚Äôve seen images of the dead deathclaw merchant but never ran into him alive.
---
I‚Äôve noticed I can‚Äôt open the crit option while mid fire fight I actually need to stop for a second hit crit and then fire. Hitting the crit button means your next pull of the trigger will crit, hitting the crit button will not fire off the crit.
---
There's a lot of side quests in the lower level areas. Use them until you level up the rest of the way. I have yet to find a situation where I didn't have an appropriate level quest. 
---
Downvote as we do not. It encourages muling and cap miners.
---
I‚Äôm sorry, I love the long dark but it does not have more content than 76. 
---
Ok, its this kinda comment I have issues with because it shows a lack of knowledge that most of this community has and perpetrates. 
---
This was not developed by Bethesda MD, the studio which brought us TES and the current series of Fallouts.
---
This game was and is developed by Bethesda Austin. This Studio only has 3 games under their belt and has only been around 6 years. 
---
This project asked them to take an Engine created for single player open world RPGs and modify and restructure it to support online multiplayer. That is not very easy and there has been and will be bugs and bumps.
---
Take off starched genes and you lose mutations every time you treat your rads. 
---
Kind of all or nothing on the perks that go along with the mutations unless you have a very few specific ones and you don't care about minimizing the downsides of them with class freak.
---
 crashed space station

Bethesda had such a great reputation until last year. Skyrim, F4 (with all its flaws, still a solid game), and its published games like Wolfenstein and Doom. It seemed like it could do no wrong, especially in the world of EA, Ubisoft and Activision Blizzard. And poof, just like that, all that reputation gone. For a very long time, if not forever. It will have to do wonders to repair all the damage done to the brand. And to even have a shot at doing it, they have to be hammered like that. The lists of "worst games of year X" don't only include objectively worst games, but also in terms of how much of a letdown a game is. And F76 is certainly a huuuge letdown. And all the patches and tweaks to it will never change that, that time has passed.
---
I could give you a similar advice to yours - if you can't stand all the hate the game gets - don't listen to it, ignore it. Nobody can force you to not play the game if you like it.
---
I think shooting the copbots is a good way to get a bounty without pissing anyone off
---
Yes please. That would be so good.
---
Head to Grafton!  It's where I levelled up when I had issues.  Participate in events for the xp.  I didn't team up for any of my main quest lines, and found it easier to level in Grafton.
---
It‚Äôs almost like they want us to play a crafting simulator. How have they not fixed this yet?
---
Np!
---
The nice thing about that spread of special pts is its not too hard to shift to pistol/vats or a few other options.
---
More just perk cards and not repecs.
---
Took me 3.
---
Sorry man. That‚Äôs the way I do it. I whole heartedly agree with your suggestion though. Maybe it‚Äôd come in an update? I don‚Äôt know. Some devs of PlayStation software respond on twitter sometimes, so maybe you can tweet at them? 
---
When the bar is full AND you have a percentage greater than 0% to hit something in VATS, pressing the "Crit Button" will guarantee the next bullet you fire to be both 100% and a critical shot.
---
If you are trying to activate crits while at 0% in VATS, the game will not let you.
---
The general idea behind the constant bashing is that people don‚Äôt want Bethesda to forget that the way they‚Äôve gone about pretty much everything involving 76, is wrong. Bethesda has made more mistakes in the past few months than I can count on my fingers, and people desperately want to hold them accountable for it. Seeing as no real legal action can be taken though, this ‚Äòjustice‚Äô comes in the form of lampooning them literally every chance a person gets. Bethesda has built up a lot of frustration towards them over the years, and 76 is just what finally blew the lid on it. It‚Äôs important to remember a good chunk of this hate isn‚Äôt directed at the game, it‚Äôs almost exclusively Bethesda. The general populace don‚Äôt want to give Bethesda the satisfaction of everyone just shutting up and moving on, and are gonna make the company listen. This is almost a final push to save Bethesda by making them abandon their shitty ways... or a push to final kill them off for good.
---
I think you have to hit the Crit button then attack while still in VATS for it to go off. I may be wrong (I don't use it often as melee)
---
The same people that say fuck Bethesda also have 1111 hours into skyrim and 800 hours into fallout 4. Dumbasses. Mistakes happen, instead of complaining and shitting on a game why not give constructive feed back instead.
---
Upvote! I agree, I wish this was like most common Online games where your characters share a ‚Äúbank‚Äù or stash. It would be problematic in a way because of how much is stored on each character but if camps were shared too it would help out a lot.
---
I have it at home will post it when I get there, if no one else has already
---
Yup same  happened to me.
---
I gotchya. That image isn't very representative, unfortunately. Sorry if I came off as snippy. 
---
Ah, okay.
---
Thanks for your help!
---
Just tried, not working.
---
it very clearly shoots two mini nukes. 
---
They will kill it off when Starfield has announced multiplayer.
---
Each silo should nuke the other. 
---
Fallout 76 sux, kekekeke.   
---
But seriously, there's a reason this backlash has been going on and that is because of their OWN REPEATED FUCKUPS surrounding this product into 2019 even. How do manage 2 months of dumbfuckery, anti-consumer and incompetent behaviour? I personally never grow tired of it, Bethesda needed an ass-kicking and deserves one every time they fail in major ways. They've been complacent far too long.
---
And for $20 Subnautica was in a state of Beta for how many years before just being release to PS4? Yes it is an amazing game, but my son has had hiccups, glitches, ect... and that didn‚Äôt have multiplayer people playing. I just bought it for $30 for my ps4.  Games have issues they don‚Äôt need to be complained about all the time!
---
My 2 cents, if so many people hate it, get the hell off the  servers so that those of us that want to play don‚Äôt have to sit waiting for a world to open. I played this weekend and the map every time had more yellow people dots than when I was doing the Beta. 
---
I would get some paper and a pen, right down your special as it is right now and count how many level ups it would take to move them where you want. Then add up all your perks you need add it all up and see how many level ups you need to get where you want. 
---
Press crit button then shoot.
---
Next bullet after pressing it is the crit.
---
O, that's a good one.
---
So it is Monday afternoon so time for a winner. It looks like Nathan TK won it.
---
There wasn't a lot of buzz but I like this idea. What other rare outfits or plans would everyone like to see put up for the next contest?
---
I don‚Äôt believe so, personally I think it is stupid that we can‚Äôt 
---
I mean, its not your fault! You don't have to apologize :)
---
And...I hate twitter. I hate that it wants my damn phone number.
---
I know plenty of millennials right there chanting build the wall with them. It's a society problem, more then likely stemming from the turd filled toilet bowl that is the internet, and everybody thinks they are the right ones and act like everything is black and white. It's as if they were right when they said smart phones and internet would make us stupid back in the early 2000s.
---
Was it Harper's Ferry on PS4?  If so, I was on that server and was super disappointed because I was looking forward to exploring a nuked Harper's Ferry.
---
Cool, will add you.
---
It‚Äôs alright man I just thought the image provided was part of what was in the mods. But yup just to clarify the image depiction where what junk is shown from what item is a menu option available in the vanilla game. Thank you and I‚Äôm sorry.
---
That might actually be Todd Howard.
---
He was quite obviously comparing his rad resist without hazmat/pa to that in a hazmat suit... If he was in PA he wouldn't have had this problem.
---
And to the second is unfortunately untrue, ~600 rad resist without paying/hazmat has me taking 7 rads per sec and sponge couldn't keep up
---
I suppose they are just quick and annoying, very bullet spongy. Taking on 2-3 at a time seems to lead to a quick death for me.
---
Just wait until the next shitshow Bethesda puts out comes along and then the FO76 whinging will stop.
---
Hmm that‚Äôs something I haven‚Äôt considered. Thanks for the idea. I‚Äôll try it later :D
---
Energy guns were kinda interesting in 2. They were generally very powerful, but damn that ammo weight.
---
Quick question, what level are you? I am level 169, and have been server jumping that spot for 14 days straight with the best mod spawning being calibrated shocks. 
---
The absolute only plan that dude EVER has for me, is t60 motion assist-servos. And I was wondering if it was because of the level. 
---
Ouch, got any sources? Or if it might have been patched?
---
By every source I can find, it‚Äôs a super sledge. It even looks like one, it just has a sledgehammer mod for some reason
---
Im trying to avoid managing another app, plus its so easy to just join from friends list in game and while on the ps4 without having to pickup my phone
---
Wholeheartedly agree on the notes. I'm 51 and slowly losing sight in my left eye (which sucks since I make a living writing novels, comics, etc. and kinda need my eyesight for that). I don't mind not having NPCs in the game, but it was definitely easier to listen to an NPC and read their dialogue box on-screen than it is to squint, step close to the television, squint some more, and still not be able to read whatever is on the note.
---
Stoves are OP in this game. Nerf stoves.
---
Mobs there will spawn to the higher players level. Your death was the effect, not the cause- lol.
---
My theory is that they saw me and decided mass suicide was better than the hell I was about to unleash...
---
What is the pattern for the walls that you have? I think thats the only one I don't have yet...
---
I hear echo sound, I punch. King dies :D
---
Interesting, didn't try that, doesn't explain what I saw though.  I tried enough times to be definitely statistically relevant.
---
what  
---
inside the resort are only robots, everything else must have been a bug.  
---
like sometimes they eyebots in the golf club 
---
This is a shill from Bethesda marketing. 
---
Thanks! I was thinking more critters were maybe running around or something.
---
Who the fuck are you bro?
---
- Use the same fucking game engine from a previous release from 3 years ago. God knows what state it was in back then.
---
- Have the modding community fix many problems for you in the meanwhile.
---
- You don't give enough shits to even include their work as you create this new title.
---
- You have a battle tested architecture at a subsidiary company you refuse to fucking work with though you like in the same bed (TESO).
---
Thanks for your semi informed opinion, but if a company isn't investing in their own shit then just pick up UE or some other engine and avoid dealing with the plague of this one.
---
I play overwatch with a few folks and I just mentioned that I had been playing 76 and everyone immediately went "Fallout 76 is trash-- don't play it." None of them have played it. The herd mentality is strong. However, all of these individuals are much younger than me, and I absorb exactly zero YouTube/Twitch. Couldn't name you a single streamer if asked. So I know I'm not exposed to the same opinion-makers/thought-leaders as they are.
---
That being said-- the game is fun as hell but expectedly buggy. None of the bugs I've experienced are game-breaking (most of them are downright hilarious). The only aspect of the game that I am frustrated with is the server crashes, which it seems is caused by equal parts shitty cheaters and Bethesda still not patching shit.
---
You also have to remember the people to whom you're referring (content creators) thrive on clicks. If it was your job to talk about gaming online, you'd be kind of silly to not mention the hottest new controversy. But you know who's opinion I give a shit about? Mine. And the fact that so many people intentionally are missing out on a good game because of hearsay makes me kinda happy. Shit-talking, close-minded people are exactly who I don't want to play with.
---
I mean, that's exactly what I've heard. That they'd promised investors a launch date and effectively had no choice.
---
I ran into a "legendary government worker" there, utterly terrifying.  I immediately murdered him before he could link up with the DMV quest bots.
---
They are definitely region specific on the PS4.  Europe Central, Europe West, US East, US West, Asia Pac.
---
I only played it when it came out and I had a blast. It‚Äôs a great game. I don‚Äôt care or understand what everybody‚Äôs beef is I figured it was just some circle jerk mentality. Besides It‚Äôs a modern game surprise it gets updates. Online gaming community just like any other online community is overshadowed by obnoxious whiners. 
---
Nah that's the one aaaallllll the way on the top right of the map. Can't nuke the newbies sadly.
---
I've heard (some) good things about toxic valley near Hemlock Holes, otherwise there's not too much going on elsewhere.
---
Weird. I live down by the Nuka cola factory and travel that area quite extensively. Never saw it. Is it. Roth or south of the factory?
---
I'm after experience currently. Just got game last week. So mid 20's lv atm, but am killing lv 30-40 enemies. Nothing a few nuke runs can't fix, at least what I've read. Butt_ermybr3ad is my psn.  Always down for a good event. 
---
A hat in time
---
The bottom red is the barn set.
---
what is the first
---
He started a new char and acted new, found a couple other players that acted friendly toward him, sold him a decent weapon on the cheap, plans to return with his high level and return the favor to them. 
---
I was a Fallout fan.
---
I wouldn't play 76 if it was given to me for free.
---
The main reason for this is the unrelenting hate the game has recieved.  Honestly though, I think Bethesda deserve everything that's thrown their way. 
---
Reminds me a lot of what‚Äôs going on over in r/wow
---
Not sure which game has it worse at this point.
---
I was crafting at the bench in Watoga station and heard that pop pop. I don't normally that that much damage so thought I'd just finish up. As I exited the bench I saw my health was right down and I dropped dead. That was the first time I met Colonel Gutsy but certainly not the last.
---
Watched a nuking yesterday where the streamer was commenting to "keep the queen in the nuke zone."
---
For those of us not in the know, what are the benefits of this?
---
&gt;So for something to be multiplayer, it has to be forced?
---
you're *forced* to play with other people in Overwatch. forced might be the wrong word, required. point is, there's no game otherwise.
---
&gt;I'm sorry if you haven't heard, pal, but Bethesda already "chose".
---
that's why we're having this argument, right? or why everyone says the game has an identity crisis like I just pointed out. they're still on the fence, and either they get off or the game is gonna stay in the sorry state it's in right now.
---
&gt;You heard it here first, boys. A build can't shoot through walls! OMG buff now plz bethy!! 
---
your argument was that snipers could farm Whitesprings safely and thus were in balance with other classes. which is false, because they can't farm Whitesprings *at all*. this isn't a con, it renders them downright unusable.
---
"""balance"""
---
&gt;Look, this is from Wikipedia, a source that I'm sure you are very familiar with:
---
you keep hiding behind literal meanings to try and salvage your arguments. just like I conceded that yes, Fo76 is factually a multiplayer although, in practice, that's not how it plays out, I'll concede that yes, two people trading make-believe currency still falls within the definition of a transaction, a market.
---
but that's not what a market is for online games. WoW, EVE, even CSGO. their markets are backed by real world currency. China and Korea don't have literal gold farms because trading in-game currency is fun or they can pay their bills with caps, they do it to turn in a profit. in real life.
---
so either cash plays a central role or you have very anal people trying to regulate a game that's not even a mmo to begin with (mmo fiends) and thus hardly needs a market. in which case, don't be surprised people will mock you for bringing up a "healthy market".
---
Not sure why you view those as negatives.
---
For one, current system doesn't prevent either one, it just makes it awkward and unreliable. Which results in tickets being opened by players who lose items. Which clogs the customer support. A streamlined, self-contained system would go a long way towards reducing needless tickets.
---
Also, why is having a mule a negative? And how is that different from having alts? I have all 5 alts already up and running, my lowest level is lvl 32, I think. All of them have maxed inventory/stash, and many of them are at the cap capacity. Sooo...how would being able to transfer items between them make the situation worse?
---
Not sure what a cap miner is, cap storage? With a cap of only 25k, is that bad? Considering the prices at the vendors (up to 11-18k per item), never mind the players' prices, having more than 25k spread around isn't such a bad idea either. 
---
Guess I don't get your objection.
---
Hahaha, yeah ive seen those explosive rounds on the turrets there too. How do I get those col gusty rounds for my rifles, and those turrets at my camp??
---
I had the same thing happen to me the second time I went there (unable to complete the first time, so it reset). I didn't realize that meant there were dupes present though; I just assumed it was a bug.
---
I know. I mean even with that knowledge. There's so much stuff I have backlogged that even then 9+ hours free to just play 76 is impressive.
---
More power to you :)
---
Cheers. Oddly, I thought I had that set!
---
There's a safe in the Charleston gov't building that can spawn like 50 leather armor pieces like that.
---
Well the maybe Bethesda shouldn't have released such a buggy game? 
---
go home Todd, your drunk
---
I realized my mistake now. I've long thought that area was an extension if the Forest. I'm beginning to see now why I have struggled near Top of the World at level 30.
---
To be honest, though, early quests do lead there. And that Sonic AoE is a bit absurd.
---
Omg the server itself is duping quest items. Lmao the witch hunting is real. 
---
Will do. Once again, thanks for the help. 
---
Nuka Cola Grape is for some reason always overlooked.  -400 rads with no perk card, Cola Nut 1/2 is -800/-1200.  I never have to use Radaway in nuke zones, maybe use 2 Grape colas. Added bonus is full restore of HP and it works better &amp; faster that First Aid with Field Surgeon together. 
---
Im in the boat where i find it extremely boring and tedious, but could be okay in short bursts, like No Mans Sky which i enjoyed a gopd 45 hours in about a year ago.
---
But cause f76 is online it wont ever fill the niche where i would play it while traveling, in uni ect. 
---
Honestly the biggest hinderance in lack of NPCs, bethesda overestimated how boring reading listening to audiobooks is, i have nothing to get engaged by.
---
I hear you, just going to be hard having people on stand by.  Most of those players will already be playing and possibly in parties.  Hard to set anything up in advance with PS4 interface.  I have 2 reliable friends that I can shoot a message to and we will organize a party with a goal, outside of that I usually end up just shooting the shit and doing random stuff with whoever is online and available. 
---
Nice link!  Is there a thread where all useful links that are as helpful as that one are, all in one place ? 
---
I joined a nuke zone last night and we managed to beat a queen. (my first time!) I collected three weapons, all of them were energy, all of them got scrapped because they're not worth using currently.
---
Pretty sure that was a Bethesda dlc. 
---
Love and naivety killed Rose. Haha reminds me a bit of the story of Atlas. 
---
Bethesda Austin has developed 2 Games: DOOM (2016 and Fo76 (2018). The third was a game made beforehand when they were still BattleCry Studios. 
---
Bugs and bumps sure that will happen with every game that has ever been made and will ever be made. I'm saying they're a AAA company with an abundance of resources, tools and money. 
---
An engine was already made for Fo76, they've been using it for a decade now, I'm sure the staff knew their way around it by now. 
---
Oh that's such a great idea! Luckily for me I didn't join during an ongoing game, we started the event by just exploring the school which gave us ample opportunity to figure it out and have fun with the event. 
---
I did wonder why it wasn't crowded when we started the event; definitely could be intimidating from an outside perspective and it is in a higher level area...
---
Strangers did join later on towards the end though! I love that it has 3 rounds and isn't over too quickly, but might benefit to have it extended a little longer so everyone has more time to fast travel / load / join on top of the friendly tag. 
---
Well from a company that‚Äôs had nothing but masterpiece games and basically gave out a Xbox 360 marketplace game i‚Äôd say that mostly negative feedback is to be expected. 
---
I met a group of guys this week and played with them on a server for more than four hours as WSR killing ghouls with no disconnection. At the end of our play time the guys were nice and offered me some items, 4 of this large group of persons (8+) decided to open trade with me and I saw the player had over 6,000,000,000 pounds of inventory made up of what seemed like every item in the game. 
---
I then proceed to scan each inventory and find near 7 billion pounds on each player. 
---
All that weight and for over four hours we had no disconnect while ‚Äúpartying‚Äù on server with these players, No server lag, no rubber banding, no slow loot loads, not even a slow trade load. 
---
Again I want to be please clear I think this was the 2nd longest play session I‚Äôve had since beta... Longest being 5-6 hours. 
---
I know it‚Äôs fucked up to say but I would group with those guys again anytime if it means I can have decent length play sessions. Seriously. 
---
So can someone mind explaining how this happens if this is the blame of our troubles? I am honestly confused.
---
Yeah YongYea was a pretty much milking every single ounce of controversy and pretty much made it sound like each part was something everyone had to get onto Bethesda about. Yes the game is shitty, and some of the actions of the support team were lackluster... Just stop beating it up already. Feels like people are just milking the controversy dry to the bone at this point.
---
Its a bug not dupers
---
No but it opened my eyes about how
---
Much he clickbaited
---
You too dude!
---
So if a majority of people dislike Fallout 76, you except to hear and read good things about it? Or for people not to be upset about wasting $60-70 on a game that used to be part of a good franchise? The only way things change is if enough people talk about it .
---
No it was xbox
---
This is why when my stash is full I log on an alt on another account and store it in deep storage. One day I‚Äôll need those junk parts and be glad I didn‚Äôt give it to some noob who will probably just drop it on the ground.
---
Hey, if they want to take it over and deal with the molerats themselves, then so be it.
---
Can confirm. Unless I go to an SBQ fight that has a bunch of meta-build players, I can easily expect to spend 5k or more .50 cal rounds.
---
I feel like this post and almost all the comments on it are basically a copy paste of every time this has been brought up.
---
Same shit every time, just a different date it was posted 
---
Why's my man getting downvoted? he's right
---
It absolutely does not have more bugs in it than Fo76, that is just an absurd claim. 
---
When a person can have 1 cache for 5 alts.. It allows for a main character to be a main account and make it difficult for other casual players to get anywhere and allows a inflated market to happen.  
---
I don't like a shared cache idea and would prefer to see something like a auction house or a GOOD player vending infrastructure.
---
I don't doubt you.  I had read that you get them in the order of large generator &gt; windmill &gt; fusion reactor (or maybe I have the last two reversed) and that's how I got mine.
---
Is there a way to farm them?
---
Stop. Sucking. Bethesdacock.
---
Dissing people who don't like the game for being here on this subreddit but can't deal with the negative feedback related to the game on Youtube or at your workplace? Amazing.
---
You honestly compare Hello Games (No Mans Sky) an indie developer group with limited numbers and resources at their disposal WHO - may I add actually fixed their game - TO FUCKING Bethesda: a AAA company who scammed their players in multiple ways just in the past two or three months?
---
* bugs and glitches which makes the game unplayable   
---
* server instability and massive lags   
---
* constant presence of hackers (Bubblehead exploiters e.g.)   
---
* super buggy exploitable A.I.   
---
And these are just a few examples that made me stop playing this garbage of a game...but let me guess: you didn't experience any of these issues so therefore they don't exist, right? I received this game as a gift for Christmas and I honestly feel sad owning it in my collection.
---
If Fallout 76 is truly that good then go and play it instead of bitching about the "haters" in this subreddit!
---
As far as i encountered as long as you don't turn it in it is possible to collect another one.
---
Be careful to stash any excess ones, cause it will take every technical data item you have on you for the quest.
---
Or you can build your camp at a safe distance from whitespring. The is a mountain with lead ore. Never got nuked but now I placed my base more on the middle and south of the map. 
---
Thank you for this
---
Its been fun for me and educational.
---
It's a bad game, I was singing it's praises for a while, but it's just not a great game.  YOU might think otherwise and that's perfectly fine, but this is a fine example of AAA game that bombed miserably and deserves unequivocally to be on those lists.
---
They did a pretty good job of taking it online, some of the story notes and voice acting is really great but thats basically where it ends.
---
I got about 30 hours or so out of it and I can't complain too much, but i'm a big of Fallout - but compared to basically any other AAA that has come out in the last 5 years, it's a giant bomb.
---
my guess is they did this not only as a reward for early buyers because of price drops but instead to promote their new launcher    
---
anyway to use the email to login there from your bethesda account you setup seems reasonable, because its the only way to gift there the people who play on console since its pcgames either way  
---
let me know if it works out if Im right, might check out the bethesda launcher, too xD
---
I suspect it's a bunch of kids. I'm sure there are plenty of adults who play I just assume they dont throw fits over their favorite youtuber making fun of a video game on the internet
---
Have you tried changing audio settings in the actual console settings? I've just always used the quick method, maybe there is a way to disable automatic voice chat settings.
---
I definitely don't think it was worthy of the worst game that it keeps getting slapped with. 
---
I think a ton of shit was handled poorly, and to the detriment of Fallout and Bethesda as a whole. But I think the biggest sin was this feels like a cash grab, at the expense of the quality we expect from Bethesda. I don't think bugs would have been as much of a hot button issue if the game was as exciting and enjoyable as its predecessors. 
---
Really? :0
---
Just seemed like a fun event- would be a shame if it turned into simply a legendary farming spot. 
---
We need to unite and bring back the focus on the event that Bethesda made to give us players something different and fun to do ^_^
---
The whole weapon system needs a rebalance.
---
it's a bug. 
---
I too am hoping for a nerf to explosive legendaries.  I've got them... and use them on the SBQ, but I prefer just normal two shot for most things.  In the least I hope the perk card stops affecting them... I got my TSE lever up to 2400 dmg last night with the full perk, adrenal reaction, and psychobuff.
---
That's pretty genius. I'm gonna do this. I will name him Hoarder.
---
My idea is that lets say we have 20-40 people in the group. Someone posts to the group "Launching Nuke on Scorchbeat Queen in 20 minutes if anyone wants to join". You get a higher likelyhood of people joining who know whats going on and it's more organized that firing the nuke and hoping the server comes together to kill her?
---
After comparing images it seems that you are correct, it does look like a super sledge but it's using the Heavy Rocket modification from the normal sledgehammer. Can you even change the mod? I no longer have mine, but the normal sledgehammer has like 6 different mods.
---
 There are probably a lot of bugs in the game that are not noticed or thought of as intentional, such as feed the people event. 
---
Some bugs that actually aren't such as limited mines you can place. Which makes perfect sense.
---
Absolutely not. The release of the game was done terribly. They havent been doing enough. its not enough. 
---
Oh nice, they got some nice tones to them.
---
Cause it discourages players from interacting with each other.
---
Most of the previous ones added fit the aesthetic of the Fallout universe, or in the case of the new country music, the New Vegas universe. The cover of "Take me home country roads" kinda works, but positioned next to the other songs it does stand out in terms of genre and sound quality. The Beach Boys "Wouldn't it be nice" stands out more, and is the intro track to one of the most famous albums ever made (Pet Sounds). It's a bit immersion breaking.
---
to have more, you just collect more. im not sure what this question is. 
---
Everyday there seems to be a thread reddit gold silver and plat and it‚Äôs the same shit that was posted last week lol. And all it is is bitching
---
Ol' Sticky Fingers VonZappel
---
level 114 here - hopped him and the train station for a week (was prob level 96 when i started) a few hours a day and yesterday got the t51-calibrated shock plans from phoenix.
---
i've been looking for the t60 jetpack or just the mods for the t51 shocks - so was happy to get the plans finally, but still am going to hop for the jetpack.
---
i've seen the motion assist-servos like 100 times (plans and mods) tho during that time as well.  did get reactive plates mods for t51 as well during the week.
---
It's a nice weapon, but definitely not spectacular, or useful at higher levels.
---
"I like bad game. Please don't call bad game bad. You had your validation, I need mine now."
---
Try  exploring and just clearing out some of the places you've discovered, don't be afraid to leave the main quest for a little while and go back to it. Have a wander around, there are hundreds of places to clear out all full with xp :)
---
There are quite a few side quests, but you have to be near them to get them to show up in your Misc quests (any that reward legendary weapons could worth waiting till 50 as the weapon will be max level then). 
---
Bear in mind as well, if the npcs seem suspiciously higher level than you or the quest that's taking you into the area, server hop. The npc's scale to the highest level player in the area so if some guy at level 50'ish has been there that would make it tougher. That said, don't be afraid to nail npcs 10-20 levels higher than you, as long as they don't swamp you and you play smart you'll probably be able to take them without to much bother depending on build etc
---
You might not be to bothered about taking workshops, but from the defence waves alone you can get a nice chunk of xp etc and if you have 2-3 workshops you'll be able to just hop between them defending (whilst getting the resources if that's your think). Don't worry bout the pvp just turn pacifist on and if someone comes to take the workshop, you can server hop and start again, take it back once they run of (or crash lol) or give the pvp a chance.
---
If you see a blast zone at White springs or somewhere like that, throw your PA on pop some rads and check it out, the XP is insane in White springs for example. You'll prob end up with some nice loot that others can't make the space to carry as well, yeah there are asshats everywhere but for the most part people are cool in the blast zones :)
---
Not sure about your build as I'm melee all the way at the moment but it should make to much difference but maybe someone Sniperish can help you on that side of it.
---
It also mostly triggers by entering the school so some people might not even know it is there at all unless they happen to check the map when someone has triggered it already.
---
did you just say frostbite is just as old?
---
frostbite was not around in 1998, no. 
---

"This is unacceptable Bethesda!" 
---
Never change, reddit 
---
Also why use any energy weponds right now when they make the corpse unlootable. I have an ultracite TSE laser pistol and can barely use it. 
---
Every trip to the Whitesprings I visit Bubbles on the second floor, only one per trip. I currently have 20 on hand, I give them out to new players often. With 9 CHA they cost 31 caps.
---
Feedback: friends only/locally hosted mode. 
---
A big chunk of issues simply go away and stay away with this feature it's the single most pronounced fix they can make.
---
Glad you guys like it!
---
I‚Äôve met a handful of folks who play along, even in pvp, and it‚Äôs extremely fun when it plays out. Even if we all aren‚Äôt hardcore into rp. 
---
From what Ive gathered, especially after much discussion, is that there are Raiders who play within the boundaries provided by the mechanics of the game, using perk cards which deal more damage to player structures, using weapons that do additional player damage, etc. 
---
And then the griefers who will keep coming back and stay in your spawn just to spite you and won‚Äôt leave you alone. 
---
There‚Äôs an honorable way of doing this, and many peoples perspective on the situation, names of parties involved are highly misunderstood. 
---
Set my base on the North side of Charleston train station. The long bridge to the north of the station. A short distance across that bridge is a crashed rail car with radiation barrels inside.
---
&gt; Nobody pvps there.
---
I do.
---
It's okay to blow things to kibbles and bits with a metric shit tonne of violence but don't use chems? 
---
Am I the only one missing something here? I mean Fallout series basically has every infraction it can have to be rated M, so everything else is okay as long as you don't use chems for their intended purpose? 
---
Especially in 76, where your stats don't really matter. Intelligence doesn't make hacking easier like it used so, charisma is a joke and barely makes a noticeable difference in price so...
---
I will disagree on one place, NMS did get this much noise. NMS's noise didn't stop. Even now when most of it finally has gone (adn it took that big update last year to get most of it to stop), you will still have some one bitterly tell you that you shouldn't like NMS and support scams like that.
---
And one big difference is Hello Games actually started doing things right.They shut up, didn't do anything to feed the noise (Sure, they didn't say anything to try to quell it the first few months but nothing from them would have as people wanted to find anything to hate), and started fixing the game.
---
Personally I liked NMS from the start (it had balance issues though which finally have been resolved). But the hate train was just as strong as 76's.... the only difference? And it pains for me to say it as Bethesda makes my favorite games. 76 deserved it more.
---
That being said, I otherwise agree with you, it gets really tiring and I wish people who didn't like the game would move on already. Yeah, it has issues. It still is a fun game and it still has some stuff Bethesda does right. And it would have been better a single player game honestly (I bet people wouldn't be near as upset at the bugs if it was... honestly it doesn't seem that much overly buggy than their normal games).
---
I've only done it the one time and everything was empty for me as well.
---
Oh boy, more workbench plans.
---
you can do it (people certainly do it) by buying another copy, with friends or even befriending strangers. hell, there's an entire sub dedicated to anchors.
---
the lack of a stash is only hurting honest players. then again, I'm pretty sure it's in Beth's best interests to make players replay the little content there is ad nauseam.
---
There's no "identity crisis". Just people who can't accept the idea of a Fallout being multiplayer. Well, Fallout 76 is. Maybe you should play another game?
---
Snipers *can* farm Whitesprings safely. I should know, I main Sniper and Pistols. So if even I, with an unfinished Sniper build can do it, I'm sure everyone can.
---
I'm not hiding behind "literal meanings"; I'm using facts (which you seem to dislike, for some weird reason).
---
Fact: Fallout 76 is online, multiplayer, whatever you want to call it.
---
Fact: people have a trading system in-game, with a general currency, and they are able to set their own prices.
---
I'm sorry that you don't like these facts. Like I said, maybe you should check out other games, friend (or should I say "fiend"? üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
*Lung cancer intensifies*
---
big yikes from me.
---
I guess I don't see why adding damage perks to intelligence doesn't help with the problem of low damage.  Being able to be flexible with what stats you use for your damage traits would also have a side benefit of leading to some more interesting builds.
---
Nothing saying they can't benefit from both rifle perks AND a new energy weapon perk.  I'm going to be a bit disappointed if they don't add new perk cards over time.
---
This is the price of fucking up so hard for Bethesda. It's just a shame that you have to suffer through it.
---
To me now, it's like cliche. It almost feels like punching down now, particularly when people like Yongyea, who have been fairer that most, keep relitigating Every. Single. Misdeed. before talking about the next issue, good or bad. It's like that partner or sibling that brings up every single past issue while trying to win the current argument. Says more about you than the person you're trying to frame in a bad light.
---
I was on a lead deposit as well and it just seems that all the lead locations are crap. I'd randomly have 3 scorch beasts show up every now and then and just trash the place. Now I'm on a junk node near the edge of the map by deathclaw island. There's two not too far from each other along the rivers coast. Good spot for star berries or whatever they're called. Good source of water and you get a level 20+ deathclaw to spawn periodically. Not great loot drops but a steady supply of black titanium. 
---
Check silos before going into one.  Don't build so close to whitespring.  Problem solved.
---
Did you just say the Creation Engine was around in 1998?  
---
Well you're wrong.  
---
Gamebryo (Which Creation is heavily based off) may be that old but Creation isn't.
---
If you're not using armor you need a team to stack empath and if you have it too a serum to suppress. Without a team don't carry junk into big fights and since you're going to be in mobs face when you inevitably die you'll get tons of milage out of last laugh with orbital strike beacons. 
---
Source: am a low life build.
---
No already had em
---
I think the idea is a smaller stash that is shared between characters (say, 50 capacity) there just to help transfer items.  This would not combine all stashes (3000 capacity ) but give a shared box between all toons.
---
Can't put my finger on what exactly is the most disturbing thing here.
---
Question, how does that pistol reload?
---
Is it atrocious like the single action revolver?
---
I don't understand why anyone watches YouTubers for commentary on the first place unless the commentary is just hilarious. I can't stand to watch a five minute video that disseminates info I could have read in 15 seconds. 
---
Still don't follow. And more to the point, I've never seen this happen in any of the other games I mentioned. Elder Scrolls Online, for example, currently has up to 15 characters per server, all of them share a bank. It has zero effect on casual players, and the market. Exact same thing in The Division, and others. All of those are MMO or multiplayer games. Other games allow easy transfer of items via mail, or some other means. EVE Online, for example, allows you to contract items and other things from one character to another, including your own character on the same account. That game, by the way, came out in 2003, and is still very much alive today (/r/eve) and nothing happened to casual players or the game's economy as a result.
---
In short, past history doesn't bear our your assertion.
---
No one was in a silo before me.
---
My base isn't in Whitespring, it's on the outskirts of it.
---
i would say luck with the server. Playing from germany too i experienced quite a bit of lag the last days and got disconnected twice this evening. 
---
Now it may be the routing of my ISP, but it isnt my connection.
---
It also does rarely occur in the morning, so i highly suspect this is related to overweight mules or dupers that are more likely to be active in the evening. If that is the case it is just pure luck who is joining your server.
---
I'm not saying they are the best period  but they do exceptional damage per their weight and they are comparable to super sledges etc. Everyone doesn't want to haul a big slow 10 pounder around. You asked why and I told you. 
---
Not really 'ha ha' funny. More like crap your pants funny. Maybe, that crap is running down your leg into your shoes and now you leaving crap footprints as you run to the bathroom. Possibly even, this shoe-crap incident happens while having dinner at a fancy restaurant to meet with your future in-laws for the first time and right next to your table is your future boss. Yeah, it is that kind of funny.
---
West Virginia's college football team hasn't won a game since FO76 came out.
---
While listening to the Commodores even! *Shakes Walker back*
---
Typically with big guns... I see them drop the gun all the time.  It's not always on their corpse.  Especially if you tag them in the arm, they'll drop it.  Granted... a lot of the time they drop the gun mid fight, if you pick it up, it just vanishes... so theres that.
---
I solo played from 1-72 when I made my first online friend in the game.  I spent the better part of a month controlling workshops and farming the defend events. I never sank huge amounts of resources in so I always stayed ahead on caps and junk. This allowed me to get basically free exp often and I could go out and explore and do events which yielded caps items and exp.   
---
It was hard for a while but as gear came along with general progression it was easier. I am now 198 on my main and everything is to easy now.   
---
I just rerolled a strict BoS player (in shielded BoS fatigues which doesn't say shielded), I had to do fists until level 5 when I could use my self gifted laser pistol. The other challenge is no perk cards except the ones I get from the packs until level 50 when I will start questing so I can get all level 50 rewards also have 0 added special points right now.  I am level 19 already in just a few hours doing workshops . Also up to 1k in caps all this is solo.   
---
As for setting up your camp that is a personal preference. I have two at whitespring, one in toxic valley for the junk/lead resources you can farm and the BoS guy doesn't have one yet.   
---
Honestly every weapon until you are running silos is viable. It is better to focus on one maybe two types max though as you start to become less effective if trying to get all the damage perks for the weapons.   
---
Also my first silo was at level 49 I soloed it and nuked toxic valley since I didn't know about whitesprings or prime it took two hours and a lot of swearing after that it takes me next to no time. So it can all be done solo including the queen, you need a lot of shit to do that though and pray if someone does show up it is not some low level making it worse.   
---
It took me a while but I have come around to the MP aspect it is fun to go on group rampages or just to a have a safety anchor when taking a lot of workshops. I started out by asking someone if I could team but not play together so I didn't lose all my workshops. they sent in invite and it was all good from that point.   
---
I had effectively done everything including getting a scrochbeast queen before I ever had a person on my friends list. 
---
I really don't think that's an accurate analogy. Bethesda has been pretty responsive to everything, and the community is barely a month old. So "dark and disconnected" isn't quite accurate. If a year from now we're still complaining about the spare tire thing, then I'll 100% agree with your comment :)
---
the creation engine is literally just gamebryo homie. it's pretty well known. especially when at the time, they said it was "a fork of gamebryo". modders looked and said otherwise. 
---
You. I like you. You do go on a bit dont you? I came here on this sub for advise on the game but ended up jumping on the bandwagon of hate too. For a while. Then I realised I should stop being a little kid (like most of the fan base are because it is a video game) and GET THE FUCK OVER IT. I love this game screw the ridicule that makes the game even cooler for me.
---
This guy is officially worse than what he‚Äôs railing against
---
I mean if I made a game right now it would be an objectively bad game.
---
I think third party perspective is important when we‚Äôre differentiating between personal taste and objective ratings. 
---
People rate opinions on an objective scale, that‚Äôs how websites like rotten tomatoes, meta critic, ign, etc make money.
---
So personally you may like it, but from a third party perspective (everyone else rating it) it‚Äôs a bad game. 
---
Sorry bro that‚Äôs just the way it is
---
About how much camp space does a pet take? I've been downsizing and pacifying like crazy, but I can't seem to get it right.
---
I've had robots stuck in the ground.
---
These sorts of problems are usually fixed by fast travelling away and fast travelling back again.
---
Lol this is what would happen if Bethesda designed a Reddit post
---
spoiley meat. 
---
Yeah I have no idea what's going on.
---
You can collect more than one technical data, they just display as 'just one' in your inventory, but they do stack. In fact, the more of those you collect, the better (better in case of quantity, not neccesarily in quality) is the reward.
---
High standards and vocal opinions are what makes industries better. Keep in mind if your playing on PC then your experience is significantly different than those on base consoles. Those people were given a completely broken game that by my standards is still unplayable to this day.
---
Not enough to spell his name correctly apparently :P lol
---
No shit EA crossed that threshold and got fucked lol maybe it won't happen again as these companies are seeing what the backlash can cause.
---
I have an anti-armor explosive gat plasma is has another rare effect but i cant remember it. That thing is my fucking problem solver, but it breaks too fast. :c 
---
I‚Äôm sorry I triggered you
---
After all you yiked first, i just wanted to speak to you in a way you‚Äôd understand bruh bruh 
---
Shouldn't have worried about your base if the SQB was about to pop over at your nuke....grab that ammo and gogogo otherwise she be dead before you get there and that's no fun!
---
Timing did suck though yeah :/
---
My base is just over by the train station at White springs and the only time its been nuked is by me, its just the right amount away to not interfere with the spawns. Pretty central on the map near a station vendor and literally a 30 seconds run to the usual blast zone in White Springs. If its on the course itself its going to get destroyed constantly and annoy other players which is just asking for it to be nuked or smashed to pieces.
---
&gt;unfortunately no, it only works for team mates as far as I can tell.
---
If you share it with a team it'll proc for everyone, including you. All it takes is 1 other person to share it with, and as long as you stay reasonably close to each other you almost never need radaway. 
---
Soooo, I got a godroll explosive two-shot shotgun. And I'm supposed to what? Give it to another player, and pray to whatever god I worship that they don't just run off with it? Because Bethesda customer support sure as fuck isn't going to help if they do. Is that your idea of encouraging player interaction?
---
Or am I supposed to sell the shotgun to another player, and again pray to whatever gods I worship that another player has the same one, and will be willing to sell it to me, for a comparable price?
---
If you want to encourage player interaction, I'd argue we need *tools* to interact with each other first. That means text chat, global (server) trade text chat, barter UI (note, barter means I give you item A, you give me item B, currently it's impossible to do in this game, but games literally 20 years old had this), guild/clan support, etc. Those things will encourage player interaction. Me having to find some mook who is willing to transfer thousands of rounds of ammo between 5 characters? Not easy, not reliable, dangerous. 
---
Kids grow up so fast these days \* sniff \*
---
Drop all your unneeded holotapes + notes. I found I seldom crash when accessing my inventory after I got rid of them all.
---
That‚Äôs is one bloodthirsty level 6, good on him for rolling with the big boys though.
---
Happy hunting, Ad Victoriam 
---
You're mistaking Fallout 4 for the rest of their games. They did have a small amount of choice in 3 and Skyrim as well. Though you can see the trend for them to keep reducing the choices in each of those games from oldest to newest. 
---
And also, unlike Rockstar, you don't have to follow the Brotherhood, you can decide to go with the Railroad or the Institute. You are going to follow Dutch and you are going to do what he says until he is the death of you. Hell, RDR 1 was worse. At one point they even have John say he's going into a trap, then they have him go in it even though it was painfully obvious (I was like do I really have to go in there) and then he's fucking surprised when it was a trap!!!!! You had no choice in it and the writing was dumb about it on top (I much prefer RDR 2 and its story to 1 honestly. I had a lot of pet peeves with 1).
---
IN the end, that's ok, Rockstar isn't trying to make an RPG and they weren't trying to give you a game where you had options, you're playing their story. Bethesda is weaker cause they are trying to make a game with options where you play your own character. And they don't do it well.
---
He got rare Outfits like Witch costume, Hunters Long Coat and Clean Spacesuit. 
---
&gt;There's no "identity crisis".
---
the game doesn't excel at singleplayer, it doesn't excel at multiplayer. seems like an identity crisis to me. and a lot of other people as well.
---
&gt;Snipers can farm Whitesprings safely.
---
and what do you do when literally everyone else bum rushes the ghouls inside the golf house and you can't hit squat because they're out of your view? because that's how most Whitesprings nukes go.
---
&gt;I'm not hiding behind "literal meanings"; I'm using facts
---
and ignoring others. yes, Fo76 is multiplayer. but does it play like a multiplayer game? not exactly. yes, trading caps constitutes a transaction. does it mean the game has a real market as defined by WoW, EVE, etc.? no.
---
Can I swap the gauss with the auto grenade launcher plans? 
---
That explains why i know i hit a legendary, but when i went to loot it was empty. Thought the game glitched out and didn't recognize my hit, even though i did damage. 
---
People are talking shit about FO76 because it's a flop. No Man's Sky didn't get this much shit because it wasn't Bethesda and it wasn't a "Fallout" game. Plus NMS fixed their game. If you don't want the "clickbait" videos then just download the video blocker extension and block the channel. Pressure needs to be on Bethesda because they are notorious for letting bugs run rampant throughout their game, only to be fixed by the community that actually cares. 
---
Youtubers that you liked that are calling the game out are doing so because the criticism is valid. 
---
&gt; Because everyone is acting like the game is in the exact same state it was on the day of launch and it's almost maddening.
---
Some things have been fixed, most things have not. It's maddening because its true. 
---
Is it not ignorant of a AAA company to have a basic function like a compass work correct?
---
Compasses work in free mobile games
---
Nah it's deserved and you just want to feel better about your bad purchase 
---
... there's no achievement for hunter/hunted. 
---
Give it a day or two.
---
If all are broken, you can just move camp and they'll be repaired and in your Stored tab.
---
That's pretty bad luck, though. For what it's worth: i have solo cleared silo to launch nuke at SBQ, only to find myself crashing when shes at 10% and not getting her loot or event reward. Basically wasting an hr + 1500x 5mm ammo, etc. This has happened twice. Not to mention times I've dc'ed right after launching a nuke.
---
I like that The Forest just got a pretty decent update which I'm sure most publishers would of called DLC and charged $15 for
---
I stole Christmas once... 
---
Yes but not the same,  and then you finished that by saying it's not a fork.  
---
Point being they rejuvenated or modded it in some way since, it's not the same engine. Heck using 76's version of Creation isn't the same engine. Like I mentioned with the ATLAS system.
---
There's about 10-15 ghouls plus either a wendigo or bloated glowing that spawn in the white springs golf club.  Additionally several more 3-6 spawn points throughout the houses around the main whitesprings building.  Kicker is, everytime someone logs into that zone (or travels to it for the first time since connecting) the entire place respawns.  And respawns to the new players level.
---
It's why people nuke whitesprings.  The sheer number of high level mobs, means there are about to be about 5% legendary.  Meaning high level loot.
---
I think I was level 25 or 30 before I left the forest, so more power to you! I'm 86 now and still haven't been to the cranberry bog. Theres just so much everywhere to do!
---
Water and Crops
---
Excellent plan. I try to kill anything I spawn if I know a location is commonly passed. If I go into a building (somewhere like sugar grove let‚Äôs say) I‚Äôll kill the stuff inside and hopefully it‚Äôll spawn for other people at appropriate level when I‚Äôm gone. 
---
Keep telling yourself that.
---
Have a level 50 one, but won't be online for at least a day, so if you wont find it by then hit me up.
---
Just got the plans last week off SBQ. I need to farm more nuked flora now.
---
I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs good, I agree that it has huge problems despite enjoying it. However you actually presented a good argument, thank you.
---
Get someone else to shoot it
---
I've played it for quite a while and had no major issues. Minor grievances but shit happens. I think people are over-sensitive.
---
my guess is everything is already made/finished    
---
to swap out and add available items and do limited sales is just something to lure people into spending more atoms and keep the atom shop interesting   
---
if everything would be there from the start people would check out the shop once and never open it again
---
I think the argument is that if you have to relog in order for the game to operate the way it should then it isn‚Äôt a well fleshed out game 
---
If we could build those turrets they would have been surrounding Whitesprings from day 1. Well, day -1, because BETA.
---
I just threw up in my mouth a little bit.
---
Sure, they made changes, but the reason people don't acknowledge them is because 99% of them aren't good/wanted/needed changes. Like for god fucking shit they made a "common issues and solutions" forum instead of fixing/remedying these issues. Who fucking does that? Just fix your goddamn shit.
---
Hubba hubba.
---
Or they could just fix it.
---
I am 138 mate. Found 2 Calibrated shocks also. Apart from this plan I've never had any other good one appear. 
---
Honestly, I mostly agree with OP but I disagree that NMS didn't get this much obnoxious noise. It very much did. And it took years for the noise mostly to stop. Even now though you have some holders on who will get offended if you like the game and tell you you should hate them and you're encuoraging bad games blah blah blah.
---
Very nice, light wooden laminate flooring from the atom shop. Offscreen there‚Äôs a staircase in this camp and the dude building his base prolly fell to his death
---
How‚Äôd you get those signs unlocked? I want those 
---
Stop crying about it and accept and enjoy your shitty game
---
Trickling it in so people use their points on it. If it's there from the get-go people are less apt to buy it later
---
Think of powerarmor as a generic defense. High numbers with little effort.
---
Regular armor can do some crazy cool specialized stuff. Incredible sneaking, immunity to PvP, hilariously high special and damage with low health, and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs plenty of other things.
---
Not everyone is you. If he wants to spend his time playing games while on workers disability, it's very possible.
---
I remember in my younger years, no-lifing Diablo 2 Hardcore with friends, definitely put in more than 9+ hours in a single day at times.
---
:/
---
That sucks! But it happens! I know for sure you can pick up at least 32 clipboards there. That‚Äôs my go to place for springs.
---
I think the hate has more to do with what happened after the game was released, not with the game itself. Every time the hate train slowed down something new would happen that would put fo76 in a bad light, keeping the train going. I also think that the main reason people give it more hate than no man's sky is because of the many great memories people have from playing their games and it just feels bad to see your hero fall from grace.
---
No joke, it‚Äôs posts like this that make me realize how young Reddit‚Äôs users are. This shit has always happened and always will. Nothing new, let it run its course and in the long run people will view the game as ‚Äúnot good‚Äù but everyone will forget about the absolute shit blasting it‚Äôs getting right now 
---
don't know about your question but the game does suffer from fps drops on PC. maybe not if you got a good rig, but definitely those goddamn stutters.
---
and mods can get you banned, apparently.
---
God Dammit!  If your "still playing" it then it is not a "money sponge"!
---
So, what does that make you? Good? You‚Äôre not good...you just know how to hide....
---
Say goodnight to the bad guy!! Last time you gonna see a bad guy like this again lemme tell ya
---
I agree with it getting super obnoxious. I have liked gameranx for awhile now and i was very close to unsubscribing because for almost a month straight they needed to include 76 in everyone of their videos with even one video not even including 76 in anyway but having it in the thumbnail picture. It 100% has become a meme ive been saying this for awhile now lol glad other people get it
---
They are there on purpose.
---
Yeah, some quests are best to be avoided till 50. So when they give you legendary weapons, they will drop at 50. It's annoying because there's no way to upgrade the level of legendary drops from quests so they are locked at that level. Hopefully they change that in a future update.
---
And I can easily take on 3 scorchbeasts at the same time.. BUT only if they aren't spamming the Sonic attack. It's stagger rate is disgusting, and it chews through your armor. If they fix the AI on it, and the fact that they can hit you perfectly with it even when they are flying away, then they wouldn't be so bad.
---
They do need a fix though, I'll give you that
---
I‚Äôm aware, and valentine has a line in reference to that
---
Fuck Juicehead. 
---
That is all. 
---
Try signing in with a bethesda account on both?
---
Yeah but where exactly? The place ain't exactly small...
---
Essentially herd mentality.
---
The thing I learned as a solo player is that you have to inch through the game for it to be at a fair level every step of the way. Make sure to explore everything you come across, explore all of one segment of the map before moving onto the next one etc.
---
It's a pain in the arse if you're more a main quest only player or aren't into that kind of slow paced gameplay but that's the best way I've found to keep things at a reasonable level without feeling like you're being held back.
---
&gt; But when the devs are actively making changes, are listening to our feedback 
---
Friendly reminder that they haven't to my knowledge acknowledged the duping situation (If I'm wrong please let me know because i would love to be) Even as it destroys multiple aspects of the game and I personally don't  have high hopes for the upcoming pvp mode with a million TSEs floating around illegitimately. They have acknowledge somethings, like balance changes things for CAMPs, and bugs, this is an exploit that has been around for a while and very destructive. If someone would like to prove me wrong I welcome it but before writing this I checked Fallout twitter, Bethesda twitter, and Beth Support twitter, and u/BethesdaReplied back about \~3 weeks and couldn't find anything. Bethesda tells us that they want to improve communication and they care about what we think about things yet they have such a massive issue and seem to want to pretend it doesn't exist, it's insulting at this point, if it takes them time to fix an issue that's fine but saying it exists does not and goes a long way.
---
(also this not the community managers fault as I'm sure they aren't allowed to mention it)
---
Yep, that would work. Next step would also be to allow us to mail COD items to other players, it's very, very, **very** popular in Elder Scrolls Online. Two players in zone chat, one asks if anyone has X, the other replies I have X at $Y. First player responds "Great, COD me!" and the second player just mails the item, with cash-on-delivery amount. Other player receives it, and pays the amount, and gets the item. Safe, secure, quick, convenient. Game's been out for nearly half a decade now. WoW has the same thing, been out for 14 years. And so on. Very, very, very common system. 
---
If you actually want to use this wepon, i'd say server hop until you get the ultracite laser plan from the BoS vendor (should be about 800ish caps). Normal laser mods do not work on ultracite lasers and they are pretty rare drops. Only consistent way to get mods is to craft and scrap. 
---
I just log out and come back in again. Things tend to sort themselves out.
---
Have you ever played a Bethesda game ever?
---
You just have to be patient. Bartering is on its way
---
225
---
When you are coding and find literally that one illegitimate character which was causing multiple bugs - yep hallelujah. 
---
Flea in the haystack.
---
Sentinel gear is pretty op as long at you‚Äôre not moving. The PA has some hidden inherent resistances that normal armor can‚Äôt compare to, unless it‚Äôs heavy marine armor with rad resist and even then PA still has more rad resist.
---
Indont agree with the hate but i do agree the game needs improving i have uninstalled it just like bo4 until they get what they need
---
Meh, I would just move on.
---
It regens at 50%, same as any other legendary. And probably they didn't want to stagger her so she would end up permanently in the air, but 30min seems way too long of a time, they could have blasted her from the sky with explosive weapons before that.
---
But you don't have to be genius to figure out that it is smarter to store your junk before you go into PVP. Chances them you have actually something to drop is close to 0 and even when they do, those few screws and ballistic fiber cost like nothing.
---
That‚Äôs nice for the newcomers because that‚Äôs a low lvl zone. Once you‚Äôre higher and don‚Äôt want to server hop, here‚Äôs a quicker method. 
---
Go to **Watoga Emergency Services**, equip **Pharma Farma** lvl3 in Luck tree, and search the 2 floors full of med kits/doctor bags/mirrors. Once you‚Äôre finished searching **just leave the building and re-enter, all the searches will be refreshed.**
---
Even Fallout 4 allowed you to finish the main story with different factions, sometimes resulting in different quests. 
---
I have the game on xbox, and PC. Nothing crosses over. Not friends, atoms, characters, etc.
---
Sorry to the people that actually do enjoy the game I am glad that some can find joy in this game...I am just still in shock about how this game turned out 
---
Your fanboy tantrum has been noted and disregarded.
---
My gt is the grateproter msg me when you get on
---
Hmmm I wonder why you would ever be downvoted for saying a completely moronic and short sided statement. What a fucking mystery. 
---
.
---
/s just Incase you couldn‚Äôt tell I wasn‚Äôt serious 
---
fair point
---
Ad Victoriam, brother. 
---
Yeah I'd love to see logs of your gameplay, length played, played with others, what events, how many times the servers stopped responding, or lagged and for how long, how many bugs and issues you came across but aren't going to mention here, and how many disconnects.
---
Or how about the simple task of adding a friend or joining a friend's server - how many times had that fucked up?
---
There's no excuse. I'd gladly take Todd's budget and then I'll partner with Zeni Studis (TESO) to bring what they've learned about building and supporting their game to craft the best in class Fallout MMO hybrid experience. I'll use the UE engine and I'll have crossplay on PC, consoles, and devices. You'll be able to play and progress in the game in many ways (full game experience or smaller game experiences on smaller devices).
---
Most of all - I won't ask my game community to fucking report bugs on Reddit. Unprofessional. Stupid. Ignorant. 
---
I wouldn't need to post "we heard you and we promise to talk more" and go silent again. I know MMOs require constant attention. I'd have a core community team and I'd have each of the developers and designers rotate in and out to help and give them a creative break to just enjoy the games community and get fresh perspectives to bring back to the team and result in a better game.for all of us.
---
I'd have a fucking TEST SERVER for testing patches. Like everything in software development whether you have $10 or $100,000 you always have multiple environments for fucks sake.
---
And this is a company with revenue of $1,000,000+. Their parent company is worth what 1.2 billion?
---
For reasons that are explained in the game, oddly enough.
---
There are serious issues with the game right now, and not calling them out is stupid.  I had to stop playing because I don't game to get frustrated every 30 minutes either lag or kicks. There are so many bugs in the game as well. 
---
While the interwebs community blows it out of proportion,  they make some valid points. 
---
Not a big difference, I'd probably lean towards the console your friends play on. 
---
I do believe the vaults are already confirmed to be raid based instances (4 man dungeons). Some people glitches into them and got some info about it one the terminals. 
---
Lol I can‚Äôt imagine getting this defensive over someone saying a video game is bad. 
---
It‚Äôs ok dude, you don‚Äôt actually have any investment in Bethesda (except for the hundreds of dollars you‚Äôve given them over the years) 
---
It‚Äôs ok to say something isn‚Äôt good. I was the biggest Halo fan ever until they released Halo 4. That wasn‚Äôt even that bad of a game and I‚Äôm willing to admit it wasn‚Äôt up to par.
---
But did you read it?
---
partially done on purpose so it looks a little intimidating from the outside
---
You're going to get FPS drops and crashes on PC as well...
---
I'd be very surprised if your purchases and such transfer over since there's no cross play and servers don't seem to be tied together to facilitate such a transfer.
---
I respectfully disagree and I believe that if Subnautica developers could do it, a fully fledged AAA studio should have also been able to do it just as well if not better. Nothing stopped F76 from being released in early access and tested until it worked, then released. The fact it is MP should not be an excuse. They chose to make a MP game right? And lastly, their response afterwards was, in my opinion, lacking. It was honestly a big turn off. And this is coming from a huge Bethesda supporter, but their reaction to this gave me pause. 
---
But honestly, I am happy that you enjoy the game! 
---
I hope you can also understand how I just do not want this standard of product release seen as sufficient in this industry, when in my eyes it is not. 
---
Juice head says he's done with the game and posts videos about how bad it is, then turns around and releases a new video on the best perks or weapons. He's probably released more videos than any one, but a lot of them are unfounded drivel repeated from reddit.
---
Cannot get behind that bloke. Started following him during the Greenbriar event and lost interest after beta due to his clear click bait nature.
---
Don't get me wrong, there are worse haters who are 100% against 76 and yet release new videos almost daily, but he seems to cause a fair amount of band wagoning due to his popularity. And he does apologise if he gets things wrong, but it's usually too little too late. 
---
Almost cool until he spelled it like Linda from HR would. :p
---
But, I just traded my Brahmin for some magic beans. Are you saying I was conned?
---
Wasn't that when he was discussing seeing thing so the map?  Cause it probably does have 16 times the detail in the distance.  Granted fo4 things became actual rectangles when you weren't in their cell so it wouldn't have to improve much, but that seems way too vague to be flat considered a lie.
---
Nah ... I agree about NPCs, but not companions.
---
Maybe for Fallout 5, but not FO76.
---
You think youre someone? Lmao
---
When you have exploiters ruining the gameplay for other players and profiting off of it, how can you not be fed up with the bullshit?
---
Same goes with other exploits and bugs that are not being addressed.  And where is BGS at?  When are they going to do their ‚Äúweekly updates?‚Äù
---
It sounds kinda like you never found the silly weapon Aeternus from Nuka-World. Sacrafice 1 fusion core for unlimited ammo as long as you held down the trigger.
---
It would seem to require little effort.
---
If a weapon is Ballistic or Energy or radiation, its damage is tagged thus.  Armour is similarly tagged thus.  We can literally see these in the menus.
---
So the equations for modifying damage must have defaulted to ballistic damage and not included a variable for type?  Is that what we think?
---
In Fallout 4, until you got super strong weapons, it was often a good idea to change weapon for the foe.  Energy for synths, radiation for living organisms.
---
Strange.  
---
I was always glad to pick up energy weapons in 76, until I also realised how UP they were.  My TSE gatling is stupidly powerful even compared to automatic laser sniper rifles.  Silly.
---
I hate how people shit on the game yet they never play it for themselves. Like if you want a real opinion play the game yourself.  I like the game. The crashes and the lagging can ruin the gae. 
---
Thank You.
---
I don‚Äôt know much space. I‚Äôll have to check that out. I do know that only some animals can be trained. A different option comes up next to pacify, then it‚Äôll ask if you want to send it back to your camp 
---
Some are genuinely entertaining and funny: OutsideXbox
---
Some are really insightful and give you something to think about: Extra Credits 
---
Some do a great job of finding diamonds in the rough and discussing games that don't get talked about anywhere else. 
---
I definitely don't watch for people opinions on games. They need to inform or entertain. My tastes are different enough that I don't trust reviewers to match what I like even 60% of the time (50% being pure random chance). 
---
That ship has sailed m8. Its all about the legendaries.
---
Actually no one is trying to transfer anything between accounts you totally misread my entire post...
---
if memory serves, they banned a guy that used a mod to make gore piles green and thus more noticeable.
---
it's kinda hard to gauge what constitutes as cheating.
---
I guess he takes raider RP seriously. I also think the 8 level 70+ players were salty that a level 6 was sneaking up on them and killing them with his board. They went into full rage mode against us. It was great fun. 
---
This feedback loop is needed. If it bothers you so much, block keywords including Fallout 76, FO76, etc. Regardless of what you think - the game was and is an utter shitshow. Bethesda deserves every bit of meme'd hatred they're getting. Your post tries to sum up the hatred as some giant meme, but the game is not good, it's not finished and it does the Fallout brand name a disservice. It's literally so bad that people made it a verb to be interjected when you want to convey shit.
---
I honestly can't believe you got Gold for this shitpost either.
---
We definitely need to give Bethesda shit for this because I love this game but holy fuck it is not a finished project there‚Äôs stability issues and multiple crashes and horrible lag and a great but short story that barely takes you through most of the world with arbitrary limit on gameplay options because of some dumb statement now I know this game will be great but they won‚Äôt work hard unless we make them work for our respect 
---
Lube for sale, mostly blood free!!
---
I agree it is too much at this point. I also have to say they deserved it. That simple. Only thing is that I'm pretty sure No Man's Sky had less than 10 people produce the game as opposed to Bethesda's hundreds.... correct me if I'm wrong.... That would be why it didn't get it as bad. 
---
damn I stopped picking up clipboards for some reason...  I think I need 30 springs to finish my power excavator armor.
---
Ya know what? Respect. This is role playing done right.
---
What I'm saying is the motives for PvP are as poorly strung together as the mechanics. A small group of survivors, in a region devoid of human life, would be far better off marshalling their meager resources than fighting each other. That would apply in a vacuum, let alone the scenario present by the game, which is a team trained specifically for that task.
---
That's insightful, thank you!
---
I got a ton before the mission triggered so i could stack them and deposit them in my Stash. After getting the mission for the first time it now triggers once i pick one up in the wild. Any picked up while the deposit mission is active are lost. The ones in my stash i can rarely use to trigger the mission if i drop them or put them into a container and retrieve them but i haven't found exactly how to do it consistently. It only works some of the time.
---
welllll, if it wasn't shit
---
That's something that has really put me off about this game.   Dupers are the ones who are thriving.  The game basically rewards it.  I don't want to share a game world with people involved in such practices. 
---
This such a stupid comment. You can't compare a game and a car. One is software. It can be updated over time.
---
What in your opinion stopped F76 from following that model and instead insisting on calling it a full release? And can you understand how some maybe mad that a game was released as a full game that could be compared feature wise to another game in early access? 
---
This is the best story, gonna have to share with my friend. Thanks for the heart warmer
---
Thanks for the input but I don't have the budget to build a pc at the moment üòÖ
---
Probally you drop it and just milking views
---
Omg, I had a good long lol over this. People at work were startled. 
---
Due to them bailing I don't have any friends playing 
---
I love how people use the phrase ‚Äúhate train‚Äù to dilute the fact that the game at release and in current state is unacceptable. 
---
I'm on. My gt is TheG00dN00dle. Just join my world 
---
FWIW, if a bot spawns it doesn't mean you got him. As bots spawning (for me) seems pretty common, but that's all that spawns. No merchant.
---
No he caught it. So I had a bear at my camp and it was in a pretty safe place but one server I logged onto had 3 scrotchbeast flying around the area for some reason. One of scorchbeast ended up attacking my house and did that fly by move where he drops the green mist and that is what turns creatures into scorched (I didn't not know that). Eventually I ended up shooting it down and checked on my bear and he was now scorched. Because of this he was agro all the time and would constantly try to attack me and destroy my bases if I wasn't around. Now because it is a tamed pet it doesn't actually do any damage to me or the base but it meant that he would either always be in my face and/or he would be making the grunting noise when he attacks ALL OF THE TIME. Even when i logged into a server he would reload back as being scorched. I figured it was time to put him down but when you shoot you own pet it doesn't do any damage. I had to go out and find another tamed animal just to replace it just to get of it.
---
So kids make sure you keep your tamed pet safe and away from Scorchbeasts or they become really annoying.
---
We use a PS Chat group which allows 8 people. Some people wait or we jump to a new server if needed. I stopped at one point and said ‚Äúwe account for more than 25% of the population of this server.‚Äù
---
Me too! You bypass the vault door and elevators üí™üèΩ
---
Have they confirmed it? I heard player vending is coming, but didn't hear anything about barter. And it still doesn't solve the problem of logistics, when one alt has a buttload of useless stuff, but another needs it, and you have to inconvenience another player for quite a while (given how long loading screens can be) to get it done.
---
Ammo is the best example - can't vendor it, can't use it on my melee char, it's just wasting space. So I have to find another player willing to mule it for me. And I give him 4032 rounds of 5.56. But he already had 3902 rounds of his own, so now he has to remember to give me back precisely 4032 rounds out of the 7934 rounds he now has. Multiply that by each ammo type, and it's a huge mess. The guy needs a piece of paper and a pencil to keep track of ammo comings and goings, especially of those 4032 rounds of 5.56 need to be spread out across 3 alts! Each of which needs to be loaded in, and traded with. It's a huge pain. And that's IF they're willing to do it AND you trust them with godroll items. If one of these isn't true, the whole system breaks.
---
OR, we do as I suggest - shared stash box. Alt A logs in, takes out as much ammo A as they need. Put excess ammo B in the box. When you log into Alt B and start playing, and need ammo, just open stash and pull out as much of ammo B as you need, and deposit as much ammo A that is in excess. And next time you log into Alt A, he'll have ammo A waiting for him. And NOBODY is inconvenienced by this!
---
Honestly most people who review or talk about it wether on YouTube or in sub Reddit‚Äôs have played about the first half our of the game. They really are just walking in blind saying unsubstantiated claims.
---
Lots of ammo of a type you don't use...
---
Take a shovel. It has, basically 3 parts. The handle, the shaft, and the head or blade. Now replace the shaft. Still the same shovel? Ok. Now replace the handle. Still the same shovel? Now replace the blade. Still the same shovel? This is basically the same argument as saying Fo76 is the same engine as Morrowind.
---
I got 1 for free through Steam but getting it to work was a PITA.    
---
I did get 1, 2, and Tactics from BGS through the Launcher. They all installed fine, but have yet to play any yet.
---
Sorry but in the interest of fair and honest journalism I'll have to disagree.  
---
I agree some amount of salt is warranted, just not by folks who have absolutely no stake in the matter and have never played it.  That leads to people spouting off non-truths about the product and because they are in the public eye, folks believe it.  That is what I'm upset about. Brad and Jeff played the game for a few hours in beta, didn't like it, fine.  Ben didn't play it at all, and trashed it with such emotional voracity about points that weren't even true (i.e. he claimed you couldn't enter any of the houses in the game, which is so abhorrently false).    
---
It does not deserve that no matter how entitled or betrayed you felt by misunderstanding the expectations set by the marketing team prior to release.  
---
I've had that happen to me with a black powder pistol actually. Extremely OP. It could fire extremely quickly as well.
---
I have my binoculars next to my chair so I can read the notes on the 50 inch tv 10 feet from my head.  My family may already be putting in paper work for the funny farm.
---
I guess busy better get busy fixing his camp
---
That was done with ReShade most likely. That entire program is usually flagged as a "cheat mod" by companies that scan for cheaters. It's not inherently cheating, but that mod does a lot of stuff that gives unfair benefits in PVP scenarios.
---
These scans are just checking to see what is running in the background, they don't analyze how they're being used. Even the Youtubers who made a big deal about the bans walked back their statements and clarified how they jumped the gun initially.
---
Also No Man's Sky actually improved and is now very much the game it advertised. Took some finagling and shit-flinging from the community, but they did it. 
---
Source has been in use since 2004 and a vast amount of people probably wouldn't be able to tell that Half Life 2 and Titanfall 2 run on the same engine.
---
Fallout 76 to me is like a good Midway game in the early 2000's, they aren't going to win big awards, but, you'll have a good time none of the less.
---
That happens. Do something and it‚Äôll go back to where it was at. 
---
Raider here and it's fun.
---
Block them.
---
Rather than watch youtube, play Fallout.
---
Imagine they're level 1 scorched, level 1 ghouls.  Walk on by, not even worth your time.
---
Yep we figured that out after posting this which is pretty gay because it shows up under his builds led objects when he‚Äôs in my camp which he spends a lot of time in since we farm point Pleasant and yes the Hot Rod Power Armor station and paint were limited time only I didn‚Äôt get it didn‚Äôt even know about it til last night and I‚Äôm not paying Bethesda for Atoms their game is already badly broken which we spent $448 (games plus pipboys) and now their game is like $30 for base and $50 for Tri love the concept but they need to fix that while camp atom and sharing camp stuff crap 
---
You sound like a little bitch
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say it was trash but it definitely wasn‚Äôt complete. Didn‚Äôt make it any less fun to me but I can acknowledge that not everyone felt that way.
---
Think its just a bug happens to me all the time, takes time in server for it to load
---
Xbox. Later on when mods come out Microsoft wont restrict it. Sony will restrict mods on the ps4. Save yourself the hassle and play on xbox

I'll be home around 10 PM est if you still have that auto nade launcher.

Dammit. I have an anti armor vats crit one but that type of reload is demoralizing.
---
Yeah, in *Fallout: Oregon Trail*...
---
This extends beyond the drama channels like legacy, yong, and jim even long time LP, tips&amp;tricks, lore, and rpg you tubers that normally leaned on Bethesda games for their bread and butter content think the game is crap, and is really the most telling sign as it's in those YT'ers best interest for the game to be successful because where are they gonna get their content from until the next bethesda or cd-project red game comes out?
---
I read that, but you never know you could try pitching it to them now considering the price drop.
---
That's a very good point thank you üòÄ
---
Yeah, I played it recently and the multiplayer is real fun. Whole base construction is revamped. Had a real good time, game is 100% redeemed imo
---
The same point could be made about these posts. You are complaining about the ‚Äúyoutubers‚Äù complaining? There is a healthy middle ground here. Every mistake made by Bethesda will be covered by popular and up and coming youtubers for views, and for them to provide their take on the matter.  I think there are some issues that could be fixed but I don‚Äôt hate the game. It just doesn‚Äôt work well for me. 
---
Mine is fixed now. I scraped and build the bigger one is a more open area. I hope you get it figured out, was so irritating 
---
Not sure I understand the downvotes cause you're right. Buying a car is a huge investment. Comparing it to buying a video game that has some bugs is ridiculous. 
---
People know what disappointment from buying a broken product feels like. But games are different, they're more fluid. And technology is constantly evolving so making games is not perfect. Gamers know this and have accepted it since online games have existed.
---
LANAAAAAAAA! 
---
You can get about 1/2 the meds in the game from the Enclave Bunker medical vendor.
---
The other half, who knows.....lol  I have gotten a Super Stimpack Recipe from events.  But no other chems other than that.
---
Do they just need to be repaired?
---
lol. What a turd burglar. I can acknowledge the flaws while also enjoying the game but to post such a low effort meme on an unrelated sub just screams insecurity.  
---
nahh, honestly I turn the radio off when that song plays.  It does not fit the time period of songs.
---
It would "not" be nice.....
---
You sound like a dick. 
---
Buy a weapon from a merchant for say 65 caps and they only have 40 caps somehow.  Are those crafty bots skimming the till?
---
Bethesda has no one to blame but themselves. They deserve all the bad press. It‚Äôs Bethesda. The company who brought us Fallout and Skyrim. They‚Äôre not a couple guys in their garage, they‚Äôre a major player. And they made some major mistakes. Tired of reading about it? Go outside.
---
No one cares buds.
---
Fixing bugs is more important.
---
Plus you can change your appearance at any time.
---
&gt; but the Bounty Hunter has to shoot him once with reduced damage to initiate PvP
---
Wrong, wanted people do not receive slap protection. I've cleared and have had bounties cleared.  
---
Fire rate of TSE weapons doesn't matter, a TSE dragon can one shot nearly any wanted player out of the blue.
---
Buy a TSE handmade its been the most reliable thing I found to easily dispact scorched beast. Gauss might do it but I dont have one to try it out.
---
I found them last night inside a safe in the Whitesprings maintenance room (main building).
---
It was that turret in the ceiling corner...
---
Me too 
---
Gotta love people shitting on Bethesda when in any current rockstar game if you step out of line or do something your own way...mission failed. Rdr2 is the worse victim of that.  To each their own I guess but I like playing games not playing movies.
---
Look left from the weapon work bench at the table closest to the cabin(far stage right if you are looking towards the targets)
---
At this point they're taking release-period bugs and vomiting the memes back and forth into eachother's mouths. They caught a second wind with the New Years day nuke bug which honestly, I was even playing that night late on the East coast and I DID NOT CARE. The nukes are only a little bit of what to do in this game.
---
I don't need other people to play FO76 for me to enjoy it, but I do probably need people to start and continue playing for Bethesda to ever put the resources into making the game what it should be.
---
Dishonest, completely inaccurate click-bait articles about the game aren't helping and do a disservice to Fallout as a world.
---
Yes, I still completely blame Bethesda for making this whole thing possible, but enough is enough.
---
They do
---
&gt; entire sub dedicated to anchors
---
Out of curiosity, which sub is that? Pretty much nobody I know still plays this, so I may need an anchor soon.
---
Your materials marine, same ign 
---
Well as nice as that story sounds, I have social anxiety and would never do what either you or that guy did. So I don't get to experience the magic of interacting with real people/strangers because I would much rather avoid it altogether. But forget that. My main point is that it makes no sense to have absolutely *no living humans*. It's not a big deal and I don't mind it too much, but the reasoning given was **IMMERSION** and I think it does quite the opposite. Like you said, even one living person would nice.
---
Which ones?  I have heard this said but nobody has been able to back it up.  The absolute closest I can find is that Todd said you would still be able to enjoy the game single player if you wanted, and there was a story to follow etc, which was not untrue, but a lot of people took that to mean it was the same as all the other fallout games in terms of story which was not promised.    
---
Apart from that I really have not seen anything that could be considered a lie prior to the game coming out so I am genuinely curious.
---
Mate welcome to the realy world of liking something that is disliked by the majority. You need yo get over it. 76 was one of the worst games of the year easily and now it and its fan base like you are paying the consequences.
---
Its not fair that you as fans pay the price for Bethesda being terrible but thats all the more reason for you to join the hate train!
---
Limited time offer in the Atom Shop, only 76 million atoms! 
---
Thanks for the laugh, good luck out in the wasteland fellow vault dweller.
---
It doesn‚Äôt kill any faster?
---
&gt;This isn't a game identity crisis. It's you not knowing what you bought.
---
I guess everyone who pointed out the game doesn't really know what it wants to be is wrong and you're right, then. even though, from a design point of view, it totally makes sense. I mean, we have similar games to compare it to, namely Dark Souls, and it knocks it out of the park. but no, thanks for enlightening me.
---
&gt;What do I do? I aim and I shoot. When I can't do that, I use VATS.
---
from behind walls? because everyone bum rushes the ghouls *inside* the golf house. you know, behind walls? you must be a really good shoot.
---
&gt;Oh, doesn't it play like multiplayer?
---
no content forces/requires player interaction. everything was designed with solo players in mind. even workshops, which are clearly pvp arenas, serve a singleplayer purpose. this isn't the case with WoW, EVE, Overwatch, CSGO.
---
&gt;So first you said that games can't have a real market.
---
never said that. what I said is that markets need to be backed by actual currency in order to be real. and that in my opinion, as I don't view Fo76 as a multiplayer, it shouldn't have a market at all.
---
&gt;but this one doesn't.
---
it can. it's up to Bethesda and mainly the players. but as it is, in this sub at least, people bash rmts. how do you expect the game to have a market if you ban rmts?
---
Handcock? Sounds like a kinky relationship 
---
Hmm. Was ME:A before or after BFr2? Cause if it was after that's a bad sign for any unrelated games under Bethesda's umbrella.
---
I agree Faction is a better word. I used Guild as a feature comparison to other MMO games.
---
I see what you mean. I thought the original comment was saying that the damage just needed to be moved to new cards and taken away from the current rifle cards which wouldn't change the damage at all. 
---
I hope to see new cards too. 
---
Peace and Tranquility to you, Vault Brother.  Consider another path.
---
NP, ign illmaticxdragn, it will be ready when you get here..
---
They are for excavator armor 
---
My theory is it's because most of the jerks are the ones that state that "the game is shit" without actually playing it. What we are left with is a core of friendly players who want everyone to have a good time. There is a possibility this will change over time if Bethesda improves game quality by fixing glitches &amp; adding interesting content &amp; the angry jerks join in the game - but I hope the core stays strong, friendly &amp; helpful.
---
I have a Furious Explosive, which indeed eats it alive.
---
I still carry it to kill scorchbeasts, but I'd prefer to be able to kill it with my shotgun, just to keep my carryweight as low as possible. My shotgun doesn't even weigh 2 pounds, as where my handmade weighs 24 pounds.
---
Or find somewhere that already has either structures built or can serve to keep your budget down in some way.  A lot of people post about caves that they built in and that is a huge budget saver.  And one of the guys I play with has a base built on top of a descent sized garden that keeps him from having to use budget space on crops.
---
I thought it did but if the anti-armor isn't working on energy weapons then I could be wrong.
---
I get ps4 bluescreens far too often, sadly. Roughly once every hour and a half. I just crashed scrolling through my inventory about to start an event. I barely if ever see workshops taken over on ps4. Saw someone taking power plants last night, then the server crashed 30 minutes later. I doubt he even got 1 fusion core. 
---
I feel like it would also be nice if corpses disappeared quicker post complete looting so server has less strain on it but I'm sure the thought is there but the reality isn't 
---
I had an awesome plasma rifle in FO4 that I‚Äôd use just for the ability to find green puddles of goo instead of going corpse hunting. 
---
I was more distracted by him sweet talking me to remember the exact spelling of his name.
---
I want the courier outfit from lonesome road dude :(
---
Kill something to get XP, the bar will pop back up. This is just one of many, many, many, many, &lt;insert a few more "many"s here&gt;, many bugs this game has. 
---
you do that already, game needs a bethesda account on consoles which it creates  
---
So I think it could be possible to do a service to play on existing characters which are tied to that account undepend from the system you are logging in from  
---
Any build that is suggested is just that.    
---
My first char is all jacked up b/c I didn't know more, the Nukes and Dragons website wasn't a big thing, and the game doesn't teach you well.    
---
IMO, you should focus on a melee/ranged combo. 2hd weapons hit much harder and there are perks which make you swing them faster. I've found focusing on more melee and less ranged early on can get you a lot of ammo saved up.    
---
I've seen people do only 1hd melee build, 2hd/shotgun, 2hd/rifles, 2hd/pistols.  
---
The Nukes and Dragons website allows you to allocate your special points, pick perks, and better yet a level by level  perk guide based on what you choose.    
---
Melee can hit quite hard if the right perks are taken. You don't have to take a perk every level. In fact I would suggest waiting the 2 levels prior to every 5 levels after 10. If you get cards you want in a pack then that saves you  wasting a card.
---
Wolda done the same lol.
---
75 minutes
---
I bought this along with red dead.. they both suck.  
---
Red dead sucks because the mechanics are shallow and the game is on rails. I've been blasting that game since I was 6 hrs in.. wanted to enjoy it but it's not a game(obviously exaggeration for effect!! ) It's sims: western version. 
---
Fallout 76 sucks quite simply because of the state it was launched in. The difference is Fallout 76 can change (and has changed) since launch. 
---
The game at least has a fucking comprehensive gameplay loop! Where as red dead is spammy as fuck. 
---
I stopped 76 at level 25 on an new character just because of a rage quit. (In game control situation) 
---
And began red dead and I was blown away by the issues in red dead but nobody was saying anything. 
---
And no man's sky is my favorite 'gaming experience' I feel I've had.. And I play everything from simulations to hack and slash to rpg. I bought NMS at launch and couldn't of been happier with how the devs continued producing updates!! It's was/is an experience unlike anything else out there. Regardless of how it launched I saw the potential in that. 
---
I will eventually go back to 76. I didn't stop because of me not enjoying it but yeah for sure the negativity and with dealing with some issues in game just made me put it down for another time.. 
---
Plus!! I still have to complete (100%) fallout 4.  
---
If you want I can go to red dead subs and post pro fallout 76 shit :)!! Cause I hate that fucking game!!!!
---
Hope you block out the negativity and enjoy what your playing. As a no man sky fanboy it never stopped me loving my experience!! 
---
Holy fucking yikes
---
I have. They're bugged. But at least they didn't disconnect me from the fucking server every 15 minutes.
---
BOS heavy combat armor is the best all around, vanguard gives you +35 to both defenses when at full health and it can stack five times, scaly skin mutation (+50 to both defenses) barbarian perk (up to +80 to both defenses), grounded mutation (+100 energy), refractor perk (+40 energy), ironclad perk (+50 to both), lone wanderer perk (20% reduction to all damage), evasive perk (up to +45 in both). 
---
There are some more damage resistance perks I didn‚Äôt cover but they‚Äôre situational, they can only be used while running or shooting or something.
---
I haven't seen it yet, at what level?
---
I only know the perks aren‚Äôt working for energy. It‚Äôd be interesting to see if the anti armor legendary effect does work.
---
My character grew up in a vault.  He knows damn well what soap and water are for.  Given that he's bright enough to put together a fusion reactor, he's also capable of laying bricks in an even row and painting though for some reason he's not given the option.
---
That said, variety is good so by all means bring on the bones and GWAR shit.  Just make sure to add in a functional washer and dryer for those of us on the other end of the spectrum!
---
- Raider PA: If it‚Äôs containing ‚Äûsteel junk‚Äú
---
- Excavator PA: if it‚Äôs containing ‚Äûblack titanium‚Äú
---
- Ultracite PA: if it‚Äôs.... ah, I let you guess on that
---
Next time; search function!
---
Honestly my entire time playing I've never had a problem, I always feel left out on things because I never experience the bad parts for whatever reason but honestly don't complain.
---
So likely, swapping out lone wandered for Bodyguards, finding room for action boy, find friends?
---
Couldn't. Agree. More.
---
Their inventory changes. There's no consistent list.
---
It's okay, little one. I have found a wonderful echo chamber for you...

---
I'll have to track down a regular Gatling Laser and do some testing.
---
The fair and honest journalists already dropped their reviews and left. They thought it was shit too.
---
Imo early theory crafting had it wrong.
---
PA modded out is better in most scenarios.
---
None PA specializes in very specific ways, some of them not exclusive to non-pa.
---
I really think its what no lifers do when they don't want to quit the game.
---
Most of the builds revolve around 1 shots which my unperked explosive shotgun does....
---
I've been doing that, everything that isn't a quest item is gone.
---
Except for "The Plan."
---
Because my name is Zach, and that's my plan.
---
Gotta go scare that bitch.
---
Have my upvote. 
---
I'll check back in february to see if there's a patch note stating that the server crashes/disconnects are down to once per two hours or less.
---
nope, it was a nexus mod. pretty sure it's still up, too. there are lots of recoloring mods for bobbleheads, magazines, etc. and some reported being banned for using them.
---
I finally investigated the gazebo recently, and found nothing intractable. Of course, this game is buggy as shit, so it could have failed to load. I went to the train station in Charleston once, and there was no stash or workbench, just a big empty nothing where the bench should have been. I was overencumbered at the time too. :/
---
51% of the ratings of fo76 on Amazon are 1 star

I can only seem to have one at a time in my inventory- doesn't show any extra, when i turn it in, i then have none, and i can't put the one i have in my stash because it's a mission item. I'm wondering if all the people who are collecting and trading them are alt accounts who haven't done the bos questline yet?
---
Ah someone has been listening to my memoir holotapes üòÇ
---
Yea as a Gatling gun as my primary heavy gun because it‚Äôs damage is so much better and you don‚Äôt have to constantly run out of ammo like with the Minigun, I will say people disregard the Minigun too easily. Yea it sucks to kill a creature with it but with a 12% chance to stagger/cripple you fire a quick volley into the big enemies legs almost guarantee cripple them then finish them with whatever weapon you want. 
---
Trying to do the max upgrade for the enclave operative underarmor, which requires a bunch of ballistic fiber, ultracite scraps, and the one thing I cannot get without a nuke launch, the crimson flux
---
Because it deserves it... simple as that. One day people will wake up and realize complaining about this is a good thing for consumers. I don‚Äôt care if you had fun l, f76 was a BAD launch not even considering the experience and expectations of Bethesda. The game was lazy and as such it‚Äôs an easy target. If you let small things like that get to you , don‚Äôt get on the internet 
---
Provided it gives us a way to block/ignore you, fine.
---
The beta of the game was a week before release so it's not enough time to fix anything from it before release. The release was a disgrace for a AAA game. The refund policy was horrendous. They put the game on sale 2 weeks after release. I meaaan ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Holy fuck this thread is hilarious. You unsubbed from some of your favorite youtubers because they made fun of one of the worst game releases in the history of gaming? 
---
Agreed on the servers. 
---
And I think you mean Action Boy? I mean, Grognak or Silver Shroud sure...not aware of anybody named Superman, what a ridiculous title. Haha 
---
I've been taking them too! I want all the plans for free and then I'll defend them for plans again. I have turrets on top of portapottys. I call them shitter shooters. I blueprinted them and put them best generators and the workbench. 
---
I also make sure to end my play session in a workshop so I can start there right away. Also, if you power up posiodon, it gives you free power at a few of the workshops in the forest. Have fun!
---
Out of curiosity what have they patched that's significant.  I was enjoying the game but the few issues I had caused me to just revisit. 
---
The game that was released was fucking trash and you know it. I don't give a shit about the game now. Game revs you get one chance to impress and when you fuck up the launch its embarrassingly funny
---
hahah the "can't leave or I die" one drives my woman nuts too.
---
there is none, i kill her usually 3-6x a day when i play and we usually want her out of the nuke zone so the low health builds can kill her seconds after she lands
---
Right on. Godspeed 
---
I have the most fun when I casually farm.
---
Just walk around and explore. Clear areas and loot junk.
---
Isn‚Äôt as profitable as the usual farming spots but man is it fun!
---
Have you seen the pictures of people‚Äôs inventory‚Äôs where they have hundreds of thousands of each mats? That‚Äôs what‚Äôs causing your bugs it‚Äôs all human abuse, Bethesda is doing what they can to fix those dupe bugs and shit but when you still got assholes refusing to clear their inventory everyone else on their server them included is gonna be stuck wondering why they keep crashing and blaming Bethesda for it. I get that those bugs shouldn‚Äôt of been there in the first place ya ya, but there‚Äôs bugs like that in every Bethesda game and it‚Äôs the players taking advantage of that shit to try and get ahead that are ruining it for everyone else. Don‚Äôt cheat in online games it‚Äôs a pretty simple concept.
---
This is simply not true at all.
---
"Dad look, I found a robot named Fisto!" 
---
*Cue immediate unplugging of the computer*
---
can you purchase a PS4 and a xbox with your non profit status and help the rest of the player base out?
---
While I agree that it‚Äôs pretty cancerous how the ‚Äúgaming community‚Äù perceived the game, the 76 community, which is much more important to the game, is currently at an important cross roads. 
---
We stand between two spectrums: Hating the game and arguing over issues the game doesn‚Äôt really have, or Ignoring any criticism or issues the game has. This is an important phase, and the only way for the community to fix this is for Bethesda to act. 
---
Sea of Theives went through a similar situation in the first few months, constantly being regarded as a shallow game with no content. The community was constantly divided over whether the game was good or not, with Youtubers constantly declaring that the game was the next No Mans Sky. A month after launch, Rare started to right wrongs, adding content that the community wanted to see, and now, nine months after release, the game and the community is in the best state it ever has been in.
---
We need Bethesda to make this kind of change.
---
anyone can do that, but its inferior to non-pa builds outside of nuke zones
---
YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO ENJOY THE GAME REEEEEEE
---
Nooo! Dude, I was just teasing them. üòÇ
---
The sad truth is that it is popular to shit all over F76 so many people are doing it for the sole reason of increasing their subscriber base, which translates to authority and power in a sense.
---
Well you'd walk up to the npc but he would be t posed and unresponsive and then he would turn into a windigo 
---
The psa should be don't spam the button
---
Oh man I forgot to unfollow this thread this game really was fucking trash thanks for reminding me
---
It's a particularly terrible game, and people are honestly baffled a AAA publisher would tarnish one of their most popular and long lasting IPs by launching a game in this state. You can like it, but it's still a bad game. Bethesda knew better, they thought they could get away with it, and they were wrong. They shouldn't get a pass. 
---
Sounds like this guy's just tired of The Internet. 
---
You think that's bad? Try being Blizzard right now because they announced they would release a game on mobile. People are now calling out for the death of Blizzard because "they'd rather not see its legacy suffer".Yeah, *totally not trying to defend your fragile ego by showing the lengths you'd like to see happen to see it defended*. Never mind Hearthstone, which was essentially this. Never mind they've killed games for less if they ever thought the quality would drop. Never mind the rise of mobile games like Clash Royale or ports like FTL that have proven their worth. Never mind the actual gameplay footage and the reviews claiming and showing that it isn't just ripping off other mobile franchises and has instead sought it's own identity in quality design. So if you are into one of Blizzard's games and have ever felt the need to drama queen because you don't like one of their recent updates to one of their games, now is your time to shine.
---
As a gamer who's grown up with PCs but hasn't shied away from other enjoying and aclaiming other platforms (most recently the switch, but also some mobile), I can only say that the PC has the highest manchild to gamer ratio compared to other platforms.
---
And here we are, reading another post about Fallout 76...
---
They don't as far as I've experienced (15-20 times of no slap protection in place).
---
[It might be a bug](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a90dwm/sois_this_intentional_bethesda/) if you are experiencing wanted people with slap protection.  
---
Searching around on reddit comes up with other posters asking about slap protection and wanted status, and the answer is wanted has no protection.
---
Heard and seen a few of these.  How has this personally affected your gameplay?
---
Well Bethesda released this title.  I think that‚Äôs why this bad game got a lot more flak than other bad games. 
---
I mean they made the elder scrolls. That game that is still being sold to the public. They‚Äôre so well known that when they mistake it gets blasted, like fallout 4. But when they make a disaster, the entire internet hears about it. No mans Sky was hyped up and failed awfully, but they didn‚Äôt have the triple A world renown developer making their game.
---
I do agree it‚Äôs annoying hearing about this still. But can you really let go what they charged $60 for? I for one am annoyed but glad people still talk shit. I don‚Äôt want an event like this to be repeated anytime soon.
---
Lmao you're preaching to the choir buddy, this is only place where people won't shit on the game. 
---
Fair enough, he's one sexy ghoul. :)
---
Dang that stinks, back to the drawing board for you.
---
Platform: XBOX One
---
GT:
---
Issue: Mutations
---
I have all mutations but Marsupial. Cannot get marsupial mutation. I got it once from toxic water, but it never showed up on list nor did I get the effect. Restarted game to see if it would show up it didn't. I later drank marsupial serum and got the 24hr bonus but it didn't show up in the list of mutations and I didn't get effect. I have screenshots. I can PM Gamertag and I've posted screenshot on XBOX profile
---
&gt;Thank you, another reminder to go grind caps to eventually buy a marsupial serum.
---
You can find people selling them for 250 caps. 
---
Same thing on my first nuke, was playing solo and was just getting ready to use the key card and disconnected. It's a bad feeling but after chilling out I went back a few hours later and got it done and it still was a solid feeling.
---
I'm level 33, using the Blade of Bastet and the Somerset Special (forgot I should maybe switch to the Voice of Set), not using power armor yet. I have my camp in the Mire figuring it would reduce my fast travel costs, though it gets destroyed pretty well so that may have been a miscalculation. Keep those Mistress of Mystery weapons because you can use them to craft higher level versions of themselves.
---
I remember barely surviving that key fragment quest. I might have been around level 18-20. I think half the cave was cleared by someone before me, because there were a lot of meat piles.
---
I have a lot of points in strength, going for a melee+pistol build. The Blocker and Lone Wanderer perks reduce a lot of incoming damage. The Whitespring ghouls don't bother me anymore. If there's one enemy I try to stay behind it so it can't hit me as often. If there's multiple enemies I try to focus on one at a time and move around so the other enemies are on the other side of it. I back off a little between swings so enemies have to close the gap to hit me. You can block too but it only seems to work for a half second or so.
---
Go watch the YouTube channel Open World Games
---
They almost ever have anything even remotely bad to say about 76.
---
It doesn't help that there is a group of people that keep damaging the game on purpose. They hide it as "concerns" and exaggerations of real behavior, yet they do basically lie in order to make the game look worse. Just this thread here. People keep trying to fight OP with "But my game crashes three times a day." Hmmm, them why did I only see 2 crashes in 150 hours and that only in the first week? Why are people so in love with the idea of frequent disconnects, when there's a disconnect roughly once per 5-10 hours?
---
Usually I would dismiss it as anecdotal evidence on both sides but it was proven that people keep making up issues to harm the game, on this very subreddit. Trade steal "bug". Banned for using mods. It's not like there aren't any real issues around the game. But those are not any worse than your average AAA company, so they need to fuel the narrative that Bethesda is the worst.
---
It's been months and everyones still here to talk shit. Holy crap just stop playing the damn game if you hate it so much. They said it's not a main story fallout game. Admit it, everyone heres still here hating because it feels good to be part of the flock. 
---
But the game is a giant flaming middle finger to anybody who has ever enjoyed Fallout. Just because you‚Äôre sick of hearing about it doesn‚Äôt make it any less true.
---
Maybe the game treats workshops and camps as different kinds of player property, either way that is very strange and definitely needs to be changed. I've noticed something similar, when looking at a players bounty on the map you only get half of whatever that bounty is when you kill them. Idk if it's a glitch but it is very frustrating. Has happened every time I've killed a wanted player and I dont remember when it started. 
---
I wish there was a demand for these strats, but I more than cover the daily vendor caps amount just with junk and food/chems :(
---
Good testing.  
---
The only use I have for turrets is if I'm in an area with mob spawns, and that's just to warn me they are coming.
---
Same here. My biggest complaint is no cross platform compatibility. I‚Äôm new to online gaming and I found that strange.  How‚Äôs an online game supposed to survive when there are three parallel earths with players who can‚Äôt play together?
---
Power Patcher perk.
---
it wasn't reshade, that's what I'm saying. it was just a retexture I think.
---
I'd say half dozen to a dozen is common for me.  Typically at least one pair moving together.  Can't guess how many server instances there are, seem to want that bracket though.
---
Whiny fanboy wants a safe space from criticism around his buggy game and needa fellow gamers to rise up. Did I miss anything?
---
TL;DR
---
Also, this game deserves a LOT of hate for how it released. No one is going to stop hating it because they are ‚Äúworking on it‚Äù
---
I think I met him or his brother... we did something funny well I thought it was,   we were someplace this level 20 was afk outside of town, they went and kited a mob of super mutants to him. 
---
üëèüëèüí¶
---
Arena in general yes. The ability to spawn a level 52 legendary gutsy specifically? No.
---
From what I've heard, yeah. But I haven't enjoyed a Rockstar game since Bully, so I gave it a hard pass. 
---
Hard to argue against all those accolades though. 
---
/+ the perk to repair it to 200%
---
I‚Äôve been rolling in a group of three. Feeling like Legolas, Aragorn and Gimli out here facing these odds. Haha that would be great, I love the sound of that. If ‚Äúguild‚Äù style groups or factions could be created that would be ideal. Similar to the one in ESO
---
West of Top of the World is mostly level-capped, but the areas east of there scale up to level 40-60 if a high rank player creates them. 
---
Spoiled! You monster.
---
You do know this is a Fallout 76 subreddit right?
---
It just works - Todd
---
As OP's mom... I can confirm this is all true. üëÜüèº
---
Grahm and Chally are both just invincible. You can't attack them at all. 
---
I setup 1 or 2 workshops every time I start playing, but the past couple weeks server stability has been a major issue. Spending the caps and resources to get all setup only to crash before you can harvest is such a kick in the balls. From an etiquette perspective- I basically set stuff up with wind mills only. I only put down turrets if I'm gonna be actively defending because even then they are kinda useless. I used to lock my stuff up but now I just leave everything open. I've even started putting some basic crafting stuff up in case people stop by. Maybe I'm stupid for being this way in-game, but I basically RP as myself- someone who wants everyone to be happy and have a good time.
---
yea these two makes life a whole lot easier. Power Patcher reduces material use on a repair with 60%. Before I got it all my junk were always gone. Now its no problem. 
---
If you want a soft core rust game this is it, i like it for what it is an i hope feedbavk from us makes it wven better, i will say day one the enemies were kindastupud an like not all there in the head but niw they realised they have bodies an can use em its crazy.
---
Yep. Haven't played a single day without at least two disconnects and one crash. It's a feature. /s
---
This happened with Mass Effect Andromeda too and drove me nuts.  
---
Are you talking about the meme that showed the shelve made half into the wall and it says "if bethesda made book shelves"?
---
By the way I got it.

I'd highly recommend it, story was absolutely fantastic. Gameplay, graphics and soundtrack are all superb as well.
---
People feel bad that they spent $60+ on something that turned out to be complete garbage. 
---
Then when thousands of other people shout "I told you so" while making constant videos/posts about how awful the game is, those original buyers feel like it is a personal attack on them/their intelligence. Since to them it feels like they are constantly being attacked since everywhere they look they see hate for this game, it's exhausting. 
---
What's your GT?
---
Hmm you don't say...
---
Could've thought this was r/cooking
---
&gt; Nothing stopped F76 from being released in early access and tested until it worked, then released. 
---
&gt; I just do not want this standard of product release seen as sufficient in this industry, when in my eyes it is not. 
---
These 2 sentences perfectly summarize my position. Very well put. End of the day, it is what it is; a fun but buggy pre-release game where all progress made early on by abusing exploits is going to be preserved for the rest of the game. 
---
So it goes.
---
What's your GT I'll message you when I get on
---
To everyone hating on the game, just read this guys first sentence in his description 
---
The fuck are you talking about dude? People like you are just as bad for trying to portray the game as a game that works great, has no issues, and is awesome to play.
---
Not only is this piece of shit game unplayable for many (documented for all to see), there‚Äôs no end-game and the ultimate endgame activity is compromised since there‚Äôs no guarantee you can complete it as there is a very real 50/50 chance you‚Äôll get disconnected from the server as you‚Äôre fighting the Scorchbeast Queen.
---
This game deserves all the hate it can get. A level 88 player with two BiS Instigating Explosive weapons who quit last week since one-shorting everything with no purpose isn‚Äôt fun anymore.
---
Hope you enjoy your shitty ass game.
---
Only 3? 
---
Where in their comment did they suggest they couldn‚Äôt handle disagreement? You‚Äôre the one that seems to have a bug up your ass about a differing opinion. 
---
It was a learning experience for me entirely. It doesn‚Äôt seem right for a hunter to not get full cap value. Or if a team brings down a person to not get proportional caps for it. 
---
I had 6 turrets in my Camp vanish. Only after I moved to a new location were they found in storage.  Half the time they didn‚Äôt work anyway even with powered spotlights next to them. I‚Äôd rather have more decorations I guess. Lol üòÇ 
---
Check watoga station or watoga shopping plaza too. I see sets often so I‚Äôll grab one next I see one dude. 
---
Just bad luck if on xbox I will keep an eye out I normally get 1 or 2 a day from claiming workshops or doing treasure maps. 
---
On Xbox it's (RS)....I can tell you that much. Rest is up to you. 8v)
---
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve discovered Blair yet. Besides that, that‚Äôs incredible you‚Äôve taken all 22 before. I had 6 once and felt like I owned the whole wasteland. It‚Äôs nice to have multiple places around the map you can fast travel to for free and be safe at. 
---
Never repair without the perks that let you repair 200% condition.  Don't even have to keep the perk on, just use it when you need to repair.  I repair my X-01 about once every other week (usually just the legs).  I don't run any mods that slow decay on power armor either.
---
If you need Materials, I'm assuming ultracite?  You can find a bunch in the glassed caverns.  Wear a full suit of excavator and you'll get even more from the nodes.  Most of them are at the end, but I'd guess you'd get enough for a full repair for one or two runs.
---
If you need springs, Camp MacClintlock has a ton of battered clipboards scattered all over the floor, I clear it out daily for 20-30 springs.
---
It's fair to ask the folks who dislike FO76 to acknowledge that some people enjoy it. Likewise, it's fair for those who do like it to acknowledge that many do not. Both groups deserve their freedom of speech.
---
Personally, I'm looking forward to what FO76 will become after it gets fixed into a release-worthy piece of software. I do not accept software that crashes. Speaking as a programmer, when your application crashes that means not only that you failed but that you failed in an egregious way. You should be ashamed of yourself and fix it immediately. No software developer and no software user should ever accept a program that crashes.
---
The bulked junk is worth more though. I made about 600+ caps (without perks) from like 1000 steel that I bulked. It would have been worth less if I sold it piece by piece.  I forget the exact amounts because I had to sell it over several transactions (since vendors only carry 250 caps for some reason). 
---
Sorta unrelated, but I think they introduced bulking because they're going to change the stash limit to be item count-based rather than weight. I might be pulling that out of my ass, but Bethesda indicated the issue with stashes is based on the servers' inability to handle the *amount* of items players have, not the weight. At least that's why they said the limit was put into place. 
---
&gt; Free clinic.
---
That sounds like commie talk.
---
you can have multiple, im not sure what you're doing wrong but you are doing something wrong. 
---
Since they are not dragged for the MTX implementation and employee abuse (which itself is worse than anything Bethesda has done), I doubt it.
---
Not really related but it's some bullshit we can only take 50 photos on console. Idk what Todd was thinking but I'm vain as fuck I wanna take pictures!
---
This games economy and pvp is so jacked.
---
no, western loads faster than single action.
---
the cylinder pops out I think.
---
Scorchbeast give better rewards. More plans.
---
Yes, but from what I've noticed using both, the axe has lower AP consumption than the sledge
---
I understand the perks I should have clarified
---
yeah I think that is new to her as well.  
---
To have fun and save money... lol
---
No? I had to look up the post there to see what you were referring to, hadn't seen it :/ 
---
I've linked the post I was talking about in the parent comment
---
Kshappy123
---
Yeah! I *wish* servers were more stable so I could find workshops with something already built and get ideas from what they do. I tend to leave fun things at workshops I take over as well (since I know I'll crash) and signs saying "Kiliox (my psn) was here."
---
Amazing!! I'm jelly :) 
---
There is for killing 20 people though and I don‚Äôt wanna just ruin people‚Äôs day. I‚Äôd rather it be a little more sporting 
---
Blair is in the ash heap right in the middle it is the giant excavator. Berkley is great which is south south west of Blair it has 3 oils a gold and crystal. 
---
Freedom is non negotiable. 
---
The writing of this post shows how much you like to waste your time posting a bunch of bullshit. Thanks for your time
---
What a waste of orbital strikes..... Worth it. 
---
Heck the amount of times I wanted to level the floating bases. I.E. bases that defy gravity.  Only thing stopping me was me realizing it may be dumb looking but it's just a game.  
---
they are great for this at large workshops.  i want to know right away where the wave is coming from so i can protect extractors.  
---
in a former life i was a software/network tester :)  LOL...i wonder if there is a job doing this for games and if they'd hire me! 
---
GUYS! He lives! I made a new post about it, but I‚Äôm shook. 
---
Didn‚Äôt know it was a thing since avoiding griefers seems to be pretty easy. They need to implement a PVP sector in the game kind of like how the division had a section of the map free for all that would fix some of this I would think.
---
that's what it does.
---
? I am lost
---
Hating fallout 76 is just a trend at this point 
---
Thanks! You posted what I've been thinking for weeks but didn't want to post myself because I figured I'd just get hate and the post would be downvoted.
---
It's rare that I'm this far out of sync with the popular narrative, but I actually like Fallout 76. For the life of me I can't figure out why so many people spend their time endlessly trashing a game they don't like. It's pathetic. There are games I don't like, even some games that I spent money on. For the most part I write the purchase off and never play the game again. Seriously, why would you do anything else? Anyone who wastes their time not only whining about the game on the internet, but spending 100s of hours digging through the game to find more things to whine about, is a colossal fucking loser.
---
This guy gets it. Bethesda has become the target of "Let's hate a company" in the recent year.
---
i see them often in watoga train station
---
I wasn't aware that workshops had their own pool of resources. Cool.
---
Running solo, I don't usually build extractors. Even in groups, we get so many errors &amp; boots during sessions that we hardly benefit from them. But we do enjoy the xp &amp; rewards from claiming &amp; defending them.
---
Raiders are immortal beings that come back to life 10 feet away to attack you again after being killed? And immediately teleport away/become perfectly invisible at the hint of retaliation/after finally whittling you down and grabbing stuff.
---
How can a duper crafting boards lag the server more than a casual player spam crafting ammo?  I spam the heck out of my keyboard as fast as I can to craft gun powder and ammo.  I have never killed a server.
---
Also check the vendors at white springs, one of them had a lot of plans. Plans change so you got to server hop for different ones even with the same vendor. Just keep checking all random vendors, you will find some. Also workshops give out a lot of plans or at least used to and some events as well.
---
Also make sure you exploring all over, I find random plans all the time especially places and houses you wouldn't think of checking out ..
---
Hiiii Mom! üôãüôãüôã
---
I will usually just lock up the extractors and keep everything else open to use. I‚Äôll always have a missile turret or two and that‚Äôs about it. Missile turrets are nice because they do so much damage, even to the higher level players.
---
Thanks to lag, I got stuck in PA on Xbox fighting the Queen two weeks AFTER Bethesda claimed to have fixed that particular bug. Apparently Bethesda will just say they fix bugs now.
---
I think people are blowing this up so much because of the position Bethesda holds in the gaming industry. Yeah, the No Man's Sky debacle was worse than FO76's release, but no one cared about Hello Games before NMS. They were just some indie company making this crazy ambitious game out of nowhere. 
---
Bethesda is one of the most well known companies out there. They made Skyrim, which is one of the few games *everyone* knows and, if they have played it, probably loves. My own parents, who know absolutely nothing about games (like when I wanted a Xbox game as a kid I had to tell them it was the green one and not the blue one), know about Skyrim. The fact that a company with that kind of respect in our community released 76 in the state it was in was just insulting, and thats why people are retaliating so much. 
---
I LOVE DRUGS IRL!!!
---
There's also that much more extreme sub where you actually get banned for speaking out. People seem to forget that when pointing out echo chambers.
---
Right, totally got that. It's the best word to describe because that's what so many other games call it. 
---
Rational doesn't pay the bills. I look at YouTube like I do mainstream media CNN, FOX, CBS mostly Yellow Journalism. Sensationalism sells.
---
"Unnatural fear of fast zombies" No, that's uh, pretty natural sir. 
---
Bethesda released the ‚ÄúInside the Vault‚Äù for January and the announced that some vaults will be opening up, possibly this month. 
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/5te3GDsV1eOM2YOKoyWoI6/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-1-2019
---
It gets this much hate because Bethesda could see it from like a decade away and made no effort to change course.... no mans sky was a no name, f76 was built on like 7 previous games. 
---
This'll surely help.
---
Fuck right off with that. I've been playin' since FO1 and I'm sick of this NMA-level bullshit. The game is fun.
---
haha i came in the other day from taking the trash out to the curb still holding my controller, talking on my headset. she just rolled her eyes and said "there's something wrong with you"
---
Make her a character she can play and she will fall in love with it
---
Ok. Now hear me out here. Just one second. Maybe MAybe. MAYBE. The game is actually just really really bad.
---
okay look, every online game has this shit it is nothing new. Hell gold farmers in WoW at the peak was worse. Some people make good money and do not have time they are the buyers of that shit. However normal people that want an experience do not.   
---
I am not sure what you expect to be done since nothing can or will be it is also way way to late to nip it in the bud .It is getting old with people posting this drivel as all you are doing is advertising ill gotten goods. 
---
The MIRV mod make it so you shoot 6 Mini nukes simultaneously instead of one. But you can find a Two Shots MIRV Fatman for an even more insane damage. 
---
Glad I could teach you something. I also didn‚Äôt know this until recently. Makes it a little less stressful when considering taking them over or not
---
Yep on xbox, i try to claim workshops too but rarely end up with something useful
---
You shouldn‚Äôt have bought a shitty game then. 
---
exactly! what are they gonna get from a never-ending stream of "lol bethesda sux 76 bad" ?? nothing at all. it has problems and it's pretty far from perfect, but for fuck's sake guys they arent done updating it yet. by now the people who complain probably wouldnt even be happy with it if they fixed every problem tomorrow lmao
---
I had a different experience with the bounty rewards. Was on a team with 2 others (my wife and brother-in-law). They see some random player on the map with a bounty. They are bored and decide to collect the bounty for fun. I was sorting my stash and  over encumbered so they went on without me. They kill him, my screen posts up with 40 something xp and 20 caps. My third of the 60 cap bounty. I was confused and asked why I just got caps, wife said she got 50 something xp and 14 caps, bro in low said he got 25 caps and 20 xp. 
---
Also I have been playing solo before and just randomly get xp and caps for nothing. I didnt kill anything, find a new location, or complete a challenge. 
---
Which is *the* dupe glitch in question? How does it break the server? Or rather, what does it do that causes the server to break?
---
I love how everyone blames duping on disconnects, it might be contributing but it isn't the only issue. Could be your internet, could be unstable servers. Disconnects were happening during the beta before duping was even a thing, it happened when they went live, it happened after.
---
It only takes about 10 seconds of your internet to time out for you to get disconnected.
---
I hardly think we have dupers on every server we connect to, but hey who knows.
---
Now and then - since day 1
---
Yeah I think there's a big difference in quality when someone has an editor as well as some form of either professional or academic training to be a writer. 
---
Sure, some people can do well as a youtube game reviewer without those things but it's rare IMO. Most have poor standards and too much temptation to put out whatever gets them views. 
---
Will do!
---
Mole rats usually get stuck in two point and burrow between them constantly, with 0.5s time to kill em if you camp the spot. If one doesn't work try to find the second one.
---
I think I have the arms, just not sure if they are marine. I know the ones I do have are 3 *
---
I needed that steel :'(
---
We should establish some kind of location based, drop off system for different junk items. 
---
Gonna do a big sweep tomorrow then!
---
Afaik I dont have plans for missile turrets yet, but I have inherited some a few times and can confirm they are effective. My issue is my machine gun turrets just never seem to want to target anything. Countless times they'll just sit there idly while hordes of enemies run at them. It's too inconsistent for me to call it a "bug," but I dont know what else to call it. I should try to find the plans so I can test out the advanced ones.
---
You just need 1 star or maybe 2 star? If so odds are yes if you want 3 star I refuse to give those to anyone for any amount of goodies. 
---
Base looks awesome. You are a butthole
---
It becomes a mission item after the quest unlocks during the Brotherhood questline, after that they all merge into one item in your inventory. You can't carry more than one at a time afterward.
---
Wifi works fine for every single other game, just this game has problems
---
?
---
yup. literally my point, friend. 
---
How are you getting enough XP to have *three* level 100s?? Or are you just blessed with a lot more free time than I am ;)
---
it started out with her sitting with me, generally interested on what was going on. Everything was fine with a, "oh what is that thing laying in the road?" it turned into "OH HELL NO" and her getting up and walking out when it got up and started running at me.
---
Dropped a 3 star legendary power fist so my buddy could fix it and the whole thing disappear very dissatisfied loved that power fist
---
You got that right. E/TSE work wonders on them though. Friend gave me TSE 10 mm pistol with 250 resist damage its just destroys them without taking damage. I carry it on me at all time.
---
Yes if it is unyielding and marine I‚Äôd like to buy it 
---
*worse than the state of the game at any point* fixed that for you. let me have the downvotes im hungry for them
---
Where is the fountain
---
You could build an arena, but it was limited to bots and NPCs from that location, raiders, mercs, and animals based on which traps you built.
---
No legendary gutsy, but the Automaton dlc let you build some wicked bots.
---
Munitions, red rocket were two where i got them, might have been another but can't guarantee.
---
So many kids have cell phones with access to the internet for large portions of the day while unsupervised.
---
People who buy the stuff on eBay will stop playing in week due to boredom from skipping the grind 
---
It has something to do with loading in and out of the server. It saves items server side in a box *and* in your inventory that's client side. Thus, when a duper with a gazillion items loads in and out it stresses the server.
---
Why would you build so close to a well known drop zone?
---
As the discussion progressed we see that there is a skewed perception between griefers and Raiders. What you‚Äôre explaining are griefers. 
---
A Raider would stay and throw down, with some flair and finesse. More of a rp approach. 
---
I see now in hindsight that the title is a bit misleading, but a scroll through some of the comments should broaden your take.
---
Has one of them stumbled into this unrelated subreddit about a video game? I'm just pointing him in the direction where can find friends. Nothing more. 
---
üòò
---
We can if people use double standards the size of Hoover dam. It's always the same. Bethesda should apparently be hated because of X (X = bugs, MTX, PR screwups, releasing a spin-off, etc...).  Fine, then why all other companies got away with doing the same X? Or why some companies get away with employee exploitation, which is by far the worst offence in the industry?
---
It's like getting fired (or fined) for cutting your shift by a few minutes when the rest of the team has already cut it by a whole hour. Sure, it's justified to get punished fot it but it just isn't fair to be the only one punished for lesset offences.
---
And what are they basing those claims on? Let me answer that: in their own *tastes* and *opinions*. They don't like a different Fallout, so they babble about it. Still, doesn't change the fact that this is online Fallout. It's time to deal with that fact, or move on. You are welcome.
---
Yes. Behind walls. I'm that good. (Seriously, if you didn't get the point by now, you're not getting it, I might as well nod in embarrasment).
---
They serve a singleplayer purpose *to you*, that you clearly hide away in your corner wathing the others play together while playing a multiplayer game. Pretty sad, to be honest.
---
Now we have reached the point. **In your opinion** this isn't a multiplayer game. Very well said, I liked the *in your opinion* part.
---
You have proven my points. Now, we can continue this back and forth, or you can just reconsider your arguments.
---
I would enjoy it as well... but it would need to be the human Nick Valentine coming out of a vault - with a plausible story on how he ended up in WV in the first place.  
---
If synth Nick showed up, we would officially be in a different non-Fallout reality.
---
RDR2 online is arguably worse. I disconnect way more often there, and there‚Äôs literally nothing to do. Also, their micro transactions are 700 times worse. 
---
I knew FO76 wasn‚Äôt going to launch well. I knew it would have problems. I‚Äôm someone who bought 3, NV, and 4 on release. I waited until 2 weeks ago to buy 76 and Its probably my second favorite of those 4 installments. 
---
The hate should be more.
---
One of the best developers made this. 
---
Nice thanks for sharing.
---
Exactly this.
---
Thank you for the response
---
Yay, support the duppers that are fucking up the servers for everyone so the are incentivized to continue dupping.
---
Hard pass 
---
Well, the guy was spreading lies how there is no new info since Dec18. There is.
---
Could be. I‚Äôve seen other people suggest however that because of the way information is stored, it takes about the same amount of computing resources to represent 1 steel as it does 1872008636853 steel
---
Game is absolute trash my dude. Got to level 6 I think and haven‚Äôt looked back. 
---
You could just have a flakey connecting and running around with more items than you should.
---
A full stash makes things crashy, same with hopping whitesprings none stop.
---
Well, if a bunch of assholes showed up to my house after nuking it, and no matter what I did they just kept coming back... yeah if I had wings I woulda f#*ked off too
---
I‚Äôve seen a million calibrated shocks....
---
What mods should I be looking out for? I don‚Äôt use power armor. I saw some extra flame shiskebaband wondered if that was valuable. 
---
Level 36 btw
---
Any mods including Jetpack? Wrong!
---
How is your point relevant? People expect that from Rockstar games, just like they expect Bethesda RPGs to have choice. It's an intentional story choice that doesn't harm the game. They would be completely different games if they had the ability to do things however you want.
---
I had this happen once. Thought it was a fix they made to the game. I was so disappointed the next time I visited Winterspring nuke zone to find out only legendary enemies drop legendary loot (sometimes).
---
+1 for that idea!
---
I am the OPs father -- and you're damn right! LOL
---
Playing *with* your kids through the wasteland is entirely different then letting them out on their own.
---
I'd suggest watching one or two YouTube videos. Those guys have done a pretty good job summarizing how Bethesda didn't deliver the game they said they were, because they never told us what the game was.
---
Bethesda fucked up and they should know that as loud as possible
---
What's this pertain to? 
---
Would it be okay if I stopped by for a marsupial? My tag is Saskapone
---
ROTFL
---
So true.
---
Is it actually as bad as everyone makes out? I've been contemplating buying it but am always dubious when a game drops to 20$ within months of release...
---
So i am not the only one who tests blueprint in workshops.
---
I do like my vATS/Pistol build, just going in and popping off the headshot crit spam.
---
Much like it did in 4, it really doesn't scale into the higher endgame levels well at all though. Even with a double-size mag/bonus crit damage revolver.
---
I am not advocating and I am against duping and selling items I will explain what I have learned. Blame the kids, they are the ones duping wrong breaking the server. The groups that do this do not, I've met enough of them in game to know how they work and what the process is to leave the server stable so they don't have to waste time duping again on a crash or worst case losing all the shit both n the character and what was put in storage.   
---
I will not explain on here what the difference is but feel good knowing that if the server crashed there is strong odds they lost all their shit and will not get any of it back. That is if it was truly duping and not some other issue. 
---
You bought a 20 dollar game with more content?  I call bs. This game had tons of content on launch.  And I'm tired of people comparing buying a car to buying a Fucking video game. 
---
Play the game because you enjoy it, not because someone else told you to. 
---
Wow, those graphics are so realistic.
---
We were a team of 3 on Xbox when we killed the bounties player. Only player that got final shot got anything. 
---
We regularly play team of 4.  If one of us goes travelling on our own we all continue to get xp and caps from missions they finish. Only once ever have we all been standing around inside a camp crafting and a random cap amount came to all of us. I heard the event feed the people can give to the entire server but that‚Äôs my first experience and not sure that‚Äôs where it came from. 
---
Plans are rando in vendors, you can find raider in any vendor, but here are a few ive found some plans: 
---
Vender Chad - Camden Park (also raider PA and Marine Armor plans in the raider area under the widowmaker) 
---
Vendor Greg - Grafton
---
Charleston Responder Vendor (Charleston Trainstation Rare Event) 
---
Raider Related Vendorbots
---
Watoga Vendor
---
Graham
---
There are a few places ive found a bunch of raider PA mods and a plan or two. Try looking up north of Grafton Steel, in the old fort. I picked up 4 seperate PA mods and a plan for the blood cleansor (or was it the strength buffing one?, cant remember) 
---
I run raider armor exclusively and currently have a fully tweeked out level 45 set-- so I've been keeping a mental list of where I've been finding them. I'm going to start making power armor parts and scrapping them with the specific perk cards equipped to see if i start unlocking some of the mods without plans. 
---
Nice. Not only the trolls make up lies about the game. Now they also make up lies about Bethesda lying. Nothing can stop the narrative, right?
---
At least with a curb you'd fall forward in real life, right.
---
Hazmat suits are fairly light, and much quicker to dive into in a pinch than power armor.  I ALWAYS keep one handy for that 3-seconds-to-live moment.
---
Why date when you can just use money?
---
From my experience orbital strikes do no damage to bases
---
It also shows changes for weapon modifiers. I tested it with an anti armor LMG and a standard LMG both with and without Stabilized
---
Also to point out that it doesn‚Äôt seem that anti armor effects seem to stack multiplicative. Seeing how an anti armor and stabilized should leave a target with only 5% armor left when in reality it leaves them with around 25-30% armor left.

Checkpoints rarely matter anyway when the game/server crashes. I was helping a lowly level 29 do the last BoS quest that takes you to the Glass (Glassed?) Caverns. I'm carrying him the entire time (I was \~80 at the time) Killed over half a dozen SB's outside on the way there with nothing but a shotgun, while he made it inside I had to run to fix my completely dead shotgun. I make it back to the Cavern, plow my way to the end, and kill both level 85 SB's by myself because he is hiding in a corner because all his armor is dead. Wile cleaning up the scorched, he disconnects. When he reconnects, his quest is taking him to the second location in the center of Watoga. 1000 shotgun shells spent and had absolutely nothing to show for it other than leveling up twice. None of the SB's dropped anything worthwhile as per usual. He was only able to level up once IIRC because he had to hide the entire time once his armor died, because even a scorched could 1 shot him.
---
That was the most recent and worst case. I've lost progress countless times after DC'ing even though the word checkpointed popped up while I was playing. Checkpointed my ass.
---
Oh you'll be missing out.  I haven't even opened the marmalade yet.
---
Honestly it's not that close I think. It's by the train station, 90% of nukes miss it because people leave the train station as a fast travel point, idk why some people drop it over the entire whitesprings the other 10% of the time, to make it harder for people to get there I assume.
---
Thanks a lot for sharing! Made for a lot of good reading.
---
You‚Äôd be surprised. My niece is 7 and the shit she says sometimes is so mature and adult it‚Äôs crazy. Kids are dumb kids of course but I totally believe there are kids around that age that would be mature enough to handle more mature themes in games. 
---
Because of "herd mentality"
---
I love to collect and display them in fo4. Really hope they ring back a display for them. Been keeping al sorts in my stashnow. But I'm not sure I have al of them yet... 
---
Maybe it's different on console, that's just how it goes
---
Good
---
That‚Äôs dope 
---
lol, right? they are playing themselves in the end.
---
Give me a min to check all my two big characters. I know I was holding onto a bunch of 1 star unyielding just not 100% sure if I muled it kept it or dropped it because of weight. 
---
Or, you know, fix the damn bug.
---
To point one: we figured out, you can avoid it when waiting till first one has entered the building before next one starts to travel...
---
i thought 130% more armor on repair of power or regular armor was nice too.
---
There are big improvements to visual quality of the game. The quoted part was said when talking about seeing things in the distance, including weather. In this regard there's a lot of improvement. And since you claim that it's not improved 16x times, I'm sure you can enlighten us by what number the quality rose. You must have calculated it since you are not happy with 16.
---
the excavator armor was how I learned about Sugar Grove....
---
Just got the game meself on xbox and loving it too. On the verge of putting other games on hold for a while. 
---
I have the left arm combat armor 3 * 
---
Or the fact that I just wasted three points in the perk card Pharmacist specifically so I could craft Antibiotics and yet even though I have it equipped and the game is showing I have all the necessary components, it is greyed out and tells me I lack the requirements. WTF bethesda? How fucking dumb do you have to be to fuck something so simple up? AND LEAVE IT THERE FOREVER AS A FUCKING FEATURE.
---
I'm not salty, no, not at all.
---
At the beginning of its life cycle, oh my lord it was as bad as everyone was stating.
---
Now? The game is improving. It has a *lot* of issues still and still seems to make the occasional oopsie, but if you can afford it comfortably for $20, now is the time to try it out.
---
Either way a few free caps and xp isn‚Äôt a bug on priority list. LOL üòÇ 
---
Will try the next time i'm on, need to finish "wasteland" anyway.
---
Eso was dope. 
---
My GT is NCCxPwnSausage Just shoot me a message
---
Because he likes the game and wants to find a video where somebody agrees with him so he doesnt feel so bad about spending 60$ on a broken game. Which is the same thing a post made about Jim Sterlings review of it stated: ‚Äúwhy do you have to hate on it reeeeeee‚Äù and my response was the same as yours: ‚ÄúWhy the fuck are you watching it then?‚Äù
---
Infinite spawns for me usually 
---
Assassin Sentinel Gear, or Cavalier Assassin gear, for when the PvP modes hit.
---
I think unless they‚Äôre exposed to much younger siblings or something people just don‚Äôt realize that children are little intelligent and reasoning (if a bit more limited) people. They‚Äôre capable of handling and understanding more mature themes and saying shit that makes you go ‚Äúwtf are you some kind of tiny adult‚Äù???
---
Started learning this a few years ago when my niece rolled her eyes at the dumb typical adult questions I was asking her (she was five or six) and said ‚ÄúI know you know how old I am, everyone does, let‚Äôs talk about something else‚Äù. Lmao. Little smart ass. 
---
Oh pish posh. Your first comment was the video game  equivalent of being snooty. 
---
Which was then followed up with ‚Äúyeah probably‚Äù (I am inferior). 
---
They do use Stims, Rad-X, and Rad-Away... So it would just be any of the "bad drugs" (or "chems"?) if you will. Exactly to your point, it would be difficult to play through without these beneficial drugs. Just like real life... ;)
---
That's a bug I would like to encounter more often lol.
---
Nah. It‚Äôs shit. 
---
lucky hole mine i think
---
No man's sky did get more work on it.
---
But first they were absolutely radio silent with no acknowledgement of the problem for months.
---
However seeing as Bethesda is still releasing versions of Skyrim with game breaking bugs that got player created fixes in the initial launch it's safe to say FO76 may get better, but I seriously doubt it will get the No Mans Sky treatment
---
lucky hole
---
Well, sometimes when a man and a woman don't love each other... Wait no, OK, so there's a flower and a bee... OK, you know what, some people just deserve to have their heads blown off with an anti-material rifle. Go kill the guy at the other end of that quest marker.
---
Yeah, that would be a tough thing to explain and I'm hope I'm not stepping on any toes by trying to turn what happens in that quest into a punchline. 
---
Me too :). 
---
The serums I bought may have been duped, they may not. Unlike TSE weapons, crafting serums isn't that hard once you learn the recipe, so it's entirely possible to legitimately farm the mats and sell them.
---
To you. That doesn't change the fact that the game is just fine. Not amazing, but good and fine.
---
TSE annihilates literally everything. It's a broken combination. 
---
Your only argument is that the state of the game changed and ia changing . But if you had all your facts you would know that Bethesda is doing very scummy things. Apart from the beta version of the game we got and the canvas bags, we also had the issue when they wanted to sell us limted overpriced crap that was discounted at original price in which they took the limited time offer off because that is an illegal practice... 2. The time they leaked information by accident through a bug from asking for refunds for the canvas bags... 3 the Nuka Rum fiasco( Not Bethesda gaming but corporate) . And now the start of the year the nukes have been messed  up and bugged to a point of unplayable. And the cherry to top it all is the addition of possibe buff/consumables that will be added to the atomic shop . If  this sits well with you then you must be one who does  not remember the simpler times of gaming . Where crap like this was not something to awww and marvel at. I would be damed if i had to pay 18$ to paint my armor blue. Which is 1/3 or should i say 1/2 of this AAA title asking price.  
---
Are you sure that will work? Do you have any tips on how I can do that?
---
Online rn
---
yes I also learned about that place this morning... now I just have to make it over there...
---
If he kept coming for you without you attacking him first I would say fair game
---
This guy gets it.
---
Me too, and my YouTube feed has become more varied and is more enjoyable again. I'm not sure why the algorithm kept feeding me a ton of FO76 reviews when my viewing habits are fairly broad and I watch mostly how-tos and stuff like kurgesagt. I dumped all of them but AngryJoe and Jim Stirling who I know both hated the game, but they, along with TotalBiscuit were some of the first channels I started following regularly "back in the day". I thought I might go back to a few of them, but at this point, nope. 
---
There's more ppl on ps4.
---
Xbox tends to be more vocal about constant crashing but that is probably confirmation bias.
---
Mods on console could be a factor but that's an IF and close to a year out or longer.
---
I think it‚Äôs on a timer.  If I don‚Äôt join soon enough it becomes a public event.  
---
Wow, that‚Äôs super cool. And makes me feel like my FO76 friend is suddenly really lame üôÇ 
---
Ther's really no such thing at over leveling.  The enemies seem to scale with you, and there's a lot of cool stuff to find everywhere.
---
Also, special quest loot is scaled to your level, so I'd hold off on completing too many quests before level 50, in the event that you actually want to use them after level 50, namely the power armor sets.  You'll get a full raider, excavator and ultracite set on a power armor frame dropped into your inventory upon completing quests in the main story line.
---
Yes. They call my character Sage, as his name is Sage Blackmoore. I chuckled when I heard that (again)
---
Ew wtf no moms allowed!
---
Plus I enjoy how he mixes it up like 'only 1 true life' and 'fists only' on his playthroughs. 
---
Well, you've got your moving permits, and then there's your environmental impact fee, and the cost for the site survey. Then you've got a title search, which the state mandates. Have you got any plants or animals in your CAMP? Special transport fee for those, you understand. Oh, and if you're moving any nuclear material then we'll need to get an NRC inspector out here, and you know they charge double around this time of year, what with all of the nukes going off. Hey, I'm just doing my job here, buddy, don't shoot the messenger. Just sign here, please, and we'll get started with the packing.
---
I normally dont have issues but have noticed more disconnects after the patch on xbox however. I could used to be able to hit the home key or go to the looking for group tab all the way open then reenter the game fine. Now if I leave the game it instantly disconnects me from server
---
Never worked for me, landing literally right next to them. I get staggered, then they start wailing on me while I'm still being staggered. Fun times. I only found plans for Explosive Vents for Ultracite, which I'm not wearing ATM, nor did I bother modding it. Honestly I expect it to work on allies like Pain Train and fuck me in the ass at Whitesprings, just like Pain Train does.
---
Of course not, comrade
---
So it is confirmed that Queen has armor now? I read on Wiki that she doesn't have armor, just huge HP.
---
you know what's exhausting? people not accepting the game has a fuckton of flaws and that a lot of people have stopped playing this game. That they published their own launcher because they didn't want to give steam revenue and get review bombed to shit. That you have this subreddit with a cult of personality that just cant admit that though they love the game its still a huge steaming pile of hot garbage now. Even though I like the game even i'm freaking bored of it now,I killed the scorchbeast queen, I've collected what I wanted there is nothing else to do in this game and what is the point of trying to trade or have a decent economy when people are duplicating 50,000 fucking nuka cherry colas? You know why people are shitting on this game? Because Bethseda made it too fucking easy. Basic features not in the game on day 1, tons of bugs, servers couldn't keep up, tons of exploits and then THEIR RESPONSES to all of this was pathetic! oh heres's 500 atoms because of a nylon crap bag, here's 20 dollars for a santa skin that is somehow off when it was never on sale to begin with, POOR marketing. 
---
Here's my take on this:
---
You step out of the vault into this scorched Earth and start trying to rebuild America. The first few weeks/months are going to be rough. The structures you build and how you furnish them are going to be grim; tore up couches that give you diseases, busted windows, smoky generators, basically Gary, Indiana. But as you explore the world you find rarities, such as pristine chairs hiding in a locked closet, or upper level of a building. Slowly but surely your CAMP starts looking nicer, because you've scavenged the world for the finest rarities and have collected them. When you encounter your other vault dwellers, you can tell how much of an Appalachia veteran they are from how nice their place is, and it becomes a status symbol. Irradiated Mr. Pebbles poster? A dime a dozen. Pristine Mr. Pebbles Poster? Wow, that's tough to find nowadays.
---
Taking a step back and applying this to the meta of the game, if you want to by the atoms, go ahead. But if you don't you can still get the pristine stuff by earning the atoms through leveling up and other accomplishments. I would also be ok if the CAMP plans were tiered in 2's or 3's. 1st time you learn tinker's workbench it's a junker looking table, second time gets nicer looking, third time is pristine. All tiers provide same functionality, but it provides a mini-game of looking for those plans.
---
On the flip side they could make "Vault-tec tinker bench" and "Raider tinker bench" that would have the same functions, but different designs. Maybe tier 3 raider chairs would have a deathclaw skull above it where tier 1 is a human skull. Something to make the skins more personable, but not take away from the game.
---
Personally, I'm trying to rebuild Appalachia, so I want my CAMP to look like the vault, with the blue furniture with yellow trim. But that's just me.
---
Hodor 
---
&gt;But, but, but... you can't compare them. Because.
---
Typical panic response when the tables turn.
---
Go get wasted. 
---
Go do monster mash if someone is there, it's a free for all, though people might get pissed you ruined their farm.
---
BTW hunter/hunted is a queue? Though i need a team of 4 people and that's what the 1/4 was.
---
Thank goodness parents have people like you to help them make decisions on how to raise their kids. I can‚Äôt imagine what they‚Äôd do otherwise. Use their best judgement based on experience and familiarity with what their kids are mature enough to handle?? Pft. 
---
TheG00dN00dle 
---
That seems like an insecurity issue, everyone just wants Bethesda to be punished so we don't get another shitty game. The original buyers should take this as a lesson, if they feel attacked on their intelligence it makes sense because they did something stupid, but we all do stupid things, but we also don't all go complaining and blaming others for our mistakes.
---
Sorry I must've gotten confused. So the account owner's character who purchased the item from the Atom Store was unable to place an item they had purchased in their own camp?
---
Heyyyyy be nice to my mommy! 
---
Boy, Bethesda sure has a lot of balls... &lt;.&lt;
---
Honestly this sub and OP can fuck right off at this point. People around here so fucking desperate to blame anybody but those who made for game for the state it is in. 
---
Honestly sick of this now with this astroturfing bullshit.
---
It wouldn't be the same team.
---
i think she scales with how many people are around.  
---
so if you have some low lvls in the area who are just hiding you're out of luck if you cant compensate with the dmg output
---
"Maybe"
---
There are glowing super mutants and scorched super mutants so was hopping..
---
I was wrong. Bounties take full damage always. Game's Help section tells us that
---
No, She scales to the number of people in the event. 
---
Serious suggestion: Escalating Wanted! bounty effects.
---
**Wanted! levels:** (from lowest to highest)  
---
* Fugitive: No effect.  
---
* Bandit: Have to sleep with one eye open, no healing/buff from sleep.  
---
* Brigand: Stimpacks heal 10% less.  
---
* Desperado: The weight on your shoulders decreases carry weight by 15.  
---
* Thug: Can no longer fast travel.  
---
* Marauder: Increased stress means AP drains 10% faster.  
---
* Pariah: Vendors no longer trade with you.  
---
* Outcast: Can no longer capture/hold workshops.  
---
* Raider: No longer gains XP.
---
PS4 Pro, PSNID is NeM2k2
---
I have two issues - I have tried relogging/restarting the game multiple times to try and remedy them:
---
1. I hit level 50 doing the Monster Mash event in Watoga High School. The trophy for reaching level 50 did not unlock.
---
2. I am trying to replace the plain concrete floors (foundations) in my camp with textured ones that I bought from the Atom Store. When I try and store/scrap/move a floor piece, I get an error "Unspecified error occurred". I tried removing all walls/objects in contact with the floor piece (aside from the adjacent floor pieces which also give the same error)
---
I did lucky hole the other day. Came out with 60 ore which turned into 30 lead.
---
I went to charlseton fire department and cleared out the weight room and got 25 lead.....
---
The scrap to ore change nerfed lucky mine imo. 
---
Poseidon power plant
---
no it can't be. it's just a 'band wagon' of youtube conspirators that are threatening to take bethseda down. There can't possibly be a plethora of issues with this game and the poor responses from Bethseda have enflamed the gaming community. Clearly everyones just trying to be edgey and poor Beth is the victim here. 
---
I think Jimquisition's video on how Bethesda has been a pretty shady company for quite a while and everyone has just been giving them free pass after free pass sums up nicely why all this hate isn't really unwarranted, at least to me. 
---
To be fair Fallout76 did deserve to be on many lists for the worst game of 2018 because it was truly an inexcusable shitshow. From horrible glitches, unwanted patches that weren't announced even though Bethesda claimed they were going to be 100% transparent, lazy game design to the point where the endgame of hunting for nukes could be looked up on Reddit because they were too lazy to make more than 1 code per week, server issues/crashes, poor gameplay narrative, all to the song and dance of 60$.
---
EDIT: I forgot about the Atom Store technically doing a legal no-no by claiming items were "On Sale for x% of the amount" when they had never been on sale before. Also charging 20$ for 12 lazy emotes!
---
Fallout76 deserved a lot of the hate. It's stupid to make jokes about it in other completely unrelated subs, but Fallout76 earned its reputation as a joke. Let's hope its continuous improvements in 2019 help restore some of the damage Bethesda have earned.
---
It wasn't just a bad game. It was a company thinking they could get away with basically robbing customers. There's no reason to let them forget. 
---
What are you even mad about? 
---
"GO PLAY THAT. WHY THE DAMN HELL ELSE ARE YOU HERE" you say.
---
Then why the hell don't you just go play F76 if you like it. What do you care that the rest of the internet thinks it incredibly funny and meme worthy that a peice of trash like F76 ever released by a dev like bethesda? I mean people didn't even have to make memes up, the game was literally making them itself out of news headlines. Are you trying to make everyone like the game so that it sells more? 
---
I have an abundance of free food in game if anyone needs it. No stamps required. 
---
I'm annoyed by both sides of this 'debate,' personally, because I'm not even interested in the game at all. I don't like that kind of multiplayer game, please just stop shoving it in my face. 
---
Also, I promise I will never bring it up on my gaming channel at all. 
---
If Rockstar made Skyrim, it'd still have Morrowind controls, UI and combat.
---
Ne'ermind both online modes being pay to win hell holes (though at least RDR2 didn't extract every sandbox activity out of the singleplayer like GTA5 did).
---
Bethesda isn't exactly shiny themselves, but I've never understood the fascination with Rockstars horribly dated (behind the obvious shiny paint job) lazy games.
---
I‚Äôm just not into the game so I refrain from critiquing it.  I know it‚Äôs not a popular opinion but it‚Äôs an online game able to be constantly updated and patched.  A year from now I expect it to be fixed much like what happened with the division.
---
Yup! And I feel insulted paying full price for a "full game", whereas the people that pay half off later get a better game. Bethesda customer support ignoring requests for refund even at the start when the game wasn't working at all.
---
I'm not sure rockstar has ever marketed their games as do whatever you want everything is canon so how is this even a valid argument. They tell several stories that's about it...
---
Honestly, the fact that this post has to be made every single week is proof enough of the state of 76. If it wasn't full of such bullshit, there'd be no need to keep having to prove it's actually some misunderstood gem. Stop pretending the problems don't exist. 
---
I‚Äôll check later and get back to ya. I could probably see it from my veranda judging from your description. Which wire should I cut btw?
---
Enemies? No? Friendly robosts at Whitesprings and it's bunker? All the fucking time. Bodies everywhere.
---
I only kept 1 1 star which is raider sorry. Thought I still had them. 
---
Nah I use medium settings (and yes, on PC). My crashes are a *lot* better than they used to but they still happen on occasion. The server disconnects still happen fairly often, and my internet connection is good.  I was more talking about the people that are still having these issues.
---
They honestly shouldnt have made such a poorly thought out game then, I played every fallout from 2 until 4 but the design decisions in this just blag my head, it seems like the whole game is one big grind for loot, the multiplayer aspect hasnt been properly implemented, there are zero characters to interact with and as such the story feels very wooden and a lot of people seem to have just missed it completely because most of it is wrapped up in text logs rather than dialogue or gameplay, and the PvP aspect may as well not be there because if you're smart about it, you can never be killed by someone who attacks you first.
---
 Honestly it just comes across as a massive cash grab piggybacking off of the fans desire to have a multiplayer fallout and that isnt acceptable, if fallout 4 had been the game everyone wanted and expected it to be, then this game probably wouldnt be getting as much hate, but fallout 4 was a lazy edition of fallout that dropped a lot of what made the series so loved, fallout 76 seems to be more of the same, with a multiplayer gimmick they can use to bump up sales
---
No, he said it to deflect my criticism of youtubers how they ran into bugs and instead chose to make a big deal out of those bugs, rather than relog and show ‚Äúok it‚Äôs annoying but lets move on.‚Äù It‚Äôs nice that you are trying to view things positively, but I‚Äôm afraid in this case you‚Äôre merely wearing rose tinted glasses.
---
The person I was thinking of ran into a bug where if you have really small AP max and get overencumbered, you slow walk as if you‚Äôre out of AP until you stop being encumbered, let AP refill to max, and then go. Instead he spent the whole video slow walking around growing and making a big deal about it.
---
Unless you can show something new, I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm gonna call it here on this point. Unless you have something completely different in the subject to add?
---
Babyrage üë∂ 
---
&gt;The quoted part was said when talking about seeing things in the distance, including weather
---
Buildings and trees appear visible at about 100m or so for me. Enemies sometimes aren't visible til they're closer. Compared to Fallout 4, no, I can't see an improvement in the render distance. 
---
Love it!
---
Claims that there are issues one second then calls the people who are pointing them out entitled the next. 
---
Sorry what?
---
that's the sad part, they don't realize defending shit practices makes for a shit game and when people leave in droves they blame it on some hate bandwagon. No it's because you served shit that is why everyone stopped coming to the restaurant. 
---
+1 for the bots, on my pc (it's pretty low spec, an i5 6400 and a gtx 950) as soon as I get to whitespring it lags for about 5 minutes but then stabilize (sometimes the lighting even starts to act weird) 
---
Also, I always find bots all near each other, like everybot near a corner, just stuck togheter 
---
Yes, this has in fact been brought up many times.  To me it makes the most sense to have another type of STASH container that has shared inventory and a similar weight limit.
---
Ok fine. This guy‚Äôs mom is allowed. 
---
&gt;And what are they basing those claims on?
---
experience? not everyone is out to get Fallout 76. *especially when we have better games that set out to do exactly the the same thing*.
---
&gt;Seriously, if you didn't get the point by now, you're not getting it
---
you say explosives and melee need to be nerfed in order to achieve balance. I say they don't. you say they do because people can't tag ghouls in Whitesprings. I say, in that case, literally every other build needs to be nerfed as well, since snipers are at a severe disadvantage because they can't bum rush the ghouls inside the golf house, which is exactly what everyone does. you can't shoot them through the walls, snipers need to stay on top of a bus and wait for a straggler.
---
this to exemplify that you can't achieve balance and someone will always be left out. that nerfing explosives and melee will shit on everyone's parade for no good reason. seems sound to me.
---
&gt;They serve a singleplayer purpose to you
---
unlocking plans and gathering supplies is a singleplayer purpose.
---
&gt;In your opinion this isn't a multiplayer game. Very well said, I liked the in your opinion part.
---
I knew you were going to get your wires crossed there but I'd hoped for the better. my fault, really.
---
it's *my opinion* **that the game shouldn't have a market at all**. this is subjective seeing as how singleplayer games *can* have markets, so long they're backed by dollars. however, considering this mess doesn't really have to be always online, the concept seems silly *to me*.
---
&gt;You have proven my points.
---
you'd like that, wouldn't you? so far what I gathered is that you don't know much about gaming, both as a player and as a designer. or its history either, considering you were struggling with the concept of a "market" a couple posts back.
---
I'm on board with your sentiments to a degree, but the poor release and the bag were not the only transgressions. Bethesda has kept themselves in the forefront of these discussions by shooting themselves in the foot time and time again.
---
The 500 credit apology about the bag.
---
The support ticket system sending private info to other customers.
---
The shitty and super late rum bottles with little to no communication about why and when.
---
The endgame nuke codes that could be figured out without working for it, and then subsequent disabling of that mechanic all together when 2019 hit cuz of a glitch.
---
There's maybe more I'm not remembering? 
---
I still haven't found a use for them in game. What are they for? They don't even turn to nuked flora like they should be so I can get my flux fix.
---
I can totally understand it. "Why spend 8-16+ hours server hopping for a jet pack when I can just pay $5 and move on with my life BUT WITH FLIGHT"
---
This is a problem with the RNG vendor situation as much as it is an issue with duping. 
---
Similarly regarding 2SE weapons: they are streets ahead of any other weapon in the game for maximized damage. This is an issue with the weapon as much as it is with the dupers. If explosive were replaced with "ignites" or incompatible with 2S, you'd see much less need for duping and much less of a real world market for it.
---
I got the game recently had a voucher and game was only ‚Ç¨35, got it for ‚Ç¨15. Wanted to see if it deserved its negative reception. In the first day I played it, I needed a massive 40GB update, then when it was done, it took hours to install. Made it to level 5 in maybe 2-3 hours with 2 game crashes, enemies glitch in and out while i was trying to hit them, lag, graphical glitches, etc. Felt like I was playing some Beta version of the game. I have great internet too, streamsPSNow games almost perfectly so it was not a connection problem. 
---
With the likes of No Man‚Äôs Sky, that was a case of a small company with a small team outright lying about their product, false advertising, etc. 
---
But Fallout 76 was a new game in one of the most popular gaming series in history by one of the most successful gaming companies in history. The company that had a game so successful its been ported to nearly everything. If this is how bad 76 was after weeks of updates, then I cant imagine what it would have been like if I got it Day 1. 
---
As for the bag, it was false advertising plain and simple, deliberately misleading. And their excuses for the bag were laughable. For example, some editions of Persona 5 came with a bag made from the same material as the 76 was supposed to be. This is a smaller company and there was not as much of a guarantee the game would sell well (although Atlus games are popular, not as popular as Bethesdas or makes as much money), their bags were exactly as advertised. I find it hard to believe that Bethesda had trouble having the bags made the way they were advertised, when smaller companies could. 
---
Basically they sold an incomplete, buggy mess of a game, that honestly feels rushed. The game often just feels like a Fallout 4 MMO mod. A Fallout multiplayer isn‚Äôt exactly a bad idea, it was just poorly executed and the microtransactions are frustrating. The only compensation they gave players was a minuscule amount of in-game currency and copies of other Fallout games on steam, which if you‚Äôre a console player without a gaming computer, like me, you are out of luck, and those games are regularly dirt cheap in sales, so not much of a saving getting them free. 
---
I agree... Its my understanding that RDR2 online launch to a shit show as well, but there is barely a blip on the radar unless you are looking for it, where as people can't seem to jerk off hard enough bashing FO76.
---
See a lot less of those crashes once the supers are gone.
---
Psh, I'd give it away for free except literally half my game time is spent managing my inventory and stash so I can actually gather that much steel. I *earned* those caps lol.
---
Yeh, that game was setting records of refunds, and got completely shat on for months.
---
I think the point is that with RDR2's huge open world you'd expect some more choises how to approach a mission instead of the single predetermined path, not necessary changing the outcome of the mission with those choises. Don't get me wrong I absolutely loved RDR2 mostly because of the story but it feels like every mission has you riding for several minutes, doing a task and getting into a gunfight, and then riding back. It kinda defeats the purpose of the vast open world if you only have a single route to follow. Of course there are things to do outside missions but tbh not so much as you would expect from a game that scale. My points made here are mostly based on this video: https://youtu.be/MvJPKOLDSos I urge you to watch it.
---
Regardless the fact that I think you cit Bethesda too much slack and are wrong about No Man's Sky getting less flak.
---
The main problem with your request is that Fallout 76 is a gift **that just keeps on giving**.
---
Blizzards "don't you guys have phones" was spectacular, but it was a flash.
---
Fallout 76 is a train wreck that was in the process of wrecking for extended periods of time. Hell, with a game released in the 4th quarter not handling a year change the train is arguably still in motion.
---
With Fallout managing to screw something else up at least every other week it has stayed relevant. So people haven't moved on yet.
---
You realize this is just because Bethesda has a huge audience, right?
---
I'm guessing it's a joke weapon? Like the alien blaster is this super rare weapon you only get a few shots with in the single player games, but this time they switched it up as a joke/easter egg.
---
No, right now you can't build stuff with any of that stuff you find on legendary items. 
---
I wish it was different, and you could.
---
So it would go over well if between bug fixes they pushed atom shop stuff?
---
Maybe the armor reduces fall damage to the limb?.. that's weird but not unexpected.
---
If you get into the whitesprings bunker, you'll have a different path to getting your ID, which will eventually get you a military ID.
---
You can get to the whitesprings bunker by finding Sam Coleman's bunker and doing some work in there.   If you need help with that, I can give you pointers for that as well.
---
Sure add me and stop by when I accept your request have a mic on or send a dm with your order when you get to my camp. 
---
The best mole rats are the ones that seemingly get stuck in a loop burrowing and unburrowing in the same spot. So you have to play VATS whack a mole to get them.
---
(Based on the VATS tracking, and my buddy actually VATS teleporting through with them once), they're tryign to burrow to some insane inaccesible point (like the top of the Poseidon smoke stacks) for some reason)
---
No, there not coming this month...
---
 *We‚Äôre also building an incredible list of future updates that we can‚Äôt wait to share, including new quests, weekly in-game events, new Vaults opening, a new PvP mode, Player Vending and much more.* 
---
A list of future updates is coming this month along with whatever fixes they've managed to get done for this months patch. Pretty sure they only mentioned this as well because they know that when the Lever action rifle animation fix is the only thing worth mentioning about the actual next update there in serious trouble!
---
Hope I'm wrong and that this months update fixes a ton of the issues and gets rid of duping but i doubt it very much!
---
Well, if anything it just proves the point that people that create review videos on youtube are just sheep and afraid of actually admitting they like the game. Because if they like it, they lose subs.
---
They'd rather be seen as the "trendy" people riding the hate train.
---
They're all fucktards.
---
Complaining about dumping $60 into a game that didn't live up to your expectations and ranting about this same point for 10 minutes? FUCKING GET A JOB, SKIP THAT COFFEE, MOVE ON.
---
I'm actually enjoying Fallout 76.
---
You clearly subscribe and subject yourself to some really shitty clickbait-style channels/articles then. Why don‚Äôt you try to find better channels to follow rather than just bitching about shitty clickbait channels who use FO76 to make easy money
---
Ah, that could explains why she went down in matter of second the other day.
---
Not trying to sound dumb here, but what is the allure to calibrated shocks? Why are they so sought after?
---
This. So much this.
---
[Here is a video of my camp](https://youtu.be/7ICjq_-esvc)
---
this might blow your mind but just because your PC hasn't been crashing doesn't mean everyone elses is working fine. I've only had crashing issues since the last patch on exiting the desktop but before that I had zero issues. My friend on the other hand used to crash roughly every 3 hours but his computer is obviously different from mine. To say people are exaggerating is disingenuous to the fact people have different p.c.s

---
Thanks for your fantastic comment
---
Pm ur gamertag if pc
---
Lots of the hate comes from people's opinions before it was even out. Although I enjoy the game no matter how they released it people would still hate it. It could have the best mechanic's of all the fallout games (and in my opinion I like the mechanic's alot) but people who'd never accept the idea.
---
It's a good game but people are reviewing it as a single player, quest driven game and that is not what it is so that's not what it deserves to be rated as.
---
Might be an unpopular opinion for some, but I think some weapons need to be nerfed too.
---
Those explosive shotguns are too powerful, you should not be able to one-shot the final boss.
---
If only they'd give us the respect of being that honest.
---
I don't think that you can learn legendary effects... If you could, that would be great. I have nearly a full set of 15% less damage from xxxxx enemies that make me a bullet sponge. But the armor is low level so it breaks easy
---
I was kinda bummed on the rarity of plans at first, but after a while you start gradually finding stuff through exploration, vendors and friendly players.
---
Always check the containers near vendors, because people will leave stuff they don't need in them.  The cash registers by Phoenix and the blue suitcase at Watoga station often have unwanted legendary stuff, scrap materials and plans.
---
They were the single hardest enemy for me to deal with. Then I made an Enforcer character and they are the easiest. I think that's why they stuffed them in silos, to try and promote group clearing. You need a bruiser to break them but then be less useful against the queen 
---
Yes its broken, but so is melee for that matter. It doesn't not annihilate everything--just most things.
---
&gt;  and I still get downvoted for everything I say 
---
Typical reaction of the hatewagon. You stand against their hate parade with facts and reasonable opinions. So they must punish you, just like the totalitarian regimes did to their oponnents. These people don't like discussions because they consider themselves superior because they joined the tribe of "Bethesda = Bad". 
---
Don't worry. It just shows how pathetic they are. Kudos for goimg against the artificial narrative. I've upvoted all your comments.
---
Putting together a pc, hopefully it‚Äôll be ready for Cyberpunk 2077.
---
Playing on PS4 
---
That‚Äôs near enough the exact same justification I have for selling chems to robots. Your siblings are smart kids.
---
I'm not on the hate train, but here's some reasons why I dislike Fallout 76.  It's not just the bad graphics, iffy animations, glitches galore, bad rendering distance, lost stash items, broken quests, random disconnections, and long loading times - but also the fact that I can't return this game.  
---
For digital purchases through the Xbox store, if you've played any game more than 2 hours, you're completely unable to get a refund.  I spent $80 on this game (the disappointing Tricentennial Edition DLC at that \[$20 more for a handful of cosmetics!\], but that's on me for getting it) +in the state it's in I'm dissatisfied with what I feel is an incomplete game I paid a fair amount of money for.
---
So, I'm as invested as **I** can be in wanting 76 to be as great a game as **it** can be.  Had I returned it, I could buy it back once it's been fixed.  Now I'll wait until it's been fixed + I'll happily play when it is, and tell my friends who are on the fence about getting it, to get it.  I've been a Fallout fan for such a long time, it kind of hurts to see the franchise in the state that it's in now.
---
Right now I hate Legendaries because unless I have a TSE weapon, I can't kill fast enough to do certain key quests.  Yeah...maybe I shouldn't have bought an MMOLite game when none of my RL friends did.
---
That means that nobody is having problems and we are all lyin then yes because the game plays great for you?
---
The writing of your comment shows how much you like to waste time commenting about a "bunch of bullshit". Thanks for your time.
---
Gungeon, Isaac, Terraria all come to mind for me
---
I seen a lots of people with melee weapons that would wait for her to land before engaging. 
---
This post is funny as fuck
---
That's not what you said, and they're already doing that. 
---
One of the first mods I installed for Fallout 4 would show hidden stats. I miss mods.
---
Also ammo capacity would be nice. Nothing like seeing that whole two extra bullets and wondering if it was really worth it.
---
Level 103 and I always help the lower players. Even when they shoot at me first. Generally a wave makes them realize I'm friendly.
---
luck hole aka when your girl is on your period
---
Jet pack duhhhh :p Tesla coils makes the game too easy. Easy = bored fast 
---
Sorry it didn't work. Wish I had more ideas for you.
---
Oh fuck right off! are you 13? do you not understand the value of money?
---
Inb4 'OMG R U POOR!?!1'
---
I like the idea behind legendaries. Unique items that provide unique bonuses that alter the way you play the game. What I don't like is the execution. I don't like the fact only a handful of affixes are worthwhile for weapons and greatly outclass everything else, I don't like the complete and utter RNG associated with their drops (including weapon levels), and I absolutely hate that there are only a handful of ways to obtain them. Throw in the fact that all legendary farming occurs with other players, and I have to chase down mobs to tag them before someone 1 shots them with some overpowered legendary effect, and it's just not a fun system.
---
I would personally love a way to introduce crafting into the RNG, but also allow ways to farm specific things. Like if I want a weapon, give me an event or dungeon or something I can run repeatedly to attempt to get it (a bit of RNG is fine, but the entire weapon and armor pool being involved in every drop is just tedious and frustrating). In fact, both of these systems could work so well together. Have base legendary effects that are on items that drop, but also methods of beefing them up or altering them further with mods. There is so much potential to make the end game more engaging and interesting, I really hope they have a plan to tackle it.
---
I agree with OP. It definitely had its faults. However, it doesn't deserve the intensity of the backlash that it's receiving. And even if it did, we're all sick and tired of hearing about it anyway.
---
I agree, but I can‚Äôt say im a big fan of terraria (I do have +210 hours on the game.)
---
What activates the excavator quest?
---
You can get dysentery in 76 from drinking dirty water.
---
   PA &gt; Normal Armor in this game.
---
Yea I‚Äôm gonna focus on heavy weapons build so I will pass on the gauss. I still am very interested in the nuka grenade plan. 
---
I hope so. The lamp doesn't work in fallout 4 so probably not gonna happen in fallout 76. 
---
The same thing happened to me, lost all my 10mm ammo at about level 15. Couldn‚Äôt believe it
---
It‚Äôs a meme, stop getting your feelings hurt over a game you like.
---
Does anyone know how to make sure Bethesda sees this?
---
Neither can you by the sounds of it...
---
Mum and dad buy yours?
---
I like the idea, don‚Äôt agree with all those effects. I feel like people would game it and get past those first few levels of largely ignoreable effects and then have a friend kill them for the bounty.
---
Which leads me to a good point. *The penalties can not provide a benefit that can somehow make their way back to the criminal.* This is why bounties in video games are a joke. EVE online did them, and it was like paying your aggressor even more money. He‚Äôd just have a friend blow him up and they‚Äôd share it.
---
Real penalties include (oh cool that‚Äôs how you do bullet points):
---
- can‚Äôt trade with vendors
---
- can‚Äôt do quests for certain factions
---
- factions attack them (Whitesprings)
---
- other access points deny them access (can‚Äôt launch nukes, can‚Äôt use orbital strikes, etc)
---
- can‚Äôt gain XP
---
- can‚Äôt see anyone on the map
---
- can no longer damage other player structures(at a certain point you aren‚Äôt rp‚Äôing a raider, you are just being a dick)
---
- cannot join teams. Yeah that‚Äôs right. Even with other ‚Äúraiders‚Äù
---
And so on.
---
I forget where you get it at, but it is worthless. You can't do anything with it. You just pick up the item you are there for. 
---
&gt;  Unique items that provide unique bonuses that alter the way you play the game. What I don't like is the execution.
---
This is a good summation of what I was thinking. I kind of was going with stream of consciousness when I was writing. 
---
The only thing that is going to make the subject of FO76 any less exhausting is time. Either the game continues to improve and the hate becomes more muted or it slowly withers away and dies. I paid 60 dollars and really enjoyed the almost ~150 hours I spent playing Fallout 76, but (sadly) the best thing I ever did was stop regularly checking this sub. This isn‚Äôt a conversation anymore, it‚Äôs people on both sides talking themselves in circles about the other. I loved the game, but it is ultimately just a game; when playing it or participating in the community stops being a positive experience for me, I move on to the rest of the titles in my backlog. I‚Äôm still curious to see what the future content additions will be, and hopefully whenever I return to playing FO76 the conversation surrounding it becomes more productive/fun to be a part of.
---
I can't imagine being low HP with normal armor at least. I melt like butter even with high ER/DR especially against ghouls.
---
Possible lore explanation for pvp being total shit?
---
If you don't mind the loss of carry weight, you can always carry two chest pieces and favorite them and swap them on the go.
---
I have traded with a person like this (I didn't know beforehand) and it took five minutes for his inventory to show up. After we traded one item it took another five minutes to show up in my inventory.
---
I've also found paper bags near this kind of player. Just their being around makes it take minutes to view the inventory of the bag, never mind if the bag itself has a lot of stuff in it.
---
Extrapolate and assume your stash was maybe 2000lbs, it would probably take you 30 seconds to open it every time. Imagine how that would look to the average player.
---
The next wave should start coming 20 or 30 seconds after you're down to the last 5 enemies.
---
Maybe if they couldn't just wipe their bounty with a friend, and teleport wherever they want while they're wanted it might be more interesting. Right now the Wanted system is too easy to abuse, these people have no interest in roleplaying as "Raiders". Most of them are just immature people spamming crap through their microphones, or abusing the broken parts of the game to ruin someone elses day.
---
Except for the whole, you know, being down with wanton killing. 
---
For sure. I would certainly not say it's a great system, but it is what it is. If you buy a Rockstar game, you can be fairly certain how it'll play. Same for a Bethesda RPG.
---
The problem is, the person I replied to is using Rockstar's INTENTIONAL and CONSISTENT style as a reason to trivialize complaints about Bethesda. Because Rockstar has linear gameplay, your complaints about Bethesda are now invalid or worth less than before. It's a stupid comment by somebody that just wants to blindly defend a game and shit on another one.
---
Then they try to make it seem like an opinion statement by saying "to each their own." Opinion statements do not start with "gotta love people shitting on bethesda when..."
---
With ammo Smith and super duper I can spend 12 lead for 54 energy rounds, sometimes 108, and expect to be able to spend maybe 300 rounds before the gun breaks.
---
Or I can spend 15 lead on 180 rounds, sometimes 360, and be able to actually use the ammo I've made, as well as having some to spare. Top that with I'm a rifle build, so I use a pipe rifle with 50, and you'd find I even do more damage with the pipe rifle than I do with the laser weapons. 
---
My statement was that even as a extra ammo type, energy weapons are useless because another ammo type is easier to make in bulk as well as deals more damage. And that's just for lasers specifically. Plasma rifle rounds cost more to make and do less damage. 
---
Just curious, why don't other games with massive inventories have constant server crash issues? 
---
I wish some of the effects made more sense in a science gone crazy world. 
---
I said nothing about different teams either yet here we are.
---
And no one cares about cosmetics as the game is a buggy mess still.
---
They'd shoot themselves in the foot announcing more atom shop items than bug fixes.
---
Considering you can see in the pic it‚Äôs greyed out as too high level for me, unsure what level you need to be to craft it but I‚Äôd imagine I can‚Äôt make it either 
---
Shotgun is bugged. It doesn't hurt flying scorchbeasts.
---
Bugthesda.
---
Not a thing
---
Fucking. Shut. Up.
---
How much
---
I can only speculate. I think people are duping without crashing, I don't know how, but in any game people look for ways to turn crash glitches into duplication glitches.
---
The kind of bug they look for:
---
Player A gives items to player B.
---
B logs out, which commits their inventory to disk.
---
&lt;something is done to crash the server, I don't know what&gt;
---
Player A still has their items because their inventory was lost in the crash, reverting to an older save. But B has the same items too.
---
I have class freak R3 and both mutations, and the damage that the mutation dealt back is very little that I don't even notice. 
---
Someone dumped 20 of those at grafton station the other day.
---
I had to do a double take
---
Sorry to hear that :)
---
So let's ignore that theres a karma system in the game... I'm talking about being too far out of mission area or not doing something exactly how the game tells you. Using the facade of an open world to sell a linear experience. Go check out NakeyJakey's RDR2 video as he explains it pretty well.
---
Oh I agree... The legendary system simply does not work in this game and i have no idea how they can fix it now that everyone has these guns.. The gap between a fully modded, max level shotgun and a level 5 two shot explosive version of the same gun is ridiculous. 
---
4k caps
---
I was the one of four. There was a queue since there wasn‚Äôt enough to start
---
Nvm too poor lol
---
cus the games shit 
---
I can confirm this. It depends on amount of players but NOT the levels of the players. Which sucks because if there's 8 players but 6 of them are around level 50 and don't contribute, I just leave since she's just a bullet sponge and I rather not waste resources. 
---
100+ Technical data...still no paints. 
---
This game is a complete garbage and it was only created so bethesda can milk money of life long fans of the series. 
---
This is fallout 4 reskined. It literally has the same fucking bugs fallout 4 had.
---
Its nobodies fault that you are to sensitive to handle the truth. You like the game? Fine, play it, but dont tell others to not call it out for what it is : A FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT CASHGRAB.
---
You and the rest of the 10 players keep having fun!
---
I went in without any expectations and still got a good 100+ hours out of it and still going. Most of the complaints boil down to "no npcs/old engine" while it's still a very decent casual sandbox/survival mmorpg. I'd even dare to say it feels less buggy and more interesting than some of those DayZ/Ark clones..
---
I hate to tell you this, but the Brotherhood Initiate paint is for the T-60.  Possibly there's a T-51 variant I haven't found yet.
---
I bought no mans sky and even preordered he game a few months before launch. That was my mistake and I wouldn‚Äôt put down a single person that wants to shit on the game. 
---
Proof LOL
---
This sub yet again, something you didn't quite understand or grasp and straight over to reddit with your proof!
---
/slowclap
---
It's a rare gun it's a two star it's really good if you can get it before tm then i'll give it to you
---
Sounds like the devs were trolling you 
---
Lol a team mate
---
I completely forgot about all that. Thanks.
---
It doesn't even hit the ones that do land.. Only AOE from the floor under it.. But if this is a bug, they should really fix it. 
---
Action boy is good, finding friends is great. With friends you can also use revenant to get those insane dps numbers. I would get rid of dodgy for sneak. Dodgy is a trap I fell for, it eats AP no matter how large the hit so rapid hits just drain you and prevents sprinting for cover or power attacks. A good replacement is sneak and escape artist. Things (mostly) can't hurt you if they can't see you and with plain old 1 star unyielding gear your agility will be high enough that you can sneak attack things in the face and they won't know where you are. If they do? Just stand up and crouch again for continued 2x damage boost. Other things to consider on a low life melee build are ninja, nerd rage, and serendipity.
---
Also I would go for tenderizer over body gaurds. It's multiplicative with your other damage perks not additive like most perks so despite the low numbers it does a lot.
---
Rockstar wants to tell you a story.
---
Bethesda wants you to tell the story.
---
Not entitled at all I have all the Mods, Weapons, and mutation that I will ever need,  I am level 150. My point is we were all lower levels at one time. Give others the chance to pick up what they need to level up. I have no problem with a level 150 or above taking me on because I never carry anything of value, so my opponent is very disappointed I am sure. All I am saying is give peace a chance.
---
I don't know what it is but I constantly lose bodies and sometimes "reenact" the fight to remember where they fell. Once on fo4 it took me two in game days to find Sheffield's body after a particularly bad battle at covenant. I was really bummed out about that, even got the cat. 
---
I‚Äôm on a PS4 when I blue screened my wireless connection went out as well I think I‚Äôm stuck in a glitch 
---
mothman cult and chill?  is that a thing now?
---
If AP is you're only conern, refresh rate. 1 agility hardly gives enough AP to be noticeable 
---
F@cking RNG man. I hate it. 
---
Nah i saw that but it isn't necessarily 'open world' in the same way fallout is there isn't many if all decisions that aren't one of two things. Rockstar have always had a lineal story with sandbox elements tagged in. 
---
I mean really most islands in GTA have began blocked so...
---
I've been in the bunker... Had the nuke launch "poster" training, etc. I don't recall finding anything about Sam in there (although I might have.  The night I opened the bunker I was self-medicating with Sam Adams Boston Lager).
---
Agreed.  If you don't like people's opinions, then that's your own problem.  
---
Is the game getting a lot of flack? Yes.  Is it deserved?  YES.  Has it become an easy target as a result?  Yes.  
---
This same shit happened with No Man's Sky, and it takes the most devout sycophant to say the game is acceptable coming from a company like Bethesda.  
---
The game was a blatant cash grab and it's painfully obvious.  This is the same company that brought us Skyrim, and 7 years later, this is the best they have?  It seriously plays like an ambition community mod, not a 60 dollar AAA title.  
---
All the bad press is necessary to give Bethesda a message that they need to get their shit together, stop using their ANCIENT engine (or at least do a MAJOR overhaul on it), and respect the community by providing a new, solid game that isn't a buggy mess at launch.  
---
Maybe it‚Äôs you that is bugged 
---
For me sometimes I do no damage to ghouls  
---
thats fine if there are people around who cripple her wings, so she comes down  
---
but often there are people hiding in the barn who just shot her once and wait for loot   
---
those make it harder   
---
theres away around this  
---
when nuking and target selecting place the nuke in a way so prime fissure is inside the red zone but the delta point is not (the fast travel point in the right corner behind fissure prime)    
---
if you do it this way and fast travel to it the queen will spawn there    
---
you can fight the queen without rads   
---
and the barn is far away,  
---
though there is also a bunker to hide, atleast in my runs lower lvl people dont get there fast enough until we kill the queen and often needs to get through the entire red zone first
---
There are a bunch of underarmors, like BoS, Enclave, Raider, etc. You can also upgrade them to give stat bonuses and a little resists.
---
[https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Underarmor](https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Underarmor)
---
That's... actually... the best Idea I've heard all week.  Keep the coils around for doing nuke runs, jetpack for travel.
---
Yeah she mentions in the quest line when she tells you where it is that she doesn‚Äôt have a claim ticket and can‚Äôt get around the robot, searched pleasant valley up and down but can‚Äôt find no claim ticket 
---
Once in a while, nuclear material
---
no u
---
There are underarmors available in the game i.e raiders, marine etc. If you sort armor by weight they will all be 1.1
---
Many of the plans (weapon plans at least) at Harper's Ferry are [unfortunately level-dependent](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ad1n16/handmade_rifle_plans_level_locked_at_harpers/). I don't know whether that includes brick plans.
---
No i paid good money for a game that's half finished, I'm legitimately angry about the state of the actual game
---
Rip your AP
---
So little point then
---
hey buddy! Thanks for your feedback, I added a search function, labels to show what the items are and i've tested it on mobile and it seems to be working fine on my oneplus one, please give it a shot!

---
One of the things I liked *least* about Fallout 4 was the switch from set "Unique" weapons and armor to a randomized "Legendary" system.
---
It is nice that 76 brought back this concept a bit, but still strikes me as a bit off that the "best" weapon in the game is something you might randomly get from a legendary radroach (Which, why do they even have weapons?) instead of from a set boss or "dungeon".
---
Good Idea, never thought of that, got the calibrated shocks so would not make that much difference.
---
got a rad-x once. they're useful if you're running a bloodied build.
---
yea unless i was mistaken this was alot more often in the beta 
---
I've totally revamped the UI and it should be working on mobile now
---
The loot is extremely random. Most give nothing, although I've found everything from a spoon to a legendary handmade on them.
---
I appreciate the offer, but I‚Äôve said goodbye to 76 at this point. Got smash and Red dead 2, but thanks anyway!
---
Most of the haters didn‚Äôt even buy the game. 
---
On the brighter side I only have to wait 5.5 months till I get my canvas bag.  Thanks Todd.
---
I know nothing about that stuff so I'll take your word for it, but it's not just stackables either. Weapons and armor are probably the worst since they have unique legendary effects, mods *and* condition to load. Then you have chems, magazines, bobbleheads, nuked stuff, hell probably even food and water, which again have heir own conditions.
---
"But if this is a bug, **they should really fix it**."
---
Lmao. Maybe in 2020.
---
Oh and yeah this sucks, I wanted to go pure Shotgun build and have 5 different ones in inventory for different situations. One that heals like crazy (medic + shotgun is nuts), one designed for vats crits (shotgun can chain crits like crazy and they can snipe from very far w/ crit), and indoor ones and outdoor TSE ones.
---
But I gave it up cause they practically do 0 dmg to the main enemy mob type (SB) and final boss (SBQ). Not fun.
---
308 ammo is a consistent drop for super mutants. At your level, the best consistent place to go might be the lumber mill at the top left corner of the map.
---
I wish they had a 1 in 3 chance of giving an atom. 
---
Good trade

PRAISE GERALDO BEATHEASDA BAD
---
This is the biggest crybaby rant I've ever seen. If a game is getting this much hate, it's warranted. Games don't get this much hate for no reason at all. No Man's Sky got absolutely demolished when that came out cause of all the promises and features it was said to have and failed to deliver on. Bethesda hyped this game up and fell flat on it's face. The hate is deserved. Deal with it.
---
That would make sense
---
üñïüò°üñïPraise üëåüò´üëå GERALDO üëèüò§üëè
---
Same, it will occasionally kill a lvl 1 molerat or ghoul somehow, probably in multiple hits - but literally anything stronger seems to reduce the damage to like, 1hp
---
Try a trading subreddit
---
Thanks for the tips. I'll make sure to do that next time. 
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox, would you happen to have any serums for sale? I‚Äôll give what I can, as I haven‚Äôt found an efficient way to get the mutations I need
---
Honestly it'll be the same game, except mods won't be restricted on Xbox. But if your PS4 is newer it might be more powerful than your Xbox so it could be a better choice in that regard. I play on an OG xb1 so you'll be but but still
---
You obviously haven't seen the video, I was specifically talking about lazy mission design which was not at all the same as in gta3.
---
What the fuck are you even talking about islands beginning blocked. You are literally having a different conversation. People fucking jumping to defend rdr2 like it's their fucking child.
---
Charleston Fire Department weight room.. they look like weights and dumbbells but they are just very refined ore. 
---
What are the penalties for being wanted? Can't you just do whatever it is you're doing until someone comes and do it or you shutdown? 
---
I'm a level 80 and I've never taken a workshop, but I've helped others defend them. Can someone explain the benefits of workshops? I don't bother with them because I play solo and don't understand their use. 
---
Personally agree with OP. I enjoy the game even as it is right now. Maybe I am just optimistic. Things will get better and things could be worse. 
---
Here's what the wiki says:  " The ability to craft X-01 power armor is unlocked at the [Whitespring Congressional Bunker](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Whitespring_Congressional_Bunker), after attaining the rank of general officer during [Officer on Deck](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Officer_on_Deck) and accessing the schematic archive in the command center "
---
so it appears to  have nothing to do with BoS or Fort Defiance.
---
Yeahhh no. The game is still an embarrassing pile of garbage and deserves all the scorn it gets. If you think it‚Äôs in a remotely acceptable state right now you‚Äôre either a fanboy/girl or just have bad taste. I will continue to ride the Bethesda hate train all the way to the station in the hope that they change course.
---
I'm trying to explain to you how game companies work. 
---
People use the internet to bitch about stuff and share porn. You act surprised.
---
Was thinking about doing the same kinda build, but it's the only reason we can't. Guess I'll carry my handmade untill it's fixed.. 
---
You can also farm it off scorched. They tend to drop pretty frequently.
---
I hope not, the helmet lamps suck
---
Some high level just helped me there as well.  Even without a mic, he was patient with me and hooked me up with a new pistol and bullets.  Whoever you are thanks. You rock bro.
---
Pray to RNGesus more. I see those plans daily. Try having a few different characters to check the merchants and don't forget ole Phoenix down at watoga.
---
When he's not chilling in the river or cruising around town randomly...
---
&gt; In a real world scenario
---
aaaaand you were done before you started. You then go on to make a bunch of random assumptions you pull out of your ass and treat them like gospel. Mkay.
---
Of course! I have at least 5 of every serum at any given time. Even 20+ of the popular ones like Marsupial. I'm at work right now but if you want to DM me either here or on xbox (GT Angelofdeath116) we can meet up.
---
Gotcha.  Still trying to figure things out.
---
u/LoneVaultWanderer
---
Yes because it's bugged.
---
How I've felt since launch ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
i never got radx or nuclear material  
---
i tried at least a hundred times, maybe 3 or 4 times i got some caps   
---
But I think there are challenges for atoms for destroying/searching them 12000 times or something like that
---
You can kite Queen just far enough outside blast zone to where you don't get rads. This will enable you to wear a full set of Unyielding armor, if you use a Bloodied build like myself, for a total of +15 SPECIAL in each stat. That means +15 STR for Unarmed weapons or non-PA 2H.
---
So for 2H it would be 85% with 2H perks and TM, and Unarmed would get 70% with Unarmed perk, TM, and Talons. 
---
What I'd really like to know here is if that extra 15% is worth the speed decrease compared to how fast an unarmed attack is vs 2H
---
...or they could officially make workshops pvp arenas and disable legendaries.
---
You're super duper OP.
---
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.urbandictionary.com/define.php%3fterm=duper&amp;amp=true
---
Ooooo invite me, gt is srgt peanut
---
yeah dude it was totally a panicked response. explain to me how they are comparable when one is an add on to the main game and one is the main game. 
---
Made a post like this myself not long ago.
---
There are stills all over the place, several moonshiners shacks and everything. One of the other things I'd ask for, hand in hand with making booze, would be a bee nest to farm honey and being able to plant other plants like firecracker berries, star berries, and cranberries.
---
I used to have multiple pieces with AP regen, also had 12 AG. I can tell you, I'd much more rather the regen over AG aside from access to perk cards. It seems as though each piece gives 10-15% AP regen rate.
---
This happens with a lot of games. Haters who don't even play the game or know about the game just bandwagon hates on it and youtubers bank on the topic by repeating what other haters say. It really annoys me also. 
---
Blows my mind that people spend so much time hating on something they don't even want or own. 
---
gilded armor is not the same i think ?
---
I'll check em out GT is statesidellama send me a message I guess I will join off that. In the middle of killing stuff
---
Well anybody can attack you for full damage and you can't see anybody on the map so I don't want to be in the middle of an excursion and lose all my junk
---
I've logged in twice since Friday, giving the game another shot after a three week lay off. Both time I"ve logged on, the game has crashed about 30 minutes into game play. This game is getting worse, not better. I'm close to putting it down forever.
---
EDIT: I'm on Xbox
---
&gt; srgt peanut
---
one moment
---
Thank you 
---
My suggestion applies only to the "buff laser weapons" part of the op. 
---
I agree that hitreg needs a fix, durability is a problem,  and was unaware of the armour piercing issue but agree if that's not working it also needs a fix. 
---
It's almost like we're expected not to just have it spoon fed and handed too us!
---
Get a grip you big Vag.
---
I have one it's not legendary or anything but if it had the same stats as my grognaks it would  be amazing. It has higher base damage than the grognaks and is way more durable. Added bonus is that it only takes bones to repair 
---
...I'm sorry I haven't heard anyone about it since launch week. 
---
Maybe you need some hobbies 
---
Also the game was completely trash so deal with it 
---
The terminal at fort defiance is for the brotherhood rifle plans.  X-01 plans come from whitesprings bunker.
---
Hmm - They are addressing me as general...  
---
What does that terminal outside of Defiance do that requires military ID?
---
That's what I was thinking other than that they are just pain with their tiny amount of rads.
---
Why are you being downvoted for this? 
---
I‚Äôll admit that duping is a major issue.
---
However, I‚Äôll be the first to admit that my internet connected sucks - and I get disconnected at least once a night because of poor connectivity. I‚Äôm willing to bet that more people are being disconnected because they have poor connectivity than because of actual server issues. 
---
This brings up a good opportunity to point out that if you ARE experiencing frequent disconnects, you might just take a moment to test your connectivity and improve your general quality of life while using the internet in general. 
---
The website I use is speedtest.net
---
I‚Äôve worked a lot of IT over the years, and I can‚Äôt tell you how many people I have witnessed get  mad at their internet service provider for only getting a tenth of the speeds they were paying for. 
---
Bethesda and dupers might not be robbing you every time - the culprit might be your provider. 
---
P.S. - if you dupe, you‚Äôre still an asshole. 
---
Wooosh
---
Oh, can't see other players on map when wanted? thats good to know, I always sneak to get to them lol
---
Hey I've updated the map, theres a search functionality too. 
---
https://imgur.com/a/qJtG3Ho I do want to maybe change the labels, they're a bit much right now, but it looks ok while keep performance decent.
---
You can find the work benches under the FURN section, theyre called:
---
* Armor Workbench
---
* Tinker's Workbench
---
* Weapons Workbench
---
* Chemistry Station
---
* Power Armor Station
---
Don't worry, they'll release another 3 sentence "Inside the Vault" any day now.
---
Edit: My bad it was 4 sentences.
---
Sprouts are actually okay, so long as you don't eat a ton of them, the big thing to be careful of with taters is the fruit the plant actually produces as it's highly poisonus as it's a cousin of nightshade (and tomatos)
---
I'm new on reddit i don't know what tht means lol
---
Thats a sweet base. I Approved!
---
I‚Äôm on ps4 where this is happening
---
We don‚Äôt worry about that anymore. We only praise the Mothman now. 
---
Press F to pay respects
---
25 bucks got the game Atlas. Despite negative reviews on steam (been out two weeks) due to a terrible first day showing, the game has been patched about 30 times straight through the holidays sometimes getting patched multiple times in one day. And it's so much better now for it. Bethesda's slow in comparison and their game jas less than half the content of Atlas.... so yeah, there are cheaper games out there with more to do, even among new releases.
---
Right, like is this Todd Howard's second account?
---
"I know this major game from a major company fucked up so hard, then fucked up harder and harder and harder again, but like, just stop complaining about it"
---
This whole post is a joke. It's a novel that achieves nothing but complaining about us complaining about a massive piece of shit.
---
I'm honestly surprised how stable the servers are. Games like Ark and PUBG were built on the Unreal Engine, which is very up to date, but honestly those games had way more severe server and sync issues (still do sometimes). 
---
Honestly, I think most crashes are caused by dupers actually. I can definitely see this game being very very good in the next 6 months. Bethesda isn't some random start up studio. They are serious and I'm willing to give them a chance to really nail this down.
---
If nothing significant changes in the next 6 months. I think this game is at good as abandoned. But we will see.
---
I normally keep 2 ranks of Sturdy Frame (cuts a huge amount of weight on my non-power armor build) and 3 ranks of Traveling Pharmacy (because drugs are valuable for vendoring, and bringing chems down to 0.1 or less weight is very nice) for standard exploring.  I switch to 3 rank Blocker at nuke sites and when I see deathclaws, scorchbeasts, radscorpions, crickets or wendigo (wendigoes?)  Swapping in thru hiker is also useful for fast traveling back to camp after foraging flux.
---
Aside from traveling pharmacy, I don't normally walk around with other weight reducing perks.  Damage boosting perks and weapon/armor durability (I run around with rank 3 gunsmith and rank 2 white knight as a sniper/creeper build) are too valuable for my character.  I typically swap them in when I want to fast travel somewhere with a lot of valuable junk, namely fast traveling out of nuke sites when I'm just wearing a hazmat suit.
---
Can confirm.  my 20th or so technical data spawned T-60 Brotherhood Initiate paint plans.
---
I mean, Red Dead Redemption was never meant to be a roleplaying Game. Even so, they managed to make RDR2 more **reactive** than any Bethesda Fallout. The dialogue options are rudimentary and limited still, but Rockstar is showing a solid (yet slow) learning curve in their games.
---
Between RDR1 and 2 there's a clear improvement in depth. Bethesda problem is they'e actually devolving each game - F3&gt;F4&gt;F76.
---
I think you're wrong about the other games, Skyrim and Oblivion are essentially linear. Even simple dialogue options to back our role-playing are missing... and that's OK I guess, Elder Scrolls isn't as much story-heavy and reliant on choices than Fallout. 
---
Could be like the Alien Blaster and the like, I've never seen one from any enemies.
---
i mean fallout 76 is bad that but not *that* bad
---
What‚Äôs the legendary effect for the spatula. Fucking forceful flipping???
---
I guess that could be.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve been wanting to dive into that. I also got a Grognak game.
---
I wore Raider underarmor from pretty much day 1. From Road Leathers to Harness I wore them all. I like the Harness best. Then I started learning about the stats and now I wear the Enclave that gives +2 strength and if I upgrade it some more +3. But so far without using any flux I got it to +2.
---
Yep which makes sense so that you can't just go player hunting
---
Just face it man - sunken cost fallacy - you're attached because you spent 60 bucks (like most of us) on a shitty game. The faster you realize it's a shitty game, the happier you'll be. 
---
Hint: IT'S A SHITTY GAME
---
The most common misconception had it being used as a synonym for "rude" or "disrespectful" for like a decade. It's corrupted further over time to be used in place of "stupid," or "lame," or "no precise definition except to apply to things I don't like."
---
I had Converted munitions factory, grafton steel, and gorge workshop all claimed once when I got a server disconnect :/
---
Sadly so. I'm not that into Power Armor.
---
Fuck SBQ's without radaway
---

---
Dropped some useless legendary weapons that weighed too much
---
Ok, thanks.  (Still want to find a way to get (back) my Military ID)
---
Yes but be careful because they might have a friend scouting the map for them telling if other players are approaching
---
The respawn thing may be fixed, it was a bug due to being over encumbered when you died and I've not noticed it at all since the last patch, just wish it didn't charge caps to respawn at location closest to your death
---
its the same as everything else, the most vocal people are usually the minority. im still having fun playing with friends and every server seems well populated...
---
"Hi, Bethesda here, we heard you are experiencing an issue, we might fix it in a couple months, here take an atom, bye see you in a few months!"
---
All of the time this last week. The worst was when I saw that Patrol Duty was active so I spent like 40 caps ft there and it froze on the loading screen. I had to force quit and then when I logged back on it put me at the penitentiary and stole my 40 caps even though Patrol Duty wasn't active on that server and wouldn't trigger, so then I had to pay more caps to get back to where I was before.
---
I'm not a big fan of bushiness. But to each their own.
---
I‚Äôm not even close (I think) to doing the nuke codes. I thank you for this but of info. I almost always fuck up entering codes in games
---
Yeah it sucks and it seems they went out of there way to put secret resists as well in the PA to make it much better than NA was in FO4. Take far less dr/er/rr even when my NA has more of each.
---
Try looking in the lucky hole mine, it kept me up at night 
---
The real sadists hide sirens.
---
That video is hilarious. If it pisses you off you‚Äôre probably a rabid fanboy.

There's a map floating around somewhere, not sure where, but was posted on reddit a while back.  There are lead nodes all over the map that you can build your camp on/near.  It opens up a Lead Extractor you can craft.  I pull about 30 lead a day out of that alone.  Steer clear of any near a fissure site though, unless you love fighting scorchbeasts everytime you log in/travel home.
---
Other than that, disarm can traps.  The ones that make noise when you go home.  They have like 5+ cans which breakdown into lead and steel.  Also, rat poison breaks down into 5 lead.
---
This is perfect videogames teaching kinds that drugs are actually bad and "lower your intelligence" that's too wholesome
---
That seems obvious. A larger company would get a larger uproar. 
---
My favorite part is the times my wife DOES watch me play is always when I'm messing around in my CAMP so I get "Wow, it was fun watching you place a chair in a room for 30 minutes" and now its called "Your dollhouse game"
---
Merv, I'll take "[What is a Paragraph?](https://writingexplained.org/grammar-dictionary/paragraph)" for 100.
---
Its not about that it exist but what devs are doing about it, and how they get this items:  glitches, duping, cheat engine etc.  Yout think its ok to pvp that has hes gear through some kindof stiuped glitch ?
---
Yes, I can't launch any Nuke from Site Charlies, it 100% of the times the game crashes at some point and also on the whitespring, PS4.
---
I think it's justified, personally. They spent months hyping up a game. A game that failed to deliver in almost every possible aspect. Although, I am a bit biased here. I find it quite funny to see all of this unfold due to the fact that I was surrounded by a group of insufferable Beth fanboys before the shit hit the fan with 76. I can only imagine how upset they must get when they hear all of this.
---
haha you said lucky hole 
---
I read a post that claimed the color of the wire you have to cut is based on the color of the stripe on the bomb. No idea if this is true though. Also I'm not sure if they were talking about the top stripe or middle one.

Doing the event "Distant Thunder" gives me the same plan as a reward each time. I have now acquired 20+ plans for the t60 motion assist-servos. This cannot be intended, which is why I'm reporting it here.
---
T60 motion assist servos plans are way too high up in the loot table, and is also the ONLY plan ever available for me to purchase from the BoS vendor in Watoga as well. 
---
I tried reporting the same issue (same reward given time and time again for defeating scorchbeast queen) earlier to /u/LoneVaultWanderer but have not heard anything back yet. Once again, I would like to ask if this is intended? 
---
Nope. They released a game that was unfinished, old tech, glitchy, and lacking content. They charged their loyal fans $80 for this experience.
---
Its not a ‚Äúhate train‚Äù, its reality 
---
Hah, I've gotten plenty and seen those in the challenge list, but never put it together that's what they were.
---
It's a location in fallout lol? 
---
&gt; Fucking. Shut. Up.

#NO
---
That was unexpected. Have your upvote.
---
I actually think that the continued backlash is good, we don‚Äôt want Bethesda or any other game company to get the impression that we just let things blow over after a while. This sort of continued response is healthy for the industry. 
---
I'm pretty sure is the cause of Duppers making the game super unstable.
---
Boo OP, boo FO76, BOO Bethesda.
---
Those minigames are surpsisingly very fun.
---
I know, man. I was being juvenile. 
---
post GT i will join in the fun  
---
we can hold him one after another and rejoin server, too
---
Oh I definitely agree with you, was just trying to explain the perspective of why some people may feel "exhausted" reading about this game being shit.
---
Why should we let this down, it's time we set a precedent that this is not an acceptable way to present games and take advantage of hype trains.
---
I'm sure there are safe spaces you can go where you can get coddled and told that it's going to be okay.
---
The developer's will get praise when and where it is due.
---
I personally found Boogie's reviews of Fallout 76 to be the best. He acknowledges the hate, but also states that it's not that bad, and no one should get hate for liking it or wanting to let is succeed.  
---
Unfortunately the mob mentality of the internet likes to beat dead horses, so discussions like that will not get views, but a meme on how much something sucks, without offering any counterpoint or pointing out any positives in it will get you that mad karma and youtube monies.
---
you're breaking the first and second rules of bone club
---
Let's follow that line of logic. If don't have to worry where my next meal is coming from; there is no way other people could be starving.
---
The way Bethesda communicates with the playerbase is laughable in general, not even EA, or rather their PR department, are/is that ignorant and that's saying something.
---
When was the last patch where they actually fixed/added anything lol? I guess you can give them points for trying on December 19th but none of the fixes actually worked.
---
I mean I haven‚Äôt played rdr2 and I have seen the video and I know what you mean but honestly I disagree that rockstar marketed their game any different than it turned out to be.
---
Also you are literally on the sub that at this point has defended fallout76 to the point of throwing random fingers at anybody. Eg the god damn thread we are commenting in...
---
Oh I wish that would happen, would be more fun. 
---
You find it funny, I find it bad game design.
---
I‚Äôll be on for now, just keep me updated 
---
You're awesome 
---
I'm aware I write run ons but thanks. This was a semi rant more than anything, written and posted for myself to blow off a little bit of steam so I was less worried about it on this one.
---
Much appreciated friend! Sadly he didnt have the hunters coat lol
---
One thing I found out is pacifist mode don't mean you never do damage to other players like I thought. I was In a group of 3. We were farming whitesprings. Another group of 2 came and joined us. One was lever 11 the other was 82. I assume the 82 was helping level up his level 11 buddy. The level 11 kept hitting members on my team (on accident I think). Now he would take damage from me even though I am always in pacifist mode. Of course he died repeatedly from the aoe effect from my gun (not on purpose). His level 82 friend got mad and attacked me. I was able to do full damage to him as well. I killed him he came back and attacked me again. I was able to kill him again. This repeated a few time until he realized he was likely not gonna kill me. Before all of this I had assumed that there was no conditions in which someone in pacifist mode could do damage to another player. I don't mind being able to retaliate, I just was confused why I was able to do damage to them.
---
What a fucking cryhard. Sure just make a whiney post on the internet to try to make people stop shitting on a bad game, sounds like a good idea. Find some forums where people that like the game are or get off the internet.
---
Yeah probably not lol only have $1500 caps I‚Äôm poor haha
---
&gt;Some of them are just weird, like how my character is a disembodied head and hands with an invisible torso for 30 seconds every time I log in. Then there's this grinding sounding noise and she actually grunts loudly like all her gear is landing on her when it loads.
---
Your head and hands appear because it's loading your inventory and applying the stat changes upon login. The grunt noise is also connected to that process. This is what they did to combat some of the exploits with equipping +weight carry armor pieces multiple times. The grunt is the sound when you pick up a large amount of items that usually make you overweight. It's just them loading your character and inventory/equipped items.
---
Could you send me an invite? Statesidellama
---
one of the best Vault Suit ones grants +5 total over....4 specials iirc, and 5 or 6 resistance to all forms of 'damage' (norm/energy/rad)
---
is it for the right armor

It's exhausting to encounter the same bugs weeks and months on end, with not a word from bethesda about them. It's also fucking aggravating encountering game breaking bugs that Bethesda claimed to have fixed already. If we shut up, how in the flying fuck is Bethesda ever going to get the hint that their game is a buggy mess and needs fixing? Seriously. I'm sick and tired of fighting bugs that have been in the game since the fucking Stress Test. It's bullshit. You talked about progress, I'm not seeing it. Until I can make a trade without "Trade failed on server" or "Requested Item has changed" or whatever the errors say, I won't believe they are making progress. Also the fucking stuck in power armor bug. Twice in the last month I've been stuck FFS, both times AFTER the December 4th patch "fixed" it. Fix your shit Bethesda, and stop lying about it. It's literally impossible to complete at least two quests in power armor from my recollection. There may be more. And one is just because there is a fucking chair in front of a terminal. FFS Bethesda, what dumb fuck ever thought it was a good idea to put a chair in front of a terminal in 76 or 4? And no, having someone else use it first doesn't allow you to use the PA interface to use the terminal like most other terminals either. GENIUS.

Obviously I'm not happy with my purchase. But I couldn't be refunded, so I damn well will complain about the game. And will continue to do so, until the game isn't a buggy piece of shit. Give me one session without a disconnect or a crash FFS. No joke, I could add up all the crashes between Fallout 3, NV, and 4, and they wouldn't be as many as I've seen in 76 already. And I've spent thousands and thousands of hours playing those games, with hundreds of buggy incompatible mods with dirty edits installed.
---
But hey, if you want me to shut up, give me the $260 I paid for it. Or get Bethesda to. I'd gladly walk out of this sub and never post again until the game is stable and (relatively) bug free. But the "progress" Bethesda has made has been laughably small, and considering they've added new bugs with almost (every?) update, I'm not holding my breath it will happen within the next year, even two.
---
P.S. I Love all the Atom Shop Content I can't buy because of the large number of atoms I'm missing because Bethesda can't program a proper tracker for Challenges! Also that some of it is content that was ported straight from 4 (like half the game) but costs extra money! Love it!

Can't get on for about two hours but if you'll hold them I'd like your: (all)

---
Like, they know stimpacks and disease cure are good drugs, right?  Or are they just hardcore?  Get it straight-edge kids!
---
I can't speak for other Bethesda games, as Fallout is the only franchise from them that truly holds my love, but it's so demoralizing when it seems like they don't even care about the state of their game
---
Hardy har har! 76 game *bad!* 
---
workshops kind of are arenas as it is. it's just not "official", ie: you can use them to gather resources and plans. but those feel secondary as you can gather resources much more efficiently, really.
---
making workshops containment areas for pvp and disabling legendaries inside of them is bound to make most people happy.
---
Cripple their limbs. 
---
you wanna see bad communication? r/fortnite (coop mode sub) or anything fortnite STW related.  fucking ghost town for any dev communication outside "lul here patchnotes" unless something turns into a HUGE (10k+upvote) problem
---
Hell your acid and Ultracite as well
---
Upvote because...Fuck Trump...
---
I think the game mainly gets so much hate because Bethesda is notorious for being, for the most part, a subpar game development company that consistently releases games that are unfinished or not particularly enjoyable to most of the fanbase that they have gathered over the years. It seems (to me at least) that they are just riding off of the immense success and fame they got from Oblivion, Skyrim, and Fallout: New Vegas, and I believe this is backed up by the fact that their software hasn't gone through many changes since. I was told by a friend who has been a devoted follower of Bethesda ever since Morrowind that TES 6 will use a very similar engine to that of Skyrim, with graphics and framerate included in that comparison as well. If Bethesda made an active effort to go above this plateau they've been riding on, they'd likely receive far less hate than they do.
---
I was wanted for a reason
---
That's about it 
---
good luck! I would recommend running 1 endurance with only radicool, a mistake I made and had to grind to swap points out. all the other perks don't work the way you would think so 1 is the way to go in my opinion
---
I can do that √∫w√π let me know when ur on and i gotcha 
---
Working now. Looking good.  üëç
---
Sounds good, IGN Thirdstorm
---
Lol I haven't played the game in weeks because of what it is, I come over to fo76 and the first post I see is someone bitching about the hate train. I assume that means nothing has changed and the game is still trash. Thanks for saving me some time.
---
that's what I meant, but I think it should be exclusive to pvp-specific areas only. some people like to pvp with legendary effects.
---
When people point out the game's flaws, that's a good thing.  When people make stuff up on the fly, that's when you know they only hate it because it's cool to.
---
Are you saying we should just bend over and let them fuck us in the ass. $90(CAD) for a game that plays like a F2P is unacceptable. We need to let them know that they cannot do this again.  
---
Yes it did. Im sure he has rebuilt it.
---
That doesn‚Äôt seem right and I haven‚Äôt experienced that on Xbox platform. I use a Tesla in farming situations and it tags everyone and pops up a ‚Äúyou‚Äôre in pacifist and not causing damage to others‚Äù mode. I use it to quickly tag enemies and not kill them so others can get hits too while farming. 
---
Was that player perhaps wanted?  We run sometimes 2 full teams of players.  I‚Äôve never harmed a player on my team or not in my team while in pacifist EXCEPT with explosives. Blowing up a car and one of them running by or accidental stray grenade will kill even in pacifist. Strange. 
---
One of my friends main goals in game is to attack us while we‚Äôre on our workbenches. We‚Äôve never tAken damage from it. 
---
Curious, US or EU servers? Might be the difference
---
I can‚Äôt be sure that someone won‚Äôt be using a duped TSE weapon so no I won‚Äôt play PVP. 
---
Eh, EA told people *not* to buy BFV. 
---
Just gonna give my two cents:
---
I agree with you.
---
I enjoy the game. I love it. I have spent well over a hundred hours and I‚Äôve yet to get bored BUT I can‚Äôt be deluded enough to say the game is a finished product.
---
Sadly, it is as it is, on the reviews topic. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm exaggerating when I‚Äôm saying probably 10% of the reviews are from people who actually played the game while the remaining are people who just crap on the game because it‚Äôs a popular thing to do and because they‚Äôll get support (because it‚Äôs ‚Äúmemey‚Äù to hate on the game).
---
Is the game finished? Not at all, it has a long way to go yet. Is it unplayable? Miles away from being that; it may be an isolated case, but me and my playgroup have yet to suffer from something that makes the game a pain in the ass to play.
---
In any case, what I can give Bethesda, is that they are still working on fixing the game. I mean, yeah, it‚Äôs their responsibility too, but, as NMS was mentioned, I pre-ordered it and that was an actually crappy product.
---
To make matters worse, Hello Games ghosted everyone for a long time before actually updating the game.
---
All in all, and I apologize for the long read: Bethesda (and FO76) doesn‚Äôt the deserve all the flak they are getting. I‚Äôm fully aware of them being aware that their product is flawed and/or incomplete, but, they can‚Äôt say that in public, as that would be piss poor marketing (because nothing works better than saying ‚Äúmy product sucks, buy it‚Äù). 
---
Give BGS some time and ignore the haters, most of them just do it for the sake of being cool and popular; only a fraction of them have tried the game enough to have a well put review.
---
Oh that's pretty sweet! The carry weight bonus is the only reason I've stayed in the excavator armour. Thanks!
---
Yeah according to that post this is what it gives fully upgraded.
---
 VaultSuit shielded: 5/5/5 1S 2E 2I 2L 
---
Only 1 strength apparently. But 7 points in total. I want the max strength so I think Enclave is the one for me.
---
Another fake post
---
Oh how I wish we could place things that stick around after we leave.  This game could get all kindsa creepshow.  Imagine coming back to your camp to find a disturbing teddy bear tableau waiting on your bed.  Or "we are watching" spelled out in wooden blocks.  Or just a nice big pile of skulls.
---
I never said rockstar even marketed the game like that. I said they released a shit game with shit game design that is inconsistent with past rockstar titles. I'm pointing fingers at people who shit talk one game and blindly defend a $60 movie.
---
Yeah, but they should have given me a mouth, arms, or at least a spoon. All I've got is a bowl of lukewarm roleplaying elements and a headless neck.
---
I don't own nor have ever played RDR2. Damn console exclusives ):
---
But whatever you say.
---
You can get shocks for the excavator and have an EXTRA +100 for it as well. I'm almost always in it because of that... lol
---
Take workshop(guaranteed camp plan) &gt; do the defend workshop event(another guaranteed camp plan) &gt; server hop and repeat. 
---
You will be drowning in camp plans and stim packs... Never skip scorchbeast defenses either because they give 3 plans instead of one. 
---
It's it easy to place? I thought it would be tricky. Also, doing the powering up posiodon quest 4 times gives you the fusion generator
---
But they didn't make New Vegas?
---
Not in game. 
---
Very Hazardous ... 
---
I'm in the same boat as you. I was subscribed to him for a while but he definitely lost my interest. He does nothing that other better youtubers aren't already doing minus the psychology facts I don't give an ass about
---
I got mine from defending one of my workshops
---
Correct, if you drop it on the ground you‚Äôre fine 
---
I don't think that's the case. I only have 4 charisma and have shared 3 levels of adrenaline with it.
---
That's incorrect. Marine Shielded is 9/9/9 2 STR 1 PER 2 END
---
The candy crush crowd lol
---
Endurance has perk cards for healing n rad removal ‚Äúphotosynthetic‚Äù &amp; ‚Äúsun kissed‚Äù both worth it for the recovering addicts 
---
I invited some lower levels to my base the other night and dropped them a few guns and ammo told them to take one bag each.
---
I got oneshot for the first time yesterday as I was wanted from shooting a workshop while helping defend. Went through an entire nuke zone while wanted last night and then I log in today and get 1 shot by some 15 year old going buck wild inside whitesprings hotel.
---
Honestly, when I read that *each* shotgun pellet creates an explosion I kind of just sat there in disbelief. If you don't use that you are basically doing 1/20th the damage, if not less. No game online game should have a god mode build. Ever. 
---
Don‚Äôt even bother. It is probably just spoiled meat.
---
Not speaking to an end all be all case, but most of the people that won't let go of the hate or keep memeing it, usually aren't even playing it anymore... or haven't played it at all. After going through the Destiny 2 cycle, The Division, No Man Sky, Diablo 3 (and ongoing diablo immortal), there are just a lot of folks who love to hate, and create an even larger echo chamber because its easy to hate something.   
---
I wish it would stop. That energy could be so much better spent on other things.  Yes, those games/companies stumbled and had their faults. Knowing a few dev friends, trust me when I say, they definitely know, and you can bet the people that pay them know too, especially if it hits the bottom line.   
---
To be clear. Not defending the companies. I'm saying, people really should find better things to do than actively hate on something.  Life is less stressful.
---
great!
---
I don't play either but I've heard people say good things about the BR communication but I honestly forgot there was a coop mode
---
HAHHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA Waaaaaaah people don't like shitty games
---
Anyone can use anything in your camp without getting a bounty, even taken your waters. They only way they get a bounty is if they try to pick a lock on a door or if your purifier is locked. 
---
Wow I wish that would happen to me, that‚Äôs amazingly scary
---
Yeah I found this so annoying, everyone is like "why fallout76 is a bad game" 
---
And I get it I watched the videos kind a free, tbh I wasnt really i tested in the first place
---
But I'm kind sick of the circlejerk, and I mean this is nothing new, it used to be no man's sky, and CD project red
---
But tbh gaming on the internet feels more and more like 
---
R /gaming circlejerk than anything
---
I started reading Steven King novels around 11.  If you can handle that you can handle anything!
---
Tesla Coils is fantastic if your a melee build, however if your not..
---
Why do you feel the need for other ppl approval/validation  of the game to be the same as yours. If you like a game play it. At this point, posts like this are just as common as the ones that hate in the game. I say you either cry about not liking the game, cry about liking the game, cry about ppl not liking the game or you can nutt the fuck up and get over it already, stop complaining about other ppl complaining and just play the damn thing. 
---
They aren't random assumptions, they are lore. Vault 76 was full of scientists and senior military, people with the knowledge and skills to rebuild the world. You don't get to that point by your teens. It's a realistic and logical assumption that the residents were at best in their late 20s to early 30s. Add 25 years to that and best case scenario your looking at 50 years old. The lore you find in the vaults tells you they never gave the residents weapons, so unless you're a senior citizen you gave never held a gun or seen power armor, which we know from game lore requires training to use. The actual odd of you surviving a week out of the vault, on your own, with no training or knowledge of what to expect (you as a player know, your character has never seen or heard of ghouls or super mutants before.) are extremely low. You would be dead a hundred times over before you even met rose and she could kill you without even trying. Sry you're not as cool as you thought you were. 
---
Nice try, bethesda employee.
---
Dont recall the exact level but it should be 30. 
---
I got the hat from a container in VTU on a lvl 10. It looks like the atom store hats so I assume it‚Äôs crazy-rare like the long coat. 
---
Right perks? 
---
If you have a bounty anyone will deal full damage on the first shot. Pacifist mode will not prevent it
---
Thanks so much!
---
Oh, have you tried ditching every single note and holo you can. It seems certain ones are glitchy but it has not been narrowed down. 
---
Pretty sure this is tied to a daily quest with a stranded robot near some hotels, the names escape me.
---
It'll never match the passive rad resist that power armor gives you, just so you know! Even with rad shield and the like. 
---
Btw I'm not just talking numbers, power armor has an invisible stat that severely limits rad exposure.
---
'That all you got, robot?"
---
Over the past months what started as a concern for Bethesda and passion for them to change devolved onto an uncontrollable hatred. If you really look into it though, this hatred is well deserved but people clump their hate for Bethesda into 76 because 76 was the straw that broke the camel's back.
---
I saw someones named '*?*arbzTV' and '*?*arbzMule' on the map right after serious 'Server not responding' popups. I googled his name(cause his name ends with 'TV'). He has a twitch channel. Yes. He's a duper.
---
&gt; Having to switch around cards constantly to lock-pick or to hack consoles is also bad game design in my opinion, same for crafting different armours and weapons along with needing to use two 5-point cards to slow durability loss on guns and melee weapons.
---
I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd go so far as to call this ‚Äúbad‚Äù game design, *per se*. It‚Äôs pretty obvious that the intent was that they didn‚Äôt want every player to be a master of all trades, to encourage people to play together. Like, you pick the locks and your buddy hacks the terminals.  I‚Äôd call it *naive* game design. Despite popular belief, I don‚Äôt think Bethesda wanted players to have a bad time. 
---
You see a bit of that in the base building aspect, too. The stash sizes aren‚Äôt quite as annoying when you have a buddy to share with. 
---
As for the durability bit, I haven‚Äôt really run into a lot of reasons to go out of my way to raise durability. I‚Äôve had a couple of shotguns break on me, specifically, but I can‚Äôt think of any other examples.
---
I think I must be in the minority in that I rarely enjoy NPC interactions in *any* Bethesda games. I kind of enjoy the strange loneliness that this approach imparts. It‚Äôs wonky in its implication sometimes (seriously? Everybody just left the vault without me? EVERYONE? Was I a huge asshole??) and it‚Äôs difficult to buy the whole ‚Äúliterally every living human in the region died *right* before you arrived concept, but if you take a step *in*, it becomes really sad and lonely in a way I actually appreciated.
---
I‚Äôve said this in other discussions, but yeah, 76 is a deeply flawed, disappointing game. But I‚Äôve enjoyed it. I play it more than Red Dead Redemption 2 and Spider-Man. It‚Äôs hard to say what keeps pulling me back. By playtime is littered with annoyances (like my inventory being 90% full from my guns and gear) but I also recognize that maybe my insistence on carrying 35 stimpacks, 40 bottles of water, and 8 guns is the problem. It annoys me. It makes me sad in good ways *and* bad.
---
But I‚Äôm enjoying it. I appreciate it for what it is. I‚Äôm excited for games like Outer Worlds, but I‚Äôm not expecting it to fill the Fallout 76 niche.
---
Where is it
---
I want to glitch in there! 
---
How do you find them?
---
It's a 37 minute video. I doubt you watched it either, seeing as you replied less than 37 minutes later. Regardless, I've never even played RDR2, since it's a console exclusive.
---
I'm still waiting for a valid explanation as to how linear mission design means you can't complain about Bethesda games.
---
One thing to consider, unstable isotope can and does set off cars.. It usually is a minor thing, but there are a few places with enough cars to kill even a high level player if wounded
---
people can initiate pvp with you while you‚Äôre wanted. you take full damage i think. when ur pacifist u can‚Äôt fight back. and it doesn‚Äôt affect the amount of damage you take. you take full damage when ur wanted. it‚Äôll give you the under attack notification though at the bottom. 
---
Fart emote!!! Yes!!!
---
You know there's a line for that bathroom, right? We thought you died in there!
---
I can‚Äôt open either dome even with the keys
---
I live a blessed existence free of YouTubers and gaming "news" sites, especially since 99% of them have always been garbage and always will be. Actually presenting information is not what they're for.
---
Forget them. Walk away. Your life will lose nothing, I assure you. Find one or two individuals or sources that seem interesting, look at their history as a whole, keep tabs on the ones that seem trustworthy or at least moderately sane; and forget the existence of all the other dingbats.
---
Look, I'm gonna be real with you. I only play this game when my friends are on. Because playing solo? Is probably the most un-fun thing for me right now. I'm not up to date on all the bethesda responses and whatnot but I bought this game expecting to be able to play it for more than an hour a session. Between the crashes and the agonizing, repeating fetch quests they call a story, it's a no from me until I get my squad together
---
Here's the resource map:  https://i.imgur.com/9Rccgzd.png
---
I get all my 308 and shotgun ammo at .Morgantown Airport
---
It isnt running a single item multiplied by 1000. It is running 1000 items. It has been an issue with the engine for decades. FO4 crashed if you stuffed over 65k into a box ... in any shape or fashion. 
---
That person is using more server side resources to just be on the server than all 23 other people.
---
Now he and a buddy drop it and work the dupe and crash the server.
---
Nicely done 
---
18+ game guys.
---
Don't worry tho Bethesda gonna cater to the family friendly audience in an 18+ game anyway.
---
Yep, around level 20, when I finally got a scope and suppressor for Ol' Painless, I plopped my camp just south of New Gad and after five runs or so, I was stocked up on .308 and had a nice cache of frag grenades too.
---
Awesome. Im glad people are helping out other players. 
---
I've helped a few people transfer their stuff on Xbox so would be happy to help you too. No charge lol.
---
IGN: RebelsAdvocate if you want to take me up on the offer
---
Well shit...that is what i was hoping to do. Fill the gap with rad shield and rad X. 
---
This game, yes at this fucking point, is STILL FUCKED and BETHESDA STILL DOESN'T GIVE A SHIT... 
---
I Am sorry. I know this is your rant but seriously.. Do you think they have fixed it? Do you think they deserve to be let off the hook for the shit they are pulling? 
---
I have played since BETA basically every day this game.. TO THIS DAY (About an hour or two ago) I STILL get random blue screen errors that crash me out of the game.
---
Last night I struggled through a mine for about 45 minutes but made my way to the boss.  Take my first fucking swing at the boss and the game blue screens out.  BAM I'm back fucking outside the god damn cave and all monsters are reset.  I quit fucking playing for the night.
---
E-V-E-R-Y-D-A-Y. MULTIPLE TIMES a day... This game cannot even let me play..  I still have items duplicate in my storage/build.  I ended up with 24 power cores because it kept duplicating them every time I got into power armor the other day. I just started dropping them I had so many.
---
They give you SHIT carry capacity and refuse to acknowledge it.  EVEN WITH the Excavator armor and extra carry capacity. 
---
THERE IS STILL SO MUCH WRONG WITH THIS GAME.  They really haven't "fixed" that much and they have acknowledged/addressed EVEN LESS. 
---
I am sorry. THEY DESERVE to be ridiculed at every single turn.. and then some. the internet, the players, the users, their customers should in no way "Let up" or "Give in" they deserve to enjoy 0 moments of their time from here out given the state of this game.
---
IT IS NOT GOOD
---
Yeah, and then motion assist servos for another 10 carry weight (it's not much, but it's something).
---
Farming events, and legendary enemies is fun to me. Made a lots of caps doing so.
---
It is probably because of all the duping. Basically everyone knows how to do it now and they are even making good money of it. The state of the game is just sad. It could‚Äôve been a great game but Bethesda rushed it. 
---
It's even funnier when you see the sales numbers. Not doing so hot. 
---
You are correct ... but in the ‚ÄòI need the best now‚Äô club it doesnt matter how they it ... only that they get it ... NOW!
---
There have not been any changes post launch that fix any of the core problems the game had on launch. I do not see how you want Bethesda acknowledged for making changes when there haven't been any real changes.
---
Was the release a disaster? Yes. Was the bad press warranted? Yes. Was it obnoxious? Yes. 
---
Sadly this is how the world works today, if there isn't a big enough stink to impact the $$ stream there will not be any changes.
---
Am I bored of all the crap people are saying about the game? Hell yes. Most of the ranting isn't even on point or are minor issues at best. Which is easily fixed as well. Don't watch said youtube vids and don't read the articles. No hits and it will die out.
---
I hate FO76 and I‚Äôve never even played it. 
---
If I find something for a reasonable price on ebay, it is more worth it for me to spend 5 dollars than have to constantly vendor and server hop. I don't give a shit a out duping. I never buy anything from other players. The trading system is so fucked up that it isn't worth trying. Just have fucking fun. 
---
If it is just grayed out, try clicking anyway
---
Can agree with you  but Bethesda fucked this game so hard. People have wanted a MP fallout for years and this trash is what thay deliver? But yeah the Internet is a strange place it seems once something is "cool" to hate on everyone just let's rip to try and fit in lol 
---
the br communication is fantastic. br problems get hotfixes within hours
---
coop on the other hand is polar opposite.   coop has bugs that have been in there since launch over a year ago, some people cant progress the story because of broken quests.  but management told the PR team, to tell coop players, that there's no communication because reporting bugs is "to much bitching about bugs and other issues." this is after the sub begged for 6 months after BR launch to get any sort of communication.
---
u/BusyBurnin may of had a base destroyed, but he made off with close to 2000 caps from our encounter. I'd still say he won in the end
---
I need this perk. 
---
It won‚Äôt allow me to install it I have tried for 10mins
---
There is a mannequin random encounter, but I think they are static.. 
---
Question... 
---
Did this happen today or yesterday, only ask because I think I had the attention of "someone" yesterday as I had a couple weird encounters in a row (multiple waves of hostile a attack a base I've had for 6 weeks, with nary an attack in that time)
---
Yeah, that's really frustrating. Even if you're not the recipient of 1-shots, it's still hard when you're trying to just...play the game and you can barely get a shot in on a single mob.
---
Also, I know it's too late to help you yesterday, but if you turn on Pacifist mode you won't be able to accidentally put yourself in wanted mode like that. Well, I mean you still can if you happen to pick some random locked chest in someone else's workshop area because holy fork apparently that makes you some kind of incredibly wanted criminal even if you didn't actually TAKE anything. Ugh, don't even get me started...
---
agreed. i put my camp near top of the world to cut the map in half. I've never pad more than 25ish caps to move. 
---
Bethesda already knows it releases buggy games.
---
It's hard not to with open world games. So many locations , so many bug possibilities. 
---
Every one of their FO/ES games has been littered with bugs. 
---
Before anyone says how unacceptable this is, don't forget the internet and this community gives their darling Obsidian an free pass on New Vegas which was no less buggy....
---
And had that wonderful bug that made all your followers disappeared forever if you sent them to the casino. Which they fixed but couldn't go back to retroactively fix on saves that had dozens of hours on em.
---
Most other games don't have hundreds of thousands of "loose" objects sitting on every bench and table in the world. The game ahs to keep track of every single one of them, how picked it up, how long it's been since that world object respawned, etc.
---
In the hundreds I've search I have only ever received 1 cap.
---
Looks like you scrapped a lot of letters from words in this post, my dude.
---
Literally the guy version of "How To Stay Calm When Your Partner Doesn't Propose This Holiday"
---
"Don't buy it"   
---
"Hmm that's strange they seem to not be buying the game"
---
Post this in a the fallout sub and see their reaction, you guys made a safe place where you and like minded people get together and all look over all its flaws, when the game relised it was a big pile of shit so people who relised that this was in fact a E.A release for the price tag of $60 that had no active story, no cool new weapons, a lot and a mean a lot of bugs, ways for people to cheat and get to level 100 in like 2 hours, duppers who Bethesda themselves said they wouldn't ban or take any action against. Old bugs from fallout 4 that had been fixed but they decided o well that would take time and effort to fix, shit from fallout 4 that's now micro transactions like the tattoos, the atomic shop prices, the graphics in general. The amount of content that's even in the game what's to do besides kill the same old enemy's after you discovered everything in the small world of 76, it may be 4 times bigger than fallout 4 but has 6 times as more empty space. If you like the game enjoy it, however everyone that doesn't like it sees past the fallout brand name. If this game was made by EA Ubisoft Activision ect their would be no active player base. I had a lot of hope for 76 but it's just a 1000 times worse borderlands in my opinion, the hate train is justify because they spent no time developing this game, all the game  is is a open empty world with 23 other people, you would have to be crazy to think they got one game tester to even try it for an hour. As I said the hate train is justified because most of the community that plays Bethesda titles doesn't want this to be the standard of games they release not to mention that this enticeses other game companies to do the same when they see Bethesda getting away with putting very little effort into a game and pricing it at $60. 
---
Do you really want all games in the future to have graphics from 15 years ago bugs that make the game unplayable no content in the game besides follow a marker listen then follow another marker. As a said before if you like it enjoy it but I don't support Triple AAA compnays release hot garbage and expecting everyone to enjoy it along with their deceptive trade practices like the canvis bag and the bottle . Write a list of pros and cons what this game does and has done you find more cons than pros if you write it unbiasedly. 
---
Idk if this is actually a perk but the ability to craft advanced power armor mods? I‚Äôm not sure 
---
Direct your rant towards bethesda then since they caused this mess everyone else is just reacting to a poorly made game
---
What's your luck at? The higher your luck the better your chances for good drops.
---
The Scaling is why the higher level characters get frustrated when the entire server shows up to just watch, her DR can increase by a significant percentage 
---
Do you have any other mods equipped on your armor? Only one is allowed at any given time. Also try removing and re-adding the armor before modding. I've also had a mod not equip because of the durability of the armor at one point but I'm fairly sure that was a glitch. 
---
Yeah as a fresh noob from the vualt starting a melee focused playthrough i have now by level 13,  400 plus of most ammo and can comfortably shoot up enemies with leasure. 
---
Is it 50/50 because it either is or isn't happening?  
---
It's exhausting is it? You know what else is exhausting? Seeing another AAA developer sink down to a low level by releasing a buggy, broken product in an unfinished state. While some hate goes too far, all the rest is justified and every bit of pressure should remain on Bethesda until they get this product to an actual standard. If the game is already at a standard you deem acceptable, so be it, it's clear from this sub that many people somehow enjoy this game so far as putting 600 hours into it (12 hours a day since release). All the power to, I wish I could enjoy such a crappy, broken game. 
---
Also it's kinda laughable that you can't deal with hate in an online setting, you can't literally choose to not read/ watch it or even reply to it if you so deem. 
---
Op, the higher the expectations, the greater the disappointment.  Bethesda was one of the last few developers we had hoped to give us a positive game.... but this happened, not exactly fair as it's just them following the industry.... but its like we don't mind throwing money at Bethesda, but give us our money worth....
---
&gt;erums(10 or so wanted for my current/future characters) and Specifically the Instigating Super Sledge with 40% Swing speed and 90% reduced weight. HMU on discord for quicker replies, ill be on for about two more hours today and tomorrow morning for trade. If you have something cool to trade you can offer it up. :)

Thanks, I was after a Deep Pocket Plan for the Combat Armor Limbs.

Most of the top comments are why I think gamers deserve to be bullied.

Sick Tip!

Here's one that I found: if you take enough damage to reduce your health to zero, you die.
---
&gt;a bubble where this was a perfect release
---
You must be reading a different OP than I was. Maybe click back and refresh? Coz there's nothing in the post on this page that remotely resembles your hyperbole. In fact, you're a perfect example of the kind of hyperbole OP is talking about.
---
And if you wanna accuse me of making excuses for Bethesda, please check my post history while I laugh in your face.
---
Try Camden
---
Oof
---
I like Non-Automatic rifle, specifically lever action, + melee + hoarder lol
---
It's very balanced and efficient. Sneak and snipe from a far or mid-range, two-handed melee when close or in Power Armor and it's pretty tanky. Hoarder because I carry a ridiculous amount of stimpaks, chems, water and food, and rare junk. 
---
Nice try Bethesda 
---
My ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù whines are from the salty bois who built up all this headcanon and then threw a bitch fit when their stupid ideas didn‚Äôt magically show up in game. Fucking FudgeMuppet said they can‚Äôt make lore-friendly build videos because the perk system lets you change your perks and the appearance change options are ‚Äúlore breaking‚Äù. Fucking seriously?! 
---
I can‚Äôt wait for Outer Worlds to shit blood all over their hype. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the fallout sequel we deserve‚Äù except that it‚Äôs not open world and they won‚Äôt support modding. So maybe it is the sequel _they deserve_.
---
So, judging by your comments, we can sum this up pretty quickly.
---
**You** don't like the game as it is, **you** think that it should be single-player, **you** think that it shouldn't have a market, and so on.
---
Now, let's look at the facts: it *is* an online game, and it *does* have a market. I'm sorry that you don't like it, though. Maybe it's time to act like an adult and... you know, move on?
---
About the las part... you won't see me trying to prove to random Internet users how much I know or I don't know about gaming. So you can think whatever you want; I don't care.
---
You don't get your point across by trying to berate me. Grow up.

Try Neeb's Gaming.  They are literally the best gaming channel on YouTube.  They are basically an extremely high end cinematic "let's play" channel with a handful of guys who have decades of friendship and brotherly love to banter the crap out of each other into a comedic puddle.  Neeb's Gaming is completely unique and totally isolated from the outside gaming news.  You will never hear something bad about gaming news or other people.  Neeb's Gaming is my absolutely favorite form of entertainment amungst all forms of entertainment!

This sub is a glue factory
---
Free rads.
---
Did they actually say that and if so what made that come out?
---
Ya, I have 5 characters...88, 62, 54, 38, 20.  I have never seen one.  Ever.  They are so rare I cannot believe that seeing one in the wild is anything less than the product of a dupe.
---
I got one in the beta randomly (maybe a supply drop?) and accidentally scrapped it because I'm a complete idiot. I've never seen one again. I didn't even get to use it as it was a much higher level than I was. 
---
I will always remember you and what we could've had, bone club. üíî
---
Just a numerical change should do it.
---
Explosive does less damage per shot and energy weapons lose less condition per shot, that'd be it.
---
If you're thinking about dropping Action Boy/Girl because of diminishing returns with Lone Wanderer, think about running with a couple points in Gunsmith (think that's the right name) so your weapons break slower and stay at max damage longer.
---
I think it‚Äôs the same as any mission, if you do the perfect job (including all optional stuff) then you get a little more, but if you only do the essential (retake it) then you get a partial reward.0
---
Jesus Christ mate how much projection and assumption can you throw into a single comment. It's almost like you're fucking obnoxious.
---
30steel per 1cap? I would buy all your willing to sell
---
Does fix it good actually work properly now?
---
Can confirm, saw a Scorched holding a flamer like a pitchfork, dropped a hatchet
---
Nope, can‚Äôt equip it to a frame without being high enough level. Can I? I‚Äôm ill and second guessing now
---
Yeah I try dropping or giving stuff away to people I find especially stuff I have too much of or things I dont need. It's a fun yet difficult game to get the stuff your wanting or looking for without someone over charging your for that item. 
---
FWIW, I'm giving them exactly one week of buffer to get their shit straight, because master Zeni screwed them all by of course pushing for the inevitable holiday release. It's hard to get shit fixed during Christmas and New Year's.
---
So, holidays are over and now we'll see how serious the devs actually are about setting this right - and/or how serious Master Zeni is about letting them. 
---
One week.
---
I can sell them all to you,  :) just gimme ur IGN and i‚Äôll head on over
---
I agree with most of your statement, but Todd didn't lie about anything about the game. He was very open about it 
---
The crucial difference is that Fortnite does not have the amount of issues that FO76 does.  Communication is less important.
---
Maybe they'll make us use pre-determined kits for the pvp, a primary, secondary, a few grenades and power armor oh wait why does this sound familiar?
---
If something crashes because a number went over 65K, that's not a resource issue. It's because the variable used to store the number is limited to a max of 65536 AKA 2^16.
---
I don't know what programming language FO4 uses, but in C++ an unsigned short variable has that exact restriction.
---
You want a mini gun? Top of the Poseidon Plant
---
I spawn in at the train station and head off to the bos vendor, if you head at about 1 o'clock there's some railings and a drop. There's often a 3 star bot down there
---
Ah look. A headline skimmer. 
---
"a title that does not imply absolute disgust with 76. I have to go parrot points other people have made, which in no way correlate to the actual body of his post, which again.... I did not read."
---
Credibility? Zero. 
---
Thanks all!
---
It is good now though, they finally added everything they had originally promised besides maybe one or two things. It seems Fallout 76 is going the same route of improving their game based on criticism. 
---
I had to have the power smith perk to install my jet pack. Once upgraded, you can install mods even without all the materials
---
That is how 50/50 works the odds are either it is on the server or it isn't but more so lately I have seen a larger active group of dupers on Xbox. One group has 57 members that share only amongst themselves smaller 10-20 people groups are rising also.   
---
So when I meet someone there is a 50% chance of them being a duper or part of a dupe group. 
---
This game is shite, mate, I hope to Godd Bethesda releases their private server client so the fan base can fix this mess. Then, MAYBE then would it be worth it, if and only if you get a free key and donate to the mod authors. 
---
for coop mode i sure beg to differ
---
I knew the ending the second you said you put all the mods in a paper bag. Sucks bro, it's like Bethesda tries it's best to force you to buy a mule character. It's the only way to deal with the mod scraping part.
---
I say this a lot, but at this point they're causing WAY more harm than what they claim the game is doing to the industry/franchise.
---
I always see them in the Whitesprings resort. I think its the shop with the bear rug. 
---
What level??? 
---
Same actually. I'm level 66 and just got my first generator that isn't the stock standard because everytime I tried Poseidon solo I DC'd.
---
It's worse because there's literally a timer so you know you just wasted half an hour in game.
---
I made the mistake of believing what I read about FO76. It put me off trying the game for so long but a couple weeks back I bought it and fired it up and I actually really enjoy it.
---
All companies have challenging times and FO76 was Bethesda trying to step up their game to meet the love of the multi-player community. Doing the same old shit gets old and is bad for business, but they weren't quite ready to release this one before doing some patching obviously. It's been a learning curve for them but the games improving as they continue to work on it.
---
Again, it's flawed yes, but it doesn't deserve the hate it's getting and as no man's sky was mentioned, its crazy and nigh unbelievable but even that game's become something decent now (finally). 
---
Sorry not really interested if you only have 30. miss understanding
---
Do you actually mine from Lucky Hole? Or is it just scrap in the ground or something
---
Sorry im an engineer. I dont understand language so well. I just took it as: they ignored making something so simple work right.  They were negligent in their implementation of a simple feature.
---
No I don‚Äôt have any other mods 
---
I'm sure this is a absolutely stupid question but wym
---
No. Instead you had Which? magazine and other paper media telling you what was bad and what was good.
---
If you don't think reviews and marketing was a thing 4-5 years ago I don't know what to tell you.
---
You sound pretty self conscious over buying a shit game 
---
That‚Äôs what I thought and I‚Äôll check again 
---
I have some Bulk steel too I forgot to list. 15 of them. but they‚Äôre 13 each
---
Are these crafted?  Im still noobin pretty hard.  Way different online.  
---
&gt; Of course you could just server hop like I bet you normally do.
---
Keep trying, maybe eventually you'll get something right! Hahaha j/k no you won't.
---
Sugar Grove is another good source for springs. There's dozens of clipboards as well as a fair number of desk fans and typewriters.
---
~~on~~ up
---
Really? I thought if they took it, they get a bounty. I remember being some where when I was starting out and came across either a purifier or a miner and didnt realize it was part of a players camp. Instant bounty. Sucked. I dont remember picking a lock but it was a while back. Thanks for the heads up. Ill put a lock on that ASAP. 
---
I mean fair enough but the story is good. I can see why people are defending it I don‚Äôt think it looks shit I just don‚Äôt want to pick that up either tbh.
---
Fresh graves have them also, and the vendor in the resort at op of the world sells bone hammers a lot. 
---
&gt; Everyone has different things they like so you wont ever know unless you try it for yourself
---
A perfect rationale for how to waste money hand-over-fist. Buy something everyone else says is awful because hey you might be different.
---
Tryed to use Word to help me as english is no my native languaje, sorry about that.

Actually, meat piles do have flies, it‚Äôs just too easy to miss them, especially if you‚Äôre outside with all the background nature sounds and swaying greenery

explosive shotgun... sadly

Poseidon is a bitch, I wish the damn quest markers worked for me 
---
I accidentally killed someone‚Äôs pet. üò¢ I felt so bad. 
---
Lol that was fun
---
i don‚Äôt pay attention to whether or not it takes it out of your caps..but i‚Äôm sure the game just gives them caps no matter what. i‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs no punishment for not having enough caps. 
---
Brotherhood plans have been the hardest for me to come by. I finally bought them from players
---
What is even the point of leveling after level 50? I can pick a perk card I most likely won't use, or move a point in a build I already like. 
---
It's only useful if you intend to totally change your build from something like stealth rifles to melee PA.
---
Because the game is not fun to play like fallout 4 was.  It's way too difficult and clunky to boot and the story is crap. All my friends i play with defend it and yet we link up less and less in the wastes on a weekly basis. It makes me angry to play it and that has nothing at all to do with stupid youtube.

If you must camp on whitespring move south towards the monument or up on the hills above there is some good lead nodes.

Whats your ingame so I know
---
I have a normal PS4 slim I got for Christmas over a year ago, and outside of when in the stash on a tab full of legendaries, and leaving world- I don't get many game crashes at all. I've actually had very few issues since their last update, and besides 3 servers that crashed in the first 5 hours after being nuked 3+ times, I've had few server crashes.. if they just restarted each server after a fixed number of hours I doubt I would see any at all.
---
I've beaten every quest I could find, finished all main quests and just get on to help out new players and screw with friends, mostly without any issues besides the occasional graphics bug.
---
Word of advice that worked with friends, reboot into the PS4 safe mode (whatever it's called) and rebuild databases. They've had much much less issues since I've had them do that, like from several issues a day to one issue a day to a week or so (hard to say exactly, just extremely less).
---
I honestly believe that the last PS4 update was for fallout primarily, as that actually created the new issues we have when all the big issues are pretty much fixed.
---
I don't think they've optimized for PS4 pro and that in itself could be your biggest issue, because all the people I play with are having a very similar experience but none are using a pro as far as I can tell..
---
Either way hope it gets better for ya!
---
BoS is Str/End, Enclave is Str/Per.  I know a lot of melee like the BoS more.  Not sure which build needs STR and PER.  VATS shotgun?
---
Pacifist mode makes NO difference to any incoming damage regardless of having a bounty or not. 
---
If wanted, you take the same damage no matter your pacifist settings.
---
If unwanted, you take the same damage no matter your pacifist settings.
---
Still open for trade if you need anything also, no hard feelings
---
I ain't Spongebob.
---
I think the PR guy at Bethesda has had it folks. 
---
And you're actually feeling unwell? If you are, and you're on xbox, come see me. I have a gift for you
---
I‚Äôm not aware of any acknowledgment about this issue either and I don‚Äôt really expect much at this point. Honestly, what is everyone‚Äôs expectations as to what they will change or add into the game?  I‚Äôm sure there will be some improvements but I don‚Äôt see any reason to believe there will be some huge turnaround. If they were that dedicated to making the game spectacular then it wouldn‚Äôt be in the current state to begin with. Raids could be a great feature if the vaults run in their own separate space with solid server stability. 
---
My favourite point you make is about other titles and how they'd be balancing builds and such...
---
What do you think they did when they nerfed Power Core production? That was a PA balancing change....
---
Here's a list of the pretty much nothing you claim they've done;
---
Fixed heavy weapons heal/no damage issue - Highly demanded by community. 
---
Attempted to fix duping - Highly demanded by community.
---
Lowered atom shop prices after Xmas outrage from community. 
---
Improved, but not completely fixed being unable to re place built camps- highly demanded from community. 
---
Came up with solution to losing your camp if someone esle built there- highly demanded from community. 
---
Oh God. The delusion!
---
Tks man, i had no idea what happens when health reaches so low. I was always afraid of the outcome so i avoided getting health low. You are a life saver.

---
No way.  Lost me as a customer for life
---
It doesn‚Äôt really effect your gameplay until you get to end game. Leveling is fine because it‚Äôs more about the journey and personal improvement. But once you get to endgame (spoiler: there isn‚Äôt much) the effects start to rear their head.
---
TSE is the main problem. I stopped playing at level 203. I attained these levels without cheating or glitching of any kind. It was easier for me than it now though, because I played from launch and they‚Äôve nerfed how much EXP you get from mobs since then.
---
The problem right now is TSE weapons. This stands for Two Shot Explosive weapons. They deal huge amounts of damage because they scale with explosive perks and are capable of one shotting every player and non scorchbeast queen enemy. In 203 levels of legit play and legendary farming Ive found exactly zero.
---
The reason it effects my gameplay is because you see them everywhere even though you shouldn‚Äôt. Players are creating tens of thousands, and selling, using, and giving them away. Most high level players you see will have one.
---
Normally I wouldn‚Äôt give a shit what you do, but end game in FO76 is doing events/nukes and PVP. PVP is a joke because you either have a TSE and one shot people or get one shotted, so forget that. Every event or nuke zone you get to someone will one shot everything so you don‚Äôt get loot or EXP, so forget that too.
---
It also ruined the economy, which was basically non existent to begin with.
---
Oddly enough? I dont see how the reasons explained in the game differ from what happens with other players. People have opposing goals. Not everyone wants to hug people and plant flowers. 
---
luficr 
---
Honestly I just liked the spot by the train station because it's flat, rarely anyone is in that location and it's usually not affected by nukes.
---
But today this might have convinced me it's time to move....I just wish in hinesight I just left the server instead of getting my base nuked. Or at least just went and fought the queen.
---
Found my first bone hammer today or yesterday.  Had never seen one before.  Accidentally scrapped it.
---
If I roll up to a camp that has like 4 unlocked purifiers, I'll take the water from 1 purifier. I've never gotten a bounty from it so you should definitely lock it, if you want the waters protected. 
---
I wasn‚Äôt using a guide when I started playing. I didn‚Äôt read up on all the perks. I experimented with how perks work. Plus I got virtually nothing useful from the perk packs
---
I do this as well. 
---
How?  To who?
---
Bethesda?  Good, company should be forcibly closed.
---
It's crazy how emotionally attached people get to a shitty product. Bethesda deserves every criticism it has received for their shitty product. They are enabled by and validated in their decision to release a shit product when people OP go out of their way to defend it.  
---
The gaming community might possibly be the worse group of consumers I can think of. Fallout is a great IP, Fallout 76 is a shitty game, accept it and move on.   
---
Letting them off the hook gives them ZERO inventive to make a better game next time. My advice to Fallout fans would be to ask for a refund, really stick it to them, and when fallout 77 comes out hopefully its a masterpiece and you and all the other Fallout fankids can throw a party.
---
I got an explosive black powder rifle that does 913 damage a shot. It has one shot every player I've fought
---
It was promised before launch and they did add a lot. I personally just moved on from it. I felt so cheated that I can't go back to it. 
---
It's just my opinion I'm sure others feel that way in 76, but I personally think 76 gave me more upfront. I also didn't have many issues with the game bug wise except for crashing after the one patch. 
---
Jet Packs are quite fun.  Useful for knocking out those Enclave satellite quests too.
---
Honestly the youtube one man gaming news channel is an untalented echosphere atm, don't pander to your audience and do something new. I hate it when developers condemn critics as groups of trolls but honestly everyone has the exact same opinion. There are 100s of big YouTube channels pulling this shit and whenever they provide a slightly varying viewpoint the feel the need to act like they are being 'controversial' and independent. Half of them don't even know what they are talking about and just spout some obvious common sense on a simple debate (barely providing any deeper insight or discussion). ReviewTechUSA is one of the worst of these.
---
Yeah that doesn't work. There is a massive rad resistance boost that comes from "sealed" protection, like the hazmat suit or a fully built suit of power armor. Being exposed but having high rad resistance does not provide you with nearly as much benefit
---
Should move to a junk or lead node anyways imo. They are actually a pretty decent help. Or get contractor perk makes building an repairing bases cost basically nothing.
---
Board so you can dupe all the tse's
---
I think the point is, "yes there are a lot of problems with this game, but the insane amount of hoopla about it is overblown."
---
Then show us something worthwhile. [Take this video as an example](https://youtu.be/M7FngrrIo_c). The guy shows off a game that was panned by critics who are "trusted" reviewers and shows a different and better angle. Getting angry at the people who see it and say it's shit or that todd lied doesn't help you. Getting angry and throwing a tantrum won't help. Show us videos of the games best points since there are already hundreds of hours of footage out there that make the game look like shit without someone telling you why.
---
you can find them at pleasant valley vendors quite often
---
Yeah. Give it a few minutes and it will return to its previous level.
---
Boy does it ever!
---
I do wonder if it's tagging all the ghouls during a Whitespring scrum though.  Worth having it just for that if it is.
---
I've been an engineer for a couple of decades. Don't limit yourself :P But thank you!!
---
&gt; they ignored
---
No seriously - i now see where the confusion is: it hadn't occurred to me that people might relate "ignorant" to the verb ignore. 
---
The words might have a common root origin, but are unrelated in meaning. "Ignorant" simply means "having no knowledge of." As in,
---
"He'd never watched professional football, and was ignorant of the rules of the game."
---
That's all. Just means a lack of knowledge. Your last sentence is the most correct: as a whole, the overall lack of any kind of QA was negligent. It wasn't accidental, wasn't an innocent mistake, etc. - they deliberately pushed out what they had to know was a broken, buggy mess, while advertising and charging for a finished product.
---
You should have tried fallout 3 when absolutely everything was grey, or new vegas when everything was brown.
---
The marine armor plans over in the Mire really suck to try to find as the server does not instance them for you, its a global to all players on the server type of instance.  I've only seen plans once there in about 25 world hops now, totally lame. 
---
Almost? 
---
That's where you're wrong m8

Tamed a Level 91 Death claw. Issue is, he is scorched. A tamed beast being scorched means, He can break items/buildings at my camp, every time I log back in spawns at random levels, and always has to hit something. Pretty sure Scorched tameables are bugged like this.

&gt;get contractor perk makes building an repairing bases cost basically nothing.

I was at the golf course and I was killing the ghouls and I killed a 3 star legendary than a car exploded and I couldn't find him
---
They made an inside the vault yes but without much substance, I am not saying it needs to be fixed (well it does but I understand it doesn't happen overnight) but they have not plainly even acknowledged it AFAIK. I am also fine with silence over the holidays but the issue existed before and after the holidays so I don't want to give a massive pass on the grounds of people being on vaction.   
---
On the PVP mode yes you're right no one knows anything and they might have a fix, but if they dont do some mechanic like that it looks grim (for now)
---
You may or may not be interested. But this is a private Facebook some people created because we were tired of all the hate, bashing, and unnecessary toxicity this game was receiving. This a group for those that enjoy the game. https://www.facebook.com/groups/1982766255093340/?ref=share

Scrap from the ground.  Excavator armor supposedly improves the gain rate.  I did a run and wasn't super impressed initially but after Chemisting/Super Dupering down my finds I think I ended up with 400 or so lead.  More than enough for resupplying ammo.  I need to make another reload run so I'll try and pay a bit better attention.

---
&gt;You don't like the game as it is
---
I do like it. the team behind should take a page or two off Dark Souls, though.
---
&gt;you think that it should be single-player
---
I think it should be an option. there certainly isn't enough multiplayer content to justify it being always online.
---
&gt;you think that it shouldn't have a market
---
correct. but that was the only time I expressed my subjective opinion.
---
&gt;it is an online game
---
yes, but is it a multiplayer game? not in the established sense, that's also a fact. another fact is that all of its content can be soloed, raising the question: what do you even need other players for? you don't.
---
&gt;and it does have a market
---
it's too soon to tell. there certainly are rmts going on outside of reddit.
---
&gt;I'm sorry that you don't like it, though.
---
says who? I never explicitly stated whether I liked or disliked the game.
---
&gt;So you can think whatever you want; I don't care.
---
&gt;You don't get your point across by trying to slander me.
---
I'm simply assuming things based on your posts. you don't seem to have played Dark Souls and this seems like your first souls-like... online thing. like I said, there are many games that set out to do what Fo76 tried, and succeeded. everything 76 is doing feels like a worse version of other games, namely DaS.
---
and you were struggling with the concept of an online market. still are. nobody familiar with over a decade of WoW or EVE market would write the stuff your posted. combine that with you being unfamiliar with this... sub-subgenre and I'm sure you can appreciate where I'm coming from.

Vegans say meat is bad and theres loads of vegans so i guess you should take their word for it.

Also loads of people dont like vegetables so you should take their word too, that pretty much exludes you from being able to eat.

If you are going to follow your rational of simply listening to peoples opinions instead of making your own what does that make you? It makes you a mindless drone who cant think for yourself. The true definition of (and i hate this word so much) "sheeple"

I strongly advise you think for yourself or at least listen to the people who have nothing to gain from an opinion.  
---
Youtubers are paid to say what they think, and oftentimes what they think is "what will net me the most views and the most money" just as its in bethesdas interests to play down anything wrong with the game, its review sites and youtubers interests to have conflict because conflict sells

Wait...

Are you saying you like having politics injected into non-political things? Cuz from what I can gather most people would like that stuff to stay quarantined in r/politics and r/TheDonald 
---
I‚Äôm not selling anything (couldn‚Äôt even if I wanted to, i‚Äôm PS4) but also try your luck over at r/fo76bazaar. Happy hunting. 
---
I still can't bring myself to do any events because half the time my game hardlocks, and I'm constantly having VATS bugs where it rapidly bugs in and out of VATS at 3000rpm, plus a litany of other smaller issues. They've fixed some issues, but to be honest I think the hate is warranted. It's still unstable. It's still broken in some regards, and the only reason I don't hate it is because I knew what I was getting into when I bought in at the $30 level.
---
They bitch because digs are cheap, easy, and deserved. You are not Fallout 76. Stop getting angry because people rip on Fallout 76.
---
ok im joining a fresh server now
---
Oh you want to praise Bethesda for fixing there shit extremely broken / buggy game? How about no, how about you expect a AAA product from a AAA developer and not a game released for FULL price in a beta state. The game gets properly shit on and for good reason. Just cause your tired of reading about it doesnt mean its not deserved. Your probably spending money on buying visuals that were released in fallout4 and then re-released in this game too right? This post is insane.
---
This is not even close to my experience. Nobody seems to give a shit about 76 anymore, and the only vid I've even seen show up about it in the last 2 weeks is one about how bug abusers are lagging the servers out and even further ruining the economy. I feel like you should probably just stop harping on it. If you didn't keep watching 76 vids then YouTube wouldn't show you them. Let it go my friend.
---
be there in a jiff
---
Well when other posts come up throwing other people in the community under the bus and outright blame them for how bad the game is what the fuck do you expect people to do?
---
Years. Anytime they post an update on Twitter some calls Sean Murry a liar. Though they have made a somewhat remarkable turnaround lately.
---
Yup, I rather hear another boring circlejerk of Praise Geraldo than letting a corporation get away with releasing broken games with "but it's le fun with friends xd."
---
I totally get why people hate this game but anyone who actually wants to enjoy their life has forgotten 76 exists and are just playing games they enjoy, whereas some people seem to be enjoying milking it and most of them haven't even played the game. 
---
0h ya, the one where he rapes that one chick and you have to help her with her mental trauma? Nv got pretty dark. Like seeing Mr. House in the flesh or being a pimp for a casino. I love that game so much.
---
Got to get that explosive flavor! 
---
No but they did advertise this game and everything else around it falsely and in a sketchy deflective manner from the get go.
---
Since this game doesn't have damage meters to see where you place, what would you all say the requirement to be helpful in a SBQ kill is?
---
Eh, I'm a rifle build.  Buddy had the recipe drop though so it's pretty painless to keep it on.  Seems pretty common to get swarmed down which is why I was wondering.
---
HAHAHA AWESOME! 
---
The game is a joke and Bethesda deserves to feel bad about releasing it like this. 
---
Of you can't see how shitty this whole thing is you're probably just lying to yourself in order justify your shitty purchase. 
---
Came a cross a nuked Harpers Ferry and must say was not disappointed, High level super mutants with at least 4 reoccurring 3-4 legendaries in the town. Found my first explosive shoutgun there.
---
Okay. Thank you!! I will keep an eye out. Would you care to share a picture of it?
---
There was a mod in FO4 called "scrapper corpse highlighting" that would give corpses an aura the way HUD targeting does. There are also some mods like Fadingsignal's West Tek Optics that included things like Thermal vision, where any kill would remain "warm" in thermal vision for a while, and gradually cool. Both were awesome.
---
I really wonder how this is gonna go, going forward. FO4 was infamous for really pushing right through the envelope of greedy "modders will fix it" corner-cutting. Now, you have a cash-shop multiplayer game where it seems \*highly\* unlikely you'll just be able to add arbitrary items and systems in - and the codebase is a huge copypasta from FO4.
---
I really, honestly, seriously am dying to know what the plan is - or if there even is one. 
---
It's not beyond possibility that the devs have been handed a losing hand by upper management who don't see the issue here.
---
No problem. Base building is pretty much all I do now. On build number 48. After hitting lvl 150 with decent loot. 
---
For me, there was no water source in the gazebo.  Anybody else?
---
Maxed at level 3
---
The patches have changed very little so far. A lot of the stuff with the patches last two times was all atom shop activation though with the xmas stuff am i correct?
---
&gt; If you are going to follow your rational of simply listening to peoples opinions instead of making your own what does that make you?
---
If you aren't going to check reviews and take their views on anything then you are just a mindless drone to advertising. So would you rather be a sheeple of the person who in invested in making you buy their stuff, or a sheeple of the person invested in getting you to read their article.
---
Here's what you do. You check the review for SUBSTANCE, not for opinion. If it says 'This game has no PvP and is therefore shit' and you like PvE then you buy it. You don't just buy it to see for yourself unless you have infinite money and like being duped by advertisers at every turn.
---
Endurance and Perception are not the stats I'm focusing on. Strength is. BoS gives 2 Strength, Enclave gives 3. That's 5% extra damage, and 5 extra carry weight more than the BoS. A little extra health (15) doesn't bother me much compared to 5% damage from strength. But yeah I do have max strength and plan to max shotgun skills also. I'm also playing around with a new build that will be stealth melee and rifles but that isn't in my current build so far.
---
I would love to see a turn around, I love this game, it was also nice bc when this game came out I was basically burned out on every game I owned and my enjoyment led to me enjoying other games as well. That being said I am truly starting to be worried about the state of the game more than I ever have before
---
It‚Äôs basically the last Jedi of video games at this point
---
üëçüèª
---
This is just flat out false. Sorry but it is i don't love RDR2 or nothing but why have you just flat out lied? 
---
I'm gonna be 100% honest (as a mega Fallout fanboy)  
---
I LOVE FALLOUT 76
---
Yep, you heard it. The environment, the quests, the OMG THAT'S A 96 DISEASED DEATHCLAW RUNAWAAAAAAAAY.
---
Does it have it's LARGE amount of bugs and other things I can complain about? Yes, absolutely, but at the end of the day I find myself logging on and doing random nonsense, simply because it's fun and in a universe that I've grown to love.
---
What does duped have to do with it?
---
Yes I'm sure your post on this subreddit will get the world to stop criticizing Fallout 76 the way it deserves to be criticized. And you've certainly made a great point by comparing a overhyped game from an indie dev team of 12 people versus the juggernaut of gaming that is Bethesda.
---
Honestly, I think you're just offended because you're too invested in the product so you take it as a personal attack. I had my fun with 76, but looking back I still got ripped off.
---
The group I run with farms whitespring nukes constantly. I‚Äôve also been playing since the release on ps4. My first char is currently 128, second is 106, my low lvl is currently 24ish. 
---
I just deleted it and took the loss of $60.
---
It's a terrible idea to make the jet pack and other super rare mods readily accessible to everybody. It's not something everybody should have and whatever the spawn timer is (I've heard 15hrs real time? per server) it needs to remain like that. I don't have a jetpack myself and I'm not even going to attempt the vendor lottery, and I've only seen 1 person with a jetpack in 90hrs of playing so far. I think it's fine like that. The whole POINT of super rare and hard to get items is that of a carrot on a stick, not that of something you take for granted and demand you have once you reach a certain point in the game. 
---
The whole draw of MMOs rely HEAVILY on the delicate balance of "noob vs. the nerd", where the noob is the one who covets and the nerd is the one who has worked hard to earn all the things the noob covets and can feel rewarded. The noob sees a guy in his cool looking armor fly across the sky and always from that point onwards has something to work towards so he too can be the "nerd".
---
Sadly, I know the majority of jet packs are already owned by dupers and people who buy from dupers... But Bethesda shouldn't try to engage in an arms race with the cheaters and instead work towards removing duped items from the game.
---
Hollow Knight has a ridiculous amount of content that is simultaneously all high quality for the $6 you could have bought it for on sale.
---
Get a group of 4 and have someone share rad sponge. You'll shower me in gifts later.
---
It's a puzzler, that's for sure, hopefully the Brotherhood paints get added for all non-Enclave armor. Until then you can go on the quest for the Nuka Cola paint for your T51, it's a nice looking design.
---
This sub doesn't consider those valid. It's just hate from nv fanboys and /r/fallout apparently...
---
I run x-01 modded with emergency protocols as well as a few perk cards for boosting defense like nerd rage and the dodge perk cards. 
---
Not true, my group of friends PvP's every night whether I/people like it or not.
---
Once it gets to being what it set out to be and not a forum full of people crying about criticism it might be worth looking at...
---
Bethesda made some seriously shitty business decisions lately, that is undeniable. 
---
But in the long run, it isn't nearly as big a deal as the hate train conductors are making it out to be. 
---
They're acting like Fallout 76 is the death of the franchise. That the future of gaming as a whole is in jeopardy because it exists. And anyone who enjoys it even a little bit are considered a scummy enemy.
---
I had someone tell me they were fighting a war. A fucking WAR. It's a video game for Christ's sake, a means of entertainment. It isn't a religion or a way of life or anything. 
---
All these people are doing is pushing people away and insulting the people who don't budge. They aren't accomplishing anything.
---
Fair, unstable isotope, electrically charged are both good, but Tesla coils is always active so better for background tags 
---
My bad, had it in my head they were both 3/2, not 2/3 and 3/2.
---
The data files themselves. I'll take some pics shortly
---
Just how many different weapons do you carry with you? lol
---
I like non auto to conserve ammo. I don‚Äôt farm much junk since I play with multiple people we kind of help each other when one of us need something repaired. Sneak is awesome with a good rifle build though. 
---
It should take time to ferment and distill, not like cooking. Load a hopper with ingredients and wait for the good stuff.

I think the circle of dead brahmin is a sign there is a flatwoods monster nearby

---
This is the 2nd time I've seen a 76 subreddit post near the front page in a while, and again its about frustration of the the overall hate this game has gotten. And to be real it's earned. The game is so bad that "I enjoy it anyway" doesn't come close to reasonably silence the outcry. 
---
You bring up no man's sky, but the difference is between a hype train into mediocrity vs a broken, insulting mess that's further spiralled into the realms of separate merchandise, customer service and putting people's personal information at risk. On top of that the game loop itself is mediocre even if it was functional. 
---
If you want to avoid the public ire. Go to r/76filthycasuals or whatever it's called. Otherwise the salt is pretty righteous, and Bethesda deserves the disrespect at the very least. I barely gripe about the game but I seriously reccomend ignoring future Bethesda releases unless they fundamentally get their shit together. 
---
TLDR; 76 is objectively a trashfire. People complain. Deal with it.
---
I'm assuming this is on xbox? I would try uninstall and reinstalling it. 
---
It says that a couple times throughout the silo. And right next to the place where you enter the code. 
---
So how many 1‚òÜ wooden leg armors were in there?
---
including their own -\_-
---
I only see it getting worse until the dupers can be stopped; its getting progressively worse and worse. 
---
Know the feeling! My kids have already asked on multiple occasions why I get up and creep closer to the tv whenever there's 'a brown piece of paper'.. can barely imagine how they'll remember this a few years from now.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm gonna need a source on that... 
---
Tonight‚Äôs weather : dark. Yeah I‚Äôm gonna need a source on that. 
---
You can craft the underarmors in you find or buy the plans, or buy them, or find them lying around in the world. You get the linings plans for them from different vendors generally specific to the faction they belong to. When you learn a plan for one the next level of the mod upgrade plan becomes available to buy. It costs more and uses more and rarer materials to mod as it upgrades to the higher levels.
---
You only get 50 special points but after you max out you can redistribute a point or get a new card on level up.
---
:) thank u

Basically you don‚Äôt want to fight anything melee is what I‚Äôm hearing. 
---
My Fiancee plays on xbox and I play on PC in the same room (living room). She plays under my Xbox name and everyone calls her Earl even though it's a woman's voice. It's pretty funny. 
---
I'm on PC sadly, but I'm definitely going to start checking the train near Watoga now! Thanks!
---
r/LoneVaultWanderer
---
Please take a look at this. This is my normal experience over the past two weeks. What is the problem. Is it on my end or Bethesda‚Äôs?
---
I'm confused by what the fuck it's supposed to be. The assault rifle sounding gutsy shots will shred your power armor apart in seconds. The pistol sounding ones are still strong but balanced because of the slow fire rate. The lasers don't do fuck all. Why is the gutsy machinegun stronger than a scorchbeast queen attack
---
I've found it a bit refreshing to be able to swap in a different perk from time to time and play a little differently - especially if it's one I wouldn't generally use. Plus, it's great being able to switch perks based on whether I'm running solo or in a team. 
---
As a new player, we all really appreciate all of the veterans that give us a leg up every now and again. I met a super nice woman back by the trading post my first time this in this past Saturday who dropped me a bag with a bunch of plans, some water, and some ammunition. Absolutely made my day. (If that was you - thanks!)
---
There's a new dupe method out that force disconnects easier for faster duping which is almost like brute force attacking the server. The servers are going to be fucked even worse now until they actually fix it.
---
Fucking apologists, just admit it's a shit game.  I like plenty of shit games too, just own it.
---
Those pesky people who wants to stop shitty business practices man, how do they keep getting away with it!!?!?
---
I found Marine protected and shielded and also datamined the values for them both. The materials costs in the data file appear to be a base cost. The OP must have posted the values with Armorer 2 perk active so I posted both the original cost and the discounted cost.
---
* Marine Protected: 8/8/8 1S 1P 2E / 20 Ballistic Fiber, 24 Circuitry, 2 Pure Fluorescent Flux / Reduced to 9 Ballistic Fiber, 12 Circuitry, 2 Pure Fluorescent Flux by Armorer 2
---
* Marine Shielded: 9/9/9 2S 1P 2E / 25 Ballistic Fiber, 30 Circuitry, 4 Pure Fluorescent Flux / Reduced to 11 Ballistic Fiber, 15 Circuitry, 2 Pure Fluorescent Flux by Armorer 2
---
I confirmed /u/NikDybdahl's findings by examining the levelled lists myself, and it appears that the Protective Casual Lining was intended to be a set drop from the Quest: Early Warnings, but that Levelled List is not actually the one the quest uses: the quest may be bugged and using the wrong levelled list. So, casual protective and casual shielded do not appear to be obtainable in the game through normal means. I datamined the values for the casual linings to make the OP's list complete:
---
* Casual Protected: 4/4/4 2C 1I 1L / 20 Ballistic Fiber, 24 Cloth, 2 Pure Yellowcake Flux / Reduced to 9 Ballistic Fiber, 12 Cloth, 2 Pure Yellowcake Flux by Armorer 2
---
* Casual Shielded: 5/5/5 3C 3I 1L / 25 Ballistic Fiber, 30 Cloth, 4 Pure Yellowcake Flux / Reduced to 11 Ballistic Fiber, 15 Cloth, 4 Pure Yellowcake Flux by Armorer 2
---
If Casual Shielded were in the game, that's the under armour I would be using. I'm in power armor all the time, except when crafting. So, +3 intelligence for crafting, and +3 charisma by climbing out of my power armor to buy/sell would be amazing. Too bad it cannot be obtained. Has anyone managed to obtain casual protective or shielded linings / plans? If so, please PM me here on Reddit. Thanks!
---
I was asking because I wanted to know if there was a glitch or something causing it to take longer - in a comment chain about game issues. If I was going to be a dick I would have been, do you think I give a shit about your feelings or something? Twat.
---
It was purple by default, in Scrapper Corpse Highlighting.
---
Ofc, half the time, enemies are not lit even when using the PA HUD. Fuck, half the time there will be two targets standing next to each other, one lit, the other not. It's getting harder and harder to hang on to the idea that this was a rush job and not just the shoddy work we can expect from now on.
---
imo: Straighten up and fly right, is the song that takes me out of the game, just literally every lyric of the song with the inflections of the womans voice, I just turn off the radio tbh.
---
A two shot explosive handmade will be roughly as powerful as the gutsy rounds. As for the turrets...idk, I guess get lucky with the camp duplicating 40 rocket sentries for you, and pretend that it's just 4 strong ones
---
Exactly what he said
---
I do this as well. I throw out the follow me emoji, drop some loot, then fire at the ground. Seems to work so far. 
---
Work on them social skills bud. 
---
Xxx
---
Yeah the game is not even finished, yet they put fucking mAcrotransactions and they are probably planning to make the game p2w. Every time we stop talking shit about it, Bethesda puts itself back on our tongues. Is it beautifully?
---
I dont know about that, it seems to remember there being less vitriol (which is what 76 has received) and more a gaggle of people shaking their heads going: "hey, why do you think you can trick us?" And then they shake their heads and then not buy the game. 
---
you mean, they've given you more than any other survival/crafting heavy online game?
---
Yep. Picked up a plasma gattling yesterday, used it a bit, was actually sort of effective. And then it broke after about 1.5 cores. I scrapped it. Had heard it was bad but didn't think it was actually *that* bad.
---
Another thing is they don't seem to work with stealth. I dont know if it was just a glitch or if it's meant to not do stealth crit hits but it seems like an odd choice. No other weapons I've used lose sneak crits even a huge super sledge. Does anyone know it's this is meant to be or just a bug?
---
I obviously don't know the details but that looks like either bad connection or a dying xbox to me. Maybe try contacting bethesda through a support ticket 
---
Thanks for the help! 
---
Nice. Wish i was that talented with the amount of weird shit ive been through in this game and the stories ive heard.
---
Despite all tbe hate this game gets most of my favorite moments have come from this game. I met a guy dressed as Evil Kneevil who blew himself up via a fatman on a motorbike droppong nothing but bones and plastic. Ive met a guy who rped as Sgt. Arch Dornan going so far as to give me a spare power armor frame for being out of uniform. Hell one of my favorites is helping put a bunch of christmas noobs dressed in santa T51B raining down supply drops into flatwoods and making a ton of Treated Lined Vault Suits.
---
If you read through all that then congrats or something.
---
Who would have thought the gaming community would be upset at Bethesda for turning the Fallout Series into shit? 
---
I don't understand why people are defending this garbage. Defending the game only gives game developers a platform for,  "How shitty of a game can we create while maximizing profits?"
---
People should continue to shit on FO76 so they don't continue making garbage like this.    
---
Please explain the "survival mechanic" involved in wading through tall sprites of 2D grass I can neither push aside nor cut down that obscures the corpse of the guy I just shot.
---
I opened a door and saw a dozen lunch bags slowly shut the door obviously it was a trap 
---
If you havent figured it out yet you'll probably need at least rank 1 power Smith, found in intelligence. To the right of the required materials you will see the perks required to craft or attach a mod. 
---
maybe, but can't shake a stick at the vault suit when it comes to trying to get the most total special points...if only it gave a bonus card slot cause "Your the chosen one"
---
Very little standards in their line of ‚Äúwork‚Äù
---
I get it all the time for the past 2 weeks on my desktop, often I have to Alt-tab out and back in and the environment appears. Sometimes I can hear the environment(gunshots etc) and the loading screen remains. On my potatoe laptop, seems to load much faster.
---
I love FO universe and am playing the game but they did not even fix the lever action rifle animation from FO4.  Bugs that have been in the game since FO4 are still not fixed.  The things that broke FO4 like explosive weapons are more game breaking now with multiple stars...I could go on and on.  They deserve all the bad press they get - they basically released a mod of FO4 with multiplayer.  
---
However, sorry you have to see it.  Guess that's the down fall of having free speech and the internet.
---
Is there a glitch where a silenced shotgun does no damage? Added a silencer to a auto combat shotgun last night and it couldn't even kill a rad roach.
---
Even after the hate I recently picked up the game for ¬£12, played 4-5 hours with 4+ disconnects from the game, game had to reconnect to sever ever few minutes, sometimes would crash and reconnect multiple times in a minute. Wasn't very fun experience. If it's this bad after updates I just can't imagine how bad it was at the start.
---
So you're saying searching for the bodies of your kills is an intentional part of the game design?
---
The real meta should be someone shares rank 3 ghoulish and someone shares rank 1 or 2 rad sponge. No one needs rad away and stimpacks are needed rarely.
---
I just double checked and i had my username correct. If you dm me i can add you.
---
nice work man
---
&gt;even if other games on the list were objectively *worse.*
---
‚ÄúObjective‚Äù is a strong word.
---
Hmm, my game looks like this for about 30 seconds while everything loads in.  Then it sorta "snaps" into place and all the textures and effects take hold.
---
I agree with the uninstall/reinstall.
---
Bethesda sux
---
Essentially same animation as the .44 revolver. Kind of silly they have three different revolvers, same calibur, and look so similar. I personally think the Western Revolver tends to have better stats but could be wrong.
---
I have a quad single action, 24 shots, each loaded one at a time. Very. Painfully. Slow.
---
Eh, acid at the grafton golf course one is about as efficient, if not more than looking for the small number of items that give acid (imo that is)
---
That said, they couldn't just 'disable legendaries' for pvp, as that'd make the already near useless assassin's modifire (damage to/reduction from; players)
---
Bummer! I'm almost out already, that sucks!
---
Got delayed but I am on the way
---
This sadly appears correct. I have most laser rifle mods but can not convert the ultracite laser pistol into a rifle
---
All I can think of is the level 11 and the lower level player on my team were causing our teams to become enemies by hitting each other. When the level 82 attacked me and I noticed he was doing full damage to me his name was in red like an enemy. I was very confused because this had never happened to me before, or since. I am usually solo so I figured it had something to do with being on a team.
---
I'd settle for once you use a type one it shows in the display.  There is an achievement for using all of them once so I would think it would not be too outlandish to pull off but then again it's an ancient engine so who knows
---
Yeah because of duping, this is how they're doing it so Bethesda knows about it:
---
You don't have to install cheat engine though it is helpful, once you have 300 boards just make your friend trade you anything for more than 0 caps and you'll be disconnected.
---
Definitely got more hate because of the power the franchises name holds
---
Ahh PA. Yeah I can see that being good.
---
This so much. It's friggin' comical after, or even during, a SBQ fight as everyone's running around the battlefield with their noses down, mousing over every inch of dirt looking for their loot. Terrible system all around. You can either stop contributing to the fight to make sure you loot everything that's yours, or you can screw yourself.
---
The textures on my original PS4 take so long to load too! And the problem got way worse after the Dec 3 patch
---
Fair enough
---
Made me snicker... I'd use a legendary wooden leg if it made my character have, like, an actual wooden leg.
---
*yarrrrrrrrr*
---
Like I said, it's wonky/finiky as server stability at times leaves something to be disired, what with people wrecking the damn things by duping (seriously, duping sometimes crashes entire servers and causes bad lag, it's the only explination why it'd suddenly kick a full team of four/lock them up at the same time since people started posting vids on how to dupe, stability was great shortly after the last patch until those vids started coming out...again)
---
I agree, and I admit I also took my fair number of swings at the game. Even as I haven't had enough time in the game to really know what opinion I should have of it. I'll admit that it didn't sounds horrible and I kinda jumped on that bandwagon. I can't really say that the game was made for me, but I can say that one or two of my friends have gotten enjoyment out of it. So I am sorry that you feel like something you enjoy is being shit on, no one deserves that. I hope you find enjoyment out of it 
---
The game definitely feels unfinished/unpolished and it‚Äôs endgame is kinda pointless. But Bethesda has been fixing it bit by bit. I personally haven‚Äôt played it for a couple weeks due to being a bit bored of it and just waiting for new content to go through (can‚Äôt wait for the other vaults and TNT domes to open up!). The massive amount of hate this game is getting isn‚Äôt completely justified, it definitely has its flaws but it does not deserve to be the worst game on any list.
---
I mean i'd be going back a couple of months did you not see any of the 'assholes have self selected themselves out of the community' and the youtubers are killing the game posts. You know eg this one.
---
that's why I said disable them inside pvp-specific areas only, like workshops. so people who do enjoy pvping with legendaries can do so elsewhere.
---
and assassin's is one half of the gamebreaking pvp combo.
---
I've been playing this game on Xbox for the last 3-5 days straight and have experienced only one insane game breaking bug but it was fixed by simply restarting the game I have no idea what could be the problem here
---
These people buying irl are exploiting a duping method, this is one such method:
---
Depends on your build and goals. My main is heavy weapons/explosives/power armor. Between all my heavy guns, explosives (Grenades, missiles, mininukes), ballistic ammo, power armor (3 sets), fusion cores (usually 4), and then the random mix of chems and food items, it‚Äôs a ton of weight. I have a perk deck just for every weight reduction perk. I sit around 8-900lbs in my combat deck- enough to move but not sprint.
---
But on my VATS Sniper character, I stay around 120lbs in combat deck, with just one STR card for weight reduction. I just carry less shit. 
---
Lucky hole with excavator armor
---
Super duper when you smelt the ore
---
Lasts forever. 
---
Please tell us that they (the kids) dont have Reddit accounts as well.... :)
---
There is no explanation in this game. There could easily have been. If you leave it up to the players to figure out why, absent any back story or in game motive, there should be PvP fighting, then some percentage of the players are going to to view any PvP as griefing. Which is is exactly what is happening. Which is why there should have been something written into the story that there was serious trouble brewing in Vault 76, as opposed to some minor complaining and a couple people getting put in the brig for a few hours when they got antsy around the release date. The Overseer could have easily been written as the second Overseer, who restored order after a near mutiny a few years back. Resentments remain, but the mission continues. Problem solved. Took me 60 seconds to think of and write. Spread that out over a few terminal entries, and the limited PvP available in the game makes sense.
---
I use cl off and only played FO4 on heavily modded survival. There is no default corpse highlighting. And I added a mod that let you gain corpse highlighting with the Scrapper perk. Sooooo no.
---
I think it has better damage but less mods, or something like that.
---
Hope did you get the blanket on your bed??
---
Yes it is a non automatic rifle, assuming you don't have the automatic mod on it. If it's full auto, riflemen will not affect it  
---
What were the standard when the gaming magazines were a thing? What are the standards to be a movie critic?
---
Combining phrases. Beating a dead horse + sending a dead horse to the glue factory.

Sorry you only skimmed the headline. Try reading everything next time!
---
Hey this is what it feels like to be a republican lol
---
I didnt bring it up first, I'm just relating it to the comment of someone else, unfortunately hidden beneath is a political commentary, but if it fits the conversation then the only reason to complain is because it offends you specifically or your nuance deaf.
---
It says scorched so im assuming all, same goes for scorched receiver. I run it on my explosive shotty cause its one of the only efficient weapons for ultracite ammo. Regular scorched get one shotted regardless so hard to tell for sure 
---
honestly pvp in general is broken, I'm hoping that the 'faction pvp modes' are like 'here you get these faction themed kits, each with their own strengths/weaknesses, including number or people on your team, now duke it out, and winning team gets whatever is, thematically, being fought over'
---
Let me know if the excavator armor helps, i figures it only helped when you were acting doing a "mine" function
---
just give us a an empty turret chassis. You know the vice clamp, with a motor, tripod, targeting system and solenoid switch,  That the all of the non-MG turrets use.  Which we can then place down all of our useless level 50 Legendary energy weapons we don't want taking up valuable stash space but want to hold onto in the fat chance BGS makes them as viable as ballistics weapons.
---
I once looted 12 shotgun shells off an eyeball. I'm still not sure how that worked.
---
Cool story kiddo
---
Without going into details, AFAIK the duping method works by either crashing or just otherwise fucking the server until being disconnect and then abusing the system in place that prevents legitimate players from losing items when crashing, correct me if I'm wrong tho
---
Yikes I thought the church was creepy enough
---
Man fuck all these questions I just don‚Äôt like shitty YouTube reviewers that need to go get a real job 
---
I used to do that with my wife with WoW. She wouldn't raid or quest. She'd just run around looking for new outfits. 
---
"We're paying 15 dollars a month so you can play Barbie dress up."
---
I dont even like the game, but I agree that the hate is exhausting.
---
But hey, when you make your money through YouTube, why not milk the absolute fucking bajesus out of something so you can feel like you fit in?
---
I had my first real pvp encounter last night. Someone broke into munitions factory. I put a gauss round in their head as they were picking lock to the ammo machine (or getting in stash box...right beside each other so couldn't tell). I dont normally mess with people. I'm the type to leave as much open as possible for people to use. You can have my water, farm my plants...leave my extractors alone thank you...ask if you need something and I'll try to help you out.
---
Looks like you‚Äôre just upset at somebody whose playing the game for what it is lol 
---
Stockholm Syndrome the Game
---
Huh. I've been playing (about an equal split between solo and with my wife) since the B.E.T.A. (PC) and my only character just hit 80. I find nuke zones too challenging to solo :\ Sounds like finding a group is the way to go.
---
Ten left legs, zero right legs
---
 Sound like fun kids.
---
I think the main reason it's getting the reaction it is, is because other Fallout games have been so GOOD. And this is just remarkably bad in comparison.
---
Every Fallout game is a little buggy and has some issues. But it was an overwhelming amount, compiled with the canvas bags, rum bottles (now) and other issues. 
---
Also, Red Dead Redemption 2 is an amazing game. Probably the best game I've ever played but I chose to engage in the entire world, which you don't have to do. 
---
But when I saw what was going on with 76 I decided I wasn't going to get it, at least for awhile. I'd still like to try it but this whole situation has just rubbed me the wrong way. 
---
It's weird, I want to play it, but the company acting how they have, is making me not want to. It's not even the game anymore. It's Bethesda's bullshit antics. 
---
Your comment expresses my frustration exactly.  I must have lost nearly 300 caps when I jump to an event and it suddenly ceases to exists like it was never happening or it just disconnects.... I haven't even been playing that long, only about a solid week and already nearly 15 server disconnects and 20 game freezes. 
---
Also, the framerate makes it hard to engage enemies like you said... the baddies bounce around and I can't get a clear shot.
---
IMO this game is unacceptable in its current form.
---
I got attacked randomly by a guy with a 100 bounty and their two teammates. They got me the first time. After that I killed them 3-5 straight times with my two shot fat man. Not the best gun but definitely fun and definitely kills them. 
---
On ps4 right?
---
New issue: I‚Äôve installed the games via Bethesda Launcher, but when I attempt to play them, it says ‚ÄúFallout 2: Could not successfully complete first-time setup. Please try again.‚Äù
---
I‚Äôve repeated this process several times, tried restarting my PC, nothing ends up working. When I click the System Requirements menu, it says my operating system and memory are not meeting the required minimum expectations.
---
The requirements want my OS to be Windows (I am running on Windows 10) and my memory to be 0.5 GB RAM (on 6.00 GB RAM)
---
How do I fix this?
---
I disagree with the op. 
---
I soloed all the way to level 50+
---
I was never over level to go through them confidently, but I've noticed that some times high level enemies spawn because some high level player was in the area, so I hop servers. Annoying, but didn't have a choice. 
---
And you can only have a max of 15 for any attribute, I really wanted 18 Agility but cannot.
---
Ah okay I thought it was something i was OOTL on or something but now that I know take my upvote, good one
---
So it's up to player 1 to behave themself in order for players 2 3 4 5 6...32 to not have disconnects every 10 minutes, gotcha the blame is on player 1. Meanwhile World of Warcraft has 12 million players behaving perfectly for the last 15 years.
---
Switch out for Rifleman and following perks for hardened 
---
Blow their camp up. Problem solved.
---
Did they ever fix it?  I obtained the perk on one of my characters but was never able to revive my buddy without stimpaks.
---
Oh I was making fun of the guy asking for a source above, but yeah 
---
Seems not many do monster mash. Great farm spot though. I've only encountered one other person while doing it and we just took turns on the mask. He was there first so I got mask second, and let him get it for 3rd round.
---
Bro, take a breath and grab a cold one. Truth like that deserves to be rewarded.
---
Any solution would be better, but I really don't like the precedent that game mechanics that are broken to begin with will be "fixed" by adding corrective perks.
---
Someone don't like facts that this really isn't a AAA quality game ü§°
---
? I have all 3 rifleman at lvl 3 but it only bumps my damage +150
---
Alright so these were some things I wasn't aware of. Apparently there was a thread on Reddit a few days ago where some guy "discovered" Owl Masks. In the screenshots it also revealed one of his buddies was wearing a Winterized T-51 PA. That they found this by going to the Dev Room and duped it was nested in the replies itself. U don't know too much beyond it though.
---
must be real tough irl to be hot and flustered about raiders in a video game
---
All bots should be removed from Whitespring during nuke events. The bots just cause lag, steal kills, and become hostile from stray damage. Bethesda could even write it into the game as the bots are taking cover from the nuclear blast and are in defense mode until the blast zone has cleared.  
---
I think this is the church with some serious green filters on the photo. Pleas le me know if this is taken somewhere else.
---
Games garbage. Tried last night, still getting server disconnects and bugging FPS drops. I can deal with the frame rate and lame enemies but logging in over and over and over gets so damn annoying.   
---
I‚Äôve actually been playing FO4, game seems like a master piece compared to 76, lol. 
---
Mothman Museum 
---
Online now
---
My rule is to not loot their junk or kill them when there are legebdarries around. Everything else is fair game. 
---
everyone saying that we should build somewhere safe are imbeciles we shouldn‚Äôt have to worry about 3 or 2 or 1scorched beasts spawning in our camp there shouldn‚Äôt be any. I‚Äôve had three sbs spawn on my camp on the cliff overlooking white spring next to Solomon‚Äôs pond that‚Äôs a safe place you‚Äôd think there‚Äôs no sb spawn zone there. I hope that a scorchbeast destroys all these naysayers camps at least once I contacted bgs support all of you that had this happen to you should too. I hope bgs fixes this bug 
---
It‚Äôs not fair when someone is using a duped weapon they can one shot you with. 
---
As far as I know, you can't. It's one of many reasons I don't trade very often.
---
Im getting people tell me its both at vendors and learned but seems to be very rare for each.
---
To add to this, a single vegetable starch scraps into 2 adhesive. So the ratio is 1:1 and green thumb doubles the output
---
I'll definitely admit they can do well if they bring the game to something resembling a proper release but not before, and for that I think yeah we need that pressure on them.
---
I also realize the reason more people are upset with them is because their fanbase is/was huge, unlike the fanbase of noman's sky. People want them to get their shit together so here is hoping they do.
---
As for duping, I believe there were three ways to dupe when the game launched/ shortly after. About a month after release, they fixed one of the ways. The other two ways are still extremely easy to do and are rampantly abused. 
---
The game is actually worse now than it was at launch with all the duping. 
---
Good idea but then i become wanted and they just rebuild their base. Even better just remove the option to build there all together 
---
What is a 'real' job? I would bet you would call Mark Kermode a talentless hack if you liked Film Socialisme.
---
I disagree, I think people were expecting more and expected more from from a giant company like Bethesda. I feel like I wasted my money on a fallout 4 mod. I won't be buying anymore Bethesda games and I tell others to do the same.
---
Bring on the downvotes, fact is I've played the game a total of three times since launch because it crashes constantly and loses items. It's not a $60 game, it's a $10 mod for fallout 4.
---
Praise be to the wise and holy mothman....
---
You basically just hit the nail on the head though "Theres bugs like that in every Bethesda game"   
---
They have been using the same game engine for a decade, bugs that have gone on that Bethesda cant seem to find time to fix.  Then comes fallout 76, more company resources being thrown at the game hand over fist then previous releases and the game comes out in that state?   
---
(Shady marketing on canvas bags)  
---
(Shady marketing on Rum)  
---
(Insane cosmetic prices to the point of backlash)  
---
(Bugs that shouldnt have made it out of aplha let alone beta and testing phases, beyond unexcusable and the \*video games are hard comments/ever adapting technology might want to look at rockstar, they seem to have them down pretty good\*
---
Blame players all you like, if cheaters were the reason most games failed PUBG would have crashed and burned a long time ago (PUBG had issues MANY issues, it was in ALPHA! at half the price and hackers) yet its still going strong, had PUBG released as a full AAA title with all those problems lol they would be done by now.
---
Was going to stop by, but can‚Äôt find your tag. Exactly as spelled in your post?
---
That‚Äôs actually not a bad damage for the handmade rifle considering the dps 
---
xD Thank you!
---
I think your perception of the hate train is worse than the state of the hate train. I don't think people are hating on it anymore, they have simply forgotten about the game.
---
I dont think I've ever seen it proc on sledgehammer, it might be a bug with 2 handed melee weapons.
---
This is the real issue. They put a bunch of stuff in the game (probably just so people wouldn't complain there were no energy weapons) but they aren't really useable. I'll pick them up and use whatever ammo I have but just scrap them afterword. No point in modding or repairing them at all right now.
---
Yeah caps and non. DUUDEwith2Us
---
I like this idea... and also just remove some of the millions of bots aswel outside of nuked zone
---
STOP DEFENDING SHITTY AAA GAME COMPANIES FOR THE LOVE OF GOD THEY AREN'T YOUR FRIEND
---
Damn straight.
---
No, the overhanging floor on my house isn't going to collapse if I don't put a support beam in.  Yes, I'm putting the support beam in.
---
No, my character doesn't get hot and cold.  Yes, I'm putting in fireplaces and fans.  Ooooo, blankets were added?  Sign me up!
---
Yes, the wires were a lot easier to use than the conduit.  No sense not having things somewhat up to code.  No, nobody checks.  Yes, people really do comment on the quality of the wiring.  Yes, I've complimented my friend for stringing his wires in line with a floor joist.
---
Of course I put on a bathrobe when I hang out in camp.  The wasteland is dirty and I want to be comfortable.  No, there's not a comfort stat in game (though there really should be).
---
by that logic, any and all crafting should take time
---
I've bought the game despite every friend of mine warning me not to buy it, i bought it because i liked the fallout series, im not a huge fan of the lore, and thus far i like it and want to see more updates sooner than never.
---
I have been trolled/burned by my friends because i bought a "crap" game like they say and i feel bad because they are just mashing a game that i enjoy playing, yet they have not played it or did not take some time to actually see a gameplay from honest players.
---
I'm only level 46 but bumped into a dude at level 16 in whitesprings helped him kill some ghouls and then gave him a shit load of plans that I had already learned. 
---
It‚Äôs a rant...?
---
One of my friends got into it with a group of three people he runs a bloodied fat man so he let them beat the hell out of him then pulled his gun out. They ran into their camp and he let loose  one shot leveled the base and killed all three.
---
Man, XB says you don‚Äôt exist. 
---
If you're using a semi fire hardened 2SE HM with all 3 rifle perks maxed you should be getting like 400 or more think mine is like 600 with the explosive perks ect alone with a mutation and a couple other damage perks I was getting over 1k 
---
np, come to me... currently in an event
---
Seams about right, most of your dmg will be from explosive. With demolition+rifle perks you should be around 400~600 dmg 
---
Hardened receiver is non-automatic so the rifleman perks will work.
---
You‚Äôll also want the demolition perk from strength as that will increase the damage from the explosive legendary effect 
---
You just made my day!  
---
You may have disabled it, it shows up in your quest log. I believe it's under side missions, in the misc section, but I could be incorrect. It's definitely a misc in either that or the main mission section. If that isn't it, I'm not sure what is.
---
I seen ppl with 3k damage on tse handmade rifles but my wont go over 390
---
Just going to throw this out there buuuuuut... maybe you should just suck it up and keep your trap shut yourself. People are entitled to piss and moan or joke about literally anything they want. Bethesda *knowingly* fucked over their fanbase. It's not like releasing this flaming pile of horse shit of a game was an accident. They did it as a cheap money grab to fund other projects.
---
"But they're fixing it!" all you fanboys scream. Really who gives a shit at this point?
---
That's like if someone took a big shit in the middle of your house and was like: "Chill dude I gave you some fabreeze, be cool! I'll be back around sometime in the next year to help clean it up."
---
I love that this sub came to be. It‚Äôs nice to see what people are getting up to in gorgeous Appalachia. 
---
I've had to just unsubscribe from gaming news entirely because the Clickbait around this game has gotten so exhausting to witness.
---
As far as those two areas go then yeah that would be a good fix. 
---
I just meant that it's kinda stale that two shot explosive is the main focus for guns and nothing else really compares. Even if you nerf explosive shot I believe it'll still be the most sought after. 
---
I personally just don't like many of the effects they have and was hoping they were going to do a rarity system instead of the Fallout 4 legendary system they have but it was wishful thinking. 
---
Damn. What‚Äôs your Gt I‚Äôll try finding u
---
Same as reddit. 
---
Done thanks.
---
Eh. He brought politics here the way La Croix has flavor.  You bumped it up a few notches. But you're right.  My response was a dick move. There's honestly nothing there but me trying to be an asshole. So I gotta apologize for that.  
---
That‚Äôs fair. I‚Äôd say read the reviews, but sometimes games are horribly misrepresented in reviews.
---
sometimes the bag fails to spawn (like when you drop items) or another player might see it and grab it.  I remember some jagoff running off with all my flux during a SBQ fight
---
On the golf course, of course....
---
I find that it‚Äôs a pain in the ass to find it in power armour because how the compass in power armour works
---
Uppdog? What's uppdog? ;)
---
More roleplaying elements? That's setting the bar pretty low, and I'm not sure that's even true. Conan Exiles has a robust leveling system. Boundless too, along with 100% player-built towns, with shops that are player-run and actually intuitive to set up and use. 
---
Oh ok thanks
---
Pc EU, lots of short connection losses, and ocasional server disconnects. Was far more stable some weeks ago, it got worse in the last few days. Stopped questing till it's fixed.
---
Everything I‚Äôve seen and heard indicates it only affects normal scorched.
---
No one has done a test on all scorched enemies (like scorch beasts or scorched mirelurks, etc).
---
Also would not recommend trying to do anything around those trees because those devil branches poke through every surface known to man and look horrible. Tried my best anyways! I wanted to make the walkway to the treehouse less terrible also, but by that point my budget was running super low, and I figured the branches would make it look rough anyway.
---
A lower level player might have visited the penitentiary before you causing the lower spawns. Or maybe you leveled up while dealing with the ghouls, and now you get higher spawns.
---
Oh, I get the gist of what youre saying. 
---
It takes time to extract and purify water, why would the same for distillation create a problem for you? It's a manufacturing process not a mirelurk cake.
---
I had a "friend" who called me a sheep, idiot, and moron for liking fallout76 lol
---
If not then maybe leave that server and try again, power armor is especially buggy 
---
Is GTA Online a multiplayer game? It is. Do you need other players for anything? I mean, you can play solo and do whatever you want. But then again, why would you buy a multiplayer game to do that?
---
*I* haven't played Dark Souls? Oh, boy. Please, keep talking out of your ass. This isn't even *remotely* similar to Dark Souls. I don't even know where you get that from. Even I hadn't played the Dark Souls series, then what would happen? Would that make me know less about gaming than someone else? Please, don't make me laugh.
---
So are you over a decade familiar with WoW or EVE? Omg, are you saying that you are a... "MMO fiend"!? üò≤
---
Look, I get it. You don't think that trading in-game goods for other goods, currency or services should be considered a market. Sadly, the very concept of Economics is there to prove you wrong.
---
people with that kind of dmg have adrenaline ramped up, bobble heads, and other dmg buffs
---
It's actually across from the train station, this is the second time in the last month it's been in the zone for a nuke and it's the second time I didnt just leave the server.
---
I think next time I'll just leave the server.
---
I'd help but I'm on xbox. Good luck!
---
I miss the perk that made you fully rad resistant in FO4.
---
That would be great for this game in endurance, make endurance useful 
---
That should be done anyhow but it does nothing to address the issue of the explosive legendary effect. I‚Äôm afraid it must be dealt with directly.
---
Is this in response to the video posted yesterday showing how unfair explosive weapons are? It happened to be during workshop PvP. You do know that it being workshop PvP didn‚Äôt actually affect how the weapon performed right?
---
Damn man I‚Äôll take some stuff off your hands 
---
Selling plans i have 40 plans stargatefan2 ps4 50 caps each
---
...and one shot people. Yeah, no. All or nothing.
---
As I posted yesterday, doing Mayor for a Day late in the game (in my case, at level 102) might (will?) set you up against DOZENS of Major and Colonel Gutsys on that rooftop. Fuuun times! - Not.
---
Silvia farm spawns power armour, just server hop and head to it until t45 spawns  
---
I think you meant spoiled meat, but boy do I now like "spoiley meat" a whole lot better.
---
Why do you think I said it is very up to date? They have arguably rewrote the entire engine several times over. The amount of stability that Fallout has been able to achieve for multiplayer is incredible considering they haven't touched that aspect at all before. Unreal has been doing it for decades now.
---
You could still get one shot before the flood of duped explosive legendary weapons, if that's what you're alluding to
---
Finding a good group that knows what they‚Äôre doing is key. It‚Äôs easily achievable to get 10 lvls a night if you‚Äôre constantly grinding. Leader bobble head, cranberry juice, well rested, team exp card + someone sharing exp card while running a nuke is the way to go to lvl up. I feel as if anything generally beyond 50/60ish is almost just gaining lvls because by 50/60 you can have your build done and mainly grinding for items
---
They probably would have increased the limit if their weren‚Äôt so many dupers. 
---
Well guess its all good if thats your gaming style.
---
  I don't have any tse weapons only good weapon I have gotten legitimate is a gragnoks axe my build it has a bd of 254 and night its 354 doing extra damage each consecutive hit. Think it was a nocturnal gragnoks axe. 
---
    Other than that just plain 2 shot weapons I am lvl 81 and grind the game as much as possible when not working. 
---
Not like there's anything to spend it on . I guess maybe I'll drop my excess items to other players now.  Good Idea. 
---
Never, EVER, put anything important outside you‚Äôd stash or your personal inventory.
---
The game isn‚Äôt stable enough to risk it, and even if it was a freak network issue would be the end of that.
---
I was gonna offer my explosive berserkers combat shotgun but oh well
---
(just to piss you off)
---
Fallout76 sucks and I didn't even play it.
---
It depends on the location, your level, and the level of anyone else that's been there recently. Some places like West Tek will always spawn a particular type of enemy (Super Mutants in that case), while others can cycle through mutants, ghouls, or scorched.
---
Same thing with creature spawns, some are locked (like the wolves east of Charleston), while other places will spawn randomly from a pool of logical creatures that fit the environment for that area. For example, you're not going to see Mole Miners spawning in the swamps of the Mire, and you won't see Anglers spawning in the hills of the Ash Heap. 
---
As for leveling, it's a combination of your level and the region. Some areas like the forest around Flatwoods are level capped at ~10 so that when a high level wanders through the area they don't cause a bunch of level 60 ghouls to spawn and wreck the noobs. As you get further away from the forest it becomes more varied. If a level 15 person spawns at say Blackwater Mine it will usually cause the Mole Miners to be level 8-20. If a high level character goes there it'll spawn nothing but level 40 Glowing Miners.
---
Hey Wierd question how is guild wars 2 and how much of a challenge would it be to start as someone new.
---
I did reach level 16 while clearing them out. That makes sense then. So enemies spawn slightly higher than your level? Some are 10, some are 22 but most are around 16.
---
Who cares about the grind? I thought this game had a rich story and environment to enjoy?
---
It‚Äôs possible it‚Äôs from legendary effects, perk cards and buffs that stack on with rifle builds 
---
Soiley meat
---
It takes time to cobble together a gun from scrap.  It takes time to filter tick blood into stimpaks.  It takes time to pick buckshot and shell fragments from the meat to make a mirelurk cake.  When it comes to actually crafting an item, wait time sucks.  They aren't charging a subscription, so any mechanics that artificially increase downtime are pointless.
---
If you run out of ammo for your gun it doesn‚Äôt fire anymore :(
---
Get out of here Todd, lol
---
&gt;which is a slim chance if he‚Äôs on the subreddit for the game anyway.
---
Yes, I totally just subbed to r/fo76 just for the meme and not for communicating. 
---
Spoiley meat.
---
Lesson learned :(
---
