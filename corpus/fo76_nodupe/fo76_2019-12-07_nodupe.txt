There is a flyer in the agricultural place near flatwoods, but it might be for the teapot. ü§î Upstairs on a counter or table tward the front.
---
---
---
Just run them on an alt and have a buddy help you transfer them.
---
I had this same problem on xbox i fixed it by closing the application and restarting the game.
---
Yet fo76 flatout requires purchasers to engage in a Sony subscription service, a considerable source of income for Sony.  I doubt that narrative.
---
Not sure about a flyer but for me just discovering the location of the park itself added a quest to investigate the park.  If you have already been to the park is the quest just turned off possibly?
---
:-)
---
Just go to the ash heap and it‚Äôll pop up
---
You always could, you just can‚Äôt make new ones... :(
---
So the Legendary Exchange system is intentionally designed like the money system in the old coal mining towns.  You earn scrip, but it's not much.  If you can scrimp and save all the scrip, you can turn it in to the Purveyor (aka the company store) and you'll get something.  Maybe something good, but probably nothing you want.  Try to sell that back to the system and it has instantly lost value.  All of your scrip that took a week to earn can disappear in ten minutes.  
---

---
You load sixteen scrips and what do you get?  Another day older and deeper and debt.
---
And a awesome camp spot it was. Was pissed when I got booted out.
---
dont forget 25% less vats cost.   That is the sought after 3rd for vats builds.
---
I would like to just have a fun fight in my private server kinda like a free for all
---
It's the game not your xbox trust me I play on an xbox one s. O and a heads up besides frame drops, lag, and crashes every now and then your xbox will just shut off but no worries "it just works" lol no but for real the only reason this game works is because of the awesome community which makes all the bugs and glitches worth it to me
---
I'm on PS4 Pro and have frame rate issues since the last patch
---
I tend to treat it like a slot machine, if I have the scrip, I go for the money shot (three star items)...and just like slot machines, come out a loser. Lol Maybe I'll try the two star method!!!
---
I have a blade of bastet lvl 25 u can have if your okay to wait till tomorow or the day after. I can up the level if you want too
---
Maybe it‚Äôs a really long elevator
---
Game crashes or she fly's away is bs
---
Something that i really enjoy is my "name- your- own -price thriftshop. Instead of trading through vendors i invite people to trade with me and request up to 5 items. They decide the price over which we  never discuss. 
---
The money i get is used for new stock. Also my other characters that do trade for profit contribute with excess junk, aid, armor and weapons. 
---
Have had great conversations, met Nice people, met  greedy people who took max advantage and met  generous  people who payd 100 times more then the value they took.
---
An example of the first institute teleportation experiments. Lol.
---
I use my private server regularly. Need to do something at a workshop? Private. Hunting for magazines? Private. Want to just mess around in game, maybe do One Violent Night without anyone ruining 27 minutes of pure exp? Private. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
They're also very useful if you're server hopping for something. It's a guaranteed different server, so you can go public, private, public, private, visit private etc, while looking for Asylum outfits or rare vendors. 
---
Public servers are pretty much only good for SBQ fights, making new friends and vendor sales.
---
Xbox here. I always buy them when I see them for cheap, upgrade them to higher level, sell them on for the same level I found em.
---
Thanks, I‚Äôm gonna try using a USB first. I never considered using the messenger app though, good idea!
---
Nothing.  I included it by mistake.  
---
I always apply Chemist at the same time as the others as I make diluted stims and Radaway at the same time.  So it's kinda like a reflex thing....
---
PC
---
The issue is I don‚Äôt have the time to level up an alt and all that to the level, and a friend to help would be rough since only 1-2 people I barely talk to play the game
---
Atom Shop for free when the event starts at the 12th of December
---
Its not out yet
---
It makes A LOT of sense now.
---
Just get a cheap Xbox, connect it to your PC monitor. Hide the cables. No-one will know. Plus! You won't get fucked over on NW.

---
I am definitely okay with waiting! Thank you!
---
No need to upgrade it, I can do so myself :), thanks for offering though!
---
You need the Patience Perk Card.
---
You can scrap them into scrip.
---
I would roll with the AA FSS as a primary and carry the Vampires as a backup for when you are getting your ass beat.
---
Thanks! Instigating was a lot of fun but the other options just seen more beneficial
---
Would buying it off the Microsoft store work? Assuming you can lol
---
Next week.
---
I agree.  Im not a fan of instigating, because if  you dont drop the creature in 1 hit, its just a regular axe.
---
Most players using a fully optimized Bloodied build can solo SBQ these days. Likely someone with melee, or LMG
---
I have the capacity to bring all 3, so Instigating on health sponge enemies, then grognaxe to finish possibly
---
All of them. You'll be using martial artist so they weigh next to nothing. Use the instigating for most enemies. Use the Vampire SS to heal so you don't waste healing items. Use the AA Grognak for heavies like SBQ and sheepsquatch.
---
I mean.......excavator.  It‚Äôs a hoarding tool, not proper armor.
---
Thank you ! :)
---
Read my first comment.
---
It depends.    If you are doing it to sell or if you dont  already have nice legendaries then your strategy makes a lot of sense.  
---
However, if you have nice legendaries but are looking for that 3rd star, then just ride the 3 stars lottery.  
---
For example, I traded the other day for a 50 cal with 15% faster reload as the third star.  I already had the 2 star variant (explosive hunters) but that third star makes a difference when fighting the queen and her spawns.
---
Do they spawn in the same locations?
---
Meaning can you use the maps twice at one location and still get loot or does it only allow a one time collect?
---
Itd be insane to scrap a 2 star q ffr tesla
---
like not a separate weapon but the actual power armor arm, like you can take a weapon and a power armor arm and combine them to make a PA arm that always has a melee weapon if nothing else is held in it. and just crafting a very powerful PA arm that has like a bioshock drill arm that is so big you can only one one handed weapons or some types of weapons
---
I like instigating, but I have it on a meat hook. It pretty well one hit most enemies but the big guys. That was with a high health build. I have since switched to bloodied and even a vamp hook one hits most things. If you are high health build on 2 handed, I'd suggest the aa for general use, if you are a low health build I'd use the vamp one.
---
I saw someone just eating her health up with what looked like a flamer today.   Must have been either a bloodied build or a junkies.
---
What are all these amazing weapons you all speak of? 1000s of scrips later, nothing but garbage. 
---
I now go to the Purveyor specifically to waste ammo in it's face and throw grenades though her kiosk window, does nothing but makes me fell better. üò°
---
You can use multiple maps at the same location. i had more than 30 maps of some locations and digged them up all at once.
---
yeah its a slap at bethesda that they can't handle more.
---
Do you have a link? I have my doubts cause if that were true PA would be much more viable in PvP instead of acting as wet cardboard for armor
---
"Rethink" suggests there was some "think" in the first place üòÇ
---
I wish they would just come out and say how it works, because there is a difference in true random and the seeded random that seems to be the case. Rolls independent of any other influence or rolls dependent on certain predetermined influences. Doesn't really matter that much I suppose, but getting 3 Ghoul Slayers Gamma Guns in a row and someone suggesting "It's just RNG" tells me it's just a regurgitated concept at this point.
---
You dirtleg and foodbuild want to try it again. 
---
Ymb_loki.. 
---
Im always looking for pvp.
---
Get everyone you know to help you
---
Vanguard armor and Vampire's weapon? I'm assuming for perks you go Dodgy and Serendipity. I don't see much use in the other perks like Evasive, Berserker or Ironclad.
---
You‚Äôre one dedicated treasure hunter!
---
I‚Äôve gotten a few good weapons like assassins explosive shotguns or executioners faster fire rate LMG, but nothing too good
---
I recently got a 25% Faster Fire rate, Less Vats Cost LMG and let me tell you it shreds every single living thing in the game! Primed, it makes scorch beast hunting incredibly fast xp gains, and fluorescent flux isn't too hard to come by!
---
This...   all of my power shut off when I applied wallpaper, even with the power connectors attached to the outside part of the wall. 
---
Found them in my stored tab and had to reattach them after applying wallpaper.
---
I get under or behind her and empty my Instigating explosive Mini Gun into it, does enough damge to register for the drop but give others time to get loot too. These one shot Johnies are showing of or selfishly harvesting flux as fast as possible.
---
**Of course if they launched the nuke good luck to them**, it's there prerogative to do what they want.
---
No, you can't do this. Physical copies of the game are extremely inexpensive for Xbox, and it's worth it for the more stable experience if you play NW a lot.
---
plays fine for me on PC..
---
I agree energy weapons are not op.  Legacies are.  But hey all good, sorry if I came off aggressive :)
---
It's not the One S at all, it's a combination of server lag and the magnetic hard drive technology of the internal hard drive all Xboxes use. I've been testing a lot of solutions to this problem, and there are 2 ways to significant improve your performance in Fallout 76: use an ethernet cable instead of Wi-Fi, and use an external Solid State Drive for Fallout 76. I recommend the Samsung T5.
---
this can only happen with a nuke mine.  and you dont take explosion damage, just residual radiation, which doesnt initiate PVP. 
---
If you have any amount of Rad resist, this damage is minimal, and shouldnt kill you outright. 
---
If you do take regular damage, and are getting blown up immediately, I would recommend looking over your perks and taking a few ranks in Rad Resist to slot when you are doing the vendor thing.  Also make sure you are on pacifist, dont just assume you are, check.
---
Players cant destroy your camp if they pick a lock, that is false.   They can only destroy your camp if you fight back, or attempt to kill them after they are wanted, which starts PVP.
---
If you ignore the player, and run from the mine radiation, you should take no damage, and your camp will be fine.   
---
If they are able to break your camp, then one of 2 things happened.    
---
1: you are not really on pacifist and did something to damage the offending raider
---
2: someone in your group did
---
Yes lmg, gatling gun, 50 cal, gatling laser,  gatling plasma,  Minigun, flamer, broadsider, harpoon gun, fatman, missile launcher, grenade launcher, I think that is all.
---
xbox? there's your problem right there
---
Cat bowels?! Poor kitties. Must have been some really gnarly constipation.
---
I can help :) bluejelly101
---
Nah it‚Äôs fine, I do it too
---
So good! You must be some sort of engineer??
---
Strange, I want to go to camps to shop not get killed and have my  junk stolen then the person serverhops to get away with stealing, I'll have to try it out sometime. AH! After.. storing my collection of screws
---
It's been how the games have worked for a long time, your agreement with it doesn't really change it.
---
Honestly, it is Evasive, etc, that I use, at least until I get better armour to compensate.
---
Switching from a Sneak Rifleman build to a Melee one, so no decent armour or weapons yet.
---
Wth üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Did someone order a pizza with Extra Sausage?
---
You get to say "I'm a Fallout First Subscriber"
---
I use Incisor and Martial artist and notice my Anti-Armor DCG still does more damage than Furious, Instigating etc. I would just use AA grognak Axe, especially since it has Swing speed. Instigating for trash stuff, you can probably kill everything in one shot with the Instigating anyway, at least that's how it is with my Instigating Powerfist. Biggest thing for me is the Pneumatic Chest mod so you aren't getting stopped from attacking as much. Learn to actively block and you wont really need Vampires on a 2h melee weapon
---
That's how I get screenshots for my phones wallpaper, glad to help.
---
Start over and appreciate all the early in game changes?
---
I‚Äôm I fire axe guy and use instigating ss as my primary and carry my vamp ss for backup or if I break it.

Yes, I have some in my basement for my Barrett.

Sweet. What all do you got?

Yeah, the hacker-free experience is very disturbing. The full servers are also extremely worrisome. If only I was on PC, I could be enjoying getting shot through walls by cheaters, long wait times between matches, and servers so empty that I wouldn't be able to find anyone to kill. I'm missing out!
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed. 
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. **Avoid the use of trailing ellipsis.** Posts with ellipsis are generally clickbait and non descriptive. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a more descriptive title without a trailing elipsis. If you have questions you can feel free to message the moderators.

I also got glasses (of course), a vintage Coca Cola sign hanging on the wall with some vintage posters and a really old coaster set
---
Don't be afraid to join public Events. My first character, I avoided all Public Events entirely. I was worried about messing up, or ruining it for everyone involved.  I abandoned that character at lvl 35 due to being tremendously weak.
---
I rolled a new character. A fresh start, and went in fearless. I joined EVERY Public event, and learned which one's I could and couldn't handle. I began to accumulate MUCH better gear, and had a much better experience the second time around.
---
Just make sure that when doing public events, you hit the Legendary monster before it dies so you get the Loot. This is often referred as 'Tagging'. Just whack em' with your melee weapon, or a few shots of your gun, and you'll get some shiny new gear.
---
For the most part, the community will be cool enough ensure you get to be involved. But every so often, you'll find someone who thinks killing everything before anyone can tag it is a reflection of their huge E-peen. Ignore these people, and move on.
---
Bet you won't gt is xHONKLERx

Maybe I should have been haha :)

This is a PvP-related bug. You're seeing your own spine. Someone broke your body with Bloody Mess.

Of course not, I just majored in programming, so I'm curious. It's interesting how many people just throw around "RNG" as if there is one kind

You can't have both Explosive and Fire Rate on the same legendary.
---
Nice build and a nice video that didn‚Äôt make me want to ffw.
---
Wait are we talking about the same kinda bears?
---
My house looks like it belongs on Tranquility Lane (from *Fallout 3*).  I have a 1950s car with Nuka Cola stickers on the windows and a "Tested &amp; Approved by Vault-Tac" sticker on the battery box.  My garage is covered in color printouts of magazine covers from the world of Fallout.  I have a breakfast nook that's set up in the style of a 1950s diner, and it features framed artwork for each region of *Fallout 76*.  My Saint Bernard has a barrel with a laser-engraved Nuka Cola logo on it.
---
So yes, in short, I think your obsession is a little overboard.

Damn. I mean congrats. I love retro stuff. But i love old culture. I have an 84 trans am and an original nes. I love it. I wish it was more like older times but with new tech. Wouldnt have to be so "PC". Just speak plain english.
---
Fapster my man! Glad to see you on reddit. I'll be on this weekend and I'll be sure to drop by, it looks like you've changed things up some. 
---
Take care out there in the wasteland and stay safe!
---
I mean the code is available and has been for years, all you have to do is look at it.
---
I don't need that kind of hassle. I mean, I'm totally capable of running my own gang, probably the best freakin' gang you've ever seen.
---
Anyway, I hear this dude Colter is putting together a huge ass team of raiders to take over Nuka-World, and I hear this and I just gotta go check it out, you know, go see if it's the REAL DEAL. Now, the guys I'm running with, they're all upset that I'm leaving.
---
They're so upset they just keep saying, "Oh come on man, you have to stay! You're the best out of all of us! We're screwed without you!"
---
But I'm like, "Nah, man I ain't gonna let you guys hold me back." So I'd go out on my own, I travel through some crazy shit you wouldn't believe, even if I told you about it, and I wind up here.
---
Now, I find out who Colter is and I just march right up to his face and say, "Well, here I am! Now what?" And you could see right away he was impressed.
---
Now, he looks at me and he says, "Man, you look like hell! How long's it been since you slept!?" and I say, "Well I don't know man, doesn't matter. I can sleep when I'm dead!" And you could see on his face that he was totally impressed, just like he knew I was the REAL DEAL.
---
So, first he says, "Man, I am impressed! You're the REAL DEAL, RedEye! I'm gonna call you that ‚Äòcause your eyes are bloodshot as hell and it looks really cool." He says, "You're gonna be my right-hand man because I can tell just by looking at you that I can count on you."
---
But then, he, like, he stops, and he sees the guitar I'm carryin', and he says, "Whoa, no shit, you can play!?" and I look at him and say, "I don't know man, can I?"
---
And I just fucking flatten Big Iron on guitar.
---
"Yeah, Colter, like you said, I am the REAL DEAL!", and he loses his mind, you know, he's so excited, he says, "Oh, no way, I got an even more important job for you! Get your ass into that radio station and make it amazing!" Well, and here we are, swear to you, true story, all of it, every word.
---
Course, Colter ended up being kind of a chump, but I mean, you know, I knew that from the beginning, like, I probably could have challenged him right there, you know, made myself the Overboss, but, you know, whatever.
---
I killed that band of Super-Mutants south of Boston, and I bit the head off the leaders dog.
---
The HEAD.

CLEAN off.

One time I was out in the Combat Zone. A few bets, a few drinks, a WHOLE lotta jokes. I'm makin' friends, havin' a good time. This one guy, he gets jealous, I mean, I can't blame him it happens to me all the time! People just get upset, that I am so cool.
---
Anyway, he's this REALLY big guy, I mean like, HUGE guy, actually. I don't remember his name, doesn't matter, shut up! So this big idiot decides he's gonna challenge me to a drinking contest. Guess he figures he'll make me look like a fool in front of the nice folks at the Combat Zone. So, he lumbers up to me, comes up to my table, tells me he could drink me UNDER the table. I'm like, "The HELL you can! Try me!" So, everybody gathers 'round, 'cause it's clear this is gonna be the COOLEST thing that happens all night, and we just go at it, just shot after shot after shot! Now the whole time, he's talking shit about me, I mean, telling me I'm gonna lose, telling me that I'm a piece of shit, all that stuff, and I'm just laughin', I'm laughin', I'm takin' my shots.
---
Now, I'm so drunk, I mean, SO drunk, that it's crazy. Later on, people were like "Man, you were so amazing! I didn't even know how you could still be standing! I never seen anyone drink that much!" And after a while, I see that big guy startin' to get wobbly, right? Like, he's not gonna last much longer. But, like, I take a minute to make sure I'm not so drunk that I'm just seein' shit, but I'm right--it's him! He is wobbly so I push through it, man! I knuckle down, and I keep takin' shots!
---
Finally, he just goes face-first into the table! Out cold! No question! And I'm so pumped up, I pick this guy UP! I kid you not! I shit you not! I picked him right up, totally raged out, and just, BAM! Slammed him back down onto the floor, and I'm screamin' "YEAH, MAN! YEAH! WHO'S THE BEST!? WHO'S THE BEST?! WHO'S THE BEST?!" And this one guy, he comes over, he looks me in the eye, and he's like "Oh man! You blew all the blood vessels in your eye, man! That's totally messed up! That's SO COOL!" Then everyone cheers even more, and I was so pumped up, I didn't even feel it! And everyone's all like "YEAH, LET'S HEAR IT FOR REDEYE!" It was pretty great, you shoulda been there!
---
Some say I was in the Great War, Got hit right smack in the face with one of them Big Nukes, Shrugged it off, and kept on goin' Some say I just appeared out of thin air, like the Wastes themselves, Conjuring me up, and Some say I was the product of a night of unholy passion between a Super mutant, a Deathclaw, and Satan himself.

I still my earloer photos just to remind me about how this game felt during the early game
---
There are legit ways to shoot underwater and exploits to shoot underwater. If someone shoots you underwater, report them for cheating and capture a video of it. Xbox allows you to retroactively record up to 5 minutes of prior gameplay if you set it up in your capture settings.
---
Hovering thing, I haven't heard of that. You can hover by forcing yourself to lag, but it doesn't give you invulnerability. You're literally a frozen, sitting duck. It's likely that someone else was spamming grenades or you were experiencing a visual glitch. Yesterday I was being attacked by a guy who had an axe. I was taking damage, and I could hear the axe hitting me, but I couldn't see him for another 10 seconds. I also chased another guy around a house, and he would occasionally just vanish (not a steal boy, a visual glitch). I have a video saved as well, showing people planting turrets, launching missiles, and being shot by my teammate, but they were clearly not visible to me.
---
First, you can alwats find one at then end of Free Range if one of the cows is alive.  The level depends on the area of the map.

Sometimes it spawns near the train station in Welch, just up the hill.

A few times. I call her Roxanne. Felt it was a good 80s name. Damn thing is hard to find parts for. I cant find any cheap online and the Classic Industries catalog dont have very many parts for it either. I need the carb filter housing to use with the cold air intake and a center bird for the rear and the right back light. Theyre the tinted ones too. Id buy the newer, but those look way better. I wanna get the snowflake rims for her and for some retarded reason someone chopped a do-it-yerself sun roof. That's the south for ya. I wanna patch it cuz I dont wanna deal with T Tops. Need driver side door panel and a few clips for interior lining. Someone thought it was a good idea to screw the one on the driver side to the frame. No hole in the frame but still looks trash. And a new dash OF COURSE lol. Im sorry for the life story.
---
I like to drop excess "stuff" with at "free watoga" flyer in the bag.  Always wonder what a lower level player thinks when they read the flyer.

I‚Äôve seen A guy on YouTube solo it. He‚Äôs a bloodied build with a fixer doing 7k+ per shot. Pretty crazy

The person you're quoting used the terms correctly.

FR = faster reload, RW = reduced weight, both 3rd star.

The nuka quantum lamp from GS. Dang thing keeps going out and I dont wanna break it because im not tech savvy when it comes to doctoring electronics. I also have a small vault girl funko  from a box of cereal they sold on black friday. She stands by my adamantium skeleten vault boy. My father in law bought me a fallout box thing from walmart. It came with a vault tec scarf, a small candle holder sized vault boy head flower pot and a plasma gun pin I put on scarf.

One spawns north of the Aaronholt homestead, east of the lumber mill

If you read the terms when you make the purchase on Xbox, it states that the monthly subscription will auto-renew.

Give me...

---
Yep, the fine print does say it will auto-renew.
---
Just got home and checked and I just had the one month and it‚Äôs not listed in my subs- might just be hanging over a few days.

Yeah the small print is a little too small for some. ;)

When you say "selling" do you mean at your camp vending machine?
---
To anyone who didn't look into the comments, I risked my neck for these, Nuka Cola Corp could have already sent a fixer to deal with this theft http://imgur.com/a/6lUuH6O
---
No
---
Oh, then it's just they don't want to mix communities and/or spend the money on developing it or the old old game engine?
---
Ding ding. This is the correct answer. The game runs poorly from time to time.
---
When you say role play do you mean to say people just wander through the wasteland talking like the npc‚Äôs? Just whatever‚Äôs on their minds?

(Real question)

What does BE mean
---
When you make your purchase, Microsoft states it most directly. Since I can't attempt to purchase it again, I can't show you what I mean. However, here are [the terms](https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/storedocs/terms-of-sale) you agree to when you start a subscription for Fallout 1st:
---
9.¬†Recurring Payments. When you purchase products, services or content on a subscription basis (e.g., weekly, monthly, every 3 months, or annually (as applicable)), you acknowledge and agree that you are authorizing recurring payment, and payments shall be made to Microsoft by the method you have chosen at the recurring intervals chosen by you, until the subscription is terminated by you or by Microsoft or otherwise in accordance with its terms.¬†

Pylons are for the Imposter Sheepsquatch, not the real ones.
---
Where's the terminals on this stuff? VTU? It's kind of awesome
---
I‚Äôve most often found him in those weird pink forests in the cranberry bog.
---
LOL, no cats though, I've jumped server over 30 times now, the loos are either empty or the yellow hard hat is sitting in the left hand loo seat but I can't grab it, I spam E and it disappears but never to my inventory. The demand because of the challenge is incredible. Off to bed, try tomorrow. Might get it before the challenge ends.
---
it was a joke lol
---
I've seen so many variations of these terms that it's hard to tell (Faster Fire Rate/FFR, "25"/25% Faster Fire Rate, and Fire Rate/FR). Thanks for clarifying!
---
What about Invader Zim?
---
This is the fix, have had this happen many times..or just kill yourself while naked ..like drowning in the Ohio River.
---
I think my account or character is broken but it's pointless contacting Bethesda and it may be this hard RNG, I've given up caring now, I have a set up that works so just shan't change it. I accrue legendary items occasionally and either sell them to bots or for scrip, but I hate going to that station now, can only take so much abuse.
---
Not as UNFUN as the guy who one-shots her with a freaking ?automatic? flare gun...
---
Bloody Explosive
---
It won't show in your subscriptions. You have to check here: https://account.microsoft.com/services/
---
Hahahaha you found me again!
---
I don't know about that. Depends on what sorts of effects they put on them. I could see them easily allowing 2 or 3 star legendaries for it and still being balanced, especially considering how powerful some of the builds you can only do without power armor are.
---
Hahahaha, that is beyond ridiculous! üòÇ
---
I've gotten into the habit of backing off after her health regenerates.  Yeah, getting crazy numbers can be a fun novelty, but not so much for those who can't commit 1,500 damage in the span of a few seconds.
---
I use the white springs cave one, you can lure that one to nearby bots to save some trouble
---
Anyone on Xbox - you are purchasing a subscription, and the fine print says that your subscription will auto-renew using the original payment method until you manually cancel the subscription. You are not getting it for free, you're being quietly charged. Checking your Subscriptions on your console will not always show Fallout 1st. The only way to cancel it or verify that it has been canceled is to log in here:
---
https://account.microsoft.com/services/
---
aren't jokes supposed to be funny?
---
The Xbox subscription auto-renews unless you manually cancel it. Check if it is truly canceled here: https://account.microsoft.com/services/
---
Lmao, finally added you
---
Late for the help, but ... Happy Cake Day!
---
That would be me. Server hopping as we speak. Trying to find one. üòÇ
---
The game will segment it. And store it in several blueprints. But it has issues with wires. Thats what usually causes the fuss with trying to replace it. 
---
Even still, you are correct. You should not be moving a camp that size.
---
I agree.  I think the Fire Axe has some innate armor penetration properties, being an edged weapon, that make it more effective than the Super Sledge.
---
sup player? player here.
---
Oh I see!
---
was this on PC over at the big overgrown tree?  
---
because i saw that last night, and i found 2 guys farming scorched for glowing mass, hardened mass, and high-radiation fluids in the middle of the tree where the cave crickets spawn
---
The SSD might be the problem. Gamebryo (and this IS Gamebryo, very slightly modified) is an OLD engine. SSD tech wasnt really a thing, when this engine came online. It might well not handle running on one, at least not well.
---
You can have mine if you still need one, I have no need for it. Just pay it forward if you get a chance. Will be online most of the day.
---
PSN ID SmoothHC.
---
Dont forget about free santatron!!!
---
I used an Instigating Grognak for 100 levels. Perfect for farming the Whiespring because you just power attack and one shot everything. The Instigating stacks with the power attack. Add bloodied with Adrenal Reaction, Adrenaline, Bloody Mess, and all the Sluggers. It's downright fun.
---
Dirtleg? That's a new one.
---
Yes
---
I mean you don‚Äôt have to be extreme about it, but you can play a role of a barkeeper, make up rumors of things you‚Äôve heard or seen. It‚Äôs kinda how I think they thought things were going to go - people would pick a faction they liked and try to role play that out.
---
Well thank you..
---
I dont remember, I think Atom Shop.
---
Yes confirmed.
---
This guy gets it!
---
33% means vats chance. 25% is vats cost. 50% is usually crit but could also be limb damage. 15% is faster crit fill. FR faster reload, FFR faster fire rate. 
---
It is confusing when FR could be fire rate but it isnt. Just like berserkers explosive isnt a BE
---
Platform?
---
Ps4.. always forget
---
Ah sorry man. I started on ps4 but switched to PC
---
Smart move lol imagine it runs much better
---
I could help you level up really quick.
---
Like hang out just at your camp and wait sometime?
---
I‚Äôve seen some fun camp posts (Gemini studios) do some fun stuff.
---
Just sucks having an older PS4 with limited space.
---
Level 70 Commando build. I have an AA Fixer that I use as my primary (powerful auto receiver) and an AAE Homemade (also powerful auto receiver) that I can use for some extra punch. 
---
I have a Zealot‚Äôs Prime Handmade (prime auto receiver) for nuke zones, but ultracite 5.56 ammo is a challenge (lots of violet flux grinding). It‚Äôs a SB killer. 
---
I put medium or long scopes on all of them, so they can be used for sniping, when needed. Still collecting all 9 ranks for Commando to max them out, but - even at Level 70 - I can dispense SBs and most other enemies pretty quickly.
---
RIP Roachie. The Raddest of the Roaches.
---
It's like that with any display fwiw.
---
That'd be great! How so?
---
I can give you a rad suit and I could drop a nuke. Give you some molotovs to throw at the ghouls at whitespring and I'll clean them up once you get that hit on them :)
---
Was this ps4?
---
If it was a green flame it was a plasma rifle. My bloodied plasma rifle with a flame barrel on it absolutely melts shit
---
Yes. That was it.  That's why the flame color was odd....
---
first off congrats on your long standing and epic victory - but as a crafter..... I hate you..... \*cries in corner\*
---
Dude they are awesome weapons lol. Unfortunately theres no explosive plasma rifles in game
---
Pc unfortunately i will keep grinding the random vendor bot
---
doing it off a video signal is significantly harder.  The reason aimbots are so easy when done from the network stream is the server tells the client where things are at (so it can render them).  The client then takes your input and randomizes if you were close or not.  An aimbot just takes out that randomizing.  Oh, you wanted to hit that thing around there, well let me just send back the /exact/ coordinates, okay, done!
---
Doing it off a video signal would involve image processing, significantly different level of difficulty.
---
make my own christmas with mistletoe and nuka cola and blackjack actually skip the mistletoe
---
What's ya name I add you aswell
---
Playing on ps4 Level 76 and don't have the achievement for leaving the Vault... I also did not get credit for discovering Beckley so I can't complete a challenge.
---
I used to sell high-end legendaries, because people knew I either had what they wanted or could get it for them. One of the most requested items was the Bloodied Explosive Faster Fire Rate Handmade. When I explained that such a combination of legandary attributes wasn't possible, some customers would accuse me of lying... Sigh... I also heard a lot of stories of people who bought a "BE Handmade" on Game Flip, failed to pay attention, and ended up with a Berzerker Explosive Handmade.
---
Some people understand the market standard designations. Some people don't. I stopped using them because very few customers understood them or used them properly.
---
Dang, bethesda needs to look into this
---
I pvp a bit. I'd say I'm fair at it and my build is way different. 1s 15p 6e 3c 3i 14a 14l is what i have. It all depends in your style of playing and what works for you. There is guys out there that are built all around steathboys and Tesla's. So it depend on how you want to play
---
Yup.  
---
I‚Äôve even just acted crazy.  I had made my guy super ugly and walked around with just leather armor on and no under armor.  I‚Äôd go into people‚Äôs camps and just make myself at home at their camp.  Sit on their couch.  Sleep on their bed.  I‚Äôd cook things (using their crops) and just leave them around.
---
Hah. It's all good if you don't get it -- some people will.  If there are too many words I can simplify it:
---
Smart people have already dealt with these problems years ago.  Lessons from the past have shown they can be addressed.  But it's not an incentive for companies to spend time fixing, so they don't.
---
I'm referring to Netrek.org btw, not Marathon.  Great open-source game, and it's the grandfather of all multi-player internet video games. It's still fun to play, but you are right, few know about it.  That's why I'm bringing it up.
---
https://www.netrek.org/
---
You‚Äôre welcome fellow dweller
---
I saw a Fixer Plan earlier today on sale by a player vendor for 22,500 caps. Until I find someone like you did, I guess I‚Äôm still looking for folks to do Encryptid with.
---
They did sell skull totems for a while in the atom shop.
---
Next week/weekend is double xp, perfect time to grind lvls.
---
iirc you need to start a new toon and hit 10, i swore it only affected beta toons but i could be wrong
---
also other achievements such as hack/lockpick have to be on 1 toon as wrll
---
The handmade is objectively stronger than a laser imo. If I can catch you in vats I'll use that over a laser, regardless of whatever the other person is using g
---
I know, but I want to dance on the victims of the bombings more.
---
totally.  the current ones look like dollhouse things.  They really don't fit fallout.
---
Ya but you don‚Äôt have to aim with the laser has infinite range it‚Äôs cheesy
---
I‚Äôd be down for skeletons or parts of skeletons
---
Yea that makes sense. I'm also considering switching, or using along with everything else, a be laser instead of my aae laser. I think they do close to the same damage at full health and in pvp you tend to live under max health average so I think I'd get more out of it
---
yes, that too
---
I've seen that happen in beta, I didn't think it still happened tho. üòÇ
---
Because I don't want to wait 2-3 minutes for a new server to load, and sometimes I have to relog 6-8 times until I find a server I can fit into (I'm in a well-liked spot).  The frustrating thing is, after relogging for 20 minutes, some of those logins had /nobody/ using the space.  I'd rather just stay there, and tell it to "try again please."
---
And, sometimes I'm on w/friends, so I just let it go that my CAMP isn't spawned.  But then later when the person leaves, I'd like to tell it to drop my camp in place.
---
I still use them because the ones that can afford a BE or BFFR handmade are the same people that understand the designations :p
---
The ride never ends!
---
Okay, thank you for the answer. Just seems like a small price to pay but I'm not in a popular spot. Usually have to server hop once maybe twice. Thank you for reiterating your point twice though. Had trouble reading it in the post.
---
üòí that's a shame
---
No, they still can't make stash unlimited, and they never could. And stash is still a problem. Would you like me to explain the difference between the same 25 junk items followed by a single number to show how much it is and having tons upon tons of items with unique signatures due to different names, mods and uses?
---
I cleared the cooking show stuff and put on a revealing dress (I'm quite the man), then took a pic. I get a real kick out of it everytime itd a loading screen

I built a few along time ago with race car beds, bathtubs, etc but got the fountain part from her, then I modified it to do cool tricks but using the fountain was hers first :)

Reassuring to hear someone else say it lol whenever I do I just get downvoted

They have calmed down with that behavior
---
How do you dig them all up at once? It normally only lets me do one
---
Dont do anything and hopefully you wont crash!
---
I FUCKING LOVE YOUR DOLL HOUSEEEE .
---
If the object is disappearing right in front of you, it's because the object is still in your history list (the object is hidden from you after the game finishes loading the data). You need to loot 180 other world objects to push the object off your history list, then server hop, and the object should be available to you again.
---
It‚Äôs not mine haha :) she‚Äôs a friend from twitter
---
Well it‚Äôs super dope .
---
&gt;floods
---
Well it is almost Christmas...
---
I‚Äôm the first comment on that link :) I film a bunch of good stuff my friends build on settlements and twitter that doesn‚Äôt get posted to my YouTube :)
---
Totally agree :)
---
**BREAKING NEWS: Radiation can kill you**
---
For the most part, it seems to be similar to camp placement where you can't have it too close to some locations or other camps
---
Have you looked at the grinding wheels on the intake port on those legendary turn-in machines? 
---
They are for sure getting scrapped. You may not get the pieces but someone is. God knows what the Mole Miners are building with all of those parts.
---
?
---
Those already exist. Not the elf (iirc) but a PA with Xmas lights and a Santa suit among others. Those were from last year, they wouldn't show up in amy recent unreleased content. They just have to turn them back on.
---
My favorite legendary effect combination is FFFRFR
---
They‚Äôll get right on it, I‚Äôm sure.
---
I know they had that pa suit that‚Äôs why I mentioned it. I was questioning the decision of Bethesda not to already have this stuff in the atom shop.
---
I'm curious to know as well
---
I can definitely do that, though what do you mean by ‚Äúone‚Äù?
---
A specific weapon, or both?
---
Thank you!!
---
Just an algorithm.  I saw it done back in the 90s and it was disheartening as I was a top instagib player.  You have to fool yourself into believing any online pvp is fair.
---
I never had it drop for me, and the only time i saw it pre-legendary fixer in a vendor it was 5k, which was not a good deal at the time. I ended up finding one for 125 caps last week for one of my alts.
---
It just works
---
Junkies all the way! I run a junkies heavy explosive build, and it‚Äôs really fun to deliver a tsunami of shrapnel to hordes of enemies.  End and Char are worthless, IMO, put those points elsewhere.

Why aren‚Äôt you datamining it yourself if you‚Äôre so curious?
---
What platform are you on? I'd be willing to buy and run the event
---
It‚Äôs their Christmas gift to everyone that‚Äôs been playing. Wastelanders is coming out next week.
---
Got mine! A great spot for Yao guai is also battlefield cemetery, when others haven't respawned I tend to check here and although it's a place for a daily 9/10 times I find one ready to fight.
---
Sure, let me just get on my computer that I don't have and a copy of the game which I also do not have for said platform and start datamining these files by myse-OH WAIT
---
I can vouch to that. My buddy and IPVP‚Äôd a high level player at the ammo factory, he was running bloodied, probably dodgy and serendipity as well. He traipsed around dodging my explosions with ease and murdered us with a plasma flamer.  Made us feel like noobs. It was bad. Prob killed us both 5x, we only got him 1-2 times.
---
Yo i need some dirty toilet paper where it at
---
Very common on the ski slopes just west of top of the world. I ran into him North of Annie's bunker, west of the entrance/complex to silo C, in the ash heap and yeah, in the cranberry bog by one of the carnivorous forests.
---
Good sir or madam, 
---
I laughed my ass off watching this, and I would have laughed my ass off if I'd fallen prey to your uniquely delicious sadism.
---
Yeah it's a great weapon. Insane fire rate and 300 damage a hit. Lights enemies on fire. Very light for a rifle too
---
Lol. Believe it or not Toilet paper is a thing
---
That would be excellent! My game arrives on sunday! then i can add you and we can play. much appreciated
---
Too soon
---
Replace the water with rad-fog
---
Does it just gobble plasma? My Gatling can shoot all week with it‚Äôs 500 round clip, and it‚Äôs super cheap to craft 180 at a time.
---
definitely gonna have to check that out! thank you!
---
what good timing then!

We actually already have those. They sometimes happen in the Forest area. This basically causes your view to shake around momentarily until there's a break between shakes
---
Check out the ITV post from yesterday. Some nice holiday stuff coming our way! Have fun out there!
---
Yeah its flies thru bullets that's the only downside. I only use it when a bunch of enemies are basically on top of each other as I can hit them all at the same time (think front door at white spring golf club after you wake up the ghouls)
---
I'm on xbox, but having to farm back up 2k caps now bleh
---
Damn, I'm on PC.
---
Find a group ahead of time. Social Club LFG is active if your on xbox.
---
This happened to me a few times, just kill your character and it will be fixed
---
True :)
---
Good idea.  I mistakenly thought since so many flooded the event the first time, I wouldn't have any troubles.  Lesson learned.
---
Ahhh, it‚Äôs a special occasion weapon. I feel ya there. I always carry a quad auto gamma, and a junkies Exploding LMG that I only pull out for special occasions.
---
Yes sir. Community market is the best thing out there. I'm not the kibd of person who play in group, chat with people and all. I never used my vendor before because "i have no godroll legendary to sell". But then I realized my stash was full with ton of shit I never used, so I started selling packed junk to npc, but you hit the caps vendor capacity too fast, then I used my vendor and I quickly made my first 15k. On both character I have.
---
Nice I love my bloodied LMG but I only pull it out when I get up to like 2k rounds. Easily go thru them in like 30 mins. I also carry a bloody gamma for getting my rads up. I have 8 weapons in my hot wheel I think I have a problem
---
Try posting it ahead of time in Reddit or if PC, install the Text Chat Mod and global chat to the community that you're starting the event...
---
Here‚Äôs a a good rundown of the whole junkies thing. Reading it changed my mind about what to do build wise and haven‚Äôt regretted it one bit

I have that as a loading screen. 
---
If you look closely, the bear on the right has a needle in one (paw).
---
Its in the NAR trainyard?  The one northish of WS station
---
It's due to how the BETA functioned I'm pretty sure. Microsoft/Steam/the Bethesda Launcher/etc. all read the Fallout 76 Break It Early Test Application and Fallout 76 proper as 2 separate independent games with the BETA not having achievements to it. Although they're read as separate by the systems, the progress carries over from the BETA so they're *functionally* the same but are read differently by the systems. Yeah, you left the vault and reached level 10, but you did that in the BETA where there's no achievements to it.
---
There's a double XP weekend coming up, so speed leveling a character for it should be easy, just piggyback public events and do easy daylies.
---
No sir, you are well prepared. I have a melee, Grenade, Tesla rifle, my 4 main heavies (JE Gatling, JE HMG, J FFR Gatling, and A Vamp .HMG), PLUS, my two special occasion weapons in my hot wheel for a total of 9 problem solvers.
---
I don't think it's *any* of them, as I hop between a few specific encounter locations a lot and I've only seen them in The Mire and Cranberry Bog. Definitely not in the pool for the Forest. Savage Divide, Toxic Valley and Ash Heap are a maybe?
---
I wish this since more then a millennium. 
---
IN. HIS. NAME.
---
Can I ask, other than this problem your having, do you feel like the subscription has been worth the money?
---
Thats why I have like 30 repair kits and 10+imprived lol...I plan around it and carry other guns as backup
---
\*resippie
---
Nice nice I've got my BE25% handmade, B crit lever, that plasma, be laser and whatever else I'm feeling
---
PA Melee primary with heavy gun secondary.   Heavies for things that fly, switchblade and swords for most things that dont.  Spent most of the last 100 levels in PA, so now  working on not being as easily damaged out of PA.   Thx for the tips!
---
Have you cold booted your system?  When I get this occurring that seems to do the trick.

Thank you for the location of the Mr. Fuzzy hardhat.  And thanks to the OP for the advice about using the hardhat.  Two thumbs WAY up!!

Yeah it's a bummer. They need another class of event, throw artkos in it with this, SBQ, maybe free range even with a match making upon join.
---
Pics of some of the stuff mentioned is on the r/FO76Oddities/ reddit

Start it right after a queen event is finished, they should all come. I was just in one with my alt and received another fixer plan.

Targeting hud mod is nice.  It highlights living things in red.
---
Power user, which I dont think yoU can get until L50, greatly reduces core consumption in PA.  I can get 6+ hours (Real time) out of a 50% core (no vats and no jet pack).
---
In Luck, starched genes 2 &amp; class freak 1, at minumum.  SG2 allows you to retain mutations when up hit a decontaminations shower or pop a radx, and CF1 reduces the negative effects of mutations.
---
Yeah my alt is bloodied, I see any wanted and go hunt them. Think was after last 2 patches haven't been able to vats you have to aim (I know god forbid) but the guy killed right before those patches were in vats. Basically last 2 guys were shot down without vats.
---
As a resident near O‚ÄôHare airport, fuck that.
---
How does it kill you? Looks like a fog machine. Not a bad design but I'm curious if you're serious (which I'd like to know how) or you're just click bait
---
Great idea!
---
Aha!  Just joined some, thanks
---
In Vault 94, before you actually start the raid, it's on the Visitor's Terminal.
---
Basically, instead of choosing the difficulty you can read up on the procedure related to the security issue at hand, as well as the grader's comments on it.
---
Gives you an idea of what's expected of you, and how it doesn't really make sense as a safety system to have what are "game mechanics" for us.
---
It's delightful little fluff.
---
Yes, this!
---
I think it depends what you‚Äôre going for. If you‚Äôre someone who is into trading having a third star is very valuable. Even if it‚Äôs not a particularly useful effect. At this point in the game I have everything I need so I go for 3 stars on the off chance I‚Äôll get a god roll.
---
But if you‚Äôre just going for best bang for your buck then 2 star is the way to go.
---
Thanks! easy peasy
---
All armor, at least the DR aspect, is pretty useless for pvp.  The damage that players can produce per bullet will easily top out the limit.  If my commando with a handmade normally hits for 100+ per bullet on the scorchbeast queen, the maximum DR that a player can achieve is probably less than that.  Thus, I can still blast them with 100+ damage per shot, with probably a half dozen hits per second.  If someone is trying to pvp in power armor, I know they don‚Äôt have sentinel effects at play.  They will drop in one burst, and typically get really upset about it or call me a cheater.  I get nervous when a guy has a Tesla and goes invisible.  That usually means I have no hope of winning.  They‚Äôre just taking advantage of flaws in the mechanics.  Once I land a solid legendary Tesla, I‚Äôll use it too.
---
What is worthwhile for defense are legendary effects and perks that allow you to flat out ignore a portion of incoming damage, or dodge damage altogether.  That‚Äôs why sentinel armor is so valuable.  Even after being nerfed to only work 75% of the time, a full suit is incredibly strong.  Unless the opponent has a legacy energy gun, it‚Äôs not hard to stay alive at half health.
---
What's the karma syringer? Never heard of that
---
Haha thank you :)
---
I've played for hours in the last 48 hours as a FO1st subscriber without issue, probably not Bethesda's fault
---
What do you mean when you say he was floating? Like flying in the air, or hovering just above surface level?
---
bridge fell in the 60s
---
Did you watch the video? It‚Äôs 30+ Tesla arcs, 12 radiation emitters, and 18 flamethrowers :)
---
It‚Äôs not the strongest trap because of its size (3x3 exploding floor)  but I killed easily over 50 while filming this one
---
The subscription has nothing to do with it.  My husband can‚Äôt get on either and he doesn‚Äôt have 1st.
---
Not really placing blame, just venting really.
---
The cat house in morgantown.  Large number of cat food bowls there.
---
Morgantown and Grafton High cafeteria.  
---
Check anyplace that has a doghouse - usually have at least one dog bowl, food joints (stacks of nuka cola cups and cafeteria trays) - Tyler fairgrounds and Camden park... the theater  inside WS resort.
---
coolant and antifreeze bottles....
---
Very sound advice, and I agree.  The third effect, at least on a weapon, is typically just fluff.  The third effect is much more important on armor.
---
That will change with Wastelanders, to some degree.  The new 4-5 star effects are pretty strong.  A flat, unconditional 20% damage boost is better than most primary effects.
---
The odds of rolling a b/e/15%crit/cryo/20% Fixer is going to be absurd.  I‚Äôll probably have to ask my great grandchildren to keep rolling for me after I‚Äôm gone.
---
a syringer mod for the rose questline, once you turn the quest and syringer in you loose the mod though
---
"Carousel...renew, renew, renew!"
---
will do!
---
I was thinking that I knew all the mods. Just curious
---
btw, with all the modern surveillance we live with today, especially around a sensitive area like an airport, I'd think there would be more evidence by now.  I mean, this trucker didn't have his phone on him?
---
The hotel near Seneca rocks spaws them...in rotation with a number of other critters.
---
Bonus: sometimes you get a strategic cargobot.
---
Thanks
---
That's not really how it works. But yes, technically we can kill people with the karma syringer.
---
Not quite small, not quite twelve inches either... But it smells like a foot.
---
If you‚Äôre already using the gun of your dreams, may as well spend frivolously.  If not, it‚Äôs probably better to try and stretch every scrip you can save.
---
oh you raiders, always killin people with them thar loopholes
---
The flower SE of TopoftheWorld. Acid node in the water, wee cave with a small boat. Lovely place.
---
best thing I've ever read on reddit, thank you
---
I can confirm this. I'm giving, and she's taking. Thanks for 3 hunters pipe pistols, honey.
---
Mothman is scared of us southsiders.
---
Have you tried flushing yourself down the toilet?
---
pun intended? :O
---
Can you order me a few pizzas?
---
Can you imagine? I mean... use your actual fucking brain...
---
No lol I just realized it
---
Have you just had a stroke - in-game? Do you small toast?
---
Maddie says no.
---
Idk and im no stealth pro, but when i had 1 piece of shadowed wood armor and escape artist i could crounch right in front of shit and it wouldnt see me anymore.
---
I have them. Enter your PayPal here ________
---
I was just looking for it for ten minutes lol. Thank you.
---
Lol I wish
---
For a while I did a "trailer park". Modulars with functions, workshop, residential, etc.
---
oh no, i know PA is really tough to pull off for pvp, if you dont have Strangler Heart its not worth forfeiting all the legendary effects of armor, i myself tried pulling off a PA build with suppresor lone wanderer and dodgy for 80% total flat out damage reduction (assuming it added, which i doubt) plus emergency prots when my health get low and it's alright, hard to find pvp in the game though and when you do it's either a foodbuild or guys with high end gear, but it seems to do very well in 1v1 situations, i was in a 4v1 situation and i could've done well and possibly even be in the advantage but PA just gets shredded by cheese, me and handmade guy were pretty evenly match but his other buddies whipped out teslas instantly, and while i have a quad tesla myself my build is a heavy guns build so it couldn't keep up with the other two teslas and it isn't FFR so they could easily outstim the low damage i was doing, burned through 58 super stims and like 140 stims in like 1 minute trying to keep myself alive, it was just spamming which is boring and unnecessarily wasteful of aid items, and they still had the audacity to call me a foodbuild haha but ended with a gg and heart emote as it should be. I started a whole new toon for an auto rifle build which I'm getting to pretty quick actually, should have it done by around double xp starts. After giving it some thought my main toon is just missing cheese to compete with cheese, I run an AA2525 50. cal for pvp and occasionally a TSE minigun(though thats mostly used for wrecking buildings lol), and while honorabu it can't fight cheese. Need me an AAE gat plasma haha, just got a JFFR90 LMG I'm hoping i could trade it for one or bundle it with some other weapons to trade for one
---
Thanks for the succinct answer.
---
It doesn‚Äôt sound like your set up is working that great, after all.  The fact that you sell any legendaries to bots tells me that you‚Äôre not making the most of the way the system works.  The way to get what you want from RNG is volume.
---
Thought about it, I‚Äôm a plumber so don‚Äôt think for a sec it didn‚Äôt cross my mind.
---
Never underestimate human stupidity.
---
Thank you so much!
---
I always thought the powerfist should be power armor only. It makes no sense to me other wise. Outside of power armor half of the the energy (e.g. damage) is going back into the wearers arm &amp; shoulder. When it is part of the power armor, the PA has the structure to make most of the force goes into the target.
---
[removed]
---
Serendipity does not work in Power Amor, but it‚Äôs a great perk.
---
Are You Sure?
---
Just try
---
This is how I feel lately. I have a pretty great 3\* weapon I carry that can only be replaced by another 3\* god roll. Why not try for it?
---
Fun Fact : You Are Cool
---
I got evicted :(
---
I have a couple explosive revolvers with stocks. It doesn‚Äôt make them great primary weapons but it makes them a hell of a lot better. They are pretty fun. I‚Äôll use one if I‚Äôm running around the forest or something easy but I‚Äôm for sure swapping my cards and arsenal if I plan on spending time in the bog.
---
Return it. Not a joke.
---
I believe the crossbow is also heavy weapons. I could be wrong though.
---
Don't think they would change it, just take it away from those who didn't earn it/don't even know the plans. It's an exploit to trade it, so in the short term it would be a good fix for the lag. But eventually they should work on fixing it after more players legitimately earn it
---
You just have to keep trying, pretty much all of the best drops seem to come from the purveyor.
---
Yes please take your fallout 76 out and break it in two
---
Had a player start shooting me after the One Violent Night event-because I didn‚Äôt shoot back, he was doing no damage to me. Unfortunately for him, I saw two of his buddies in Chameleon just waiting to ambush me after I shot back. Watch out for this.
---
I have digital copy
---
I've run into Sheepsquatch in the Savage Divide several times.  Most commonly on the railroad tracks between WS Station and the Bed &amp; Breakfast.
---
Then you don't actually own the game. You're safe!
---
I was the only one in our team using it, and still, the lag.
---
People have said it's op, but if they make it less powerful, I'll be disappointed given the grind.
---
Apparently it's being patched with Wastelanders, but stability vs function is yet to be confirmed.
---
I'm 100% behind taking it off people who haven't earned it. It's meant to feel special
---
Chems
---
I found it some time ago on the shore of a lake at the game boundary.
---
5.56 and .45 at 1 c.  I buy as much as I can.  Also, Ultrite 5.56 at 2c, would buy lots of that
---
I bet if you looked around some old hardware store or big-box store warehouse, you could find New-Old-Stock wallpaper from 1993 and it'd be in fine condition.
---
I agree
---
Agreed i get tired of seeing witch hats..
---
Personally, I'd be happier with perk trees. Like every other Fallout game has.
---
Very impressive !     üëç
---
As far as ammo goes I sell shells for 1, 10mm at 1 and give away any spare .38 and i sell fusion cores (full) at 76 caps
---
Server hop and look at Quarry X3 inside a portable toilet, I got it on the fifth server hop
---
Not much, just playing around. hey, by any chance have you seen player?
---
Quad Tesla is new PvP meta cuz people can't aim üòÇ, also alot more toxicity, if you find someone nice, keep them close and protect them, good luck and stay safe üëç
---
Ok
---
I use my IE Black Powder to snipe the Super Mutants at Wes Tek from the cliffs.  Saves a lot of wear and tear on armor and meds.  One shots Lvl 68's with a critical hit or surprise attack.
---
So now it‚Äôs cool to grief people? Bring back the ability to destroy player camps &gt;.&gt;
---
Big daddy liked this comment
---
They mean war. 
---
I remember the days when you didn't have to lock your doors, the mailman waved to you, and scorchbeasts were kind enough to follow you around, even after death, just in case you wanted a massive, screenblocking, floppy corpse on top of the workbench you were using. The times sure have changed. But war... War never changes.
---
Least he was polite. Silver lining.
---
I've been exchanging 1000s of scrip at a time until now when I lost interest, not sure the system is conducive to receiving bulk legendary stuff with casual play. Maybe thing will change if I bash at it again?
---
Cheers!
---
Sounds interesting, I'll keep that in mind!
---
There was some talk of it being basically like your favourite wheel, where you can assign different loadouts to different slots.
---
he did not get what he wanted. unfortunately for him i had seen this type of attack before from others and was well aware of it.
---
I don't PvP but this sounds feisty üò±
---
Delete it
---
No, PC
---
I used to favor underneath power line towers. It's pretty flat there. Perfect for a garden.
---
How are you removing the UI from the video and getting camera work that moves like that?
---
Its a game.
---
It took over my computer and I can‚Äôt delete it
---
Then do the vault raid
---
Gunpowder is always a big seller at my vending stations as well as 5.56, 5mm, .50 cal and 45 ammo. All the .38 and .44 rounds get tossed in at a 0 cap price. 95% of the players who do get some of that ammo only take a few hundred rounds and usually buy something else since they were gifted free ammo. Even if it's a few 5 cap recipes, 10 cap plans or a few mutation serums. Mutation serums are a hit or miss a lot of times, but usually Marsupial outpaces them all.
---
I also tend to look for non-legendary versions of weapons to scrap for mods, such as the radium rifle and handmades. I usually craft my own, but when running low on parts, I'll vendor hop on the server until I've seen them all and then server hop and repeat.
---
I also want friends to run it üòÇ
---
Just in camera mode and I play with my Hud completely off 90% of the time :)
---
That's what they do man.  
---
PvPer's can be cancerous.  In dedicated PvP games there are tons of systems in place to control griefing - systems that evolved from long years of dealing with asshats.  
---
These sorts of hybrid games often don't have anyway of dealing with exploits because they were never expecting PvP to be all that important.  But any chance someone has to screw complete strangers over is eagerly sought out by some types of people.
---
Exactly, I want to sit back, relax, and kill some ghouls, not have to worry that I'm going to be minding my own business and some little prick decides that since his parents don't love him that he's going to ruin my experience, and grief my base, if people want to PvP that's fine, go fight some Actual PvP builds, I've had to creat a PvP set just to slaughter people that won't leave me alone but new players can't do that, these kind of people drive them AWAY from the game, they probably won't PvP people who want to because they know they'll get fucking bodied so they pick on low levels, it's disgusting and a douche move, and is overall killing the game, unless you're one of these useless individuals, you should feel the same...
---
I normally sell all chems at NPC vendors.  Do chems sell at camp vendors for more/the same/less.
---
I‚Äôm selfishly trying to figure out if it is worth more to me to sell them at my own vendor?
---
Pretty sure duping isn‚Äôt a thing anymore and hasn‚Äôt been for a few months at least. Bloodied builds have always been very powerful, and you can‚Äôt damage them because you‚Äôre not in combat with them.
---
The game is absolutely still a steaming pile of shit but it‚Äôs better than it was a year ago.
---
What is this you say the purveyor(spelling) not giving the sweet weapons ?? Y-day that bitch gave me a bloodied ss +str rolling pin, i sold it to my wife ...now shes beating with it
---
&gt; Was this Bethesda‚Äôs plan all along to sell more private servers? 
---
Yes.
---
Just an edit to this ... also beware of players following you around and doing the trade emote, or team-up emote. Two of the main ways left to grief in adventure mode. You will find posts on this all over so wont go into detail.
---
Purge those cheating bastards !!!  Just like they took away our stack of 10+ godrolled  items
---
And I‚Äôm addition to this - always always scrap and  store you junk as much as you can.
---
With some of the other stuff Bethesda's pulled of late, it wouldn't surprise me.
---
I have my private session to play + unlimited junk stash, but i only pay 1 month at a time cause i get boored
---
solve bugs first please
---
I bought it and never use it for this reason. :(
---
If you're on PC, send me a PM, I'm looking for people to run them too
---
Sadly no. Stability's still just barely high enough to keep the physical servers from bursting into flames, and the only new content are some of the vault raids that were datamined at launch. Item dupping seems to be down, at least.
---
A grenade fragments on impact. You saying grenades dont explode?
---
Duping is non existent on the playstation console at this point.  
---
Most if not all bugs have already been announced to be fixed with the wastelanders update.
---
If you put in a casual amount of effort, I think it stands to reason that you should expect a casual level of rewards.
---
I‚Äôve been playing for about four hours, farming legendaries and just quit for the night.  I collected just under 500 scrip worth of legendaries, plus an I/SS/End golf club and an AA/SS/90 spear that I might save for lower end trading.  I got a lot of single star pieces today.
---
If I want a B/FFR/Crit Fixer on my commando alt, I‚Äôm going to put in the grind required.
---
This is for non-pa, I can‚Äôt speak to pa personally
---
And to that end I will be having a sale of all my gear, a decent sale whereby you can actually see what you are buying and it wont be flamers or black powder riffles with bash damage..more detail to follow :)
---
&gt; just one spawn point
---
[confirmed](https://i.imgur.com/cKh3dLT.png)

It says everything about the faith of Vault 94's residents that the security logs as filled in by an Usher. Shame after all the work he 'went through to set up the lockers'
---
Thanks Shank
---
Upvote my sir
---
And canned stew.
---
Imagine being this upset at a video game
---
I saw several times a couple of them attempt to lure people into their little pvp bs, didn‚Äôt work since nobody was interested. So they just hide on top of the roofs outside golf club and wait, when someone finally got whacked by ghouls they would rush to steal the paperbag and emote thumbsup to each other. Might as well call them junk thieves instead of pvpers lol, there‚Äôs no better way to define the word ‚Äòlosers‚Äô üòÇ
---
Seriously what is the point of this ‚Äòfeature‚Äô???  Is it for streamers or something?
---
How did he kill you
---
I enjoy the Nuka-Cola aesthetic so I guess going with the real world version is cool too
---
Its a post apocalyptic world and there are going to be thieves and murderers out there. It‚Äôs a legit role play strategy.  What you might be interested in is Farming Simulator 2019.
---
Unsure. I died, and he was immediately looting me, and I had the option to seek revenge etc.
---
Hm :/ and your 100% sure you had pacifist? Is so i saw some post about the karma syringer being able to kill through pacifist if your taking rads. But that only sounds usefull on bloody builds or low health in general.
---
100% sure on pacifist. Which is why I was confused. I am a low health bloodied build though.
---
Might be that and then he blocked you from session so you couldnt see him.
---
Must‚Äôve cause I chose the avenge option but nowhere to be found.
---
I think the issue is somewhat between the chair and your keyboard.
---
I also like the bladed commie whacker, well done!
---
Never happens to me as I don't own a mic and I ignore everyone.
---
Honestly
---
Again, its a fucking game.
---
Also the worst ones too
---
Ran in to a griefers the other night. Classic 5cap bounty scam some how he didn't get flagged for an event though so he was just jumping in front of people and trying to kill the legendaries to piss people off.
---
Yeah and the Path to Enlightenment event.
---
"The Forrest: (251 maps)
---
single-action ivory grip plan: 55"
---
...god do i hate those... Not even low level want them for free.
---
In a level 96 .50 Cal Anti-Armor Power Build. GT:ZeRoPiXeLs4life. I can be on at any time.
---
How do the griefers use it specifically to harass players? Have you seen it?
---
I have both an explosive bolt action and pipe revolver. As a sneaky sniper, the bolt action does more damage than my TSE Gauss. As a sniper rifle it's amazing. Need something else for up close though. I have a junkies exp 10mm for that lol.
---
Is this your first Fallout, I assume?
---
Cool. We'll hit ya up next time.  Ended up doing a couple of SBQ runs and called it a night!.
---
Nah, keep going for JFFR. There's no reason going to to AA. If you really struggle, go for VFFR.
---
For a non vats stealth sniper build that‚Äôs alright! But you should change some of the stuff like ammosmith to something useful in combat imo, since you only need that perk if you‚Äôre  crafting ammo! I got one vats crit character and it looks pretty similar to your build, but obviously a maxed on luck with all the vats percs.
---
Couple of things I‚Äôd do:
---
1: get rid of 1 point in strength and run with bandolier 2
---
2: pull down endurance. Being a sneaky Rifleman means you don‚Äôt have prepare for damage taken. I put 2 in rejuvenated for heath benefits and AP regen (useful for VATS)
---
3: same goes with charisma, but that‚Äôs up to you. Lone Wanderer 4 is a powerful perk but your losing perk points that could be spent in luck
---
4: use all of your special points that you remove and put them into luck. If you want to run a low health play style (which is easy for ranged sneaky builds), 3 extra points for serendipity is a must
---
Owl_No is my psn 
---
play however you like
---
I have a JFFR combat rifle but I don't know how it'll hold up against JFFR handmades
---
This pissed me off so much last week. 
---
A friend was saying that they wish there were more caves, and I referenced the old caves that were there. He hasn‚Äôt seen them. So I trekked up there and found this cave and was like oh, I though the cool cave was here but it must be close by. Walked around the mountains for 45 min, and then found out it was replaced.
---
0/10 Bethesda, let us be cave trolls again.
---
AAFFR Handmade would be better because of the faster fire rate. I say just go for VFFR.
---
id think its the top of the monorail elevator, seneca might be higher tho
---
Exactly
---
Lately I‚Äôve been trying for a legendary bear arm for my gauntlet build.  I got five swing speed melee weapons while farming, so I used the 500 scrip I had on hand, because why not.  I got a hunter/ss/str bear arm on my fourth try.  So close.
---
I love that I got it the first time I played the event so long ago.
---
No worries. I loved the sword and used it for ages
---
Give me your psn and I'll add you next time I'm playing.
---
I see vendors selling the stuff from time to time if it's not too high I can pick the other things up if you keep me updated with what you do and dont need
---
You can keep upvoting yourself with your alts. Doubt that Reddit admins will appreciate but by all means my bro
---
Happened to me about a week ago. I joined to let him do it, then just reported him and moved on.
---
Kinda boring than innit?
---
‚Äúsaid platform‚Äù?  You didn‚Äôt say a platform in your comment/request/pizza order.  Throwing in terms you don‚Äôt comprehend just makes you foolis-OH WAIT
---
I do it when I want something from your vendor but need to get caps from an alt and I don‚Äôt want to lose you.
---
If you had a teammate that didn‚Äôt have pacifist on they could have been tagged by him and then they can initiate with either of you I believe
---
Whenever you see blatant exploiting/hacking, just report them. A while later you'll get an email from Bethesda about that ticket, which you can then reply to with the details about the report.
---
Geneziza_Sicken I can provide you some crafting/modding services
---
I have 4 vendors, each one specialised: handmade, fixers, vampire and junkie. All weapons.
---
Bloodied sneak builds are really op if that's not your style go armor pen
---
What‚Äôs armor pen? Sorry I‚Äôm still learning a lot
---
4x the size and 16x the detail! 
---
Or whatever Todd said
---
I'll adjust some of these such as ammosmith and look in to adding them in to luck. Thanks for the insight!
---
Pretty often when I go to send invites to my buddies, it'll send to an entirely different person instead. Leads to awkwardly booting them off when they join. And sometimes, people will do that to get to your vendor free of charge. Just little things to save on caps sometimes haha
---
Okay so let me get this straight, my Anti armor Gatling laser does 25 energy damage. But if I had armor penetration for energy weapons it would do more?
---
Lol. 
---
You have an opinion. 
---
Upvotes don‚Äôt make it makeIt more valuable.
---
There's a lot of clips on youtube that will give you ideas &amp; show perk card layouts.
---
 I watched one from captainnoob &amp; angry turtle &amp; they spurred me on to do a solo queen. Failed first time, but on second try I was able to do it.
---
You one shot the queen? Holy crap I have to DUMP ammo into that thing
---
Not one shot, I wish :)
---
Just took her out solo
---
Ohhhh okay I was goddamn that thing has a stupid amount of health
---
And here we are...
---
Hi friend,  
---
So, do you typically downvote anyone who disagrees with you and then upvote yourself with all your alts? Cus that‚Äôs kinda what it looks like. 
---
Sup with that? We‚Äôre all participating in discussion, no? Why the need to downvote anyone who disagrees as upvote yourself because your opinion is obviously right in held in much regard? 
---
Seems pretty damn shady to me.
---
I recommend blocker 3 in strength, serendipity 3  in luck &amp; then it depends on weapon used. For a vats build gunfu in agility is awesome &amp; is my favourite perk. 
---
Also as mentioned before, sneak but also headshots can be your best friend.
---
Someone has one shot her, don't have the post saved but they did a vid on it
---
It‚Äôs all good, we all learn. If you go to Captainoob‚Äôs YouTube page his front page video is how to do a stealth commando, which is a fun and easy build. Don‚Äôt worry if you don‚Äôt have god tier weapons and armor, I use a mix of basic bolstering and unyielding pieces and basic bloodied or even vampire, executioner and anti armor automatic weapons and it is still a fun and manageable easy build. You can even do full health stealth commando without to much difficulty. What can be tricky is re-specking a old character to a high damage build- but you could use the upcoming double xp event to do that or get a new character up to speed quickly.
---
It never was 24hrs, it's always been 22hrs, or 180 items picked up.
---
Yes it does, it was also in the promo pics for the burrows. Not sure why it never was released though.
---

keep repeating that , thats sure to convince people their game is a game.
---
Weirdly at my last job exactly the same acronym could cause confusion as PA could mean process analyst or personal assistant! üòÇ
---
That‚Äôs actually true.  Fixers, bear arms and sheepsquatch weapons don‚Äôt drop off enemies.  The Purveyor is the only source.  You can also choose the number of stars and they‚Äôre always level appropriate, so that bit of chance is taken away.  Nothing feels more disappointing than getting a lvl 35 b/e lever gun.  It happened to me last weekend during Uranium Fever.  It‚Äôs mostly worthless as a trade, but would be gold if it were lvl 45.
---
Found Santa in Nuclear Winter. He was in his sleigh with all of his reindeer. We took pictures with Santa and even gave him a present. A nuke case with 4 codes. We escorted him around and won the game. We know we are all getting really good presents this year.
---
LOL you are such a weird dude.
---
Found one here ‚òùÔ∏è
---
:-D
---
For good reason.  I don‚Äôt think it would dare show up in south Boston, either.  It would be a back bar decoration within an hour.
---
You're trying too hard, and it's pretty pathetic.
---
It's well-documented that the PC platform is exclusively plagued with hackers due to the lax anti-cheat measures in place by Bethesda. I guess PC players need all the help they can get to git gud.
---
The server population for PC is barely sustainable. Since NW has minimum server thresholds, yes, the wait times on PC are longer than any other platform. I'm legitimately amazed that you think 100Mb/s broadband would somehow change the server-side matchmaking settings. 
---
And I feel like I shouldn't have to point this out, but you are struggling to have any dignity... I don't play on PC. No one on PC can kill me. Obviously, I'm not calling people hackers because they've somehow beat me. Git gud.
---
might hit you up for level 40 and 50 modded out handmade whats cost here?
---
Someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed
---
Damn I must admit that I‚Äôm a little jealous of that! I live in Europe myself so some things you have I wouldn‚Äôt have a chance of getting.
---
I do have a Pip-Boy 2000 replica, a Pip-boy 3000 replica, a Mini Nuke replica the T-51B power armor helmet and all the other stuff that came with the collectors edition, some fallout 3 style Nuka Cola bottles (my dad got me those when he went on business trip to America, what a legend), a big Nuka Cola bottlecap sign and some bobbleheads, I really am jealous of the stuff you can get in America tough (assuming you live there because GameStop haha)
---
Why try to find the plans? The parts are everywhere...
---
I usually fine most people gathered near WhiteSprings, or near an event.
---
Maybe just don't play then? I rarely encounter the things you've said.
---
Where you find the ball? I have the glove.
---
PC?
---
I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs some version of the griefing scam where you join their party, they make themselves wanted and thus you now take full damage from their chameleon buddies waiting to mug you from a bush.
---
Every time the game goes for a few weeks without any new content, players get bored and start trying to ruin someone else‚Äôs day for kicks.  It‚Äôs been happening since last December, without fail.
---
Be thankful you‚Äôre not lvl 300+.  Every jackass on the server wants to pick a fight lately.  I can‚Äôt play my main character on public servers during peak hours without wearing power armor to vend, because everyone figured out the nuke mine trick.  Thursday cannot come soon enough.  The brats need something to do.
---
tinycamp? build everything on one foundationblock, stack crafting benches, beds, crates and other mobiliar by placing them on floormats first then move them, which then allows to put them onto each other. tiny camp tower!
---
locations:
---
go outside the bounds top north east corner of map,
---
on monorail tracks,
---
inside the tunnel that leads from bogtown to watoga,
---
tinycamp should fit anywhere

They still need to grind the plans.  I‚Äôd be bitter about the players that just used a credit card to buy theirs, not the players who lost junk and never expected such a generous handout from the devs.
---
I‚Äôm still grinding for mine.  I can solo DitW on standard if I get a good task combo in the reactor.  I only try once a day now, so progress has slowed considerably.

It's more that the people that have the plans could then make about 4 sets to sell

You can use emotes to draw their attention at least :) The players will never fill the NPC gap of course, but it interacting with others can be great, or not, depends on who you meet :P
---
No, XBox. Sorry!!
---
I know who you're talking about, he has a Youtube channel where he shares videos of his victims.  
---
It's quite an elaborate scam, kinda hard to find someone that does this kind of stuff in the game.
---
Of course it doesn't work. It's Bethesda. Unless they can squeeze some money out of you then you don't mean anything to them.
---
Rats. This Fixer plan is burning a whole in my pocket :) Have a good day.
---
Thanks I‚Äôve  found it now.
---
My Player Vendor Christmas List:

my wife and i came from a more cartoony based rpg game background, so its more of a habit thing since people in those games called their characters toons
---
Graham did it for you while you where away, he's good like that
---
What special stat is it in
---
Make one with your main, one with your alt
---
Well i hope hes willing to give my atoms back
---
I‚Äôd recommend getting (for now) perks that increase the amount of stuff you get when scrapping. Also perks that mean your armor and weapons break slower too.
---
Any day fine by me
---
They have the exact same attributes? I know when you have studded sturdy leather, it has almost the same attributes as an unmodded heavy leather piece. Maybe that's the case?
---
Thanks for the input!  I have the perks for scrapping and weapon longevity but have yet to see one for armor longevity.  I‚Äôll keep my eyes out for it!
---
What platform? I'll hook you up with what you need to build excavator on xbox
---
Lol! Thanks!!
---
This happens to me too, basically it's something to do with having minimum Charisma
---
It happens when you have dynamic modificators to charisma working against each other (e.g. additicions). Game keeps evaluating your current charisma and will unshare perks sometimes even though it allowed you to share it. Best if someone can share magnetic personality perk to bump everyone's charisma high enough that the debuffs no longer trigger unsharing.
---
Thanks!  I‚Äôm on Xbox!  I‚Äôll be on in an hour or so and can dm you my gamer tag.  I wasn‚Äôt expecting that!  Wow!
---
On the contrary, this is actually something that would be rather easy in this engine, since the water level set by records for a particular cell, all you'd need to do is just change a single record for Tmins until it 'resets'.
---
Don't use that rifle, lack of ammunition is an eatly problem, try stealth rifleman with hunting rifle or go melee to save ammo.
---
Talking about exploding bullets not grenades
---
Thanks!  I can make a decent hunting rifle.  Melee is how I handle all the low level stuff but I just can‚Äôt tank the damage with most closer to my lvl.  Good advice, thanks for responding.
---
Check the mods on. One of them is probably the heavier version than the other.
---
what does 180 items pickup mean? it resets after u pick up 180 pieces of scrap?
---
I have a team-build toon (high char) and I'll occasionally shot-gun invites. Met some fun people doing it too.
---
that's super rare though  - not everyone's an asshole.
---
Also, it can be related to a daily challenge )do such and such on a team). On those days you'll get a lot of random invites.
---
At level 28, this sounds pretty normal. I waited until level 40 to do Ross's quests, and mostly just stuck to areas that were level appropriate. Grinding for ammo, excavator parts, and materials to make and scrap handmade were my primary focus. I'd take breaks just explore the Ash Heap and areas around the Top of the World. The latter would often get me into fights with enemies a bit higher than me but there's a lot of cliffs to snipe from, so I'd usually approach areas from above and then snipe those below. Most of Welch can be sniped from the station, so that's a good place to gather black titanium and other mats. If you're on pc, I'm willing to help you out although I'm not on that much.
---
add me on psn: Owl_No 
---
we can do silo runs, im lvl 78
---
For adhesive, plant corn, tato and mutaberry in your camp.
---
Homemade vegetable starch.
---
Twice the fun if you got Green Thumb.
---
It‚Äôs sent
---
no, do you?
---
the 2nd with the gunreligion seems interesting.
---
how would you convey that message with building structures?
---
an explanatory sign with "10commandments" ?
---
i dont get the 1st one, havent seen the movie. :)
---
You have to get the plan for it first. It costs a fair bit, but you can buy it at the Watoga station or probably at a Whitespring vendor. You'll need a ton of screws when building/scrapping them though.
---
When you're feeling tired of frustrated from the grind, just explore a bit and/or go back to an area that you simply enjoy being around. Some really good perk cards are going to be coming your way in the next 10-15 levels, that will make life easier. There were times I thought that I'd never get ammosmith, but like everyone else, I eventually did.
---
Must be your luck setting is high!!  I joke but hey maybe üòâ
---
Do you use the extra points from unyielding to share perk cards? that gives me problems ...
---
Isnt that why they call you Dr. TRAGEDY?  LOL i joke of course what system you on?
---
I really appreciate your thoughtful advice.  I am just coming back to fallout after getting frustrated with it mid January earlier this year.  I‚Äôm so glad I decided to give it another go :)
---
The middle levels are for sure the hardest and grindiest. Then you'll just suddenly hit a point where you can't remember why you were ever having trouble lol.
---
Keep an eye out for the public event One violent night.  It will be free to travel to since it's public.  Make sure there are already people there because solo at your level will just be lots of respawning and frustration. It's cheesy but if you show up there, tag everything you can and let the high levels finish everything off, the xp is going to give you at minimum one level, probably multiple, given where you are at right now level wise.  As long as the ghouls spawn in normally it's going to be thousands of xp per event as long as you focus on hitting everything and not getting hit back.  If you cheese out a bunch of levels then you'll have points for perks to make the game a little easier on you.
---
Thanks!  Everyone here has been so helpful.  I‚Äôve been afraid to try out co-op events because I don‚Äôt want to be a liability, I‚Äôll look for that event!
---
That's the guideline I see online, but we all know that creatures vary in difficulty depending on who first enters the area.  :)
---
No you.
---
Oh shit, they do exist!
---
Find a junk extractor spot and put your camp there, yiu can build an extractor on it and itll collect some rare resources for you over time providimg you keep emptiing it when its full
---
Level 28. You should search for "commando unyielding vats crit sneak build". Progress the storyline on this character.
---
Also you should create an additional character from the vault. Search for "mele unyielding vats crit sneak build".
---
December 12, 2019 will begin double xp weekend.
---
Scrap and stash your junk often. Bulk and sell as needed.
---
These mutations will get you killed, avoid these: Electrically charged, plague walker, and unstable isotope.
---
Shes given me some really good stuff over the past few months. I even named the BE hunting rifle she gave me "Murmrgh"
---
Did you get the plan for shielded bos underarmor yet? If not, there's still that.
---
Handmade.
---
There is also this.
---
A plain handmade or a TS one. In either case, I vote for the handmade, although the TS one isn't great.
---
Handmade is superior in every way
---
Thanks!
---
Yeah i have been trying to place my tent any time i do a queen run that way players have a place to store their junk and not lose it to players like that. Last time i went there was like 5 or 6 tents around the event, they are also nice to stand on as well
---
Hi, yes, I failed to mention I waited and no one showed up before the timer ran out.  I'm going to call out next time I start the event to make sure people want to do it, because even though the server wasn't dead, not a single person showed up.  Oh well.
---
See, that's kinda the way I played survival mode. Death bags were marked on the map, so instead of camping train stations, or getting into pissing contests at uranium fever, I'd go junk hunting. 7/10 times It was just free junk, sometimes a jackpot haul from someone with way too much aid on them, but 3/10 I'd be able to get the drop on the other player and get some good fights in that aren't just at whitespring. 
---
The golf club vultures though, they're just lame ass loot ninjas.
---
I was wanted from lockpicking a thing that shouldn't even make you wanted. A few people flocked to my impenetrable camp and could not destroy the walls to get me. The way they finally killed me was their legacy tesla or whatever that can shoot right through/around walls.
---
I don't think camps can be destroyed at the moment in Adventure mode.
---
A bigger worry is having them waste your budget in a place you can't see or interact with and you never finding out where that item was placed to hog budget. Since teammates can place things in your camp.
---
I was super disappointed when i killed her the first time that scorched were still attacking me. Like seriously guys, go home. Your side lost.
---
Yes your special will fluctuate depending on your health
---
I Love it when you load in and magically complete an event and get all the rewards from it. Had it happen a few times and have gotten some pretty good loot. Once got the Plasma grenade plans, unfortunately it was back before I knew they were worth anything and used them lol
---
Go melee
---
It would be cool if got the rewards.
---
I've got a bloodied crossbow.  One shots most things with a full bloodied build.
---
None. Unless it is explosive.
---
I hit this wall on Xbox. 
---
I stripped myself completely naked no weapons or aid or ammo, drank nukashine and see where I end up and set myself the task of surviving all the way back to the opposite side of the map. 
---
Side note: was much more tense on Survival.
---
No thanks dude, I'm after an instigating or something along those lines
---
No link, it was a while back in the dataminer AMA somewhere. Nothing is viable for PVP lol.  Everyone has weapons that hit for so much more than the damage cap that they will pretty much do the max damage everytime regardless of reductions.
---
Wait and hope it returns to the shop
---
What's your IGN? I didn't receive a request.
---
Aw man, this strategy is going to ruin some of my gameplay preferences.  I enjoy finding low level players on the map, inviting them to team up, then promoting them to leader and following them around helping with stuff.  Apparently at least some of the people who have turned me down were suspicious about this practice.
---
Right on. üëç
---
Mobbie1996

On pc.

Omw
---
I was on a level 3 character outside vault 76 waiting to do a trade once. A scorched beast flew by so close that I could of hit it with a rock. If it was the queen, I would have passed out lol.
---
Someone ate me at the end of the Encryptid event when I went down. I got stuck in the respawn loop and had to leave server but it instigated some kind of PvP as I had the option to seek revenge or ignore, I was just frozen. That's a new one on me and quite a time to grief someone lol. Still not unsure if it was intentional or some kind of bug.
---
some mods can make appearence differences, you probably have pocketed/deep pocketed on one leg and not on the other
---
other than that i could only imagine they are just light/sturdy/heavy and thats the difference
---
Pretty much this, they'll cycle Hero of the wasteland back into the shop at some point. One of those things i'm very glad i gave in and grabbed when it was up though, cool AF.
---
Two Shot isn‚Äôt a great prefix, but a Handmade is much better than an Assault Rifle.  I hope the Assault Rifle gets a buff with Wastelanders.
---
Always read Plans and recipes when you first buy/find them (Under Notes: in Pipboy) avoids you buying dupes.
---
Avoid taking Workshops unless you want to get 1-shotted in PvP (Just being in a workshop area opens you up to PvP!)
---
Point Pleasant has a lot of low level Scorched which drop tons of "starter" weapons which can be sold to vendors or scrapped to learn mods, a fair amount of chems in the church, and Mothman eggs which you can turn into omelettes for +2 CHR at robovendors
---
Whether or not you want to run a power armor build, (Raider PA becomes available at Lvl 15) A PA frame can be used at any LvL and negates fall damage! (Just unequip and scrap the armor pieces!)
---
Squatting/crouching to sneak helps to let you know if enemies are nearby and hides you from other players (allows you to grab scrap/loot from workshop areas discretely)
---
The good doggy perk card (END) makes canned dog food (plentiful in the game) satisfy your hunger AND it is a food source that doesn't spoil/go bad {also look into Good with Salt perk}
---
Mutations can be cool but Radaway and Decon Showers will remove them, so they are hard to manage until you pick up the Starched Genes perk at around Lvl 35-40 otherwise you need brahmin milk to remove rads.
---
Walk everywhere,follow the main questline, have fun!
---
You don‚Äôt lose junk during scorched earth anymore FYI
---
The irony of this game, the developers had group play in mind when developing it.
---
Yet in my experience 99.9% of Gamers enjoy their own company,enjoying the solitude,exploring alone escaping reality.
---
Not to say people are not friendly,they really are.
---
You do SBQ events and die,usually anyone near by will Stim you.
---
Random acts of kindness are part of the Norm.Everyone other than the 0.01% looks out for lower levels giving them stuff.I always give lower levels free stuff i see in my Camp,and i know many others do to.
---
I gave one a decent Weapon the other day he was jumping all over in excitement.
---
There are only 24 people on the map so they may be somewhere else. Game starts off slow. Once you get pst Morgantown it picks up.
---
There's a reason behind the madness I suppose. I don't know if you've tried PvP regularly. There's no way of finding people that want to, so half the time if not more is spent just jumping from player to player and punching them a few times hoping for the best. You can easily do this at 3-5 servers before you find anyone willing to participate. Thus if you see someone in a workshop or whatever you'll often initiate PvP because you've spent 20 minutes jumping servers or something. 
---
As other people have said, it's a game and people just want to have fun,and since there is no options for PvP players (other than nuclear winter but) they take the fun when they can.
---
the latest craze i've heard of is players using nuke mines to kill other players with rads.
---
Funny thing when a HIVE MIND is linked to a SINGLE INDIVIDIUM like SBQ... just saying.
---
No such thing as heavy marine armor, all marine is sturdy only. Combat, metal, leather, robot and raider are the only types with light/sturdy/heavy.
---
If you're going for non legendary armor, scout is probably your best bet, although there's no way to craft it so you have to buy it from the enclave.
---
It would be a cool feature if the scorched creatures dropped dead when the queen died.
---
Nooooo!!! Youre breaking my heart with such news.
---
Nope, only the one from the tadpole quest.
---
There's an achievement/trophy for joining teams afaik.  Perhaps people are just doing that?
---
Cool, thanks!
---
As long as she's popping out them babies she's gotta go.
---
Thank you, Just pm me, ill give ya the link
---
Many still dont have the scrapbox... the struggle is real.
---
The game is literally laced with dark humor. I found in wendigo cave a couple skeletons and a teddy bear with read eyes holding a knife set up above it. I found in the asian stress relief temple, cant think of it, a few blocks set up to spell out D R U G S with a knife stabbed intp a table. I snapped a picture and framed Welcome to West Virginia around it. It's a pretty good loading screen picture!
---
Bethesda apparently wants this.
---
My record its 3 crashes a row in main menu...Sometimes just works
---
I never saw or heard about it, but I need to have it now
---
I believe flux no longer drops after sbq event, you just lose it whether is on pvp or pve, if u die after the event flux is gone.
---
Cool, sounds good. Thanks for the help.
---
I rather  ot call these people PvPers...
---
Remember the PvP radio? it was perfectly an option, but failed. Why? Because, by large, most people don't want PvP. Period.
---
Now we still see lots of people trying to force it? How the hell we have that many people trying to force PvP and the radio failed?
---
...
---
in short, they don't want fight PvP, they just want to annoy and kill defenseless people. These are bot PvPers, these are just griefters.
---
I have many friends in RL that enjoy very competitive PvP games and they all feel the same: "weak opponent = boring game".
---
I didn‚Äôt want to be the bearer of bad news but I seen there was another comment waiting for it too :‚Äô( soorryyy
---
Not good.
---
I dumped the 15 damaged  Cores.
---
It puts you off doing a run,
---
If your on Xbox I'll set you up with some decent gear
---
I have never gotten a bear arm from the purveyor.
---
So nueter her then were good
---
to be fair.. on pc there are so many cheaters you might as well just afk because you aint got a snowballs chance in hell of winning unless you join them
---
It's pretty cool for sure!
---
It‚Äôs hilarious you haven‚Äôt even watch what it is haha
---
I eat 5000 steel for breakfast in these builds. People almost never drop junk and this trap costs 30+ copper, 30+ circuits, 50+ steel, 20 screws, and 20 aluminum to set off once. No one is building traps to ‚Äúprofit‚Äù junk. I‚Äôve gone thru at the least 1500 copper in one day before, let alone all the other stuff each trap takes to repair :)
---
Store your junk in one of the many stash boxes around my camp and watch that to see a bunch of people having a good time:) a radiation trap haha how boring
---
Large number of new players lately, black friday or something.  Just newbs thinking it's fun to talk and make friends.
---
I mean I dont blame them for doing that, not everyone is into PvP, but most people still want the skins. What they should know, is that you can select an option not to fill the team with other players, so you'll spawn always alone in your team.
---
Honestly this is why I never group with strangers, being high level somehow makes people think that I want to pvp and I'll get people blatantly ask to pvp, which I find are the more nice pvpers since when I turn them down they give a heart emote and move on and then other times it turns into this, invite to team, decline, gang shows up, melees me hoping for electrically charged to spark (which I had to remove because of people like this) and then they complain saying, "Really? a level 500 doesn't pvp what a joke."
---
Ok that was missleading.. it's more like rapidly digging them up one by one.
---
Very annoying when you help killing it and you die towards the end by an enemy then you respawn and it counts as you weren't even there and you get no loot from the body.. Just happened again to me üôÑ
---
Ill have my hopes though!
---
Lol. God bless Reddit. Without it. I would never have seen this funny comment.
---
I get random team invites and trade requests and generally never do them.
---
Only time I do team invites or invite people is during events like uranium fever, and then disband right after the event is over.
---
1) The PvP radio fails so bad because it requires like 1/3 or 1/4 of the entire server to start.  Finding players that want to PvP is really difficult already and that many on a server is basically impossible unless you plan it. 
---
2) People try to force PvP because as I said before it it's pretty much impossible to start hunter/hunted since no one wants to. Thus the ones that actually want to can't really use it
---
3) you might be right about some people, but a lot of people also just want PvP. Spending 20 minutes jumping servers and basically playing loading screen simulator is really not fun. If you kill a guy,sometimes they seek revenge for a bit which can be entertaining. 
---
4) I never said anything about that, I just said that it is difficult finding people that want to PvP
---
Most that I know at least set themselves to solo.
---
I honestly haven‚Äôt done NW since Halloween, I hate Morgantown. It‚Äôll be nice when Flatwoods comes back.
---
Where's everybody? Playing other games until Wastelanders releases. The players who are left are the hoarders/builders who do their own thing and that's it, people who raid workshops, and Vault Raiders/Queen Killers, whom you can't join.
---
Sounds like you picked the wrong time to get into the game.
---
Good to know! I just raided the first enclave mission, taking the hiring exam now.
---
It's West Virginia, the losers get statues.
---
They respawned.
---
But then you might miss out on all that loot
---
Strength. By the way, what weapons do you intend to use? The most important decision is what your SPECIAL attributes should be. If you want to use rifles and/or pistols, put as many points into agility, perception, and luck as possible (e.g. 3-15-3-4-4-15-12), while for melee, heavy guns, and shotguns you need high strength and less perception and luck. Heavy guns work best with power armor, and somewhat higher intelligence (at least 6 points) can be useful there. You can swap perk cards anytime, and eventually you earn all that you need in any situation, so again it is getting SPECIAL right that is the most important.
---
In my opinion, it is overall the most effective and easiest for most of the game to use automatic rifles and VATS, benefiting from sneak attacks and criticals whenever possible. This works well enough even without legendary gear, mutations, low health builds, or anything like that, except for a couple of particularly difficult events. The downside is that you need to give up on a lot of weight saving and convenience. Although for ghoul hordes in particular, heavy guns and power armor work well, too, you take less radiation damage and can kill all ghouls before having to reload.
---
And what exactly are you doing towards the pvper?  Being upset at someone caring about their entertainment... 
---
Fo76 has pvp in the game. These elaborate (ish) hoodwinks are one of the only way the pvp players can start combat, just accept it for what it is.  It's part of the ecosystem of the game.
---
There has been a lot of good advice so far, so I br redundant, but I will echo what was a complete game changer for me...Marsupial. If you find it at a player vendor for 300 caps or under, go ahead and purchase it.  Then when you get to the levels where you can unlock starched genes and class freak, you will get the full effects from it and never have to worry about losing it.  It changed my game in that I could get up high away from strong enemies and kill then from a distance.  I started leveling up so fast at that point because then I could go through the Whitespring much easier.
---
Ye,I sadly admit I both suck at PvP &amp; am a certified bush wookie,I gotta have them custom outfits &amp; skins...
---
But I always set myself too alone,for two fold reason of both not messing up anyone else‚Äôs team,&amp; not getting my spot blown up when I‚Äôm In dah bush...
---
Everyone‚Äôs got there own way too play I guess
---
Watch for ‚ÄúFeed the People‚Äù, too. It gives you the canned meat stew that‚Äôs good for +5% xp. (Staying rested by sleeping adds another +5%). Also the ‚ÄúPath to Enlightenment‚Äù event lets you commune with the wiser out human and get even more of an xp boost. All of those will help you level faster.
---
It‚Äôs all about the gears and it‚Äôs tough until you get the right set and the perks to go with it. Until you reach level 50 (when you get max level legendary drops) you can stay in and around Whitespring. The resources are plenty and there are bots there to help you as well as high level players. Make sure you land a hit on all the ghouls you encounter then you just run and stay alive, someone will wipe them out for you in no time and you get the XP. The higher level ghouls the better. Get a shotgun or tesla so you can hit a hunch of them with a few shots. Don‚Äôt hesitate to use grenades and explosive cars.
---
Is it the guy whose videos start with the cringe intro of him saying "yOu gUyS aRe ExTrEmElY sAltY"?
---
I can't handle that much edge.
---
This community sucks, they all silently farm, constantly afraid of being griefed.
---
West Virginia was in the union
---
Dude, chill lmao. It's not even that serious. Some people, like myself, don't enjoy PVP, but want the rewards that NW drops. I'll be doing it on the regular when the Halloween stuff comes back as well as the Christmas stuff cause I would like all of it, solo, so I can run around and hide in bushes and water
---
Or when you are able to loot, you loot, spawns so much enemies at your back that kill you and when you go take your fluxes they are just disappeared... XD
---
You can thank the community for that
---
Ahahahah that's true! I always kill them feel like a bully, I hate them so much. Schoerchbitc~hes XD
---
It's 1 month from the date of purchase - so if you but it today, you get 1 month from today.
---
At this point I‚Äôve kill hundreds of people and tbh I have no idea exactly how it works haha 
---
All of the traps are pretty weak, and if someone is using cards/wearables to negate fire damage, electrical damage, or has high radiation resistance it can be very hard to kill someone. Per tile 6 flamethrowers, 4 radiation emitters, and a couple Tesla‚Äôs to help stop fast travelling will kill anyone but it may take a few repairs. 
---
You can build just rad emitters but you can just fast travel out, the flamethrowers have a long reload so to make them truly effective you should run separate triggers for them to offset the reload. A lot of small traps people build will work but not on everyone. 
---
Start buying, saving, or getting junk from friends or market. The cost of it all is unbelievable :)
---
Yeah - you'd hardly be able to tell by its politics today, but the whole formation of West Virginia came about because the northwestern part of Virginia wanted to be in the Union during the Civil War, so it broke off from Virginia itself.
---
Never happened to me honestly. Your fluxes also count as meds üôå
---
How do you know you did enough damage?
---
There are usually two radstags near the Whitespring golf club, if you are lucky enough that other players did not already kill them.
---
Yea I've had 2 crashes in the main menu - boggles the mind ü§£
---
No, the Small Backpack doesn't count.  Surprisingly.  You'd kind of think the whole point of the Small Backpack would have been to motivate sales of Backpack skins by making it easier to get.
---
Ok, but can I claim this months rewards AND the next month?
---
Well, technically, it's in the Atomic Shop and there's nothing that stops them from bringing it back.  We just haven't seen those particular outfits return.
---
I kind of think that after Wastelanders releases, we'll see a lot of this stuff come back for a bit as a new wave of players arrives.
---
Yesterday I saw about 10 radstags at the dry toxic lake on the north side of the map.
---
Nope - it doesn't go by calendar month - or goes by purchase date. 
---
So if you buy today, you have one months access and the perks for 1 month from today.
---
It's frequent enough that you should be extremely wary of taking an invite from someone completely out of the blue.
---
This also happens with encrypted.
---
What happend to your server jw?
---
I dont really play NW but I'd say the biggest scum are the a-holes who melt the legendaries in events without giving others a chance. Mainly One Violent Night and Uranium Fever. Incredibly annoying.
---
Amazing, thank you for sharing this! 
---
I have routes I use to farm for certain resources, and this will be very useful in improving my routes efficiency!
---
The real joke is trying to be a griefer while playing a critically-panned video game.
---
I don't mean that as a knock against Fallout 76, but it's kind of like "I couldn't hack it in a more popular game, so now I'm going to pick on you instead."
---
Thanks so much!  I‚Äôll hit you up after a nap!
---
Thanks!  I‚Äôll send a dm when I wake up!
---
Solid!  Thanks!
---
Shrub hugging is a strat also btw
---
Fuck. Thank you tho!
---
Isn't that how the Borg work too?
---
And Unity in Rick and Morty.
---
Seems like it's pretty common for the hive to be linked to an Individual who actually rules them.
---
That's right! I totally forgot.
---
If I remain in stealth and get my Adrenaline going, I can get my Bloodied Pipe Rifle up to about 2,800 a shot.  And that's with Rank 1 of the damage perks, Adrenaline, Mister Sandman, etc.  You can imagine, then, what max rank of all of this could pull.
---
The only reason I don't have this is because Agility is extremely tight when you're trying to do Bloodied, Stealth, *and* Pistols.  Even at 2,800, that's enough to put down pretty much every enemy in one shot.  A Colonel Gutsy can take a couple.  A Mirelurk Queen, maybe 3-5.  It's very efficient on ammo.
---
I got nuked mines a few different times recently although I am perked where that won't kill me. Someone also nuked mined me than shot me with some modded syringe which for some reason works against pacifists.
---
What system are you on?  Have done the queen countless times and only once haven't gotten the loot and rewards, because I didn't do enough damage. I didnt rush to get hits in and a bloodied meat hooker killed her in about 20 seconds after she landed. Honestly couldn't even be mad. It was pretty awesome to see lol.  I'm on PC.
---
Personally, I have nothing against adding "newer" songs to the radio.
---
I'd hazard a guess that it's got a lot to do with the divergence: Did the Beatles form after the Divergence? Did Lynyrd Skynard die in the plane crash?
---
I think part of the problem is that we haven't had maintenance for almost three weeks.  We'll have it next week with Patch 16.
---
I'm not getting crashes, but I am getting rather dubious performance with increased amounts of damage rubberbanding, the occasional super-long load screen, enemies taking a long time to spawn, etc.
---
Preparing that excavater armor drains the hell out of your resources early. I‚Äôve been dreading getting my level 45 set on my second character. There are so many perk cards to address all of this but some of it‚Äôs locked behind leveling. Luck have so many scrounger perks. Also two cards that randomly repair your armor and weapons as they get used. Not everyone uses it but I do for my melee build and it goes a long way. Agility has a card that reduces ammo making cost. Intel covers so much for repairs and sower breakdowns. White knight was game changing for me. Heck end game gives repair kits away and the raid gives you scrap bundles.
---
They should absolutely add some newer songs. It‚Äôs like listening to music from 130 years ago today. there‚Äôs all the good reasons to add music from 70‚Äôs - 90‚Äôs. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I LOVE their current playlist, they are mesmerizing. But some diversity would make it even better. Can you imagine what it feels like when the nuke goes off while the radio is playing ‚ÄòThe sun is in the east, even though the day is done‚Äô
---
Any time!
---
It‚Äôs certainly not as hot as it was before, you were probably just playing out of peak hours. But even then you tend to run across the same people.
---
I see it when stealth attacking any enemies already engaged elsewhere. I'll still hit for full stealth damage, but they heal the extra damage back.
---
Hey, stay out my stash bro
---
I think I remember VPN being against tos, so I would be very careful deciding.
---
Inconsiderate for not turning Fill Teams off?  Maybe.  Scum?  No.
---
Yeah but that should still get you the craftable from both months if there is one.
---
I'm saying no one should have access to the dev room. It spoils the game. In 600+ hours of play I've never even seen any of this content you seem to think is so readily avaiable. If I ever do, I won't buy it, I'll report it. Fuck thieves, cheaters and hackers. As far as 'Us PC folk having it easy' talk to the PC NW players about 'easy'. Hackers have pretty much ruined it for PC. Or how about the fact that my parents didn't buy my PC for Xmas like a lot of the consoles out there. I worked for it, spent twice as much as the current console price at the time, bought the parts, and built it myself. That's not entitlement, that's called knowing what you want and earning it.  Don't be jealous because I drive a gaming muscle car and you drive a bucket. Save your money and buy your own muscle car. Its an investment that will eventually pay itself off by not having to pay some BS gaming service like XBlive or PSN just to paly games you've already bought. Then you can be a cheater like the rest of them otherwise quit complaining. It's how the world works.
---
yeah i seen‚Äôt him, he be playin.
---
In case this isn‚Äôt a troll post, you can easily find out why this game is pretty much dead at the moment. Just look at the most upvoted posts around this sub and maybe check some videos on Youtube. I hope you didn‚Äôt spend much money on it.
---
Chain link would be really great! much better than white pickets..
---
It‚Äôs a glitch when your weapon deals too much damage the same doesn‚Äôt register it. It‚Äôs was a bug that was removed but they brought it back
---
Gotcha, that is pretty surprising actually. Lol. It's not too late though, idiots are everywhere.
---
I have been jumping around in private servers. I have a rad toad right now, I found a cat but it died right away. Old pets I've had sloth, 2 deathclaw, 2 rad toad, and a dog. Something I've just discovered is when you see a Mr Messenger remember that location because it's a pet spawn location.
---
If I find a radstag, and if I can find this post again I'll let you know where it was.
---
Right. They should have done a massive map wipe of scorch the second she dies. Like hive mind type shit. She dies and out of no where everyone in the map can see scorch just die instantly and not respond for a few hours.  That would be a nice touch.
---
Imagine being this upset and censoring yourself. What are you, 11?
---
You could all just grow up, it's just a game, pacifist or not pvp is part of the game and the fact is you can still be killed, just try growing a pair, it makes the game worth playing
---
Gotta share my daydream.. free range farms get snow and north pole decorations, and you have to lead red nosed brahmin along with a friendly death-santa-claws back to the north pole and battle sheep-krampus-quatch
---
I run a pipe rifle build which takes advantage of rifle and pistol perks. I can take down Beasts in a few shots. But I have low endurance so once enemies aggro like the ghouls at the golf club I gotta be careful. It's a catch 22, I can do tons of distance damage, but their rad damage especially does me in.
---
i agree, its a bummer re: hunter/hunted.  mayb if they reduced it to an global pvp opt-in flag or just a 1v1 mode?
---
They made many surprisingly backwards moves. You‚Äôd think they could sell a sht ton of shotgun skins since it was a popular weapon. Instead they nerfed shotguns next to useless before they released the long awaited shotgun skins. I haven‚Äôt run into a single shotgun user for months, those skins must be selling like hot ice creams.
---
Oh my lord please let me see your build! I would love a pipe rifle build, direct message me
---
I having similar issues.. I left the game after  it come out basically bc I had other things to do so have on just come back and didn't realise there was a passive mode, I accidentally shot a level 1016 ( I did literally 0 damage) and he one shot me and before hand I had be farming for led I had loads a hole day wasted. On another occasion someone kept knifing me over and over so I fast travelled he followed me then continued so I shot back and again got one shot I'm only lvl 37. Its getting so annoying now.
---
Someone asked to join my team while I was at my camp at Whitesprings, I declined as it seemed fishy, probably did the right thing after reading this.
---
Thou there are some quests or challenges that do require a team and if griefers remain unpunished it will kill of random people groups forming. And without that this game is shallow.
---
The multiplayer aspect is the game mechanic for the players for fun and giggles but has no relationship to Fallout lore, the two are not related, this game should be played as a sole wanderer survivor, everyone else still a pure human in this part of the country died.
---
It is possible to separate the two while playing, I take it to its proper conclusion and play solo and ignore all other players unless I visit a camp and vending machine, then I see those as outside the game story line just like the lore unrelated Atom store.
---
This is a multiplayer game of groups/teams consisting of solo lone wanderer players only interacting in the real world for fun.
---
Thank you! I had no idea this hat existed before the op post but then I had no idea where to find it. Took me just 5min to grab it.

Get concentrated fire so you can VATS heads, get the sneak and escape artist perk and get close and shoot heads.

You cant always wait around for someone to nuke the queen, but right after that event ends is the best time to get people to show up
---
There are always a bunch by my camp which is just a bit north of the flatwoods motel.
---
I choose to headcanon it as her being like the gravemind for the flood. For the scorchbeasts the plague is symbiotic, enhancing their physical abilities and giving them thralls at the costs of some of their free will. Some, but not all, as the SBs have shown themselves capable of leading scorched armies and even committing greater resources to tactically advantageous targets like the BOS's emmitters and AA guns.
---
The queen retains even more free will to coordinate the expansion of the SBs and scorched in their expansion. The queen handles all of the strategic planning and is the "brain" of the hive mind, the regular SBs are in charge of all tactical decisions and lead their thralls in battle as the "nerves" of the hivemind. Canonically when the SBQ dies, one of the other SBs eventually becomes the Queen, but in the interrum the scorched are leaderless in their invasion.
---
As to the "reign of terror" it is uncertain whether or not the BoS successfully killed **A** scorchbeasts queen when they detonated a nuke inside the glasses caverns. If they did though, the SBQ the players kill would be the queen that took over after the SB caverns got turned into the glasses caverns and successfully defeated all of the NPC factions.
---
A euro is worth more than a dollar. So yes, he is saving
---
That's what I'm wondering. Assuming damage numbers are turned on, how much are you actually doing per shot.  Based on the pip boy paper damage I should be hitting 1500 in about 5 or 6 shots. In reality though I need about 75 or more hits to actually hit the threshold based on damage numbers.  Could very well be doing enough damage like OP says though, I don't doubt Bethesdas ability to bug anything and everything haha.
---
Also wondering if op went down during the event. I've heard dying during the event can reset your progress but I've never died and been able to confirm.  I died once during the queen and that was because when I fast traveled to v9 it spawned me right on the edge of the nuke zone 5 seconds before impact.  Only time I've ever been nuked!
---
i feel u fam, but dont forget they change that ecosystem all the time.  right now the ph is all outta whack!
---
was really hopin for true private servers w/ rule-set options; that'd make life so much sweeter 4 everyone
---
Kind of I just *in my head*  take it to the level where other players don't really exist in the game world, they have no importance to me lore wise just use them for vending resources and fire power in SBQ fights.
---
unless you die in the carnage after it ends.
---
worth not taking it just in case
---
I see them there all the time, just south of the huntsman's lodge.
---
Two shot on tesla is bugged. It's not giving any bonus damage compared to a regular tesla rifle. It does shoot 2 rays at 50% damage each, but that does even less damage than a single 100% hit due to how resistance works. It also has the accuracy penalty. It's a purely negative prefix on a tesla rifle.
---
in a world where ppl jump 15 feet in the air to shoot magic exploding bullets; so much, the realism!
---
The free weekend should bring some new people, hopefully that bumps the player count enough to last until Wastelanders.
---
Saving enough for some candy, honestly what's the point when there is risk of Bethesda getting pissed. Just cough up the couple of dollars and do it normally...
---
Some people smh ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
u/cifbalsa
---
u can also "re-mark" it pip-boy quest page
---
When the user gets banned be sure they will come on here whining about it, always the victims.
---
I dont see how it effect you at all, but sure, let it bother you
---
Should be more or less the same damage output between those 2. Two shot only adds 25 percent damage, and that's assuming both shots actually hit, half the time they probably won't since two shot screws the accuracy.  Are the weapons both the same level? If so you can probably mod it to match the higher damage one.
---
Well that's good to know at this point lol, I need to track that player down and get a refund.
---
One thing I noticed later on as well was that the two shot one was actually level 40.. I feel ripped off more and more every second now
---
Seriously...
---
TS is bugged on tesla and doesn't give the extra damage bonus.
---
What I would do is wait for the double XP we get next weekend to really grind some levels out!
---
Relax bro, that's why im asking and making this post
---
Montani semper liberi
---
Unfortunately I‚Äôm not going to be able to play much that weekend so I‚Äôm just trying to make progress when I do have time. I‚Äôm like lvl 13 currently.
---
One thing you can test yourself - damage after a  bounce. Maybe there's another bug there too and after first bounce, each ray does full damage? Would still be gimmicky... But at least something...
---
Live and learn lol. After a while you intentionally have to buy things to waste caps anyways to avoid the limit anyways. You'll make 2000 back pretty quick
---
He‚Äôs missing strangler heart lol
---
Sorry what???
---
It's their end game.
---
I know I know, still feel pretty stupid about this. After all I'm already over level 100 and then this happens :D
---
We don't really have any impact in Appalachia, do we? lol
---
Yeah that's what I've gathered from all this, thanks.
---
Does it trigger Tormentor?
---
my Man you ruin it for other people with fill team who have no one t play with
---
Well at least you got that achievement.  Getting a bike dropped on me is the last thing I need for platinum.
---
I ment people with fill team on
---
Ahhh geeze shouldn't ask random people for that, there's scammers on reddit. Join a trade community and ask for a courier. There's a trade group in my post history I use a lot, should look in there and specifically ask for a courier
---
Yes it does. So I guess that part of TS extra works..
---
Thank you!

Inside The Vault, 3 days ago, old news..
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7MJVLws9DRhH6OpzAXfLde/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-update-16-highlights
---
They ruin it for others
---
Him, spoken like a true survival tryhard which only plays 76 for pvp, I couldn't really care less about some "attraction" you've set up Camden Park will always be better in IRL compared to some scrap you bunched up together but hey maybe I'll take a look, if I feel like it üòå but for now I'll keep the large amounts of BF and LS in my stash rather then having to pay caps/junk for entry
---
They did kill a queen, and had a fairly long period of no recurring scorchbeasts.
---
The problem was that they didnt keep pushing. In the few months with the queen dead, they had the opportunity to fully exterminate the scorchbeasts, but they didnt know that there could be more than one queen.
---
The only way to truly be rid of the plague is to kill *everything*, as with even 2 scorchbeasts alive they can continue to infect.
---
And the only way to be able to kill everything is to push during the brief lull while the queen is dead and the masses are leaderless.
---
And your headcanon is 100% correct. That is exactly what happens/happened. The queen is the breeder and the leader, and removing her means no decisive actions and no new scorchbeasts until another queen has fully matured. Just think of bees!
---
Naked super mutant In the genetic lab that escaped there tanks and block door ways. I think they have been lobotomized.
---
It will be nice and quick. You can trust me.
---
By the way, what methods do you use to make money? I usually gather stuff from a very secretive location and sell them, gets me the 1400 caps every vendor has combined. What else tho? Some specific events perhaps? (uranium fever?)
---
don't go to the patch, there are pumpkins behind the house. no shenanigans for you!
---
Doesn't mean there aren't loser statues there today
---
I got a Bloodied Explosive pipe pistol/rifle yesterday after reading this post and going for a 2\* instead of 3\* and I was hyped.  
---
I haven't played in a while and these used to be incredibly valuable.   
---
Anyone have an idea of recent value?
---
If they nerf the ‚Äúnoob tube‚Äù what will noobs use then?
---
I've run into a few of them randomly. Most of them have popped up in the ash heap near Welch. Came across a couple of them near Whitespring Lookout. They are tough SOB's so be careful
---
I mean, it is about a ‚Ç¨3.25/$3.60 savings.  
---
But to me, not worth the risk of breaking ToS or even the very remote chance of getting flagged for FCT violations.
---
Do they not get the caps if it‚Äôs powered off?
---
I'll pass on your offer.
---
Good info, was not aware of this. Honestly like almost all 2 shots I would have insta scripped it. 
---
This reminds me though I have a 2 shot lever which served me very well for a really long time.  Pretty much 100 percent never going back to rifleman though so I should really find it a good home.
---
I would advice not to trust just any random stranger. There are some trading communities but don‚Äôt have experience with those. 
---
I would be happy to help out if needed, also found this quite frustrating that this is not possible. I‚Äôm on PS4 and roughly in the same time zone.
---
It would definitely need another way to gain players. 1v1 might be a bit meh compared to the function it was intended to have, but I don't really see any better version of it that's not a new mode or something. Maybe if they made another way to trigger it, it could work. Would need something across servers or something similar. Definitely think it needs improvements :)
---
Their skills, if it's possible
---
Certainly, especially since most statues were erected decades after the end of the war. Texas has the most and wasn‚Äôt in the confederacy~just think it‚Äôs a weird thing to point out for West Virginia personally since I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs particularly prevalent (though I don‚Äôt know that for certain) and I think they act of separating from Virginia is a more uplifting thing to consider for the states legacy.
---
Its the most inconsistent weapon in the game to where I dont even use them anymore. Handmade is op as shit regardless and consistent. 
---
Too many times I've had to do 500 damage to a single guy for them to die with the launcher so I dont  bother with it.
---
You don‚Äôt play against noobers who play without grenadier so they can frog leg and shoot directly down and not take damage. It‚Äôs getting more common and with adrenal, tenderizer bloodied mess and demolition expert you can one shot people after the first person is down. And that‚Äôs without the explosive bobble head
---
If they're doing them monthly, yes. I subbed  like 27th Nov and got the original armor and riot paint, then a few days ago also got the new coat with the shoulder pads.
---
They took more than 30 days to give out the new coat though, anybody who subbed day 1 would have to sub for another month to claim the shoulder version.
---
Meh my set is more impressive. All I see is one atom shop paint and one quantum paint. My set at least has the bone raider excavator and the hotter rod t60
---
This has also happened to me.  There seems to be an exploit with the public events.  Others have reported the same anomaly.
---
AFK =/= Cheating. 
---
Find some friends to play with if you want to team up. Grouping with a random AFKer isn‚Äôt any different than grouping with a random that dies in the first minute of the game.
---
Weird, nobody said to server hop west tek for gear, but there's a uranium fever recommendation. I'll add that you should launch nukes and solo the sbq, best way to get gear at level 28 imho
---
The sad part is joining up with random players can  be a really fun way to make friends in the game and those of us that have been playing a lot have been jaded to it because of griefers. Honestly, if they just tweaked the PvP settings for teammates and made camp modifications by other players able to be turned off it would fix this issue.
---
You probably take a couple shots at the queen then hide cause your build is utter shit
---
Honestly don't even try to hit 1400 anymore because I'm perpetually near the cap limit. I used to server hop at Brim Quarry though, picking up combat rifles, combat shotguns and double barrels to sell. There are definitely better places though. Also selling water, even with only 2 small purifiers at my camp I can easily do about 400 caps worth of water in a day.
---
Right now most of my caps come from my vending machines and selling chems and water to vendor bots. I'm almost at 30000 once again. I've been buying mod plans I don't need for power armors I  never even use just to sink caps.  Time to buy another I suppose.  What I really need to do is set up a mule to transfer caps over to but I'm too lazy.  Maybe with the double xp coming up I'll finally get around to it....
---
Eh when your told by snobby high levels you ain't got nothing they want you refrain from selling, seeing your title üòí the smile at the end appeared suspicious as if was some store that rad traps those that want to shop only to steal junk and serverhop, had that happened once, person must've changed their name turns out they were a community scammer. Had no idea I don't pay attention to trade communities I play for fun not marketing and usually receive trending hate notifications about how "big bad Bethesda" so evilll and cruel, you get those notifications as well I bet, it's annoying unless your apart of the 76 hate train then it's normal for ya
---
so it's actually beneficial to buy it at the end of month?
---
Your welcome Is it just the weapons your after or the garb too?
---
If you kill shit it won't see you either
---
The world IS empty. All you'll really meet is robots and players. And the most that players will usually do is wave. Sometimes you'll come across player build bases (Camps), but they're usually gravity defying monstrosities that you just use to scrap and store some items, maybe do some repairs, before moving on.
---
‚ÄúI would advise not to trust a random stranger...
---
But me, a random stranger, will do it for you‚Äù
---
Lmao
---
Perhaps he meant the hardened masses (or whatever it is that shows as junk)
---
I wish they would eliminate pvp.  I hate it so much
---
What are you on about?
---
Thank you.  I guess I already did it, and didn't realize it changed, lol

Hmm, maybe. Or the stable flux that drops from him.

Definitely, this is supposed to be Fallout not Edward Scissorhands

Yes, please keep the market for B2525 going even higher
---
Fixer is higher DPS, Handmade has a larger max clip and I think is slightly easier to control, It is a trade-off.
---
I bought my French pc version for 8‚Ç¨,needed a vpn just to activate the game from russia in the launcher.

I think they should work on server stability and live it at 24 or expand it.

Its how my whole cap dilemma came to be, not the worst problem to have though lol.  Now though 90 percent of my income has been selling all the crap I stuffed in my stash thinking "I will use this later".  That mindset led to a full stash.  I've been selling tons of plans because I sell them really cheap unlike a lot of vendors I've visited.  I can't believe all the times I've seen people selling ultracite armor part plans, not even mods, for 100s of caps each.  Does anyone actually buy them? I tried selling them for 9 caps each and sold exactly 2, finally dropped them all at a train station recently.  They drop like candy from the queen and you get them for free doing the story anyways so why do people think they'll sell for 500?
---
Unless it's a super rare plan I price them around 5-25 caps depending on the rarity and usefulness.  Recipes I tend not to bother with unless they are rare, those don't seem to move well.
---
Sadly I think the boat for new music has sailed.  However if you use the music services like Spotify there are some excellent playlists people have created for using as a background radio, including most every song from past games.  Though I like my own mix as I‚Äôve found CCR to be a personal favorite addition.
---
Best damage I do while not going bloody or stealth either is with heavy weapons and armor pen. Stuff like gattling guns, minigun, 50 cal, etc. Get a good heavy weapon with decent mag size, good fire rate, and legendary with armor pen prefered and/or use armor pen perks. Add the heavy guns damage perks, bear arms to reduce weight, power armor to up your defense, and you can mow down hordes of ghouls pretty well.
---
My personal fave is heavy weapons/melee. I have a really decent 3 star super sledge that has junky on it. Combine 5 addictions does 50% more damage, and there is a perk for melee armor pen too. My gatling plasma and melee build is a beast on most SBs. Regular ones I take down in about 30 seconds. SBQs I can solo, but takes more like 20-30 minutes and lots of ammo. Still fun through.
---
Be sure to watch out for the 5 cap bounty guy. I encountered such a person that was obviously attempting to get me to attack/hunt him when he blew up the cars around me at the Whitesprings. I just ignored him because I already saw him traveling around with 3 other much higher level people and they just "coincidentally" happened to be near said bounty guy.
---
Thank you. I'll pass this along to her!!
---
Add me! LostInAwe
---
whats the reason behind getting a ban if you use VPN?
---
They get the caps, but if the purchase puts them over the 30k cap limit, the overage is lost.
---
Just think, if you had offered just a little bit more..  I hope you ended up getting one.
---
not everyones super rich friend :(
---
finding people who want to interact is a challenge because the social side of the game is lacking.  Hopefully they will improve that.

Honestly, it is one of the main reasons I signed up for the subscription. I signed up for a year.

I've heard of people doing this with other games but when they do it the game doesn't work because they bought a version for a different region than there account

Sheesh really-I need to refresh on all that. For some reason I thought they were one of the states under contention that ultimately went union despite people moving there to make it confederate. Thanks for the correction and I‚Äôll update my comment
---
Anchovy and garlic, please.
---
Yea I fell victim to this last week. I was level 30 and thought they were friendly,  they invited me to a group, both fast traveled to my base and started fighting. They started a lot of damage on my first floor. I caught on what was happening pretty quick and closed my app a few seconds after they started the destruction. Came back and had a few walls destroyed, nothing to bad.
---
I feel the main reason the price jumps exponentially is because of the exact reasoning in this post. A lot of people have the 2 star version, or maybe a 3 star with a crappy 3rd effect of the gun they want. So when everyone is trying to upgrade from that to a better 3star version, a bidding war breaks out and people start throwing stupid amounts of caps or trades trying to get it. partly because a perfect rolled 3rd is still kind of rare, despite all the duping going on. Then comes along another guy with the exact same roll, sees how much that one went for and wont take anything less then that. Were basically driving up inflation because were all impatient as shit. Lol. I cant say much though, ive been guilty of overpaying beyond market value just to get my hands on a few items ive been searching for. The longer the trade market is operational, the higher prices are going to go.
---
On private servers.

Not sure about that, but I've had multiple times running into people with unlimited health &amp; one hit killing me. But they always had another person with them and the unlimited health person always had a bounty on them. This also happened to me not too long ago, I went to go trade with someone, and we were trading. I saw in the background someone tried smacking me so I went off, tried smacking him back and I died instantly but exploding bullets from who knows where. So I respawned and saw there were two hostiles. The non cheating guy was pretty easy to kill but everytime I got even near the other guy he one shot killed me so I was thinking hmm, there has to be a way &amp; thought I was just sucking that I couldn't hit him. So he was distracted trying to kill someone else so I snuck up behind him and started shooting him with my explosive rounds, I saw his health drop all the way to 1HP like some of those enemies that sometimes can't die, and he didn't die at all. That's when I knew it was another exploiting idiot that can't play the game normal. Lost about 500 caps because I wanted revenge when all that time I couldn't even kill him. If you wanna go kill players go join nuclear winter, not free mode üò∑
---
Yeah for sure
---
I love to attack and grief people
---
I've done it successfully for a second account by activating an European cd key despite living in North America.
---
It happens a lot!  Only solution I found (albeit temporary) was to delete the game and reinstall. You can try to rebuild your database first and hope it helps
---
people let 5 year olds play fallout 76 and join clans??
---
I can craft you some bolts if you got the flux
---
Awsome. Glad your sorted just sorry I couldn't be on any faster
---
This. Would. Be. **AMAZING!!!!**
---
This game is a disaster
---
U still doin this @7
---
In a span of two months no nothing has really changed that Sparks any real interest.
---
Or when you get the loot, and happily stand around wondering if another nuke is going to be launched, and don't realize that you're near death...and then something kills you and someone stands next to you until you depart so they can steal your flux.
---
Combat rifle has best AP usage. It's a bit shaky if you're going ads... But ffr should let you put enough out to kill.
---
If you're gonna vats crit savy/high luck will net you a crit every 4 or 5 shots. Just hold space and let her rip.
---
Also if you're going pvp you can safely ditch silencer. They are going to know where you are and combat is fast. Keep the range.
---
I mainly wanted to come back for Christmas and decorate and play but I‚Äôll get on do that and then be bored out of my mind
---
Tell that to the one shooting you in the face.
---
Besides, they never bathe.
---
honestly not everyone experiences these bugs. My Gamestop managers claims is crashes every time he plays and mine nearly never does, not more than any other game ever has on a fluke. And I Just love wandering an shaving no one tell me what I have to do. I like taking photos and collecting shit and sometimes killing. But I def do not have the problems the you tube haters tased about. never.
---
Yea no Christmas stuff in yet either unless you had stuff from last year. Honestly I hope this just means they are putting effort into making wastelanders good.
---
Could just be wishful thinking but we'll find out soon enough.
---
Probably different grades. I've noticed different pieces can have similar damage/energy resistance even though they're the same level but might be sturdy/light or heavy. 
---
And leather armor does get bulkier as the grade increases.
---
I feel it is... you get the equivalent and a lil more in caps I believe.  That in itself was enough for me.
---
Well said. I fail more then i dont. Cause people are clueless
---
That...would be epic.
---
I mean, even if they respawned in a few minutes.
---
In atoms I mean.
---
I was playing ESO on the side but then I started a new job so I haven‚Äôt been playing anything but thought fo76 would be better to play bc I already have everything I‚Äôd want but I want something new to do. A goal to achieve
---
Sure am üëç
---
It's tricky. Here's how it works: 
---
Person A and B are friends with each other, but make sure not to be on a team together. They're talking via Discord or PS4 party or whatever. They fire some shots at one another so they count as hostile to one another, but not enough to kill. 
---
Person A then invites Person C (like OP here) into a team. Person C is now hostile to Person B because they're on a team with someone who's hostile to them. Person B then open fires on Person C and kills them. Person B may in fact be on a team with three other people who are in on the scam who will join in on this ambush. 
---
Person A is essentially a honeypot, meant to lure in the unexpecting and trusting.

I tweaked your build so it would work better for me.  Personally I would swap out Rifleman for Commando and stock up on 5.56.  Lots of power in vats criticals, so the more luck the better.  I use a bloodied build with Unyeilding armor, at least one armor piece should have AP Refresh.  The idea with this build is ‚Äúdon‚Äôt get hit.‚Äù   Kill them before they can hit you.  In close quarters, like Wes Tek, put in rank 3 of Serendipity to avoid taking damage.  
---
Perks like green thumb, lock pick, and hard bargain are just temporary installs when you need them.  Then take them back down and install your damage perks.
---
If you still need help hmu @songya-
---
I run them a bunch by myself, could use a second person to be faster too.
---
Sounds sooopo stupid hahaha, well avoiding group invites now
---
Update: at 5:30am I was finally
---
My condolences
---
They should have had another scorch strong hold that with the only way to loot it would be to kill the SQ and make all the guards  instantly die. Like you killed the queen go look this base for extra rewards and some lore that plays into getting ready for wastelanders. Like a radion station  guarded like hell and after you beat rhe sq you go and send a radio signal stating peace in Appalachia.
---
&gt;Grouping with a random AFKer isn‚Äôt any different than grouping with a random that dies in the first minute of the game.
---
... who charges right into the middle of a combat zone instead of safely hiding in a bush. üòÅ
---
There are some unkillable enemies, but I've never seen where they regenerate HP unless it's a legendary.
---
Sweet, your GT dragonshoulder7 ?
---
Note: If you get killed following a Queen battle, your flux just goes away.  No one can loot it.   This was supposed to cut down on the problem your having.  I guess without PvP in the game some players are looking for any way to get it back in.
---
If they did manage to morph all scorched at least in the bog, back into ghouls, thatd be cool. Like, since NPCs are almost here that gives a chance that the rational ghouls could be what happens to scorched on a lore basis, since they‚Äôre basically ghouls that cab‚Äôt talk now, itd be a great end game hame situation to be at the drop site, and watch the scorched all fall down and get up as those talking, articulative ghouls that can be like ‚Äòergh ugh wtf happened one of us? Whats that mean?‚Äô
---
Both of my characters sometimes act as stealth shotgunners, but it's true that they offer little benefit over other alternatives, unless you need cripples.  Enforcer is still easily the best perk for crippling limbs, and that has its niche applications, like in the Vault Raids.
---
Sometimes new people are weary of high levels meeting them early on.  I‚Äôm only lvl 148 but I was trying to give a lvl 2 some armor and plans.  But they wouldn‚Äôt come near me.  I waved and motioned for them to follow but they just weren‚Äôt ready yet.  
---
I left my paper bag there. I hope they took it when I left.
---
Yes as long as you know the mod for whatever type of armor ...marine,metal,leather..etc
---
Yes that would be the best. I‚Äôve just lost faith in it ever being that stable
---
There‚Äôs a large monument in Philippi to the remarkably fast victory of Union troops over the Confederate holders of the town. The retreat of the Confederate troops was so swift it was referred to as the Philippi Races. Great little museum there too, with mummies!
---
I spent ten days doing a ‚Äò76 tour of WV and saw fewer loser flags there than in my own librul home state. People were amazingly nice and the only backlash I got as a tourist was from a guy from Florida who cracked comments about my librul state and dems in general. WV was far more welcoming than expected and we went well off the beaten path in search of map markers. 10/10 would set up my C.A.M.P. there again.
---
Yeah I actually combat shotgun for that reason too. I rarely ever get killed by noobers but I still think they‚Äôre op
---
Yes you can. If you are on PS4 I will be happy to help
---
I have killed enough Queens to know mankind is doomed. They breed faster than I can log in and play. At least Kevin Bacon knew that killing that last fat worm would grant him a break.
---
The regenerating bug, making shotguns useless since...
---
upvote for being the only person on reddit, hell, in the fucking world, to admit a mistake.
---
i just got fallout 76 and when i figure out how adding works ill make sure to contact you
---
literally just got it cause of your comment :D
---
Sometimes there are daily challenges for atoms that require you to complete 10 quests in a group.  
---
If you‚Äôre someone like me, without friends on PS4, you shoot out some random invites to complete those quests real quick.
---
Yeh, stable fluxes that I earn killing the queen. Every time I die immediately after the event, they just disappear, and I'm not the only, other people saw this. It's weird that it happens at someone and doesn't happen at someone else :)
---
I wouldn't trade Unyielding for Bolstering, but Vanguard's is good for not Bloodied builds.
---
It‚Äôll perk back up with double exp next week.
---
I love the pipe revolvers.   My quad explosive makes for a fun secondary weapon to a bloodied handmade.  I think you‚Äôll find,however, that a lever action is a much better choice as a primary weapon.  
---
I came across a bloodied explosive pipe-bolt.  With the right combination of health and perks I‚Äôve seen the pip boy damage over 750 on that thing.  Adrenaline just pushes it higher.  So they have the potential for big damage numbers, it just takes the right gun and perks.
---
How do I rebuild the database? Sounds complicated.
---
I think its Florescent happy to pay for the flux the going rate, thanks for the offer are you PC?
---
Wondered the same thing myself, and yep it works.
---
But what we relay need is extra deep pocketed legendary armour. :)
---
I haven't failed a single SBQ for months. And I haven't completed it in more than 10 minutes with randoms.
---
Pretty much, yeah.
---
Idk why people are down voting a question
---
If you have everything you want rn, there's nothing else to do. Play other games, like most of us do until Wastelanders.
---
Even with not having to go over to it, the fissure is still close enough to the house to bring the beasts over. Got stuck in a hell of a battle there my first visit.
---
I mentioned something like this the other day and someone called me a liar and an asshole and that this game is perfect and if it wasn‚Äôt i wouldn‚Äôt play, so therefore I‚Äôm a liar. Meanwhile i just got the plat trophy the other day
---
Yep, doesn't make sense if you bought it.
---
Quite a few people have reported this, and so far Customer Support hasn't been able to help. 
---
I guess you will have to reinstall the game.
---
&gt; Just kind of wondering where everybody is?
---
Dead.  Welcome to the aftermath of a nuclear war.
---
IMO, outside of the area around Fissure Site Prime, the Pumpkin House is arguably the most dangerous area in the overworld.
---
Some of us play along side our children, like i said its more a huge family, so we care about whats said in responce to eachothers fillings.
---
Use a 50 cal f ffr. The gat is all dupes.
---
They just disappear, it happens on private world too (empty), maybe mysterious savior steal it üòÇ
---
I‚Äôd love so credits to roll a la NES.
---
It's a bug.  Supposedly they fixed it in the last patch, but I've noticed zero improvement.
---
On the PC side at least I seldom get disconnects now.  I have a suspicion that FO76 is very sensitive to network conditions, I am on a very good fiber connection in a University town with solid internet back bone and have always had fewer issues than others.
---
I use rejuvenated. The faster your ap comes back the better
---
Bethesda should have created pre SBQ servers and post SQB servers that track world progress so you could see the hold the scorched had slowly die. They could have used that to give rise to a new faction/ boss. It would also make more incentive to make new characters.
---
Ah yeah sorry bro, I gotta pump up my game with my BEFFR lv 50 modded duped ultracite legacy junkies unyielding VATS crit stealth instigating Marsupial all perks, stacked bobbleheads Vault 94 Shovel build.
---
Actually, some of us play for fun.
---
Did you see the Teapot?
---
Okay I‚Äôll try that and see if it works. Thanks!
---
Get a powerplant, repair it and farm them at the workshop.
---
Your bullet points are half knowledge, half myth. Success depends on enough players doing enough damage. 
---
Yesterday I lost one of the worst, most gruesome battles against the queen I have ever had. My stealth rifleman was hitting her for about 150-200 and killing everything else with a single shot. Sure, some low levels were being fucked, but the fight threw two deathclaws, three mirelurk Queens AT THE FUCKING SAME TIME, six Kings, ten Yao guai, some honeybeasts, FOUR extra legendary scorchbeasts one after the other and hundreds of scorched. I must have killed 100-150 minions myself. I broke my lever action in the process. It was impossible. The heavy hitter on my team (bloodied unarmed unyielding) and myself stayed through the battle, but it was obvious we were going to lose. It even felt bugged, like something was wrong.
---
You cripple her, she lands more often, whatever you do. You glitch her in the air, she doesn't. The rest is myth. Sometimes, you are lucky and the fight goes smoother.
---
Ya but I don't have any florescent. Got everything else tho. If you find some or trade for it hit me up. You get 72 bolts per with ammo smith
---
It‚Äôs actually not hard. Just google it. I don‚Äôt remember how it was done and I‚Äôm technologically challenged. Lol
---
Your mom is a disaster.
---
Need anything hmu friend. I hope you injoy your time in Appalachia!
---
Ok thanks will do
---
I know you can craft them, but I don‚Äôt run PA very often, so I‚Äôm not sure what materials you need or even which bench to use (I think it‚Äôs tinkers).
---
How'd you know?
---
You can do it all. I seen that a lot of guys shoot her in the air. We keep on the adds and talk shit about it on team, but what can you do. When she does land, keep her on the ground using one gun, tormentor, enforcer, whatever. Ignore the adds when she's landed.
---
Claim all 3 PowerPlants and collect from the fusion generator every 15/20 min and you‚Äôll have over 20 in n hr
---
Because the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
---
It‚Äôs fine! Thanks for offering!
---
Can only sell via an exploit so those people are pieces of shit and would have eventually exploited some other way if they weren't already exploiters
---
Thank you for your help Mark!
---
Right first of i dint mean anything bad its just i have had bad experiences this was made after a said indecent i dint mean anything ok sorry
---
Guess I‚Äôm gonna go on Minecraft and kill myself
---
When you go green, you never go back
---
So my experience was that I encountered enemy‚Äôs level 40 and above almost in any location i went trough when I played on regular servers. I got killed often my armor broke as well as my weapons and I got frustrated. After a while a joined a friend on his server he was the same level as me about 25-30  as I progressed the main quest with him all enemy‚Äôs were roughly on the same level as we were most difference was ~5 level. So guess is that high level player who roam an loot trigger high level encounters.
---
Lol I know right!! Like I was hoping to trade my anti-armor bear for the bloodied version and then the next day I get it to drop!!
---
You will probably have more fun than in F76 anyway.
---
The worse one I had was when a rad storm struck SBQ, wiped out none PA players who then respawned in rad zone and looped dying..
---
I like to eat apple
---
You are right about that. Idek know why I try to give the game multiple chances to steal my money and time
---
Sorry like i say i dint mean anything by it i was just venting
---
I was in a fight where we defeated her and I think she landed once briefly. I have a zealots explosive primed lmg, at least two other guys looked like they were using bloodied explosive gatling's. You could literally watch the health just melt off.
---
It helped that there was only about eight of us so I'm sure her defensive Buffs went that high.
---
yeah thanks everyone, i‚Äôve triple checked and even crafted new identical versions of each, and it still happens. 
---
maybe you‚Äôre right though and i‚Äôm just missing something. i guess i‚Äôd throw my lot in with the folks asking for a new way to manage grades of armor, even on found pieces. there have been threads (har har) about this lately..
---
thanks for the feedback!
---
Just join the Free Range event.
---
Yes, I run heavy leather for high ED, with 4x vanguard pieces and 1x chameleon I have over 500 ED
---
[deleted]
---
Like the others have said, claim one of the nuclear power plants, Poseidon is easiest, and do the Powering up quest
---
Alternatively, you can just build a fusion generator which will provide the 100 power needed for the machine that makes fusion cores
---
It will make 8/hour and it will hold 3 before it's "full" :)
---
Use the Contractor perk to reduce the build costs, and you're good to go
---
me too :)
---
In nw I use lifegiver and dodgy. If you mean in adventure, neither.. Sbs makes optimum perks irrelevant really.
---
Get a power plant. Farm them. Or buy them from other players.
---
No, you probably don‚Äôt act like an npc do you? If you don‚Äôt, why do you expect others to
---
Couple questions...What level is he?  Is he trying to run the silo on his own?
---
Take over Poseiden Energy plant....hook a fusion generator to the fusion core producer...You get, I believe, 12 cores per hour.
---
That 'tweet tweet' noise isn't a bird.
---
Yes i know, you can have better DR than in PA, but it doesnt seem to make a big difference for me, I take almost the same damage than without the vanguard effect.
---
Weight reduction pieces do the trick.
---
Are you running a bloodied build or a health build?  You are talking about 2 completely different sets of armor with different attributes.
---
Nah. I‚Äôm on Xbox.
---
Easier to get them from the Nuke Plants.
---
Yeah those e gats man.. Nice though
---
Some people sell them very reasonably in their shops.  These are some of the best people on the planet.
---
Because you had hope, like many of us. But now that's difficult.
---
To add to that, Covert Operative (Agi) can boost your silenced stealth crits multiplier to 2.5, and if you combine that with Mister Sandman (Agi) you can get a crit multiplier as high as 3.75 at night. Throw in Nerd Rage (Int) for even more damage at low health and Concentrated Fire (Per) to make sure you land those headshots every time, and you're looking at a truly nasty stealth kill machine.
---
Yeah, but this is game logic, not real world physics. :)
---
It is amazing, though, when you think of sand being turned to glass by the heat... but water diffuses the heat so quickly that it doesn‚Äôt vaporize. 
---
Physics is weird.
---
Step on him! Over and over!
---
What do you think of sea of thieves
---
Yeah that makes sense pc and fiber connection haha. That‚Äôs good stuff. I have only 80mbps wireless connection on a PS4 pro. Not nearly as good but better than some.
---
Yeah... we don‚Äôt want our Xboxes becoming a fire hazard!
---
I was thinking about the rivers that come down off the mountains in the S/SE portion of the map. They do a reasonable job of simulating flow, without actually using the real world physics of flowing water.
---
On a related note!
---
If I'm looting something, please don't make the loot window disappear when someone runs in front of me.
---
I haven't played it, tbh. I'm more into FPS games.
---
Uhhh... bottom right corner of the map? SE of Watoga? Isn‚Äôt that called the Mire...?
---
I made a post about it a week or so ago. Coulda been me. 
---
It only works on the Urban version. It has 2 "No Paint" options and the bottom option will give it the Forest paint. It wont actually show the change on the armor piece while still in the workbench but once you back out you'll see the change.
---
Plus when you spam the pickup button and the map displays multiple times because it doesn't remove from the corpse fast enough.
---
pls answer
---
Hello, that's me. I usually sell fully charged cores for 9 to 29 caps depending on how quickly I need to get rid of them. 
---
I've found that killing Sentry Bots is an excellent way to get full or mostly full fusion cores. Also, Line In The Sand usually awards two full cores.
---
Absolutely.  Legendary effects have no impact on the mods you can apply.
---
Don't tell you mom.   Or do tell her, but don't tell us.
---
weight reduction pieces with unyielding....If you are over cumbered and need out of a jamb slap on some junk unyielding pieces and drop your health below 20%...Your carry weight should be over 400....My full set of unyielding with 12 in strength nets me 525 carry weight with a couple deep pockets and backpack
---
My head cannon shoots head cannon balls.
---
everyone mentioned powerplants so il go kill based.  my go to spot is __98 NAR__ (derailed train north of whitesprings on map)
---
server hop a few times for a mostly full core from a level 30 sentry bot.
---
They had a good idea and then limited a big map to like 20 players on top of not letting you choose what server you play on and to this day there is no text chat. There is no permanence in anything you do or the people you meet.
---
Hmm. Good question. 
---
Nukes don‚Äôt ACTUALLY vaporize bodies of water.... so we are working in ‚Äúgame reality‚Äù here rather than REALITY reality. 
---
So maybe the nukes part of the lake would vaporize, and all the other water would rush in to fill it back up?
---
I don't  blame people; unless someone teaches, one doesn't learn since the game have no explanation about that fight's mechanics...
---
... and most people have  no patience to teach.
---
I play since the game launched and that's the first time I saw someone saying we should NOT shot to make her land. (thank you, btw)m
---
LOVE IT.
---
Oh wow I didn‚Äôt know the flux just disappears
---
Hey hey keep it under your hat I don‚Äôt want to be banned
---
No, that's the Cranberry Bog.  The area north of that is called the Mire.  The area you see in pinkish red is the Bog.
---
Had this happen to me just the other day. Some dork in PA drew her into the storm and got her stunned. Well, with radsheild, I only take 14 rad per second, but its a fight, especially being a bloody build. Lol. Still managed to whoop her ass, but died right as killing blow was stuck and I didnt get credit for the fight.... I was pissed.
---
What's your ign? Found a few and made 430 bolts. That should get you started
---
I did see someone the other day throwing mines toward players at white springs the other day.
---
Not really sure about that, mine seem to kill everything just fine, maybe they just didn't get the memo.  Maybe it's not as much of an issue for PC?  Not really sure because I see people saying this all the time on here but in my experience it happens just as much if not more with harpoon guns and other really high damage weapons.
---
 I get the bug once maybe every 100 enemies or so and only for one shot then they go down like normal.
---
Super weird.
---
Ohhh. Well that could be it then. Idk of teammates had it on or off.
---
Derp. I‚Äôm gonna go hide under the covers now....
---
Thats fab IGN Whacky tadpole, wont be on untill later as im at work. Will 1K cover it?
---
Gotta have Hancock‚Äôs coat/hat too
---
Bloodied hvy gunner here. Don't stand on top of shit is totally true. People not being able to kill her surprises me nowadays. About half the time the sbq is done in under 3min, what with the dcg/meathook crews. I can solo her in about 8to10 min. Me and my one other bloody buddy have salvaged many a clusterfork!
---
I use both a long-scoped Fixer and long-scoped Handmade for sniper-like shots, and they work well. Both have Suppressors and Powerful Automatic Receivers.
---
It also depends upon the elevation where the bomb is triggered.  They do the nukes higher in the atmosphere so it's more about secondary effects -- the shock wave and heat flash.  This also makes for far less nuclear fallout.  If the nuclear reaction itself interacts with surface materials, those get burned up into the cloud and comes back as fallout, which is where most of the longer-term problems come from.
---
No worries. Traded some yellow for it. I don't even know what that stuff is for I never use it.
---
Wonder where the Right is ....
---
I wish you were on ps4, so I could trade my entire account, car and house for that.
---
The PvP wouldn't be so bad if it was limited to hunter hunted and duels with nothing to gain except experience. 
---
I just don't bother with it because anymore it's just exploits for the purpose of gain half the time.
---
Also for you traders out there keep your pacifist on because Bethesda decided change tab=melee so people use that by backing out of trade immediately.
---
Have seen some players make toons specifically for grieving the griefers though. Just dump your caps in the nearest vendor and go to town.
---
I'm just going use that as my personal lore when they do just up and die around me for no reason. I went into the hospital, heard and saw all the scorched. Then every single one of them just up and died for no reason. That wasn't the first or last time that happened.
---
They definitely do. My brother used an auto controller on ps4 as well as the fps dominator
---
This is awesome and a great use of camp building I commend you for your efforts and success
---
bluejelly101 :) I made the switch from ps4 as well and play often
---
Today? That has been a Tuesday since launch.
---
I get what your saying, but if you stagger her in the air, and let's face it, 90% of the novice players (myself included until about a month ago when my mistakes were pointed out to me) have perks that increast the chance to stagger, she will not land. She just flies off and comes back to blast you with her sonic farts. I agree that luck plays a huge roll in it, but 20k rounds and her health not moving 1/16 of an inch is ridiculous...
---
It should be for people who want to increase immersion in the world by removing the floating text over everyone's head altogether.   
---
As it is not what you have suggested is the only even remotely reasonable usage of the feature I can imagine, and even then why?
---
Thanks so much - appreciate your kind words.
---
Server hop at waatoga and take fusion cores out of the power armor chassis , there's like 3 per hop each at 25 percent , use the power user perk to lower the drain rate and server hop like 5 times and u good to go only takes like 10 minutes
---
Hmm I was looking at one can u be banned for it
---
this
---
Mine is Deathclay_Sparky :)
---
Ok, well I missed that, others may have too.  What's the problem?
---
Lol. Totally agree. I can‚Äôt seem to spam the ‚Äútake‚Äù option fast enough.
---
Are you on ps4
---
You recieve your atoms 2-3 days after your renewal. Plus the renewal is set to 30 days, not a monthly date.
---
Don't worry, the new queen who looks surprisingly like the old one will be back in 20 minutes, or 3 minutes later if Bethesda keeps turning a blind eye to the people who glitch the silos.
---
It can take up to 3 days i have read, but i got mine on time.
---
So that means most of the higher levels are just griefers? Sorry, I do not mean to troll nor anything, I don‚Äôt actually own the game, *yet* - but I‚Äôve been debating if I should get it or not, I‚Äôm a Fallout series fan.
---
&gt;How do the griefers use it specifically to harass players?
---
crashing players out by locking the game up with say a tse minigun or something similar. (causing stupid amounts of particle effects)
---
&gt;Have you seen it?
---
yes, one of my friends has both items above and has crashed people out at queens before (not on purpose, unlike griefers)
---
Probably not. I don't think they can detect it. The most they can probably do is put a cap on how fast your fire rate can be. The FPS dominator can give a pretty good advantage as you can set it to offset recoil. I'm also quite sure people are using the adaptor that allows keyboard and mouse on PS4
---
Use melee and remember, Death is hardly a punishment!
---
Ah right, that makes sense. Yea i know it's not a monthly date specifically.
---
For all the talk about how friendly the community is there sure are a ton of assholes in it in game.
---
True. If she would truly be terrorizing, she would leave that fissure every once in a while to destroy the newly built settlements, turn yours settlers into the Scorched, kidnap people etc. as a part of new side quests. We ourselves should be able to down to the underground world, sneaking past the sleeping scorchbeasts in large subterranean caverns, planting charges that would collapse the caves, disabling the beasts from spawning in a given area, which in turn would make it an open spot for new traders and settlers to arrive.

Let's not forget:
---
*You must rebuild. Not just walls, not just buildings, but hearts and minds. And ultimately America itself.*
---
Nice one, thanks for the info.
---
What platform are you on?
---
On the road leading to Robco, a destroyed sentry bot can be found among the semis, so there's one free fusion core...
---
Oh, that was stepped on a long time ago ü§£üòÇüòú
---
Well I suppose imma give it a try I think imma buy a custom one online
---
Ah yes like the scorchbeast with a 5 bullets and some screws
---
Assault Rifle is the worst rifle in this game hands down. Sad because it was a beast in FO4.
---
I hit for 84 per shot(headshot) with an LMG and high 60's with a body shot
---
I had a similar experience in regards to almost losing the battle, but clutching the win in the end. 
---
I was on my shotgun build, so keeping her on the ground wasnt an issue. I wasnt doing much damage to her because, well shotguns are kinda shit, but i was mostly focusing on crippling incoming adds, and pelting the queen a few times in between to keep her grounded. We were about 20 mins into the battle and only had her 1/3 of the way into her first health bar. I had 5 people show up, all lvl 50 or lower. I was trying to be hopeful and thought we could win. Havnt lost a SBQ event in over 6 months. At the 20 min mark, everyone just bailed besides a lvl 30. I wrote his name down, went to the main screen and switched characters (heavy gunner). Joined back in off the guys name and spawned in at the event luckily enough. I pulled out my primed JFFR LMG and started laying into her. He immediately seen that i was just chewing threw her HP, and started protecting me from the adds. Killed her with 2mins to spare. At the end i gave the lvl 30 all my event rewards as a thank you for persevering the event with me. We exchanged heart emotes and went on with our day. Honestly probably one of my most fond SBQ memories to date despite having such a shit show of teammates join in.
---
Hmmm I can't seem to add you
---
Oh type my bad Deathclaw_Sparky
---
I think my gause rifle with bonus damage to scorch does like 40ish damage to queen. Been a little while. My handmade however only hits for like 10 damage
---
Played with it a bit today and found it better than the combat rifle.
---
But yes the handheld does seem to have the edge, which is a shame as I prefer using the other two.
---
Also, the main villain doesn't always have to be the Scorchbeasts... ;)

No, no, no. These griefers are rare and unpleasant. I've played for over 1000 hours and I've never encountered this sort of thing and I've only spoken to two people directly who have. This sort of thing is happily quite rare. I think that the fact that they recently closed down the "survival mode" which was pure PVP has kind of pushed these trolls back into adventure mode with the rest of us and now they're trying to find new ways to be troublesome is all.
---
She has a flat 70% damage reduction plus a shitload of armor(300 DR and 300 ER), what you see is what you get.
---
There we go :)
---
I did not see the teapot. We covered a lot of ground in 10 days: Harpers Ferry, climbed Seneca Rocks, Blackwater Falls, Monongahela, Dolly Sods, the Cranberry Bog, Philippi, Grafton and Tygart lake (there was, in fact, a parade in Grafton), Morgantown, Flatwoods/Sutton, Helvetia (omg omg so cute) Charleston, Point Pleasant, Mothman Museum, abandoned tnt domes, Hillbilly Hotdogs, the Greenbrier inside and out (we stayed in one of the cottages two doors up from the Presidential cottage- on right as you enter from the RR station), and bunker tour. It was amazing and there‚Äôs so much I want to go back and see more of.
---
Untill you find something you like, just get the first rank of some of the dmg cards, so you have flexibility.
---
When you can get enforcer perk (agi) its a good one, even with no other shotgun perks you can break a deathclaws legs and arms then go punch it to death with your bare fist. Horde of ghouls chasing you, bust out a combat shottys, blast there legs and slow down their charge
---
Or they all frenzy and attack everything indiscriminately.
---
I'd like them to all just start attacking each other as the queens hivemind is gone
---
Yeah, but what happens if you log into a pacifist server and just turn it off? Or vise versa?
---
And TALA, forgot TALA (fort defiance)
---
You're most welcome. Just plink her to keep her interested and clear the ground. The quicker you get rid of her minions (it seems like to me) the quicker she lands. I noticed when I did my last solo, she'd just keep flying around and I finally found a scorched hiding behind a tree. Killed it and almost immediatelly heard the "thwump" right behind me. Lol. Might be nothing to it, but I plan on testing this out some more later!! Good luck!!!
---
Don't forget the wrapped and torn shirts from nuka world
---
i personally get most of mine from player vending machines. but i only pay 1 cap per 1% on the core.. or less. i'm not paying 168 for a 2% charged core.
---
That sounds like a great tour!!!!  WV has a special place in my heart. I love that state. I have family in the Seneca Rocks area. It is so beautiful there.
---
WELCOME!!
---
Try the filthycasuals sub, too.
---
It will often depend on your server.  And, the longer you play, the more you run into folk.
---
I can‚Äôt even loot the queen. Killed her twice the other day and got nothing each time.
---
The stealth commando gets its damage multipliers from sneak attacks.  So Sneak, Escape Artist, and Covert Ops are the obvious perks.  If you can run low health Nerd Rage and the Adrenal mutation add lots of damage.  Then vats criticals can be enhanced by luck cards such as Four Leaf Clover, Better Criticals, Grim Reapor Sprint and Critical Savy.  
---
Agility affects your sneak ability, the higher the better.  A low health build with Unyeilding armor can easily get your agility over 20.  This helps sneak a great deal.  
---
Some people believe lighter armor like wood and leather help improve sneak, while heavier armor makes easier for enemies to spot you.  
---
Some people believe chameleon armor stacks, meaning the more the better.  Others disagree, or say more than one piece has less affect than the first.  You would need to experiment to find what works best for you.  
---
In my experience, The Fixers stealth ability really works.  I find I can stay in caution easier with it than my bloodied handmade.
---
You left off point 6: don't fight her inside the nuke zone. A lot of this comes down to nuke placement, but even with a first-timer centering their nuke on FSP, , there's no good reason to fight her right there.
---
Dude, this is probably one of the best SBQ stories I've read. Friggin fantastic! Gotta love it when the new guy has more brass than some of the veteran players! Lol!! Congrats to you two! Sounds like y'all deserved than one for sure!
---
Additionally, I think the numbers displayed can be a little glitches on the Queen. I can use my bloodied power attack meat hook on her face to get 50,000 damage displayed. But her health might only drop 1/3 of a bar. 
---
Either way keep refining the build. It‚Äôs half the fun of the game. Some people can get 1500+ with gauss rifles or hunting rifles.
---
Try not bitching about the stoopid shit when there‚Äôs literally a giant moving, evolving mound of broken ass, unplayable shit to worry about.
---
You are still going to run into trouble, every now and then.  If you're wandering around the Bog expect some difficulty.  
---
You don't want it to be a cakewalk...
---
You're right.... I didn't add it cause I thought EVERYONE should know that by now.... But dammit, I just told the story of the asshat that drew her into the zone not 5 minutes ago. Lol.
---
Fallout (1st) doesn‚Äôt mean the 1st of the month.. üòÇü§£
---
Did you get a disease on that server already? Diseases have a cooldown by a couple of hours I think. It makes it hard to be a plague bringer build
---
Op screws tho
---
I'm currently gadding about the map just getting mods and paints.  I may eventually even collect a full set of Raider armour, it's the only one I didn't bother with.
---
Dude, you're basically me!!
---
1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 
---
That‚Äôs a stream of ones btw, lol.   I‚Äôm just about to hit 50 and not bloodied, so there‚Äôs that, but I do try.
---
3 perk points in Longshot is essential in my experience.
---
Replace it with Tank Killer for boss battles üëçüèª
---
There‚Äôs people over a week out that haven‚Äôt gotten them- it‚Äôs a scam like everything else in fo76.
---
But you‚Äôll pay that next sub whilst waiting , won‚Äôt ya?!
---
Lol
---
I didn't get any disease since yesterday, I haven't played a loy either so maybe it's the cooldown? Will try! Didn't even think of a cooldown. Thanks!
---
He sure did. I was definitely impressed with him, and kind of pissed off at the rest of the scrubs. Lol. And i definitely felt like we earned it, but he desrved it more, probably burned through more ammo and aid then anybody there, so i gave him my take. Lol. I was just happy to not break my winning streak, thats the main reason i switched toons. I wasnt about to let that bitch fly off into the sunset. Lol
---
If you server hop it's supposed to reset the disease cooldown
---
I actually forgot about it tbh. Got the email yesterday and yep, gone out the bank. The service was not whatbi expected, thought, the unlimited pre-stored junk kinda was worth it?
---
Backpacks are pretty pointless now since they don't work in power armor anymore but nope only pioneer scout backpack.
---
Well in that case I joined half an hour ago on the current server and didn't get any disease yet.. Hmm
---
It just works?
---
Could be parasites or dysentery, but I would keep trying before you hop
---
And a bullet to the head for you, and you, and you, and you, and...o wait, a lumbering giant with a bloody meat hook to your face, maybe one for you...
---
Don't those show up in the effects tab if you have them?
---
I will keep trying
---
What ever happened to the take all button?
---
Junking around in the ash heap I can usually pull a couple of full ones. Certain events also give cores as a reward.
---
I have a two shot explosive assult rifles(and 1 agility)which is a rare reason to use one, the only other i can think of is thr great purple bats skin which was a nuclear winter reward.
---
I had one of these just last night, too. I didn't even go inside the red circle at first until it was clear the sub-80s were intent on doing it the hard way, and I am nothing if not a slut for flux so I had to go help. But I wasn't happy about it. I very much doubt they would have even gotten her to health regen had they been left to their own devices.
---
You means nukes or putting together 1 shot sniper builds?
---
Game at that point is dependant on Legendaries and Perks.  But only the ones that actually matter.  Meaning you either have to have a tonne of RNG luck to get the weapon you need for your build, or grind out a tonne of caps to buy those specialized weapons off of other players who are ALL selling stuff for ridiculous amounts at present.
---
Melee does more damage.  On 3 play throughs now, I have found it necessary to switch to Melee between levels 70-95, waiting to get the right legendary armour and weapons just to make the game less frustrating.
---
But the grind is a diversion.
---
Get the ammo hack. They purposely made this "game" crap, so they can sell you the "solution". Just get the hack. They already hacked you, why shouldn't you hack them?
---
Weird. I played 3 games yesterday night. All were full, all took less than a few minutes to start.
---
Maybe it's early right now?
---
After a hard night of gaming and drinking, I don't really want to get up and play anything lol.
---
Came here to say this.
---
Came back a few patches ago. Same time they brought back the invulnerable enemies glitch.
---
I seriously have no idea how they can bring back bugs they already fixed, but whatever.
---
Are you SURE you want to take all?
---
300-400 bloodied Commando
---
You on PS4?? My wife just corrected me and told me that the nukezone fight happened last night. Were you with us muttering "oh you friggin idiots." üòÇ
---
If you start the grill quest in toxic valley there should be some marked, i see them eveywere including stuck in camps so if you tame one there is a dair chance somone will accidentally kill it
---
Go visit a wendigo and let it scream in your face before you shoot at it, instant sludge lung every time for me.
---
Anyone else just see a missed opportunity for a huge event where you can actually transition from scorched to a new enemy?
---
Like have a massive event where people have to get multiple nuke codes, then a world event trying to take out a super bad SQ. After that's done, and since everyone if theyve followed the story has the inoculation to the scorched, the numbers either die or dwindle down. 
---
Would have made a great natural transition to Wastelanders, IMO.
---
They need to change this shit, code rads to not do anything. If spawned from a player weapon, and pacifist means pacifist , team or not - a person against harming others doesn‚Äôt suddenly murder  just because a person he‚Äôs friendly around suddenly does.
---
Hock mask and western duster from 3 and Nick's coat would be nice too.
---
There's No where near enough long coats in the wasteland. 
---
That and raider stuff but everytime they do that it turns out like long johns.
---
I just want my junkie to look like one.
---
Usually around 40-55 Damage per bullet, I mainly like to assist in the SBQ fights by attacking the other mobs that spawn at the same time and then just spam the queen when the numbers are a bit thinner but I don‚Äôt use any chem buffs or anything along those lines
---
Just to add something different: try enjoy the challenge.
---
When I explore the low levels areas in order to do skipped content I unequip my armor and weapons and use gear according the area (1-10 at the Forest, 15-20 at the Toxic Valley or 25-35 at the Ash Heap). This is useful because have good gear or being chessy are not the only way of kill enemies easily. Use skillfully your favorites wheel, swap weapons on fly according to range and to avoid the reloading stops you from kill a enemy, knowing when use and don't use VATS, move around the terrain to gain advantage... are all useful abilities only acquired through playing the game.
---
Also, I think you will be more comfortable moving to the
---
You...had faith in Bethesda? 
---
O.o
---
I found the survivor from the asylum guys...quick, put him down.
---
This is what I miss most in this fallout game nothing I did mattered

---
But you haven't really seen a griefer doing it on purpose, regularly or often, or at least twice, as your post would suggest..?
---
I'm on PC, but I was definitely muttering the same thing.
---
Dude.  Your paying 12$/month to store virtual junk in a buggy ass game AND that was something that was supposed to be freely in the game as is- they took it out to rob you.
---
So basically you‚Äôve been bent over and willingly rammed in the ass twice but your still smiling about it and ready for another go next month...
---
Ouch brother.  Ouch.
---
I think the same guy came to my camp.  He  went to my vending machines, had a look, came over to me, gave me the thumbs down and then started stacking up all his power armour just like that.
---
I still don't understand what he was getting at.
---
It has been very stable for me on PC as well. The only disconnects I have had in months are due to the fact I'm using a really shitty USB wifi adapter that will suddenly decide it doesn't want to work anymore.
---
The only crashes I have had in that time span as well have been from dingus's who think they need strangler heart armor and an explosive minigun for the queen.  The last time it happened the guy almost completely froze me out but then suddenly disappeared and I got to finish the event.  Crashed himself out of the game.  Congratulations, you played yourself!!
---
I‚Äôve run into several politicians before (PS4), including newt gingrich, bernie sanders and a few others. Maybe they‚Äôre trying to figure out how to profit from future America.
---
You get used to the whole people ignoring you thing after a while. I‚Äôve played almost exclusively solo because of this. It‚Äôs boring yes but you don‚Äôt have to invest in a charisma support build. And even at level 99 the only form of players interacting with me is when they buy ammo from my vendor. It‚Äôs nice to just see people every now and again in my out of the way camp I guess.
---
Sure, why not.
---
I wasn't the one bitching about anything, that was the OP. I was just answering his post :)
---
You, on the other hand; you should take your own advice! Getting all salty because you don't know how to handle a debate.
---
No, you started posting like a bitch though- same thing.
---
Have you tried lifting a .50 cal? Loaded?  Fuck that noise.  I‚Äôm not even talking recoil from auto fire (ugh). 
---
My back and I are out!
---
I really didn't, you just don't like being called out on your ignorance. Why don't you run along now little guy? I'm sure your mom can find something productive for you to do!
---
Switch servers, friend. Sometimes you got to read the tea leaves for when things are screwy.
---
Sorry, you pent up angry little boy, no time for you.
---
You should pay more attention in school, you might learn something! I'm not the one losing their temper :)
---
You've wrote an interesting commentary, but to my shame I can't figure out what "the Divergence" and "the Science!" mean in this context. Google doesn't really help.
---
If you will, can you please explain what these things mean? I suppose it's something deep american, something I can't understand with the knowledge I got living in my country.
---
Yeah, politicians have a lot to learn from Bethie.
---
The wasteland is a lonely place...
---
Thank you very much for this. I'll look in to doing this. I'm only level 13 at the moment so not really much I can have messed up to make adjustments
---
You get robbed so you don‚Äôt have to worry about money as much. 
---
You lose your own self respect, so ugly women start to look better.
---
You get to wait around for things that are broken to be fixed or be given that won‚Äôt be, so your patience improves. 
---
That‚Äôs about it.
---
how did you get automatic receiver on handmade?
---
As mentioned it can be for a variety of reasons from griefing, fast travel to error. I would be more inclined to say yes if they at least sent me a message as to why.
---
s'all good man!
---
just get a (free) hack - no need for 1st-nonsense.
---
110 bloodied prime 50 cal. Could be better but I'm a commando build that only goes heavy for the queen, so I can't use all the heavy gunner perks.
---
PS4..apparently more than a few people are having this issue as well. It's fairly recent as I've been doing Queen fights a long time with no issue. 480, heavy hitter so I know I'm doing the damage.
---
there should be a king under ground.....
---
It's useful buy junk from vendors. Move your camp near to a vendor. In order to get caps you need sell all the weapons dropped from enemies, loot all of them! Around the world there are conteiners with unlimited storage (a red tool box, a blue briefcase, etc). When exploring you need identify this containers in order to store your weapons to sell. Then you can kill and loot everything without worrying about be overweight. Finally you need fast travel to your camp, go to the vendor, return for all the weapons in the unlimited container and repeat.
---
Also, I think you will be more comfortable moving to the Ash Heap. Avoid the bullet sponge enemies. You will do better hunting mole miners. Explore the area in order to do a scavenge and hunt route in order to farm. In a few days you could move to the Savage Divide, explore new content, do more quest/events and establish a new farming route. Move you camp regularly in order to explore all the zone. And then move to the Mire to do the same. And then move to cranberry bog and do the same.
---
Seneca mountains
---
Yeah, they lied pretty much. I guess "victim" is somewhat accurate.
---
Spookydays
---
Wastelanders is still a mystery to me.  What is the timeline?  If we killed the killed and ended the scorched reign of terror then she needs to be gone from Wastelanders or do we go back in time and run a parallel timeline??
---
Rejuvenated, equivalent to action boy 2 and +50 HP
---
cheers, i learnt the handmade plan so i will try to craft and scrap as well
---
yes m8, mod away
---
VE is better than V25 because you get an additional heal triggered by anything the explosion hits.  So you minimally get a double heal if the bullet and explosion hit just a single mob. My ‚Äúindoor‚Äù heavy weapon is a VE LMG and it‚Äôs almost impossible to blow yourself up or die in general due to the number of heals you get.
---
I ran into the flatwoods monster at level 10. I shat myself.
---
Whoopsies i think you need to get bitten a lot by mierlurk hartchlings. Diseased mierlurks hatchlings
---
:  )
---
Idk. Hopefully when wastelanders drops shes no longer the end boss but something stronger like a mega behemoth.
---
I just came across a camp at the very top of Seneca mountains a few minutes ago and it was pretty cool. One of the highest points on the map, but it‚Äôs a bit out of the way IMO
---
We've listened to the community and have decided to add this feature to 1st subscribers.
---
[https://falloutfirst.com/](https://falloutfirst.com/)
---
That tag feature needs a lot of QoL love.
---
- you cannot tag components you don't have in your inventory
---
- you cannot tag specific items if they aren't used for crafting
---
- tagging missing crafting ingredients will untag items you current have
---
- you cannot tag ingredients in your stash/inventory
---
- item tagging is dependent on you already knowing recipes
---
A workaround would be to add a bunch of dummy recipes for items that can't be tagged. With super duper exemptions,  ofc.
---
Ie: 
---
Berry mentats (x1) -&gt; Berry mentats (x1)
---
This will let you tag berry mentats.
---
Which timezone? My ps+ ended so I recently moved to PC
---
Contact Xbox support.
---
Well she is the hive mind and did use the scorch to kill all of Appalachia
---
If they're going to be having continuity in the dlc then the Scorched plague has to be on its way out altogether.  I hope there is a separate server system for wastelanders myself.  Beat the Scorched questline first , then go on to Wastelanders.....that would make sense. Otherwise it just doesn't.
---
I'm not sure too about scope, I only use a dot and it certainly makes a difference with Longshot active. The game engine draw distance is relatively short, so I abandoned using a scope in favour of a dot, as no matter where the dot is the bullets hit
---
CST
---
Contact support with proof of purchase, but honestly bethesda is scum these days so I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they said there was absolutely nothing they could do for you.
---
My base Intelligence is 10, Shielded Vault Underlayer added 2 (Shielded Casual Underlayer adds 3, BTW) and Mentats (Berry, I think) added 3. This gave me mods at about a 40% rate per scrapped homemade. 
---
Good luck!!
---
They could easily put different genres on different stations. There could be heavy metal channels for us to battle SBQ then there‚Äôs the mellow 40‚Äôs and 50‚Äôs for us just to chill and wander around. It could be a huge investment though, for BGS to get the rights to use too many songs. The cost is probably the main factor why we don‚Äôt have a huge pool of music in game.
---
I'm aware, but the gat dose more dmg. Though I just primed my Bffr 50.will have to see the dmg in that
---
Not really.  I'm just sort of hanging on out of hope they manage something amazing, but after a year of..."bleh" and I just don't really have any expectations.
---
Because you have 50% lower chance of contacting diseases. You answered your own question.
---
Was on the same server just a while ago. I chuckled and started looking for his buddy...
---
 Meh :( I'm UTC+1.
---
It's all good, friends we can be :)
---
what do you mean?
---
Thats how i used to feel when people would try to grief in adventure when survival was still a thing. Its like what? You flunk out there? Lol
---
As others have said, your camp will be there when you log into a new sever. However, (unless they've fixed it) any items you have in your vendor will be moved to your stash. So when you do hop to another server, you'll have to restock your vendors. Big ol pita. üòñ
---
Beautiful things, you say.
---
I strongly believe it'll mostly be instanced not seperate severs
---
That's really cool OP! You must like it a lot if your family and friends know you play. That's really nice that they made that for you
---
I think they fixed the mutations.
---
Disease resistance is reduced. It's -50%. I have 50 higher chance of contracting them
---
*Eyeroll*
---
I can see no way this could be abused to entrap people visiting your PW's.  (s)
---
Try shooting at them.
---
I literally stopped playing F076 after one week of launch. 
---
Judging by where the stories gone, it seems like they‚Äôve missed on such a huge cool opportunities. I had no clue you could kill the leader of the scorched, and from what it sounds like they really dropped the ball on cool storytelling tied with even cooler gameplay
---
I guess I‚Äôm just so much of not an ass hole to even consider doing that. People visiting my private worlds are only people who know me, and they know damn well that I love to nuke.
---
Wild Appalachia's content was pretty lacklustre, but from leaks and stuff I've read I am hopeful for the DLC. Lack of interactable NPCs is the biggest reason why WA felt so flat, and even if choices are superficial at times at least it gives flavour and replayability.
---
They need to either:
---
- buff base PA unarmed damage so it scales competitively at 15 STR, making PA Arm mods worthwhile
---
- Allow unarmed weapons to work in PA.
---
- Increase STR cap on PA from 15 to 50.
---
The power fist looks like it was designed for PA.
---
 how does the Excavator actually mine?
---
I played solo all the time and launched nukes myself lol you don‚Äôt need anyone with you. Just good enough weapons and something that takes down robots quickly. It sounds like your perk cards are a mix of builds, do some research and align them to specialize in a certain type of weaponry and then things will be much easier.
---
That‚Äôs one Sweet Cake , what kind of buff did it give you ?
---
Oh okay, good to know. Might give it a try during holidays. Thank you.
---
Same thing happens with notes. Makes looting low level Liberators a drag since they have propaganda note on them.
---
It might be hard for you to get there but there is an ammunition factory workshop on the northeast side of the map. You can crank out 200 5.56 rounds in like 15 minutes and there is a junk pile and a lead mine. It's helped me a ton.
---
The unarmed attack for PA and humans grant 10 dmg / STR.  The damage is too low for any of the effects to be meaningful. NPCs get too much HP.
---
Yeah. Only $15-20 if you buy it soon
---
Excuse me good sir, what the fuck is that?
---
See, I‚Äôm glad they instituted private servers so you can have your own private world :)
---
Its assumed it's set one year after reclamation day. The SBQ can be fought as many times as you want, this is simply because it's an online game and not a lore thing. The plague is possibly still around, but now there is a vaccine against it. I assume like the current main quest it will start off low level and slowly get more difficult.
---
Fallout 76 isn't a LAN game like Minecraft, it's live, you need PlayStation plus on each console and 2 tvs, then just invite each other to a team
---
Is that why I haven‚Äôt seen any of them flying around anywhere lately?
---
How about this:
---
- Suit
---
- Mod slot 1: Dirty / Clean
---
- Mod slot 2: Color / Paint
---
And use naming rules to generate variety.
---
Or we could bloat inventories by having 20 different versions of the same suit
---
Switch back and forth between the 2 HDMI channels....
---
Aw that‚Äôs too bad
---
Can they mess with the lore of a Fallout game??  I don't think that's a very good idea.
---
They're still around.  Probably more so since going legendary.  Do you visit the fissures?  I spend 80% of my time farming them so they're definitely around.
---
AR gets better cone of fire, accuracy, AP cost and mag size.

Prime Gatling Plasma - 50-60 (no hw perks)
---
This does not include Adrenaline. When active, those numbers go way up.
---
Sir, this is a Wendy‚Äôs
---
I did earlier. Guess it‚Äôs just bad timing on my part. Good to know though. I‚Äôll keep looking
---
So tell us how you really feel?
---
Yep that‚Äôs what I did here, unfortunately it just displays the frames but who knows maybe if someone messes around with it they might be able to find away to make the actual armor show. It also looks goofy lol but it works
---
Point to us on the doll where Todd Howard hurt you
---
Only to do that (if I'm right) is to have your ps4's on two different video feeds (video 
---
1 and video2 inputs for example) and then use a split screen or picture in picture function.
---
You're running two different instances of the same game so they can't both be on the exact same video feed into one view screen.
---
Try the one in the forest closer to new gad.  that one doesn't get a lot of attention.
---
I don't use anymore turrets to increase my budget. I'm in whitespring, it's quiet only sometimes wall damages.
---
points at the nono spot, daddy todd touched me there XD
---
It could be chameleon armor. I always rock one piece for this reason. I enjoy it when someone initiates PVP, unless I‚Äôm carrying 100lbs of junk of course. Just walk away.
---
I have a vending machine with a complete skeleton, a prisoner collar, handcuffs, party hat, a teddy bear, candy and a KidSecure ID bracelet.
---
I'd much rather just have a ragdoll skeleton on the ground.
---
Can't help myself remembering Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel (not to confuse with Fallout Tactics). They put f\*cking Slipknot into the Fallout game! Sorry for my language, but Slipknot, Killswitch Engage, Skinlab, Celldweller, Chimaria, Messhuggah - even these bands' names sound like they're gonna eat you, and they were in a Fallout game, though it's considered to be non-canonical. 
---
It's too much for Fallout made by Bethesda, of course. What about heavy metal - well, I don't know: I believe that this music was born in a process of evolution which included rock'n'roll before (the one we hear in Fallout series now). Fallout's pre-war USA was conserved, and it's musical preferences stopped on this rock'n'roll. In these conditions, 60's psychedelic rock still can exist, but as some sort of an underground. What I want to say is that we can't get Metallica or even Black Sabbath without psychedelic rock go into mainstream, which doesn't fit the world Bethesda have already made.
---
+1 to charisma but -1 to agility. Got really full afterwards
---
Happy birthday! üéâ
---
No, nothing happens.  I'm not suggesting just another form of a Survival server.  I'm simply suggesting a way to steer things one direction or another, within the current server setup, so you clump players more likely of similar mindsets together.
---
If you (player) change your pacifist setting after logging in, nothing should happen (until next login). For that server, next time the PvP calculation is made, the float shifts a little towards PvP.
---
Except for it nose-dived in popularity.
---
See I actively look for PvP oppurtunites it show me where i can improve my build and gear until they pull out stealth boys and equip secret agent and start hopping around me. Survival I dint have to deal with that cause people couldnt safety carry like 99 stealth boys
---
I just want level scaling for all areas. It's not really worth visiting a lot of areas because everything is low level
---
nope, this was fixed probably 5-6 months back...
---
Build a new camp it will make the game last longer and I've been playing since the start with no breaks throughout the year and haven't spent a cent on the atomic shop, subscription servers and extra's. So I choose not to support Bethesdas bad decisions but I still enjoy the game and make the most of it despite of it having many bugs even over five that's been there since the start. Stay positive fellow wastelander ‚úåÔ∏è
---
We stayed in Dryfork for a bit. The view was amazing. I can‚Äôt wait to go back.
---
u.u... ill try.. thanks for the positivity, really need it right now ;/ ill delete my nasty outburst, but damn it felt cathartic to get that out
---
Nice. Thanks for the heads up. I've been too afraid to test it out. üëç
---
Well, I have 2 characters...level 396 and 165 and I have never once not gotten loot from the corpse except for 2 reasons....My character was too low and did not do enough damage or I died just before the event ended and responded without doing damage after the respawn.....Also, and I am not positive on the calculations but the SBQ is scaled and you have to put in a certain amount of damage according to the scaling to get the corpse reward.....Did you ever think that or possibly if there is only 2 of you that the scaling or amount of damage may be 50% or greater....total damage divided by 2 people?  Maybe your buddy is doing the greater of 50% and you are not getting the right percentage to get the reward?  I am not sure on this last part because I am not exactly sure how the scaling or percentages work, just a thought.
---
yeah, that was a bad and annoying bug :)
---
Oh yeah I've felt that way many times. Keep it posted I'm interested what others have to say lol
---
666666666666666666676666666666666766666666666666777766666666666566666666666666767.....
---
They have to bring back the survival servers. You're either built for PvP or not. If someone attacks you in adventure, they can beat you. They're built to beat you or they wouldn't bother you.
---
Stealth boys are what really ruins pvp for me. I spent a lot of time to level an alt and get him top of the line pvp gear, but I literally have no motivation whatsoever to chase around invisible people.
---
I'd bet we know by the end of the month when it's going to be released.
---
the irony is that the cake is actually a finished project unlike what its based off of
---
With sneak/crit build my Quad Crit Damage Handmade goes 19 19 19 91 repeating for the entire clip of 85 rounds. This is with Vats headshots and crouched very close to SBQ. Radshield to survive the radiation!
---
The clean suits are tagged as Atom shop items in the .esm. There are dirty versions, but they are labeled as "Not playable." Agent Hale from the Encryptid quest wears one. I don't see the hat or Kellog's outfit.
---
Yeah lol. And wow. What a scene.
---
I am indeed - I have a secondary account on PC but I have get to find the motivation to level it.
---
Any PA you find in the Wasteland usually has an FC at 25%, Morgantown is usually good for 2-3 100% and 2-3 25% the generator under the Airport,the one behind the garage kitty-corner from Mama Dolce's , 1 in the PA in the booby trapped barn across the stream from that, 1 in the generator in the commie spy base under Mama Dolce's, 1 in the PA also there, 5-6 at Mount Blair.  All of these are random so its hit/miss. Like people said the most reliable way is to take over a workshop, but if you do unplug your vending machines so your base isn't displayed on the map,sneak everywhere you go, lock the FC resource collector and every 20-30 min. check it
---
No he's right. I bought an HDMI switch and connected it to each PS4, then have one HDMI cable from it to the TV. You have to press the button on it to switch between, but it works
---
Yeah. Mines been pretty quiet so far. Watch. A friggin deathclaw is gonna spawn near lol
---
I love how this is supposed to be a sociable game, and yet we have to ask if team invites are Griefing scams. 
---
Bethesda never should have given any favor to the Trolls with this broken Pvp system to begin with.
---
Better still give them back their own mode as survival was.
---
You use up a lot of flux that way, I think it takes 1 of each Flux. Far easier to scavenge... ;-)
---
If anyone knows how to shorten Launch Prep I'd like to learn.
---
thats been around since day one, bounty lures are the oldest trick in the book
---
Who gives a fuck
---
Do events or you can go shopping. The players didn't really fill the void of the lack of human NPCs though and that's why they are making wastelanders. Fallout 76 is about loot and sales! Lol
---
Nice cake
---
Why are u so toxic?
---
This guy gets it.
---
Why not bring back survival servers? Fix what was broken and throw the people who want PVP a bone.
---
Same here, MMOG Fails says it's currently aimed for Feb but as with all leaks that's subject to change. A fresh trailer is essential to maintain hype and I can see ending with an actual date, or at least a date for the pre-Wastelanders event due to come out.
---
Stop supporting Bethesda's bad decisions and play the game without greed, i've been playing since the start and haven't spent a cent in the atomic shop or subscription servers and I still enjoy the game. It was intended to be online only and we we're the NPCs so why go solo anyway I don't get it but majority of the player base now are fallout First subscribers.
---
I've tried several legendary assault rifles.  The bloodied is the only one I kept.  The rest are just dissappointing.
---
Nonlegendary handmade will out power the TS Assault Rifle easily.  Fixer is also a better rifle.
---
The assault rifle mod/plans are easy to obtain earlier in the game...thats the only reason I can think of for its lower damage numbers.  As rifles (in this class) become more difficult to mod, their damage numbers seem to increase.  I believe its a balance issue.
---
You seem like a honest trader, and you're right: people over price the hell out of rather common items, idk if they're trying to fool those who don't know about something (looking at myself here) or what.
---
This, and I can‚Äôt stress enough: PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE scale materials used for repairing weapons and armor based on condition... 
---
shouldn‚Äôt cost the same adhesive it takes for a broken item to repair something at 50% condition. It just doesn‚Äôt make any logical sense, it should be the more damaged an item is, the more materials you need.
---
It‚Äôs little things like this that improve the quality of the game and the community. as a returning player they‚Äôve done a ton to make it better but more work needs to be done! I‚Äôm hooked again.
---
[What an ](https://i.imgur.com/EZbsHyq.png)[original idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/bethesdaplz).
---
Exactly thing is people couldnt risk running around with stealth boys in survival cause it was an item youd risk dropping in mass
---
Good god. u/HughesJohn, you're wasting your time. Logic and reason are lost on anyone arguing against you here. They want to feel robbed by Bethesda and facts won't changed that. Womp womp.
---
Huh? I asked a question to other fallout first subscribers, with a question relating to them. You have seen this, not being a fallout first subscriber and then not only not answered me (since you can't) but also gone out of your way to give me a rant about your personal feelings about fallout first. Wtf pal haha?!
---
Reddit tip. When replying to a comment, use the reply button beneath that comment instead of making a new comment on your post. 
---
This is a big mess right now.
---
My 4 characters are in the mire, everywhere else looks terrible
---
If I recall correctly, the announcement that they are attending is originally from the ESO developers (ZOS). Which is not to say other Bethesda published upcoming content could not be shown.
---
Maybe it'll be somewhat they begin to repopulate Appalachia after the scorched infection "ended"
---
You are correct about the 2 TV's but incorrect about the two PS plus accounts.
---
 I have a PS4 and my stepdaughter has a PS4.
---
 My account on PS4 has my PS plus account.  I also have my account on her PS4.  I set her PS4 as the primary PS4.
---
  This still gives me access to PSN on my account on my system. Her account also has access to PSN network because she has the primary PS4.
---
 Confusing but it works.
---
More confusing Side not.  Every account on my stepdaughter's PS4 now has access to PSN.
---
 Only my account on my PS4 has access to PSN. Every other account on my PS4 has no psn access.
---
Yeah ik hehe sry, just being pedantic.
---
Yeah, just be careful crafting, if you have a teddy bear display or whatever and start making gunpowder you're gonna scrap em lol
---
Just pop some berry mentats and you‚Äôre good to go.
---
Just trying to help a lost soul üòÇü§£
---
Then Maybe all the scorched are replaced by ghouls (sentient ghouls), if anything just re-skin them by instance??
---
Especially odd given previous games let you loot books and notes without an auto read unless they were in the open
---
Hes probably the silo glitcher.
---
You have my permission to cuss you know.
---
If you see your opponent use SB, fast travel a decent distance, then fast travel back, and you'll be able to see and VATS target that behaves recklessly because assumes they are invisible.
---
The distance required is about 3-4 caps.
---
I mean some dont mind a bit of musk. ;)
---
Yep.  It's really frustrating.  Spent a month ranking up a shotgun build for nothing.  I had a 2shot explosive pump and every shotgun perk maxed out, doing over 280 damage per shot. 
---
I should have been one-shotting mole miners...only to see their health regen and it took 6-7 shots.
---
Oh, Bethesda...how annoying you are sometimes.
---
Yeah, true. Both are really good to be honest. Now I just need the full Vanguard set.
---
With Fireproof + Dense mod you won't take any damage at all, though. Except if it's a legacy.
---
So your saying I have to use an exploit to beat them seems legit
---
It's been that way for over a year. It's just a gameplay over lore thing.
---
or raiders, trappers, left over scorched
---
I support this, been saying so, and I think it is the easiest and cheapest solution to main issue with F76
---
You play with a 3the party device no matter what :p
---
As a Bloodied Heavy weapons user, I find that I can eliminate everything in the game with ease as long as I'm not the center of dozens of bullets. However for situations that require more tanking, I jump into that power armor and let Emergency Protocols do the work while I continue mowing down bodies.
---
Against a target with thousand duped nuka colas and infinite stealthboys playing dirty seems to be the only way to make them drop their shitty custom.
---
Having a solution for this playstyle is a way to make people go back to playing more cautiously.
---
He's right
---
I know I just want to be able to say I always fight fair
---
Scorched will probably be relegated to a smaller area of the map once Wastelanders comes out and existing locations are repopulated by human NPCs. They aren't completely eradicated by the time Wastelanders is set, but between the Inoculation Project and frequently nuking the Queen I'm guessing they're no longer a major threat.
---
A lot of the current main quest would have to change to make sense alongside Wastelanders, but the basic through-line of "investigate what happened to the original factions &gt; learn how to nuke Fissure Site Prime" can coexist with it.
---
Oh please yes, put all the violent people together away from us. I support this, with bells on.
---
Depends. I like some of the mire. The lighting isnt the greatest because it gets dingy for me. But everywhere else it's all FLASH BAM ALAKAZAM orange colored sky
---
Yep but laser are worse
---
Yeah you can do similar with someone you trust who also has PS Plus. Basically set each other's consoles to primary on the others acc.  with your own consoles  as secondary on your acc. Allows you to cross-share ea others library.
---
Kill the big sentry bots at whitesprings, they are the only robot mobs there who drop loot (which always included a fusion core) and they give a nice chunk of xp
---
Got you. That was the first time ever posted on here. Thanks for the tip.
---
If they did this I would unlock my CAMP again &amp; set up vending machines (again). At the moment I jump servers to avoid people &amp; keep my CAMP as low profile &amp; as defended as I can
---
i think that if they invest time and resources into making it congruent with the 76 lore and timeline it could be a lot better to actually eradicate the scorched and move forwards with re settling and rebuilding.
---
Forest is nice too. I like the darkness and the creatures in the mire. I had a spot in toxic valley for so long, I can't stand the spacious ugliness anymore, just for some lead and junk lol
---
As a cake decorator, I approve of this
---
Do you think that we'll meet the overseer?  I hope so.  I hope that there is a cut scene that follows the death of the queen and introduces us the next step in finding the overseer.  As you know there is still a 'find the overseer' quest in 76 even if you have completed all the available quests in the line.....so I think she is going to factor into Wastelanders.  I hope she is
---
Looks great :) . Happy birthday from over the pond.
---
This is an additional 3rd party device...
---
Again a car without tires.
---
If you want stealth boys I have some for sale I‚Äôm my vendor. ü§ì
---
I'm pretty sure you can pick up that plan at the Watoga Shopping Center vendor for pretty cheap.
---
By far the best idea I‚Äôve ever seen on here. To add to that I think nukes should cause widespread rad storms.
---
I think Vampires is one of the times Exploding is significantly better than FFR.  I do use legacies most of the time, which is why I use the VE LMG to avoid blowing myself up inside West Tek or wherever.
---
Hit around the 2000s with a stealth bloodied sheepsquatch staff w/ unyeilding
---
Just an fyi that is fine for families in the same home but me doing that with my buddy in another city is bannable and against the tos.
---
Hard to get caught unless you're stupid of course
---
Uncool.
---
Ive got hundred left over from the guys that used them in survival cause they would drop them and fill my stash box
---
People hate seeing the same thread come up after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day after day day after day after day
---
Bos vendor at super duper in watoga.
---
Stealth Boys are the only real counter to VATS. With a bit of practice, it's not hard to see SB'd people and if you're really having trouble you can always pop a Berry Mentats.
---
The problem isn't SBs, it's VATS. I run a Heavy Guns/Power Armor build. SBs are essential to stop commando builds from just using aimbot for easy kills.
---
Lmao, they are not hurting anyone by glitching the silos, why are you so salty
---
Yeah, I have killed myself many times with the AAE Gat Plasma
---
That, my good fellow, is a render of a beast found deep within the game files, waiting to be woken up... :)
---
I give a fuck that you don't give a fuck. I kinda like it.
---
I can do only one shoot level 1-8 enemies. And has to be close range, with all shotgun perks on. The health bar takes the damage and regenerates it on the spot. 
---
I can cripple anything, however.
---
The vault changes every Tuesday
---
you get the rewards  once per day, 
---
you can run the vault again after 4 pm Pacific to get rewards again.
---
so you can run it at 3pm and again at 4pm and get rewards both times
---
15k average, 22k fully boosted
---
you can snake wires through walls by changing them into windows or doorways, sending the wire through the opening, and then you just change it back to being a normal wall.
---
I ran into Obama on xbox the other day.
---
I've tried the berry mentats and it doesn't seem to work when they are in stealthboy mode
---
I think they'll announce it during the free trial. That's why they mentioned it. I also wouldn't be surprised if we get some kinda beta in January or so, February sounds right.
---
I also think it's gonna be a lot more significant than most think. If they didn't care about it they probably could have slapped it out a month ago.
---
After 250 it falls off pretty hard. I have a heavy metal vanguard chest and one other vanguard with other stuff like zelots and trouble shooter. 
---
Use to be 4 vanguard and one stealth piece. Got up to 400 or so but the difference is not worth.
---
There is an advanced wiring connection piece thats used to run wires through walls and many for running them though floors and to your roof. I use them all the time and they look great.
---
A see a ton of the strangest, weirdest names on fallout 76.
---
Disagree. Imo the hi-cap and armor plated are well worth getting. Lead lined is useful too.
---
Whoops. Yes I don‚Äôt know. Just walk around ash heap. You‚Äôll get it.
---
id say the T-60 is the best in terms of economy (repairs), but yeah i agree otherwise. i love my 51
---
Has nothing to do with Bethesda. 
---
Console transactions and library are handled by Xbox. 
---
Great job bud.
---
Right. I only moved to my spot cuz of the extractor. And farm at lucky hole
---
Agree with this, took some time to get full vanguard and with some perks added in, DR is over 600 and it feels like barely any difference at all.  Wasn‚Äôt worth all the hours searching, that‚Äôs for sure.  Similarly disappointed in the full sentinel set.
---
Have the best results with full WWR armor with specialist pieces (-15% scorched, super mutants, etc)
---
Yes, plus 3rd star effects can reduce weights even more. I have one that reduces weights of my weapons and no joke gives me 20 extra carry weight when equipped because of this. I have less carry weight in my PA with leg mods.
---
I know that one, but thanks all the same.
---
Imma do this
---
Every time I see that I like to imagine it being Tay Zonday‚Äôs Chocolate Reign.  A weird teenage black kid with a deep voice instead of the queen. Every time I‚Äôm baked anyways.
---
Nope.
---
Place a connection on a rug... Then connect everything up and slowly move the rug and then place your wall. Saves a lot of headache
---
Would make violet flux a lot easier to get.
---
Easy solution is just keep pacifist on 24/7. If I wanted to kill other players id be playing cod
---
Yeah, I use those, but I like to keep that stuff on the outside and have as little wiring in the house as possible. Some pieces are being really squirrelly right now due to how whacky actually just placing things can be.
---
There should be pre wastlander and post wastelanders servers
---
truth hurts don't it
---
Okay cool. Last I heard of the rumor was a few months ago and I was a little skeptical about it so I thought I‚Äôd ask again. Glad I did though bc I would‚Äôve been tearing up my greatest work in that game for nothing
---
&gt;!*Ah the perks of Place Everywhere and Fallout 4*!&lt;
---
Cold sucks for me to old to be any good. I actively search for PvP in this game it feuls a competive edge for us older players that can't hop around and hip fire shotguns while building stuff at the same time
---
I want one solely for the purpose of smelting lead.
---
Also Skyrim is the same engine and it let's you take all instead having to sort it and take each thing separately.
---
One piece of creature resistance armor gives you more damage negation to that specific creature than a full set of Vanguard or Bolstering will. So running a mixed set of different creature legendary effects will give you much better damage negation than a full set of Van/Bol. The vast majority of players don't know this and value Van/Bol armor extremely high.
---
Here's a damage resistance chart to help you better understand how DR/ER work- [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage\_Resistance](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance)
---
I feel like the hopping around is worse in this game when everyone has marsupial lol
---
Very disappointing indeed. I remember my first time showing up to to killl the SQ and I was a bit nervous with my 50 stimpaks over 15 thousand rounds of .50 ammo and lots food/water fusion cores for my PA. When I get there there were level 20's running around shooting the SQ with their pipe pistols taking blast from her directly to the face and walking away unscathed. Only 5k rounds later 1 or 3 stims and she was dead...I waited until level 75 to even try her...wtf did I wait for when I could have been doing her from a much lower level.
---
Make sure to unequip the perk that makes weapons degrade slower, you have it,
---
everyone who has posted so far nailed it
---
7 per shot wirh gatling laser
---
So what if it can, it's thier world.
---
This.  You can repair them at ~99% durability, so a few bashes should be more than enough if you don't repair it over 100%.
---
I use a bloodied handmade with the mag with 2nd best armor piercing, 9 perception in commando, 3 in tank killer, 3 in bloody mess, 3 in covert operations, adrenal reaction mutation but I hover around half health. I hit around 75 to 110 provided I stay in caution. As soon as i'm spotted by any adds I immediately focus on taking them out and try to go back to caution. If i'm in danger i'm hitting like 20s.
---
crossbows damage quicker bashing because you can bash faster than you can shoot a crossbow
---
Happy birthday man!
---
Love it
---
200/280 per bullet with a BFFR Handmade,bloodied stealth commando
---
Exactly, it never happens. You haven't seen it personally, I haven't seen it personally, no one I know have ever seen it personally and there is exactly zero verified claim on this reddit afaik (but please, prove me wrong). 
---
You saying "griefers use it to harass other players" makes it sound like a widespread problem that players have to deal on daily basis, getting pwned by packs of strangler-clad griefers; which is basically same shit as *class war between F1sters and plebs* that found its life in mainstream media. If you can't seem to comprehend what's wrong with all the reasoning, I am truly sorry.
---
theres an entire mode for pvp........
---
How will I kill hackers without the noob tube
---
I was playing with my wife once and she died at the golf club, i went to sit on her bag and these 2 assholes blocked me and stole it, giving me the thumbs down and talking shit on the mike. I followed up up to the row houses and trained their asses, and then i got her shit back and theirs as well. Was funny because she was mid 20's, the 2 morons were a tad higher while I was 150. They left the server after I trained them. Douchebaggery can only really be countered by returning the favor.
---
Usually it means you already have that code. At least in my experience
---
&gt;Exactly, it never happens.
---
do you have proof it is __not happening at all?__ otherwise your in the same boat.  it's almost like you are not aware that crashing the game on console means you can't hit "record what happened x time ago" makes it super hard to record proof
---
&gt;makes it sound like a widespread problem
---
that seems like a you putting words in my mouth there.  just because it isn't widespread does not mean it does not happen.  i have honestly no idea where you are pulling this "if its not widespread it doesnt count" attitude from.
---
&gt; If you can't seem to comprehend what's wrong with all the reasoning, I am truly sorry.
---
you should look through your own notes, again, im not saying it is widespread, im saying that it does happen.  if you cannot comprehend what is wrong with your own reasoning, that is based completely off assumptions i did not say, im the one that is sorry.
---
Happy Birthday (sorry i‚Äôm late)
---
Getting mobbed by high level ghouls can be difficult. Easier with PA as apparently in normal armor they can stun you and you can't get the swings in fast enough to take them out close up.
---
Yeah that's pretty damn weird then and I see how that could get frustrating really quick if it happens over and over. I've dropped a ton of ammo into her before only for some dude with strangler armor and an explosive minigun to come along and lock up my game.  I know I was pretty pissed and quit playing the game for the day right then and there.  All that ammo wasted, no xp, no loot, no reward.  Makes you mad for sure.
---
Lots of them are what we call squeakers, preteen brats who don't know how to play nice but know how to make life miserable for other people.
---
You know you dont need them at all anymore right?pretty much nobody bothers since they are already found
---
You can dashboard close the game, restart the game, and it will put you back into the same team. I've done this before to farm the traveling responder Bot vendor at Charleston, some say you can do it to respawn the clubhouse at the whitesprings as well. I would not recommend doing this for item transfers between your other characters however for many reason, it is much safer to use a friend's server and alert them to stay on the server for you.
---
Pink indigo and yellow r the rare few and u can‚Äôt perosonally apply those colors so if u see one with one of those three colors u‚Äôll know it‚Äôs legit. 
---
Side note INDIGO is rare, blue is not
---
Well what does the rare bats say? Because I have a pink bat in my inventory that came out of nowhere but I don't think it's rare because I can change the color I'm sure
---
Don't bother. Pick up randomly spawning crossbows from around the world; they spawn with random durability, and thus can be repaired straight off. This is what I did, and I got that part of the badge in about 5 minuets. [Here's a list of spawn locations](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Crossbow_(Fallout_76)#Locations) to get you started. Good luck!

Seriously. At least that. The fucking giant pipe with the giant connector is just atrocious.
---
Will it say indigo?
---
Yep. Put your team together, have the leader open the Vault with the computer terminal, then kick it off with the terminal inside
---
Thanks.
---
you really do need to read your own links better, and i quote:
---
&gt;However it is important to note that we can never be certain of anything, and so we must assign value to any claim based on the available evidence, and to dismiss something on the basis that it hasn't been proven beyond all doubt is also fallacious¬†reasoning.
---
my statement has plenty of available evidence based off the search bar. 
---
 you have yet to provide any that shows i am incorrect beyond a reasonable doubt.  if you want to accuse me of being incorrect while there is evidence in the search bar, the burden of proof is on you.
---
I've never heard this, and can't think of any reason it would be a mechanic. I've certainly never noticed it, and I'm level 133.
---
Totally. I try to keep all wires outside of my camp if possible. I make a room separate that holds my fusion generator and use the conductors stated above to run wires on the outside. You don‚Äôt need many to light your whole base up. Happy Building!!
---
I know fo4 has a take all button. Does this game not? It‚Äôs been awhile since I‚Äôve played and forgot
---
Doesn't the game run a lot worse on PC though?
---
Yup üëçüèª dont know if the title of the bat will say indigo but if u look to where it says the mods attached it‚Äôs paint job will say indigo/pink/yellow
---
It runs alot better actually
---
Does it let you change the color? Because I have a pink one but I'm sure it will let me change the color to all star or whatever
---
Each set, other than Raider and T-45, is "best" in a certain area. T-51 has the best balistic defense, X-01 has the best energy and radiation defense, Ultracite has the best overall stats (if you add all the power armors' stats together, Ultracite has the highest total value), while T-60 is the cheapest to maintain in terms of repair materials, the Excavator armor give a massive +250 carry weight without upgrades, and finally the Stranglerheart Armor has a built in AoE damage effect.
---
I do and it's amazing. Don't think the burn effect uses the primary effect however, I believe it's a separate stack of damage. Will have to conduct further testing later.
---
My pleasure!
---
Do you play in secret?  
---
My family and friends know me as a massive fallout fan, getting me something fallout for xmas or birthdays is just their standard thing now, my brother even made me a fallout card this year for my birthday
---
A explosive Gatling plasma is pretty easy on ammo
---
I think so yeah. I think it‚Äôs just the fact u can‚Äôt ever change a bat to be pink yellow or indigo. That‚Äôs what makes them valuable
---
If you go up to the thing you're looting and hit the transfer button, the inventory of the thing you're looting will show up and then you can hit take all. It just takes too long.
---
Award for worse customer service in history üòÇ

My sentiments precisely. It is of course based on the german MG42, which had an incredibly high rate of fire. It struck fear into the hearts of the soldiers who heard its distinctive "tearing fabric" report. However, german squads were built around their MGs and the MG 42 gulped ammo. When you see photos from 42 on you will likely note that most german soldiers heading into combat had belts of MG ammo around their necks even if they were not carrying a MG42. So kudos for the historical accuracy. I sold mine for 25K. I kinda miss it sometimes.
---
It might be easier to make a "Display Space" item that could be placed on tables (or anywhere else, for that matter.) Basically, I'm thinking of an invisible display case, that could then be placed on top of tables or other objects. That way they wouldn't have to re-code every table we already have.
---
Tuesday, and the vault rewards reset at 5pm EST
---
That's really cool, man. No I don't play in secret and in fact they know I play it a lot. But to most people Fallout is Fallout, they don't know the exact number I'm playing lol
---
Yeah but you have to get a 100$ member ship it get it and must renew it to keep the member ship after 1 year
---
Ah fair enough, i think because my friends and brother are also fallout fans it helps thatvthey have also played the latest ones, and in the case of 76, played in my team
---
Holy crap man.
---
There is the pirate hat. It is similar to Hancock‚Äôs it‚Äôs a tricorn hat.
---
You, I'm guessing. Why else stay in a sub to a game you claim to have no interest in?
---
Oh yeah I have it~
---
I don't think any one set is definitely better.  I just wear the one that looks coolest in my new skins.
---
I want this for my 21rst birthday, with homebrew nuka shine.
---
What effects did it have?
---
I'm getting lag at the white spring station vendor.
---
Yea but they‚Äôre legacy, so even though they were duped to hell and back and probably still rarely duped people sell them extremely expensive
---
Not sure on the exact time. I bet it's 20 hours like the vendor timers. Maybe it's less though.
---
No, server hop
---
I pick them up just to stop the beeping.
---
Mines still good üëç

Back before tents I found people nuking DSV9 and the forward base SE of the fissure super annoying because you then had to fight in an open field with nowhere to fall back to to regroup (the launcher would say nonsense about how the queen landed more etc), so on more than one occasion I followed a player into a silo and stole the missile to make sure it was targeted to MY preferences (fighting from on top of the DSV9 bunker). I make no apologies. Since the tents came along no longer an issue.
---
\-1 year after Vault 76 opened 
---
\-Probably. I mean, it *was* the main quest, after all.
---
\-Effectively, yes. While it might still technically be around, we did finish and take a vaccine for it in the course of the main quest.
---
\-No idea, looking forward to finding out.
---
\-Probably not, but hey, that's MMOs for you.
---
I'm cautiously optimistic. While things have certainly gone poorly up until now (*cough* Fallout 1st *cough*) I think Bethesda realizes they f#$%ed up, and need to put out something halfway decent to keep any sort of reputation in the gaming community. The fact that they delayed the launch of Wastelanders certainly says they're actually putting some effort into it this time around.
---
On a personal note, I want to know what the new Gauss weapons will mean for the existing Gauss Rifle? Will it be reskinned? Replaced? Will existing Gauss Rifles just get deleted?
---
I blame inbreeding
---
Gatling it's the best ballistic.   I have a two shot,  does 178 damage,  and with heavy weapons perks staggers,  blows through armor and increases my defense. 
---
But I do have a lovely MG42 on display.
---
Are you running unyielding?   Each hard bargain = 3 charisma as I recall and eventually you cap out on discount (20 something base).  Grape is 10% and 5 so you can get to max with just that and no hard bargain.
---
No, it is rare. You can change the colours of bats to different colours, but the game is bugged and you cannot change them to indigo or pink. However if you have a pink bats, you have the ability to change it to another colour, but then you wouldn't be able to change it back to pink.
---
That's why it's rare.
---
It's the same with serrated Bowie knives. They can drop from enemies with the mod already on it, but you cannot apply the mod
---
Yeesh! Nice.
---
Same thing is happening to me
---
Human skulls on a table? Yes please.
---
If we get anything big content wise post-Wastelanders I‚Äôll be genuinely shocked.
---
People who want pvp have there ways of forcing pvp.   They come to the queen fight, turn off pacifist and the quest to kill the queen, and jump in front of people so they get shot.  This is their attempt to find one dude out of pacifist so they can kill entire squads over one person's mistake.  If that doesn't work and they are desperate, that can get a bounty by stealing water or something from a camp.  With a bounty, a pacifist's mutations will cause damage to the wanted person, this initiating pvp even if they are in pacifist.  This is why you shouldn't have unstable isotopes etc as mutations anymore.
---
Geez. who has that much fkn time on their hands!? :D
---
You're right. The reflex sights still count as iron sights. The only time you personally will want a scope is for boosting VATS accuracy.
---
This is the way.
---
No, I just switched to Bolstering from Unyeilding. Doesn't change prices at all with maxed out Hard Bargain. It used to when I was on Unyeilding.

Happy Birthday Wasteland Wanderer.
---
As long as people keep buying fallout 1st sure
---
I have a tse LMG and traded away a furious FFR one to a friend.  Love both of them but don‚Äôt care for a gun I can bring out on odd numbered Sundays because of ammo consumption.
---
I give plans out to low levels and occasionally, someone will gift me plans randomly. The ps4 76 community isn't too talkative but we're certainly pretty kind.
---
My birthday was yesterday too! Happy shared birthday!
---
I can't open your link, I think because it has studio in it. I am interested in seeing your walkthrough though.
---
You don't even have to wait 24 minutes if you change servers.
---
Ammo consumption can be somewhat mitigated by firing with controlled bursts rather than spray and pray.
---
  Two trips through lucky hole will yield about 800 lead, plus what you can pick up from toys and such.
---
  Sure, its tedious to make ammo in quantity, but between supeduper, ammosmith, and what I scavenger from dead critters, I usually don‚Äôt drop below 1k rounds.  (That and I generally only use the LMG against things that fly)

If it is controllable. I like the low level areas for my camp. Don't like dealing with a shit ton of level 68s when turrets are weak and can't target for shit.
---
Lol Oki
---
How often do you deal with a team of 4 that run up jumping around and killing you with an auto aim qffr tesla rifle
---
Yes exactly
---
you can also block it from the map, just right clic the quest marker and choose stop.
---
I mean if they want to keep this game alive and worth of note then they probably will.
---
How exactly is that any better? I'm not trying to sound like a bitch, but I'm in such a low mood right now and this just doesn't sound like an improvement.
---
I have a Junkies Exploding LMG I only use for PVP.
---
 If you use LMG I heard it's actually much easier to make it prime and use ultracite bullets.
---
Crouching, cover, and high ground is all you need to fight vats builds. Crouching forces them to free aim in order to turn vats back on. High ground makes it harder to hit you. Dipping behind cover will break a vats lock. 
---
Vats is essential for certain builds and countering high mobility/high tankiness. Being able to use an item to completely shut down someones build is ridiculous. What item can I use to avoid tesla arcing? Or legacy weapon explosions? The later is really the biggest problem with PVP. You can be killed through explosive resistance without actually being hit.

---
have a primed BE lmg, let's just say it melts the SBQ, and is totally worth it, dps is sick , but remember to craft ultracite ammo....
---
And, it has to best sound in the game, lol
---
Depends on how you want to define ‚Äúbest‚Äù
---
Each PA has its own strength and weakness.  For my play style, ‚Äúbest‚Äù is usually Excavator, in that I‚Äôm almost always overencumbered, so the extra carry weight makes it best.    Excavator has served me well through nuke zones, silos, and even SBQs.
---
T51 has the highest DR, X01 the highest RR, and I have used both, but have to switch back to Excavator when I bounce off the weight limits...
---
Same reason a cake like this would get upvoted
---
Award for saying big camp budget increases would wreck the games structure yet plans to do it for subscribers

What a fucking money grubbing joke

Also if your crouched they can't vats you

I liked the feature that Skyrim had that only tracked new quests when you didn't have one currently active.
---
HB adds +3 invisible Charisma per rank. 
---
Once you hit 20, that‚Äôs the most impact you‚Äôll get for selling. (25% of Base Value)
---
For buying, 25 is the cap. (175% of Base Value)
---
And for low priced items, it ‚Äòcaps‚Äô out sooner.
---
Does your TV support side-by-side/split screen Picture in picture?   
---
If so, that would be the route I‚Äôd take - otherwise, you have to alternate who‚Äôs game session has control of the TV..

But my prices aren't changing at all.
---
I tested this previously with a new character. I built a camp, went and leveled up my character like 20 levels, no difference was made to the space of the camp budget
---
And I have 9 points on Charisma, which are buffed to 12
---
Thanks, same to you!
---
Yeah, that would be grand.
---
I think it would need to be a small or tiny mat, just because I believe people would loose track of it
---
Like a coaster
---
Yup. I met this guy a few days ago- or someone just like him. I also didnt fall for it.
---
But I have never killed a SBQ according to my challenges. Only like 100+ times a week. Just sayn
---
Nice. I was going to say the same thing.
---
20-50 depending on what weapon, but thats is without using performance enhancing chems, foods, mags or bobbleheads
---
Exactly. I've used nuka crypt for a while now, but it's still strange to not be getting any.
---
I only had a couple codes in my inventory though, and then for the next 3 to not spawn at all? Just thought it was strange
---
Wasn't that after they nerfed it because people where crying over the leader board?
---
No, I use nuka crypt and have for the last 70+ nukes, just thought it was strange to not get any codes from officers
---
I havent seen anyone do this for a long time! It used to be the thing to do down in the hallway by the stores in Whitespring. 
---
Ahh. Brings back memories.
---
Freddy's house of fear u may need to server hop as sometimes scorch are there instead of gouls

Why bother locking everything, I thought our camps were invulnerable now unless you play the Workshop lottery?

Thank you so much. ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Hihih. Finally get my collection done.
---
There tends to be one in Fort Defiance
---
Abbies bunker walk down the road from the bunker theres 3 that can spawn in the trees.
---
White springs golf course can have either a wendigo or bloated glowing one downstairs.
---
Yeah this is good both for competitive players and for those that focus on coop/pve.
---
Could just be legacy code from Skyrim and Fallout 4.
---
The cake has 16x the detail while the game it is based off of isn‚Äôt even enjoyable
---
I want to know what's going to happen with existing Gauss Rifle in light of the new Gauss weaponry. Are they going to become Legacy items? Will they coexist with the new stuff? Will they be updated to the new version? Will they get deleted outright? If so, what about existing Legendaries?
---
Maybe it gets highlighted in build mode, like destroyed items do currently?
---
Happy birthday dude!
---
The cake should've been broken
---
I think they just want people to forget about it and all the controversy to go away, honestly.
---
I've gotten my FE gatling plasma up to 70ish per hit, but it's mostly around 50ish. That's head shot numbers, with and without adrenaline. Body shots are 30 to 40.
---
Why bother adding content if people are already paying monthly?
---
It's a rare drop but yes I know it and have gotten it at least 5 times
---
I do
---
I‚Äôve gotten the plan 3 times since the event came out. Each time I got it, it was my keycard that launched the event. I‚Äôve done it at least 100 times beyond that, but I think those were the only times I used my own keycard. 
---
That tells me that using your own keycard at least increases the odds of getting the plan...time for some experimentation...
---
Just make power......passive
---
Classic!  Thanks for pointing it out.  Corrected!  Enjoy.

I found Arthurs Wooden lighter inside Blackwater mine where uranium fever Is held. It in the room next to all the lockers it popped up underneath the cart but have not seen it since.
---
Yeah, ammo conservation's half the reason I settled on a Gauss Rifle as my primary weapon.
---
I repaired one of my turrets recently.  It's brother imediately destroyed it.  I thought it was a fluke, so I repaired it again.  And again the other turret destroyed it.  Screw it, I just went about my business.

If you use marsupial/ bird bones spike trap &amp; a jetpack, you can  launch yourself anywhere on the map üòÅ

Store the bad boy and replace it.

This is the way

Where are you at?  A vendor bot or a vending machine?
---
On ps4 yeah?
---
The lmg is better than the gatling , just prime the lmg , i have both a tse gatling and lmg and use the lmg way mroe simply because ita better , ammo isn't a problem if you prime it , gives you something to do like launch nukes and you can make like 5000 ammo per nuke
---
I‚Äôll take a look...never heard of that one tyty
---
Yep
---
Yup more then enough without green thumb perk.
---
I use a TS LMG as one of my main guns - they're wasted on radroaches but work very well on anything larger than a super mutant. Even without damage perks it only takes about a second of concentrated fire to kill a scorchbeast
---
Wastelanders is Endgame depending on the amount of money they make

Same has happened to me twice within the past week or so. Playing on an xbox one s

Yeah I suppose.

Static spawn at wes tek

You can just place two normal conduits together and then place a wall over top of said conduits. Problem solved :)

Yeah I've gotten it more than once.

                                                eat it
---
My username on ps4 is spodermun if you're able to hop on let me know
---
Except wood armor. Wood armor has like 1 mod for stealth.  No pockets whatsoever.
---
Well if they want the players to forgive them then adding a lot more content that's worth players time and money is the way to go. And a future DLC that goes to a different part of the U.S that we've never seen in a fallout game could do that.
---
It was the plan to support this game for a long time. If it keeps selling and people keep subscribing I dont see why not.
---
A lot if it hinges in its reputation after wastelanders. So better not suck, Bethesda's. I'm trying to play this game a long time
---
Rare you say?

There is a chance the whole server went down.
---
Sure, but when you get one out of a machine it feels special.
---
I think the game has a lot of potential. I hope the extra time Bethesda is taking helps ensure that Wastelanders is good.
---
Yeah this forsure. I crafted a crossbow at 150% on accident for this. Spent like 3 days shooting it and crafting bolts for it. Finally said F this and found the spawns. I think the temple up north has on a table, west side of it.
---
I have received 3 and never used my recall card.
---
when you crash during sbq, is it when the performance drops and the game lags?

if that‚Äôs it you could try what i do to ‚Äúsurvive‚Äù that- I actually turn my back to the action and then stair at the ground with the least amount of textures. that seems to help me but i can‚Äôt really prove it.

Any response to this is speculation. We dont know.

I get 40s with a furious gatling plasma.

I'm a rifleman but pretty much always use the gat for the queen now. I do t remember what my handmade was doing.

What a beautiful cake! I hope you had a wonderful day celebrating :)

Wendigo cave is a good start.  1 in 4 chance of it spawning for "queen of the hunt"

Nothing quite like a buzz freeze after using hundreds of ammo in Scorched Earth Event üòÇ
---
So you rage quit cause the halloween event crashed and never got back on? Most if us here play the game and enjoy it. Just play it. If your not happy dont play it. 
---
These threads are annoying. Search next time too this is asked constantly.
---
It does, I always use it when fighting the SBQ in case I‚Äôm getting attacked and don‚Äôt notice
---
Grape actually doesn‚Äôt change prices directly. It just gives you +5 Charisma, which is what affects prices.
---
Ive had 2 machines in a row give me them before
---
To top it off, my phone froze while rage posting this so ended up being two threads üòÇ
---
They come in pairs, expect another.
---
My game froze at the "press x to respawn" screen. No combinartion of button presses would take me out of it.
---
It's too bad that nuking prime doesn't spawn scorch beasts at all the fissures at once.  That would be fun.
---
It does do more damage, but it's bugged! I've tested it for months, and it only works on big beasts, SBQ etc. 
---
I have 2 laser rifles,  one is limb DMG. 
---
The limb damage hits the SBQ's legs wings and body for 9 DMG per bullet (without VATS)
---
The non-limb DMG hits everywhere on the SBQ for 6 DMG (without VATS)... 
---
Do the math: 6 + 50% = 9 
---
I've also tested this with the Buzzblade on the SBQ without VATS. 
---
Only works on the SBQ, on Ghouls you will only notice the damage if you use VATS concentrated perk, even then it doesn't display the proper damage numbers, as it does with the SBQ, but they still die faster if you aim at their limbs, it's just a UI display error
---
Just here to help. üíù‚úä
---
??
---
Nice, must‚Äôve been lag or something 
---
Thanks mate
---
I wear it because it gives you the cleanest shave.
---
The whitespring golf-club has a possible wendigo spawn. So does the wendigo cave ( savage divide ), Quarry X3 ( cranberry bog ), Freddy's house of fears ( the mire ), and Fort Defience ( Cranberry bog ).
---
There are more potential spawnpoints, but these are super common to see a wendigo spawn in.
---
They have a facebook group.
---
Mineral veins are private loot, and have a playtime-based lockout.
---
I‚Äôm not sure if it is 20 hours to be honest. After a single run and then the silo/gym run I tend to have more than enough lead/lead ore.
---
Totally wrong dude, I've tested limb damage thoroughly since January, read my reply on here. It's just a UI display error, but works totally as intended
---
Wow, entitled much? You do you, but stealing a silo run is b s. Just jump server and launch yours however you like.
---
If you die at the same time as the queen this happens.  Same with the imposter mission. So make sure you dont die when the ads come in at the end. Hope it gets fixed, I like being in on the kill, but it has gotten chancy.
---
actually this was on Flatwoods
---
100% wrong. I've been a limb DMG build for since Jan. Read my reply on this thread. It's just a display error
---
um.....ya. How?
---
It's the wasteland donuts don't come easy my friend ..
---
 you can suppress/turn off by unchecking them via the pip boy.  
---
OPeb the pip boy,something like the 4th tab over.
---
Displays you quest list.  Scroll to the one(s) you dont want to see, and press X (on ps4) to deselect.  It I‚Äôll disappear from the quest list shown on the right side of the screen.
---
yes i checked. i‚Äôm gonna contact support soon i guess
---
At least it doesn't have bugs, since it's community made.
---
Yeah its a real group.  They post some good stuff but other post some pretty classist durogatory BS about peasants and make their group look like trash basically.
---
Fix the stupid melee detection problems, you mean.
---
I think Wastelanders will be the end of support for Fallout 76. They are trying to make it as best as they can so they look good or something, I guess.
---
When I rebuild last time, I used the contractor perk.  
---
its subjective, but I was able to place more stuff down.
---
You can save some budget space with the T-giving display cases.  THey hold 6 items instead of 4, (so you need fewer of them to display the same amount of stuff). They are also 1/2 the width of the glass case, so in theory, and depending on how you arrange the things, you can make your floor plan footprint smaller.
---
Yes it's real.  I'd love it if they had organized pvp sessions so I could put on my ranger outfit and go kill them all.  Afterwards I will put all of their junk in my scrap box.  (just kidding sort of ) They have some good posts on their fb page but also some really classist douchey BS.  I was invited but soon left their trash group.
---
Do you know the 3 w farm run? Not sure why your not getting any.

The prices are from 2077. 58 years of inflation makes a big difference. an inflation of just 2.2% a year would make a 1 dollar donut today cost that much in 2077.
---
Here, I'll just copypaste my comment from r/falloutlore on the subject.
---
*Inflation isn't massive in the fallout universe, the only thing we ever see at absurd prices are oil and gas, and those were specifically pointed out as running out. They weren't expensive due to inflation being rampant, they were expensive because the supply and demand shifted massively to where demand massively outweighed supply.
---
Lets take the magazines you find for example. The cover of the ''Astoundingly awesome tales'' comics say that they cost 29$ to buy in 2077.
---
if they are akin to an avengers comic book then they would cost 3.99$ in 2015 ( when the game released ). At an inflation of 3,3% every year you would end up with the magazine costing 29,8$ in 2077.
---
So the inflation for comic books in the fallout universe are a little under 3,3% per year since 2015, which is nowhere near being out of control levels of inflation.
---
We also have the price for a large coffee and jelly donut combo at slocums joe. In 2077 this combo was priced at 30$. In real life a coffee and donut combo could definitely cost as much as 5$ today ( hell my friend paid around 7$ for a coffee and pastry the other day, 5$ would be a good deal ). So if such a deal goes for 5$ now then the inflation would only need to be 2.93% to cost 30$ in 2077.
---
Inflation being rampant in the fallout universe is just never shown to be true. Normal every-day items ( except oil since there is next to none left in the world ) have followed a quite stable 3%ish inflation rate. Sure 3% is on the higher end of normal ( most governments want to hit an inflation rate of 2-3%), but 3% is still nothing any economist would freak out at.
---
The reason we find stacks of money is because singular bills will have blown away or otherwise been destroyed by centuries of decay. Bigger stacks of bills however had an easier time surviving ( either due to being kept in more secure and dry locations or by just having more that needs to be destroyed before it is completely gone ). The denomination of these stacks is also not 100% certain, since the texture itself implies it is 20$ while the Skylanes smuggling manifest puts them at 100$. Chances are that the stacks represent all possible denomination stacks, be it 20, 50 or 100.
---
*We can figure out roughly how many bills there are in a stack though. If you scrap a stack of pre-war money then you get 1 cloth, which weighs 0.1 ( probably pounds in this case ). Since a bill weighs 1 gram and you need 454 grams in a pound we can figure out that there are roughly 45 bills in a stack, which we can round up to 50 to account for any waste while scrapping. So a stack of bills is worth roughly 1000$. The skylanes smuggling manifest also mentions smuggling 2500$ in cash, so clearly they aren't having any problems with hyper-inflation in the criminal world at least.

They are worth doing.  As long as you do any damages you get loot.  A lot of events are how you are going to get some plans or recipes. Plenty also have a guaranteed legendary creature so as long as someone doesn't kill that instantly, you doing any damages gives you a legendary item.  Also, some events go a lot faster when more people are involved, eg go pick up a bunch of stuff.

Yea they're good for xp, rewards like plans and fusioncores. With lvl 16 stick to the Forrest, toxic valley and maybe ash heap.

I mean they said that they want the game to run for years. If they want that to happen then there needs to be more than Wastelanders. Just look at ESO and how much DLC in different regions of the Elder Scrolls it covers and I'm pretty sure they're still adding more several years after launch.
