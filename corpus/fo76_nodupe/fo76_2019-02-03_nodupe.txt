God this is so annoying. I'd rather a reward system where you'd have to grind an amount of tokens but atleast you know you're going to get something.
---
Negative just confirmed it's the heavy gunner perks the adjust it.
---
Trolling right?
---
The action to trigger is probably broken or conflicts with some shit, I'm not a developer by any means so idk. It's just frustrating sometimes, you log in. Literally nothing to do.
---
Free travel between all train stations after completing a quest to restore the railroad would be awesome, was always thinking of that. 
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
However, we will never seen an actual moving, ridiable train in this game. This engine. 
---
Maybe we will get mounts one day, at best. But two different objects, one moving on the other while one is moving through the static world? Never.
---
Might be walking [into a trap](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ado8x1/i_built_an_oven_and_then_roasted_players_alive/)... 
---
Because they're stupid
---
It takes so long to make a new build from that though
---
lol, just stop buying video games from big ivory tower publishers. Just stop it already. Goddamn.
---
Right? I wonder where all the Yelp reviews and Reddit hot takes are about their lights working or the fact that they received what they ordered at a restaurant.
---
Explanation for the derpy hot take: People don't praise the things they expect to work a certain way.
---
What you are going to start seeing is all the past TSE people complaining they can't point blank TSE shotgun someone who can VATS teleport one-shot them. The circle of life continues.
---
Exactly
---
They already have a setting to turn voice chat off, I don't see how this is much different 
---
Not sure what platform, but someone was asking for legendary rolling pins the other day.  It think it was on filthy casuals or the flea market sub. 
---
Well, yes.i don't think that events give you unique outfits
---
Agreed. Even worse, I only recently noticed that the spreadsheet with all the loot tables also has drop rates on there.  And holy hell are they abysmal. 
---
I honestly think someone at Beth put an extra 0 after the decimal on the Mire Events without realizing it and the result is the nightmare we are in. 
---
I joined a community on PS4 and it’s all about trading, and surprisingly it wasn’t toxic 
---
I just had this. All I can pull up is pipboy but cant close it. When I hit map it comes up, will accept caps to travel, but upon spawning in again I'm in same place and still cant move
---
It's less of a issue for the casual player and more a problem with min max builds. A properly setup melee will tank and one punch you every time.
---
YES please. I have to stop using to explore indoors, cant see anything.
---
Yeah thx
---
That's actually part of what I was referring to.
---
I figured we'd be hearing people crying about nerfing melee VATS.
---
But nothing. Not a sound. It's as if PvP isn't even popular.
---
If I’m teammates with someone who owns a workshop, and they get attacked, am I in pvp as well? 
---
at least they can't 1 shot you through the DR anymore 
---
Better get to it words are meaningless bro. this guy's all about action obviously
---
Then it's the same thing. Ignore people. It's fine.
---
Are you fat-shaming combat armor?
---
Only Gatling guns... the ammo issue is because I cannot sell it.
---
Nope. Shoot through the train in Goldeneye then do the same in RDR2. Former is more fun, despite the beauty in the latter
---
I'm fairly new, but also looking to team up If anyone still plays. User name is richard_long
---
What they need to do is have a bunch of spots with boss type enemies. Nuke west Tek you get a super behemoth, nuke black water mine you get two mole miners grafted together, nuke watoga you get a liberty prime knock off.

https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alufua/psa_after_patch_scrapping_all_breaks_all_bulk/efjlohc/?context=0
---
Woah this is exactly what’s wrong, I don’t know why their just now acting up
---
Believe it just negates the int bonus. As intelligence bonus caps at 15 anyways.
---
I can see where lack of new content for those who have put in the hours to complete all of the quests would make the game boring.  I'm not quite there yet, still have some quests to finish.  But I do get the frustration.
---
On the other hand, it's only been out for two months and Bethesda has been spending that time fixing some major bugs and, yes, tweaking some of the game play settings.
---
The point is that it just wasn't ready when Bethesda released it.  As such, the reality is that new content takes a back seat.  It sucks, but I wouldn't expect new content for another month.  
---
The one area where there has been new content are the weekly challenges...  
---
I think this would be really nice to have in the game..it sounds a lot better than the game we have now
---
I thought she was saying the F word 
---
Try either having them all on your person or in your stash. That might fix your problem 
---
My experience has been that one side has an invisible hit box that extends out farther than the model. Try flipping it around when you go to place it.
---
Also, and I might be crazy but it seems like it's easier to place stuff when I'm moving an existing object rather than placing it "new" from storage.
---
I'm on PS4 as well if you wanted to see how mine looks up against the door.
---
Thank you!
---
What about bulk converting to scrap when changing zones?? 
---
Why does everyone think melee is the best look don't get me wrong it's a good build for pve maybe pve but a sneak critical build can take them out really quick even without sneak.
---
Literally typed what you just did but you beat me to it could not agree more... co-op Fallout, PVP was DOA as the game is literally not set up for it in any way: it’s rules, skills, classes, “builds”, factions, player economy etc. it lacks almost all the elements to make it viable...
---
Yeah I can do all the same things.... There is not much to mess up with a melee build in a rad suit. Pretty much solos the queen? Yeah I can pretty much solo the queen if someone gets the adds and gets her on the ground. It's just high damage value and armor piercing. Not rocket science and everything in the game is easier in power armor with heavy weapons. That's my point. Low health melee is fun because the added difficulty, not because it's singularly OP.
---
I would agree with you under normal circumstances but people have reported issues that have gone weeks without a response.
---
These are not normal times. 
---
That's another confusion on the sub.
---
PvP was never popular. No one did Hunter/Hunted, Monster Mash, Battle that Never Was, etc.
---
All they did was blow up CAMPs with the "loser" complaining they couldn't defend themselves. Now they at least sort of can, well.... Until people learn how to roll armor. A few people thought they were gankers and the rest of the sub clapped along with "raider rp".
---
Just saw this now. Literally have no idea why you out this down but we are in agreement so i dont really understand..
---
Holy $hit I'm so pissed right now.  I just saw someone with wanted on the map, I dropped to his location and he said "do it."  I turn off pacifist and shoot him some.  Now- I recall doing this in the past and even 1 tapping someone gave me cap reward.  SO  I was just messing around and thought I'd shoot him with a weak weapon.  I tapped him, but then he ran up to me and 1 hit melee killed me. 
---
Guess what??  I loose 100 caps.
---
I try and hit revenge like an idiot and he kills me again I loose 100 caps.
---
SO let me get this straight, someone is WANTED, I shoot them and they kill me and I LOOSE caps?  Why the hell would I want to shoot anyone then.  Why would a non-wanted player loose caps?
---
I'm so pissed about this - really put a bad taste in my mouth for the whole game.  
---
What is the deal with this??
---
Then charge the players a subscription to use the mods. Muhahah. 
---
Bob Ross of fallout 76.  I love it!
---
I'm hoping they expand the CAMP system to a point where you can do that.
---
Private servers, or city systems - allow workshops to be controlled by Clans, for example. It wouldn't work well with the server system we have but... meh.
---
Update: as of current patch, vendor bot Chad in Camden Park sells plans for Excavator Calibrated Shocks for 6000 caps.
---
The 300dmg fire axe warriors are happy now, game is balanced.
---
You'll have better success on the market subreddit
---
Yeah you ain’t on FO4 matey ;)
---
So last night I noticed something weird that seems to contradict this. My brother in law and I were in a team, me in pacifist and him in open pvp. He started attacking this person and that person shot back. So I fast traveled in and started attacking but it said I had pacifist on and I wasn't doing any damage to the person. Maybe a bug from being out of zone and then traveling in? 
---
Months one would think is long enough..     
---
As for the workflow, as I understand it usually, assuming there is multiple people on the team you'd have some working on running down complicated issues and some doing the "smaller" but time consuming error corrections that just involve substitutions.  
---
In many of these cases the fact it's a bug is widely know.     
---
  
---
Correcting a keyword in a mod, or switching the correct leveled list of armor record usage is something that takes under a minute once you have the FormID's in hand.   
---
   
---
Yes some of the more complicated things would take longer, without question, especially for QA testing,  but fixing it so for example "Optimized Bracers" did what they were supposed to, takes no time at all.
---
If you hit someone on his team he can kill you without getting a bounty 
---
I hope you’re right...
---
If you’re a duper I’m gonna report the bejesus outta you. 
---
With the right perk/legendary modifier/mods the harpoon gun goes from shitty to one shot the SBQ...
---
A friend of mine got one up to 4500+ damage to 5500+ via chems and adrenaline. I forgot what legendary effects it had.
---
Oh there’s a market subreddit? Could you please send me the link?
---
LOl I just posted my complaint with the same situation.  I'm going to try and make a support case because that is the dumbest system ever.  So you are penalized for trying to attack a wanted player?  Why EVER turn off pacifist then?
---
They need to Minecraft it up a notch. 
---
Make Workshop defense rounds, for example. Waves and waves of churning masses of Ghouls.
---
Yes I think it is done that way on purpose as well. I've just been thinking about the idea of boosting perks and stats at the same time cause for certain fights I always pop a med-x or psychotats but pretty much just keep mentats to sell. I also have a lot of perks that I rarely use on my current build but would be cool to  have on as a temporary bonus. 
---
But I get the hint. Downvoted to oblivion right out of the gate. Obviously not a popular idea.
---
Oh hell no, legit all the way duping ruins the fun man
---
500 atoms for your trouble.
---
I loved collecting power armor in Fallout 4. In this game, I simply can't do it. I ended up scrapping my excavator armor after I got calibrated shocks for my T-60 and the Ultracite. I simply can't justify the space it takes up in my inventory when I now have suits with higher DR and the same carry weight.
---
"Bogtown" It's north of Watoga. 
---
This is also pissing me off, I can't farm ghouls without getting rad worms
---
Good man! Tired of servers crashing all the time. 
---
Yeah that was a mistype I knew what he meant.
---
That would make nukes seem a lot more interesting along with a reason to consider where you drop your nukes.
---
Squatting in chameleon also doesn't show you on the map. It is my favorite way to take out wanted players.
---
If you say so...   (grin)
---
In my personal opinion, it's not a very good song.  But hey, taste is personal...  (grin)
---
"Bogtown" It's on the road north of Watoga. 
---
I know! I hope Bethesda can take action
---
When this has happened have you crouched to check to see if it was reporting you engaged / at threat?   
---
AP and health regen do so at different rates in and out of combat, so curious if this is related to one of the Stealth bug people have been reported..
---
[removed]
---
I have no issues with my inventory/stash.
---
*Inventory:*
---
Pump Shotgun, Double-Barrel Shotgun, Hunting Knife, Bowie Knife, .44 Pistol.
---
Five armor pieces - two of which are Weightless, all of which are ultra-light mod.
---
50x Stimpak, 15x Rad-Away, 5x Rad-X, 10x Psychobuff, 5x Nuka Quantum, 10x Dog Food, 10x Purified Water
---
With perks and armor legendaries, comes to about 80 pounds.
---
*Stash:*
---
Approximately 50x each material except for 430x ballistic fiber, 200x steel, 100x aluminum, 100x screw. Weighs in around 500 altogether.
---
I have everything I need. Anything else I need for special projects, I can easily get.
---
The bots are quite busy on their own renovations, 25 years and counting.
---
guerilla is a new perk and build made for fallout 76 and I was saying that all SMGs should be under this perk and not commando
---
Why are you bringing RDR2 and Rockstar games into the mix?
---
Sometimes if you have too many holotapes in your inventory, it won’t let you load a holotape for a mission. It’s weird as hell, but if you dump your nonessential holotapes and then try to load the mission tape, it should work. Good luck!
---
I don't see why they don't already work this way. Or why mole miners are capped at 40. I can fight level 50 dogs for good loot but not a mole miner -_- 
---
Bethesda could have nerfed damage on CAMPs with 3 lines of code.
---
I'm not sure what the draw to wrecking someone's CAMP was but I'm sure a Bloodied melee build could still destroy a base.
---
Beat me to it lol
---
Lol you're the guy that kept boasting about cheating a few weeks ago right? XD gosh what a change of heart my dude.
---
Except the nuka guys all of those are in game... the fatman users are rare as hell. Chamoclaws are everywhere... I killed like 4 of them last night.
---
Yeah i kinda figured it would be a long shot but hey never hurts to suggest it.
---
joining through a friend. 
---
Exactly. They will never pull Fortnite fans to the shitty pvp of FO76. Not sure why they are trying. There are tons of people who dont like shooter games with pvp. They need to cater to the coop audience. The most fun in this game are events with people helping, exploring, and fighting together. 
---
One of my main concerns was that the survival part of the game would get tedious &amp; frustrating. So far that part of the game is tolerable for me. However, the perk card system is tedious &amp; frustrating! It might have worked in Fallout 4, but in a game with no pause button it is a really bad idea. This is especially true when crafting at your camp! All the crafting perks replace most of the damage &amp; defense perks. If you base gets attacked you have to spend 3 or 4 minutes trying to find the cards to switch them back. If you are not in a safe place you will be dead. This was only an issue for me when I was a low level with a camp in a high level area.
---
The TL:DR of any "How the fuck did they break *that*?" is that Bethesda is a small indie dev full of people working on their first game.
---
Mistakes happen even for professionals, but BSG consistantly makes amateur mistakes in *every single patch*.
---
I don't understand how you guys get to place so much stuff. I make a simple box house and the budget is full
---
I need to start using pacifist mode. Accidentally shot someone’s generator one time. 10 cap wanted level. Owner killed me and took my junk. Such is life in the wastes.
---
Everything now feels like a chore in the game. 
---
I have a compromise for the demo 5 being less useful as a 5 perk. Use demo 1 instead for 20% damage and use the other 4 points towards adrenaline. 
---
Until this is fixed I'm going to have to get myself a lot of antibiotics
---
I guess that's why there aren't any conversation about PvP builds or strategy.
---
You haven't run into a good one then. Im running about 550dr and er, on top of sentinel armor, dodge and evasive perks, you would be lucky to kill me before I tele smashed.
---
They finished renovations on the whitespring, they're just maintaining the grounds now. They can't have new guests because no inspection has been made. Overseer uses the capitol systems to get credentials and fully opens the whitespring!
---
Nice!
---
Truth is, the game was rigged from the start.
---
Todd Howard needs to weigh in on more posts.
---
All those posts were made by people"quitting the game" and they quit posting. Nobody cares they quit and down voted it all.
---
A bad glitch more than likely. 
---
You were boasting about being a duper in a raider clan not long ago, what happened that made you change your tone like that?
---
It's part of how the weapons work, inside each weapon there is a leveled list for its assigned ammo, and when weapons are assigned to a npc or player, it's hitting that leveled list to ensure the NPC has ammo to fire said weapon against the player 
---
Yeah, I just dump missiles, fatman, 2mm EC, grenades, mines, grenade launcher ammo, flares, fuel, etc.
---
I only keep .45, 10mm, 5.56, shells, fusion cells, fusion cores, and plasma grenades.  I also hang on to 5mm for the few times when I feel like picking up a minigun from a mutant and just playing around with it.
---
Boooo

Containers aren’t resetting, to include cap stashes. 
---
Running around in Poseidon collecting caps and loot. I’ve returned several times today and anything I pulled from a container hasn’t respawned anything. 
---
It’s been 24 hours since I first went through the area and still have nothing in any container I that I pulled from. 
---
Such a nice skin for such a useless weapon...
---
I always hear it as “tug him in the morning”.... 
---
Happening on Xbox for me
---
first time I've heard the suggestion, but I am all for it.
---
They’re*
---
Thanks! I have been competing with the rest of the scavengers infiltrating Sugar Grove this whole time!
---
LOL omg I just HAD to pass by your profile to check your comments after the one I read a minute ago. Now cheaters should be banned...? If  I recall correctly, and believe me, I do. A few weeks back you were making fun of everyone (myself included) who thought being proud of cheating was retarded. You ARE a cheater. You dupped to no end and announced it proudly in this very subreddit, you stockpiled tons of things that way and now you're advocating for fair play and against cheaters? You were also proud of using those things you got by means of cheating to ruin other players' experience. My dude, being a cheater does suck, but you are full of shit.
---
It also doesn’t help that there aren’t that many incentives to fight higher leveled ekes because a level 1 wolf will most likely drop the same loot as a level 30 wolf. Also it isn’t fun to kill a legendary super mutant master to get 5 fusion cells, 3 caps, a frag mine, and a legendary bloodied cane or a nocturnal wooden left arm.
---
It's a pretty neat mechanic, actually.  The cloud gets +1 damage for every negative FO76 Reddit post.
---
Well that's what I'm saying. They are the ones that "extended" the engine. Before they took it was an at least ok engine  made for online gameplay. They used that and changed it very poorly because they wanted bdtter offline. Even if they had another engine I would think their games would be filled with bugs and glitches, they can't even fix years old bugs or don't care idk.  
---
They wouldn't do any better with a new engine, even worse as time goes on. IMHO.
---
I think a more powerful message from the whiny angst-ridden "I quit" crowd would be a message of silence.
---
Show us the power of your quitting with stoic silence. That would really show Bethesda.
---
ikr 😂
---
So is this intended then? If so I will delete. 
---
Disagree, game is poor, especially poor in terms of PVP.  Engine isn’t the problem or potential saviour.  The idea of a PVP Fallout based on FO4 mechanics is fatally flawed... the game itself, isn’t sophisticated enough. RDR2 is poor too, they both can be poor, it’s not mutually exclusive.  A hell of a lot of poor games recently, we can only hope developers take notice and try to finish products, or at least don’t make cynical, shareholder pleasing cash grabs with microtransactions without least making the base game semi-decent.
---
You're still a cheater, you were very public about how being a cheater was fun. What happened huh? You can downvote me all you like, but I will never not call you out on this new righteousness of yours. Don't be sanctimonious when you are a cheater yourself.
---
Agreed need some way to form a community within the game
---
Bloodied melee build does just find but it takes a whole lot longer. TSE is AOE on every shot.
---
Once the player shows up to defend their CAMP melee is actually more viable, anyway. It was just to easy to lollercopter in a circle with TSE - which was the same for PVE and also why you see tears over the nerf.
---
My bloodied build has never changed and includes melee and ranged. My explosive build just requires an additional shot now. It's not at all a big deal, except Bloodied is slightly less accessible because people try to minmax and ride at 20% which can cost them a PVP battle pretty quickly.
---
Which leads to the point of: Risk vs reward was just straight up broken _especially_ after the fireproof buff when you could point blank people with a TSE and not die.
---
Me too
---
We've nuked it half a dozen times, with scorched up, with someone standing in the blast zone to make sure it stays scorched..   
---
We don't always get glowing ones.. Like one out of six times we did.  
---
Hell one time we had ghouls up, and they didn't turn into bloated glowing ones either.
---
This.
---
This is a good idea, maybe away to trade pictures too, and a terminal were visitors can look and even purchase pictures that can be crafted in to a wall decoration.
---
The guy you are answering to made a post 2 weeks ago bragging about being a duper, he's just acting like he's against it now because dupers are finally getting banned.
---
If you walk from the golf club towards whitespring going past the tennis court there is a little round structure with a water fountain, it is sulphur water and will cure disease. Dont think allot of players know of this healing fountain
---
I don't know if it's really intended for the player to benefit from it, but it's a side effect of how the weapon system works.
---
Thanks!
---
I don't know. I don't have the perk.
---
Gotcha, thank you. 
---
Do they really cap at 15?
---
I heard that there is a stacking of unyielding bug that you can get crazy amount of int and this crazy amount of conditions. 
---
"negative but truthful" The only truth is that there's a lot of butthurt dupers, that is all. Plus when you have 100 posts about quitters, the good content gets flushed away so removal of those is good.
---
I think I have the plasma gun plan how many should I make and under what conditions 
---
What can I say, I am a new person now.
---
In the sadness and soil of that sad earthly scene, only then I am human. Only then I am clean.
---
GTA VI damn I must've missed that release.....other than that mistake well written and thought out yeah FO76 seems to get more hate than it deserves but RDR2 and GTA are not riddled with bugs and work as intended.
---
I think people are most upset at the fact the funs gone it's turning into grind sessions I swear almost like doing chores I honestly log in every day just to get caps nothing else I've spent more time grinding the same areas for weapons to sell than doing missions. 
---
We may have forgotten how riddled with bugs Fallout 4 was when released but who'd of ever thought they would use the same engine.
---
The best areas to farm were nerfed pours one out for the way whitespring used to be)
---
The best guns were nerfed
---
 
---
Duribilty of weapons and armor is a thing of the past we can't empty a clip without having to repair our 200% repaired guns
---
XP has been nerfed accross the board
---
Prices are super inflated
---
Perks nobody ever complained about or cared about were nerfed seriously white night and licensed plumber pipe guns suck no one used them why the hell would you make shitty guns shittier
---
It's obvious at this point BGS idea to keep us playing is to make it harder to play instead of keeping it fun RDR2 and GTA V always stayed fun to play no matter how many times you repeated the same style quest.
---
I'm holding out hope for this game but I don't know for how much longer.
---
Where are the dungeons, the raids, the endless modes ?
---
What the game really lacks tho is actual enemies. I mean I felt overwhelmed by the number of mobs maybe 2 times in my entire playthrough. I want swarms and swarms of enemies when I nuke something. I want to have to retreat sometimes , facing an army. Add some roaming pack of mobs, that are both dangerous and rewarding. 
---
I want to feel IN DANGER. Not a walking powerhouse that nothing can hinder. 
---
"[Sometimes... it doesn't just work...](https://youtu.be/50KimbZkW6k?t=15)"
---
Bender confirmed
---
Yes, I bet the threat of consequences finally made you reevaluate your life and all /s.
---
You can logically deduce that it must be that way for inventory, crafting, and building to work the way it does. 
---
Yep this worked.  Thanks.
---
That's a very good idea and good investment of points, Thank you
---
Definitely. The RNG in this game needs to be reigned in. We shouldn't be getting awesome loot all of the time, but it'd be nice if a level 91 3* legendary death claw would remove some garbage items from the rolls instead of giving me a weightless woonden left leg
---
Oh I hate you just a little right now for having the quad version. I would love that. The plasma flamer is great for decimating groups of ghouls sans the obvious in glowing ones. Still useful, but those guys have tons of defense against it which makes sense I suppose.
---
Lol he's scared of being banned apparently
---
I just want to dig some trenches and role play as a gruff WWI officer.
---
You need to see the bigger picture.
---
Weird. 
---
Quadruple tension and grants the ability to spring underwater....
---
I would believe this, if your game wasn't so broken. Fix the game, instead of banning people who probably got that much normally. It might be a rare item, but due to massive amounts of bugs within your game. That might be a whole new bug in its self! Rare items are not so rare at all. How about instead of banning people, fix your game. 
---
There was a purpose for that specific post. It had the desired reaction.
---
Yeah, great tip, but curing them _is actually the problem_. ;)
---
I either need them to not ever cure or they need to fix whatever causes it to break the mutations when they are cured. ;)
---
It's an older meme sir, but it checks out
---
They could also simply make sure the player is invincible when they load in UNTIL they move. Wouldn't be too hard to do but... again... this is bethesda we're talking about...
---
You are full of it.
---
For a game who’s sole enjoyable aspect is combat after they’ve removed many rpg elements they sure have found ways to make combat unenjoyable and reward less.
---
But why do the groups of enemies attacking my camp always kill Sasha? Everytime! I had to plant some razorgrain just to have on standby for her nightly death. I have perfectly good flamingos and corn to shoot and instead they ALWAYS kill her.
---
Just head straight for the cave and skip the first few parts of the mission you'll still get credit for it when you find the person in the cave
---
If you mean full of omelet, you are correct. I had too much for dinner.
---
You can.
---
The best content they could add would be sandbox style content, AND more challenging structured content to tackle.
---
Sandbox content: 
---
- CAMP and settlements, with NPC settlers, jobs, resources, and things to build towards
---
- Additional things to "build up":  Levels and gear on NPC settlers, add new rare resources, add numerical skills that enhance crafting and other aspects of the game
---
- More random events with unique rewards
---
- Re-balance the current items, HP, damage to make sense for more viable and unique builds
---
Structured Content: 
---
- More bosses
---
- Gauntlet style no resurrection challenges or dungeons
---
- More levels of gear
---
Lol yeah ok, keep telling yourself that, cheater got scared? Or did you end up really getting banned for cheating? Come on dude, how can you defend what you're doing? Seriously xD white knight attitude and all.  
---
Meh, literally every online game I have played where people get banned there are people who go and post on forums making shit up about how they did nothing wrong and still got banned. It is very often discovered that they were cheating/botting/hacking/doing something they weren't supposed to be doing. It is very common, people just want their accounts back and think if they can convince enough people on the forums maybe something will happen.
---
Did you die? It happenes to me a lot if I die. I come back w full health and no rads and hardly take damage or rads at all. 
---
Same build. 
---
That would be cool, but I don't think we'll ever get it because Bethesda said no NPCs, if you know what I mean  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
---
BOS combat armor mod plans are normally at Grafton station but I haven’t seen them since the latest patch. You can try server hopping for them at Grafton 
---
I have yes, and it’s the same both in and out of combat. Stops at certain increments, regens slowly then stops again. Even makes sprinting while traveling quite annoying since it’ll still take awhile to regen back to full out of combat.
---
Why would I get banned? My inventory is perfectly clean, I have no mules, no shady business. Everything is legit ;)
---
I'm confused. I went to this site and only found a few iron ore veins. Is there an entrance to a mine I'm missing somewhere?
---
Why are you advocating against cheating now? You are a cheater. Admittedly so.
---
.
---
People say things that happen in game that can't happen in game. Understand?
---
OK. Phoenix had them. Finally got em. But it seriously took like 3 or 4 server hops. 
---
Yes, they are weak on thier own but strong in numbers
---
tbh this is the only time I wish the thread kept going lmao
---
I managed to stay alive for the whole thing. 
---
I'd question your math on that. 
---
Assume a gun pre nerf does 201 DMG and an enemy at 600 HP....... 3 shots.
---
80% nerf on explosive brings that same gun to 120 DMG......5 shots.
---
Of course that is only for explosive and not counting the Nerf to Demolition Expert or considering a TSE.
---
I found with being a rifleman adding just 2 points into any of the rifleman perks (to max it out) gave more damage that 5 in demolition. Maybe try to give 1 demolition and the other 4 in heavy gunner and shotgunner perks. 
---
It's just a bunch of laser pistols taped together. 
---
Oh, great. It was bad enough when it happens when I die. Can't wait for it to happen out of nowhere like it did for you. 
---
Pure RNG worked fine in single player fallout 4 where items had no level. The radroach drops an explosive minigun. The super mutants drops an explosive minigun... They're the same gun. Now ones level 35 and ones 50. 
---
They were... Manually, by me, the first time I got any and before I realized their use. That was a facepalm moment. 
---
what the what? I’ve been farming firecaps and thistle like an ass.
---
To be fair. I was just messing around. But okay. Sorry I got you all worked up. 
---
Come on now, let's not jump into conclussions!
---
I used to collect 500 dirty waters by spamming ‘r’ on a lake. Then, turn then into boiled waters for the xp. Then realized i gained like only 200 xp. 
---
So i stopped doing that. 
---
But no ban!
---
Have someone kill you
---
That wasn't vanilla, it came with one of the DLCs
---
Ok dude. I'm done. I had a good laugh. Thank you. 
---
Cant collect thought only work when drinking
---
Fun experiences for this game were 2-3 patches ago, sorry you missed it, it was when there were tens of players...
---
And thank you, my friend. See you in Appalachia. Come visit me at Grafton some time.
---
Very, even weirder at one point we returned and it switched from scorched (post nuke) to Molemen, so either bad luck or it's somewhat random 
---
Nah, I don't play with cheaters. See you never ♡
---
I question your math as you're assuming those shots total exactly 100% of an enemy's HP when they could easily be 45% + 45% + 10% but the same damage per shot.... Right? Why would I be doing _exactly_ the total HP of a mob in damage? Is that the psychic affix? ;)
---
Grognaks axe is bugged with weapon artesian it does not work atm
---
It will be nice and quick. You can trust me...!
---
Straw man.
---
Now you're just arguing for the sake of arguing.
---
I wonder if it can be used on my Western Revolver.
---
I highly advise finding a junk pile site, move your C.A.M.P. to it, and setting up a reasource extractor.  That coupled with all the typewriters, hot plates, fans, etc you can find.  I prefer the West Tek region and all surrounding satellite dish areas surrounding it.  
---
Just more evidence that we need to have a lot of enemy types buffed in nukes. So mole miners especially aren't total garbage 
---
Weird...
---
Why should I have to gain another level to use skills I already have? That doesn't make sense. It's just a workaround for a game with a flawed system.
---
That's another good spot. Just depends on what's close to where you like to farm. 
---
Okay so it's not just me , thanks ! Hope they fix it soon 
---
+1
---
Honey... grafton is a shitty low level area. You're always so proud of the wrong things. It's tragically funny really. 
---
IIRC that card was never meant for melee. I believe there is a melee equivalent, makeshift warrior maybe. I will have to look it up.
---
You are the hero the Wasteland needs sir. Forward-thinking from the player base is the only thing that is going to drive this game forward. Clearly the Developers will not be.
---
Agree, rewatched the '76 announcement and they said it would be completely new, super buffed mobs...   
---
Maybe eventually?
---
No clarification, could be either. 
---
Yeah, kinda kills the build a bit... "Fortunately" after the durability nerf I carry a furious sledge too. 
---
The thing is, even if there is barely any endgame content, people will always find something to do as proven time and time again by player organized raids and the semi competitional camp building. 
---
All of this required the game to actually run smooth and work without people crashing half the time or the game deleting items.
---
Take me for instance, I am unable to play due to my characters randomly chaning direction when walking through the world. Beth help support is supposedly working on a solution but thats been going on for three weeks now...
---
WhiteSprings can still be used to effectively power level if you have someone who can trigger the respawns 
---
This happened to me with the last pack I got. Master Hacker was one of the cards in the pack, but it was gone when I went to apply it. I already had Hacker and Expert Hacker, so I figured I could just swap out a different Int card whenever I needed to use Master Hacker.  I used my level-up point on something else, only to find I didn't have the card anymore. That being said, I can count on one hand the number of times I've come across a level 3 terminal, and I don't think they're needed to complete any quests.
---
If you are on PC, I'd be happy to help you get set up for success. 
---
To put it into perspective my explosive shotgun does 435dmg without max demo, 475 with all 5 points. Any +% damage effects explosive damage I believe, bloody defiantly does. 
---
Straw man my ass. You misunderstood and made a bad assumption. Anecdotally, if it takes me one more shot there's no math that makes yours correct. Trying to interject that this is somehow a debate when conversationally it doesn't work..... You did bad. You should feel bad.
---
I'M NOT EVEN GONNA ASK.
---
No, I use All Rise as backup to Grognak... the super sledge repairs to 200%
---
That's why it was chosen! Business has gone pretty well, though, and we have expanded our influence to Pleasant Valley as well. So if you don't like Grafton you can meet us there!
---
3\* legendaries have always dropped random \* loot. It shouldn't be this way but it is.. and it sucks. 
---
I wouldn't mind if we never saw a 50+ mole miner outside of nuke zones. Give them a huge drill. Or some sort of minigun meets shotgun bahahaha
---
Putting things in Manichaean terms accentuates differentiation. In terms of open world games, Rockstar focuses on graphics first, while BGS focuses on gameplay. This is clearly an oversimplification, but it was something I found it interesting to think about. What is the purpose of a game if not fun. 76 is fun. Monster mash is like an awesome counter strike level. Red Dead looks better, but it's less fun, with clunky controls, &amp;c. Why is one hated and the other lauded? These thoughts all went into my reasoning
---
I'll be on later, closing in on end game. Right now,  I'm just gaining and exploring.  SILENTDARTH1 on xbl. 
---
Gatling shotgun! 
---
The whole leveling system is flawed, instead of making it so a level 10 could go to an area around the vault and find a level 50 weapon make it so the areas where you find these weapons  are filled with more hazards so it would take someone who’s around level 50 would have the skills and equipment to get it. It sucks to find a high level weapon early in and just have to wait 40 levels to use it. Also the game considers legendaries more level required then normal weapons, why is a nocturnal tire Iron considered a level 20 weapon while a black powder rifle is only level 15.
---
I believe that was debunked as ppl tried selling pa as super condition and it broke just as quick as a 200% repaired.
---
Only if we can get one too, maybe limited to only usable in PA?
---
Sweet  playing for a at least a few more hours find me when you login
---
Lol srsly how BAD are you at this game without cheating?! You're all talk buddy 
---
Yeah. And I'm absolutely sick of questing on my level 23 alt and constantly running into 50+ mobs because a level 100+ walked by an hour ago
---
Have about a dozen queen kills sense patch and I've been able to sneak as long as someone else has her attention. Don't cluster with the pack and fight at a distance.
---
Should I know who Joseph Anderson is ? 
---
No, there are tons of people with valid issues.   
---
Trying to associate all of the frustrated posts with dupers is a little short sighted.
---
Now you're overreacting
---
Same issue. My sniper rifle gets replaced by my hunting rifle. Both are .308s.
---
The Teddy Bears.
---
Those things are OP.
---
Why put it in the game if we can't have it? Ehh unless we're killing Frank Horrigan. But that abomination's weapons are too much even for PA
---
It's a lot easier when you're in a team, because multiple players get XP for each enemy. When solo you're better off getting most of your XP from events, especially if you're not playing stealth sniper.
---
They could maybe fix this by awarding bonus solo XP if there's no-one else nearby when an enemy dies, although I suspect they wanted to encourage players to team up.
---
It’s dumb that the game still treats itself as a single player game where the game revolves around a player character when there are dozens of player characters in a single world, why not just make it so certain places are filled with certain level creatures.
---
I love how at the start he says it isnt another hate video and then proceeds to ramble like one.
---
Talk and bobbleheads.
---
It also rebuilt itself each time and became the corner stone of Western Civilization. 
---
They fell away off the "leader board" due to a number of other posts, and well, once people quit in droves (or took a break) there are few follow up posts.  
---
The sub seems much quieter the second half of this week
---
It's the law of large numbers bro.
---
With a large enough sample size your random situational percentages will regress back to their mean average.
---
Sure it's possible that you could only need one more shot after a series of fortunate events. There is a difference between possibility and probability.
---
Long term based if if base damage numbers just looking at the explosive perk on a rifle......for every 600 points in damage resist.......you would need to fire 2 additional shots......1200 damage resist 4 extra shots........1600 damage resist 6 extra shots.
---
Your math is wrong. You significantly tried to down play the stats.
---
I'm all for that! Except in the instance of nuke zones. They should buff everything to 50+ even radroach. Give us the gargantuan rad roaches from fallout tactics 
---
PSN: Sixtoned  (TLDR: unfortunately no W, but will go to great lengths) but have an anti armor/weight reduction Max level gaunt I believe and if not have serum recipes, TSE movespeed 3* .50 cal(will prime if you like), caps . Myriad of outfits too. Hunters longcoat,  longshoreman,  clean spacesuit. I have a pretty large group of trading community friends so will ask,  but good god I will give you whatever you want for a bloodied/anti armor/decent 3rd combat rifle. 
---
If I ever see you solo you’re dead bro 💀
---
Very, hopefully they can figure out what’s going on and patch it sometime soon.
---
Hahah last time I pre-order a game on blind Faith :(
---
^this
---
Hopefully they will revisit the flawed "rebalance" of the Legendaries and perk cards, but I'd have to say The explosive perks just don't seem to be worth it ATM 
---
This is suuuuuuper awesome!
---
Geez. I wish it was co-op fallout. 
---
Weeest virginiaaaaaaa, cheating looooseeeeer, take me homeeeeeee, with my moooooom xD looking forward to calling you out in the future. Laters!
---
Best idea yet, how do we get them to see this
---
I just tried it..sadly, seems like there's no paint option for western revolver :( .
---
Spending a lot of time removing stuff and refining the base. Many areas of it used to have more stuff in it, but I had to get ride of it to make stuff I found more important. Also, turrets and lights take up a massive amount of budgets, so I don't use turrets and have only one light per room.
---
Well, with a more than two hundred known issues and bugs..
---
Nice tune. Been a while since I heard it last.
---
stash your junk so that there really is nothing bad dying will do to you.
---
Bro, you're wildly confused. Anecdotally I could've been shooting a gutsy.... Or a ghoul. And anecdotally I could've done it starting from a sneak attack. And anecdotally the affix could have been furious.
---
Bro, you made a stupid assumption about a conversafion to shoehorn something to a conclusion you prefer, much in the same way you did with your hot-take OP with assumptions about identical player engagement and their chosen meta.
---
Bro, you did bad and you should feel bad.
---
Love when I load in and I'm already at 25% health getting pummeled by scorched and a scorchbeast
---
Difference is people stating they are leaving provides nothing constructive, nobody should care about a lost cause. If you are done with a game, move on, try to dispute a refund what ever. Wrong place to be complaining.
---
FUCK ME
---
Check the map and go when no high level players are nearby, or go when a high level player is there and let them kill the ghouls. If you're on pc I can escort you.
---
Just imagine, a level 10 takes the marsupial serum jumps around for 10 minutes then radaway oops damn
---
I love the idea, but they won't even let us help fix the bugs currently, so, I'd advise to not get your hopes up.
---
I just figured the nerf backlash died down like in any other online game.
---
Dude the community thing is so big. There's no fucking chat... How am i supposed to communicate with players and actually play? Fallout 76 is basically an mmo with different worlds/servers you can log into. How can you play an mmo without some type of actual text chat.
---
Exactly, the game doesn’t need to respond to the player, Th splayed needs to seek out challenges whether that be going to a difficult area or creating it through a nuke.
---
I feel you. I've been playing since release and they have nerfed a lot of xp from the start. The idea being you can't power level from 1-100, but in reality it has just caused those who aren't already high level to have a hell of a time getting there. I casually play for a few hours every couple days or so and haven't reached 50 because I've been lollygagging rather than farming whitespring when it was populated and XP plentiful. It is no longer populated or plentiful...
---
You have Fireman Outfit ?
---
The "door gap" on brick doorways drives my OCD crazy as well.  lol
---
The issue with repair is a bug that crept in on Tuesday, they've said they are looking into it
---
I Hope it will have a good turnout!
---
There's several trading subs, my dude. Too many.
---
-Intelligence bonus matters for base condition.  
---
-Intelligence bonus can exceed 15, but the points have diminishing returns past 15, and and the returns drop even more sharply past 25.  
---
-Intelligence doesn't  matter for repairs, it's always 200% (assuming max artisan) of the original condition.
---
When I first played I would sometimes run into level 60 super mutants go ohhhh noooo! Can't do that quest!!! Wahhh this must've been nuked!!! With all the disconnect and crashes it was a long time before I saw an actual nuke zone and thought... Why the fuck did I have so many quests ruined!?
---
Drop all your shit in your stash and go to The Whitespring...
---
Testing FEV on normal citizens, yes ethics was deffo out the window 
---
Would be nice 
---
All in all the game doesn’t know how to properly adapt to players.
---
MACHICOLATIONS!!!!! Screams into mike I love Shadowvesrity

Just uninstall 
---
That's situational mumbo jumbo.
---
When you're back peddling from a mob of Super Mutants without any sneak crits or AP for VATS the nerf adds a shit ton of extra shots......not 1.
---
Could've..... would've...... should've...... nobody gives a crap about situational keyboard tough guy bullshit. 
---
Weird. I powered up Poseidon then took over 5 workshops right after. I'm on an old ps4
---
It's not GRIEFING to bounty hunt. You may not like it, but unless they are following you, tormenting you, and causing you grief until you server hop they aren't a griefer... End of rant.
---
Sure bud
---
I have a two-shot .44 but the TSE nerf made it inferior to a plain western, so I've been using a vampire's western I found.
---
Hell, that is literally what was advertised / sold to us by Todd Howars, just rewatched the announcement of '76 the other day.   
---
Either they've not implemented the post nuke creature change, it got cut, or something else, because other than ghouls there is no significant change 
---
First videos I looked for on YouTube a week or two following release was to see if he had any videos but noticed he had not posted anything in a year. Thanks for the heads up, glad he's back
---
Ran into the same issue. After the frustration I have yet to even try that event again. Ended up buying a fusion generator plan from Graham (Bless he's soul).  
---
Nope. There's only one hunting rifle prime receiver, and I think that uses 308.
---
I had this happen when switching weapons in the middle of a reload animation.
---
Free travel between stations would be sweet even if it was a daily event. I love that idea but they'll never do anything that saves us caps
---
You're full of crap and interjecting your own facts into a conversation you don't like.
---
Under the same inane type of scrutiny the OP doesn't hold up, so your whining about internet tough person bullshit is hilariously hypocritical.
---
Yep!
---
Oh I know the fun of trying to get stuff to place. This one I couldn’t get onto floating floors, only foundation. And much like generators, wall conduit, and pa benches, any roof or floor above it has to be removed. I’ve spent more hours building than probably anything else in this game, but I can’t get enough of it.
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
I also have 3 shotgun perks at level one, all being added up to 30% damage, rather than one perk at level 3 for 20% damage.
---
Have trouble disagreeing 
---
Show me your math.
---
I'd like to see it. 
---
So if I create a weapon and say it has a theoretical 150% base condition then repair it then it would be 300% condition with artisan?
---
I stopped noticing it once I hit level 50, because I was contributing to the problem. The only place I'm really comfortable questing on my alt is the forest. I went to black water mine and garrahan to get black titanium and get ready to build excavator PA and had to use 30 stims and 30 healing salves, then baiting one at a time and eating throughout encounters to get my scrap. It was awful and ridiculous to go to the places I should be and have so much trouble 
---
This cannot be on purpose. So many bad things can happen. Enjoy it while it lasts though. 
---
There appears to be a luck component involved with them, like the "seeded RNG" debate.   
---
Some people have never gotten one, others have gotten the outfits more than once..
---
I have, I normally play every other day only for 3-4 hours, but have still almost run-out of things to do. 
---
And the problem is (due to the abrupt way the quests just dry up/the lack of them, along with the progression system becoming meaningless post l50) there is no driver to give the few things I have left to explore 'meaning'.
---
Lol awesome, my psn is above
---
Why is this post being reposted every hour or so?   
---
Thanks for taking one for the team. Saves me having to give the guy a view and my time for watching it.
---
Hi bro. I did the same a few weeks in a row on ps4. I have an arena too. Don't post stuff like this here. There's people that are gonna friend you, pretend to want to participate then grief your event. If you wanna make an arena like this you gotta keep it private for now friend. Just a fairly warning
---
Bobbleheads and magazines do not grant permament bonuses anymore. Not really worth the effort to hunt down as you'll eventually come accross them naturally.
---
I did and you attempted to extrapolate it to Scorchbeasts which was highly inappropriate, intellectually dishonest, and the same stupid leap as OP...
---
I meant in the same way that mods were getting accidentally scrapped.
---
Stopped playing a month ago, after dumping 400 hours in. I totally agree with this. The game is designed for someone who doesn't have 6+ hours a day to game. Once you reach endgame, your fun is derived from farming, and socializing; that wears thin after 100 hours. 
---
No...   
---
Intelligence effects the length of the "base" durability bar. If you make 5 items you'll notice they all have different durabilities.   
---
The larger the bar, the longer between repairs, and the longer once repaired above 100% it stays above 100%
---
This is what I expected and what I want out of nukes. The liberty prime knock off was more of a joke I don't expect a robot boss that way, but come on... How hard is it for nukes to make us fight Swann?
---
Kind of running into this myself. I find that I just come on to get some caps from vendors, roll the dice on an event to see if I can get lucky with a rare outfit (never), maybe hit Whitesprings or fissure prime if available. Get crappy legendaries. Log off.  
---
I got a lead pipe from the SBQ last week. I’ve had to buy every worthwhile weapon that I have.
---
no you missed the point, you are in PvP and you are also in Pacifist, meaning they can kill you and you can’t fight back... that’s the problem with the pacifist system it’s assbackwards af.
---
Not played since Tuesday for more or less the same reason, I'd need to drop so much stuff... Just can't bring myself to do it
---
I was kinda agreeing with you. But it’s still quite feasible to make a min-max build work in PvP, but you like all builds it’s very situational and has an Achilles heel. Reactive plates destroy those build types
---
Sound like a bug where group perks sometime become AOE and transfer to other players. like the targeting HUD giving everyone nearby, the mob red glow effect.
---
Yes they can push crazy numbers. As far as balance between other two handed weapons, they are all very capable.
---
I like the idea to find gecks in a vault, but I don't want to have another nuclear silo experience , I think maybe it should have mutated humans, but like unique mutations as a result of experiments. Also a greater focus on puzzles sounds cool
---
Right there with you. Last time I went farming was around 10 three star legendaries that dropped nothing. Ended the night with a single 3 star weapon and the mods were such garbage I vendored it.
---
Whole TS(e) rebalance and perk tweaks were flawed, really hope they revisit it
---
Meeting @ station.
---
Did you test this? I did and you can’t travel to any player, only those on your friends list or team.
---
I think this might be it
---
That means, if I understand correctly, the intelligence bonus is almost useless long term?
---
They’re good early-mid game. Endgame they get beat by super sledges, grog axes, etc.
---
Lol
---
Well complicated question...   
---
If and when they get a better grasp on patches and updates maybe?
---
I’ve been sitting on a signs plan for awhile trying to sell it, but THIS - this made me want to keep it and do that. LOL. 
---
I laughed out loud in my shop when I saw this. 
---
Yes I looked at that spreadsheet, but it only had 8 out of 22 vendors filled out, unless I am missing something.
---
Under walls towards all the way on the bottom.
---
No you just threw out random percentages and said that's how it would work.
---
I'm asking you to lay out the actual math of how your sneak crits VATS followed by a crippling knee shot and a head shot only requires one more shot. What perk cards? What damage multiplier?........and finally what about the other 12 Super Mutants?
---
Xbox one 
---
Maybe have people be guards to keep the griefers at bay?
---
It has one. Unfortunately it's after you emerge from the cavern. I was fearful when I disconnected after leaving but thankfully didn't reset my progress all the way to the beginning like the last 5 times I quit mid-mission.
---
Still, they should put you up to the latest objective you've completed. It's not like the quest markers are randomised.
---
Currently yes, that's what OP wants changed. 
---
You can prevent a guy respawning on you and destroying your base. One single guy with an explosive weapon will demolish yiur base even with ten guards. 
---
I have a great idea for them! Copy Swann. Rename Swann. Put in game. lol 
---
I never said anything about Scorchbeasts.
---
I used a simple base damage of 100 pre nerf and post nerf vs a target with only 600 hp.....and proved that it would take 2 more shots, not 1.
---
A target with 1200hp(Super Mutants) would take 4 more shots.
---
He says he enjoyed his time with the game and would recommend it to people, so I dont really know what you're talking about
---
Opposite, the intelligence bonus on crafted items (especially PA) pays off in dividends.   
---
**Example:**  
---
When I craft PA with a 32 INT my durability bar is generally twice as long,'or longer, than someone crafting with a 5 INT. In one case it has four times the durability of the compared item.   
---
So long term it means I repair my power armor nearly four times less often then someone with a durability bar that starts out at half the total length. 
---
No, you just threw out random bait in the form of a stupid conclusion to argue about the nerf. It's transparent.
---
Now you're demanding perk cards "for science" in a scenario presented anecdotally as testimony as to how little this has affected my gameplay.
---
I'm sorry you're salty about the nerf. Get better.
---
Yes actually releasing a not bug ridden game is such a bad thing to do we better not listen to them and instead keep releasing our buggy games like our blind fanboys want. You're exactly what Bethesda want in their fanbase. People without a shred of any standards that won't question even the most buggiest of releases.
---
I was hoping they would implement global text chat in one of the early patches. But the moment they complained that we wanted push to chat it was obvious they don’t know how to play these types of games or how to allow a community to grow. With no way for us to build one and become one, everyone would be a transient at best
---
Yeah, I mean it's the exact opposite of what happened, but neat theory?
---
My bad, read it the wrong way. You can def use a glass canon build in pvp, and played right is super effective. But with that build you are like paper. Going to get one shotted by even low- medium damage. Imo a glass canon using a long range like a Gauss would be best. 
---
I wish I owned it
---
Now you're just throwing out numbers to validate how bad a shot you are.
---
Bolstering isn't +35%, it's +35. Each piece gives you up to +35 DR and ER depending on how low your hp is.
---
Everything you see here I built with my own two hands from the cement steps, neon signs, ceiling fan (you can see in the door), stash box, cooking site, even the fallout model of you, Julia!
---
It should have never been a secondary (major) legendary effect and who ever though it was a good idea should have been demoted.
---
The cranberry bog disease cure is pretty easy to collect while you do other things.
---
it doesnt work eventhough it says u can. Unless the player is on ur friendlist or team.
---
Didnt make it past the begining with the usual "unfinished game" and "greedy bethesda" crap.
---
I had sneak 3, sneak bobblehead and gear that increases sneaking.  I went from \[Hidden\] to \[Caution\] to \[Detected\] real f\*cking quick.
---
Bethesda monitors this sub.  It’s the perfect place to complain.
---
Alright gotcha thanks for the answers.
---
I think I see the problem here. The "High Bar" games, 1, 2, and New Vegas, weren't made by Bethesda. Bethesda made 3, 4, and 76. Basically, Bethesda makes good sandboxes, but they really need to contract out to other companies for a good story. When they do, you get something like New Vegas. Otherwise, its 3, 4, and now our current mess.
---
Hm? For now.... don't cure rad worms or you'll have to relog, and definitely _try to get them_ for the ridiculous mutation buff.
---
I just hope they fix it.....
---
this
---
Everything has an Achilles heel. Ranged against melee can be up ended with stealth boys. Melee can be up ended by reactive plate armor. Sentinel builds can be up ended with any VATs crit to the face or a Mr Handy Buzz Saw blade. 
---
Tweaking the TS(e) was required, but their ham-fisted "rebalance" wrecked so much it's insane.    
---
All they needed to do was make it so the explosive legendary effect didn't benefit from the explosive perks, and suddenly it's fixed.  You still have the most powerful secondary legendary effect at 25 points per bullet / pellet but it would have not been insane like it was.  
---
There was no need to touch two-shot
---
Ohhh okay, yea i run a 20%hp build so as long as they stack that is awesome right? 
---
Whitesprings was nuked more than SBQ, so I'm not sure that's as relevant. I know legendary drops suck a little bit, but why aren't people farming it much now?  I think it's probably a combination of things, not just crap queen drops.
---
Where's Cheech at the front door?
---
Happy to help
---
Definitely more useful
---
In all seriousness though. There should be more unique encounters in nuke zones. More boss types. They don't have to reinvent the wheel either. Throw in a big bad behemoth. A level 91 deathclaw boss. Have health scale with players like the queen, make it an event. Doesn't have to give as good of loot as SBQ just something cool. Nuke a horde event to create a near endless onslaught with a big boss.
---
Pre nerf:
---
100 base damage.
---
2x multiplier for explosive.
---
Damage=200
---
Enemy=600hp
---
600/200=3 shots.
---
Post nerf:
---
1.2x multiplier for explosive.
---
Damage=120
---
Enemy=600 hp
---
600/120= 5 shots.
---
Conclusion:
---
Enemy with only 600 hp now takes 2 extra shots to kill.
---
You can only get them from events. The plans aren’t in the game files, or weren’t as of two months ago.
---
This. This is great! One of the reasons I love games like this is the stories the players create. Yeah the game has a ton of bugs, and we'll not go into that here. But the fact that you still come and post this little story, that's just great! Loved it, and would love to see more sometime. \^\_\^ really nice job!
---
What I meant was more along the lines of "Im leaving, l8r nerds" posts with no content. I complain without my posts being deleted often, it's not hard just be respectful.
---
There's the tried and true "ignore the mobs and speed-run it" method, though I admit you'll burn through a lot of stimpacks that way.
---
More like level 180 death claw boss, I already find level 91+ all over the place :)
---
If you had claimed a workshop or had any team members at all, it's possible to get flagged without having done anything.
---
Better result with unyielding sentinel or straight sentinel if you are only looking at damage reduction. 
---
This is the *USS Approximation*.
---
Ironically, a good Samaritan can be the cruelest of trolls.
---
Heard all this shit when the game came out months ago lol
---
and yet you link to one to give it attention....why?
---
Adjust your perk cards, use your weapon in its effective range, maybe pop some psyo but nothing is really that hard if your decked out right. Melee has to run right their target before they can do anything, while ranged dps can always lay down some fire from 200+ yards. 
---
There is a perk card that cleanses all rads when Ya res someone. But since ya sent die idk. Over abundance of rad sponge being shared? Lol
---
Never! We want a refund after 700 hours of duping, making $10,000 in eBay sales, and getting banned when caught. I mean banned for crafting 10 handmades with super duper!
---
I too dislike nightmares.
---
The connect points on the small and neon letters are broken, been an issue since the beta and hopefully they will one day fix it
---
Not to make you type it all out.... but whats the difference between them all, im lvl 80 and had to complete change my build after the nerf, thats why i run a min max now 
---
Right, I'm saying my situation contradicts what OP laid out. He/she said if you're in a team then your teammate can pull you out of pacifist. This doesn't happen. 
---
You know what I'm getting at though. Those level 91 death claws don't feel like level 91s
---
Some of them are better-known than others, but yeah. A lot of it would be guesswork.
---
For what it's worth, "Two Shot" does count as a single 125% damage shot when you hit with both. Not two separate shots with individual damage calcs. I'm not sure what happens if only one of the shots hits.
---
Still comedy gold.
---
"Tell me lies, Tell me sweet little lies"
---
All those people that said the slap mechanic was shite because you wanted to *RP raiders*, where TF you at? There's a mode now. Or was that **fucking bullshit**?
---
Just checking.
---
P.s. if you can't role play in a game that lets you dress in any way you please (with no penalisation), create your appearance and gender, choose your stats and perks, weapons to carry and outfit... It's not the game. You **fucking suck** at role playing. Beyond belief. You fucking suck. You suck. Not even well  you suck badly. **You suck**.
---
rofl, if you like BF, then I'm not sure FO was ever the game for you... especially if you had no interest in pvp.
---
Ps4 pro
---
Avecha
---
Updated game to the latest patch. Now I can't get past the please stand by screen. No matter how long I leave it. So the game is unplayable for me. 
---
Too true... Too true
---
Graphical glitch. You can’t actually travel to another player that you aren’t in a team with or friends with.
---
It doesn't work it looks like it will let you till you actually click then it tells u they must be a friend or on your team
---
What times do you usually play. I have around 20+ 3* Legendaries in my stash I need to get rid of. I never drop 3* legendaries I loot, I simply hold until someone wants it.
---
What you wanna do? Turn the other side? These things are happening and people should be informed. Ignoring it won't do anything.
---
Might wanna check your women. One gave me a case of Radworms. 
---
No, the last patch broke a lot of stuff. If, for example, you were a non-powerarmor stealth build, or specialized in explosive weapons (not just TSEs), you got royally screwed. 
---
In a queen situation does everyone share perk cards as tho ya were on a team? Since an event puts ya in a large group? Could have been medics using rad away and spreading it out. Not sure how it all works. 
---
What a terrible pun, screw you!
---
Lost so much quality junk, including 100 stable fluxes the other day because of this...
---
I remember when I saw a death claw and said oh shit! Now it's oooo gotta tag that bad boy before the TSE kills it. Well until the latest patch bahahaha
---
Unyielding armor will be overpowered. 
---
With a set you got +15 for each stats with right conditions. 
---
And if counting any food or Chems bonuses. I have seen my friend got to 37 strength in power armor without having the unyielding effect also. 
---
Question do you use Power armor and so you have a targeting HUD?
---
THE GODDAMN SUFFERING 
---
Would be nice if it was for more guns, but can people please start reading things? It says on the store it is for the .44
---
Just surprised it's a skin not for the minimum for once
---
okthankyousomuchbye
---
Is it possible to find sets of excavator armor?any tips? Or should i just try to look up PA armor spawns?
---
Short answer: No. It's a five point card with the power of a three point card, and affects the weakest weapons in the game.
---
But why? they literally share a model, there is no reason for the skin not to apply to both.
---
One problem with the TOWN idea, being stuck in queue because you were sent back into that server
---
That does sound like a nice idea but it might be a bit too much for the developers to implement. Still, good idea. 
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one who feels this way! I talk about this with my brother all the time, bunch of drama queens and pot stirrers.
---
I never had a CTD until the mid-Jan patch...   
---
Now upwards of 9 an hour.   
---
Dozens and dozens of posts about it, that patch fixed stability for some and wrecked it for others
---
Nothing like respawning to grab your dropped loot, hearing shuffling footsteps. Then growls, whacks, slaps, controller feedback. Yep, being attacked while immobile again. 
---
Yeah. I'll admit that it's wrong to set such a high bar for a company known more for less story-focused narratives like I have, but it's clear Bethesda has the capacity to make a fairly interesting story with player freedom held in high regard, but instead of focusing its efforts on these key aspects synonymous to the Fallout franchise, the developer rather zeroed in on combat and graphics. Even when I was a stupid kid who thought graphics meant everything in a game, when I began playing FNV, despite how poor its graphics were compared to other games at the time, its story was amazing. So Fallout 4 can have the fanciest graphics and gnarly mutants, but without a strong and immersive story, it simply lacks what makes the Fallout franchise so great. 
---
Oh yay, this guy has been doing nothing but creating hate filled vids for as long as the game has been out.  He lost all credibility with me a long time ago.
---
Not giving them clicks/views for a start. that is part of the reason for them chasing this crap in the first place.
---
u/LoneVaultWanderer  \- This looks to be substantiated by several posts if someone can look into it.
---
Ok more mostly non spoiler tips. You already know that these will be involved in a quest but you probably don’t know that when they are, it doesn’t matter if you have one or 50. They will be treated the same. 
---
So the solution: find a friend who you trust and also hasn’t advanced this quest line to give all of these to. Once you discover their use, have your friend give you them one at a time. You’ll understand later and be glad you did. 
---
That makes it even better 
---
Please assume the position 
---
Purple headlamp is not an Atom Shop
---
Item they can be found in game. 
---
Bloodied at least carries some risk
---
Good point. I was just trying to come up with a solution. I love the idea of an event like this. What about an indoor arena with the metal or concretw walls surrounding it?
---
Woah thank you i play really whenever I’m currently online now, I will be for awhile
---
This game isn't the game for you. It wasn't meant to be the game you want it to be. It wasn't advertised as the game you want it to be. You made the choice to buy the game not made for you. The details about all the things you don't like we're known before launch.
---
I agree, letting the masses determine the state of a game never ends well, seen it too many times.
---
This is a F\*ck up on Bethesda's part.
---
They accidentally tagged all the Headlamp Mods as Atom Shop items in the latest update.
---
Its even worse if you find a Red Tactical light which has been changed into a Mothman light and wont even equip.
---
Thanks for confirming, folks, that it is a non-functioning graphical issue.
---
I did not test it, only saw it as an option when accidentally right-clicking on a player that was close to a train station. Glad to know it is graphical only.
---
Cheers.
---
Hey thats better than this [https://i.imgur.com/pJMmh9M.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/pJMmh9M.jpg)
---
Two-shot out damages every other mod by far if it is at 100%. Bloodied requires you to be at below 20% HP (one hit by any high level mob) and doesn't even come close to 100% dmg. It's around 60%. This is more towards the line of high risk high reward. Whereas 100% dmg and accuracy penalty is hardly a risk and insane reward. If two-shot took two bullets then it's much more reasonable for 100% dmg as it would have some sort of cost or risk.
---
Wouldn't last a second trust me. My arena is litteraly in a satellite dish. Griefers are griefers and won't stop till your event is broken, end of story... 
---
Yea as if this community not watching it will ever make a difference. I'd rather call it out for what kind of a shitshow it actually is.
---
&gt;I m looking for the Forest Camo jumpsuit

The last 2 patches introduced some odd instability for some PC players, including it dumping part of the load into the second GPU if you have more than one,'for some people.  
---
You might want to base line your INI's and then do some googling for the correct settings for your set up and hard code them in (generally the ones from fallout 4 will work).  
---
Doing that helped me "some".. But not completely, I lost 20 FPS +\- after the mid-Jan patch I've not been able to recover
---
Not sure I'll let's see the inside
---
Not true buddy
---
Sentinel is actual percentage damage reduction. It's not clear how it stacks, or whether it's applied before or after the damage resistance calc, but it's certainly extremely strong.
---
Problem is that it's also extremely valuable, like you'd do well to get a single bolstering + sentinel piece for 10k caps.
---
Log a support ticket with as many details as you can give.
---
obsidian making outer world. it is for you. and don't expect obsidian from bethesda. they are different. 
---
I'd guess no.. I mean they gutted the "mules" which was the only way anyone could get the needed stock to be the merchants they promised we could be, so doubtful 
---
If you're using rad x before a nuke fight it suppresses you mutations...
---
Nope about to get into the control room now 
---
Okay be there soon man
---
I'm glad someone else is a fan! 
---
This. How is it so hard for other people to understand this? Like anything another player does that inconveniences them and now the other player is a griefer.  
---
It’s a new feature implemented last patch....
---
I don't know. I am not a dev. But seriously it says on the store page it is for the .44, if it was for another weapon it would have been listed.(for example the power armor paints, even though most are for all armor types, still list each type it is for.)
---
Log a ticket and they'll hopefully fix.
---
It's a bug with rad worms, upon infection mutations are buffed, after being "cured" mutations don't work.
---
Stop trying to rob people's camps.
---
Whore. Whore never changes.
---
There currently isn't a single item, event, quest, or activity in this game that is rewarding enough to keep me playing. It's a constant chore. 
---
Here is what I want:
---
1. Rewards to be adjusted to make events, quests, and killing enemies an efficient way to earn resources (i.e. de-incentivizing farming and/or ‘server hopping’ behaviors). 
---
2. Workshops to be lucrative to incentivize operating, capturing and defending workshop from other players. 
---
3. Events to actually be rewarding by providing players with useful buffs or effects that incentivize replaying them on a regular bases. 
---
4. Players to be reconnected to the server they last played on after logging off or otherwise disconnected. If the server is full, another server will be assigned as usual.
---
5. New Item Attributes to provide players with more “Build” identities by synergizing equipment effects with perks and SPECIALs. 
---
You gotta relog to fix that.
---
You can tell it's rad worms by the fact your'r mutations only change the instant you contract the disease and the instant you cure it your mutations stop working
---
Yeah people are too hard on the game. But I guess I'm lucky that I don't get to many bugs. I'm board af now and just recently stopped playing (after 2 chars)
---
every click/view helps them was my only point. If you dont want to help them don't link to them.
---
I do find it funny how in the Shadowversity and Skallagrim community there is so much talk about the practicality of home defense with a sword and im like sword vs gun I win 
---
I have no desire to RP, equally no desire to PVP, bought FO76 to play with my friends.  I’ve done that, happy with vfm I got out of the game as I swooped in at the discounted phase.
---
Or is your comment in reply in general to the thread and not to my comment specfically..?
---
Agree with you as regards those that complained, eerily silent now...
---
I'll keep an eye out for you.
---
What part of that isn't true? No human npcs, PvP in the game, limits on SPECIAL advancement, and perk cards equipped were all known before launch. I think Bethesda has made a ton of mistakes and screwed the game up... But I at least accepted the game for what it was. Everything in the op that you're claiming to be against and that wasn't wanted we're established facts before release and are part of the game they meant for it to be. Fun game... But no real long term potential until Bethesda gets their heads outta their asses.
---
One of the many unaddressed issues :(
---
Or prizebot finally delivers something at a time that doesnt cause me to panic and jump off a cliff to my death...

The relays are just story fluff and irrelevant

Its definitely better, but now things tend to end in melee one shots instead, so still room for improvement.
---

If I were a betting man, I’d say this is going to get nuked. 
---
Rome wasn't built in a day, but Rome 2? World class speedrun of city building
---
you could be missing a separate perk opening medium grades like you would for power armor or a combo perk from a different special category
---
Time to get to the grind then lol
---
Just don’t carry much junk around and be prepared to get capped. 
---
I doubt it was the mutation it doesn't do much damage but there is a mod for Power armor that delivers half of melee damage back to attacker
---
Hawt dayum I wuv it!
---
Any idea which card?
---
My typical foods are Sweet Tato Stew for a one hour high health regen.  Once piece of regen armor isn't as fast as the Sweet Tato Stew.  I've been wondering if multiple armor pieces stacks though.  I also eat Silt Bean Puree for a one hour DR buff.  Corn Soup is easy to make for a 3 AP regen, but there are some faster if you don't mind running around collecting the ingredients.  For standard food and water replenishment I use Carrot Soup.  Both of those last two I choose because I grow all vegetables at my C.A.M.P.  About half the time I eat Cranberry Relish for a one hour 10% XP bonus.  Occassionally I'll fix a food that increases % crit damage like Firecracker Berry Juice.  There are other crit damage recipes that increase more percentage, but firecracker berries grow near my camp and I don't feel like jumping all over the map for ingredients if I don't have to.
---
Here's a post I made on cooking recipes: [An (almost) Master List of Cooking Recipes](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aen9jf/an_almost_master_list_of_cooking_recipes_with/)  There's a link to my spreadsheet in there.  The second tab has recipes sorted by bonus type.  Recipes with green cell color are Herbivore.  Yellow is Carnivore and grey is neither carnivore nor herbivore so they give full benefit to either mutation.
---
This comment alone deserves more upvotes lol 
---
As much as these dingleberries annoy the piss out of me it's best to focus our energy on telling Bethesda Austin what we want out of the game.
---
If you’re working in quests and such, leveling seems about right to me.

How to deflate an entire controversy, with your host: u/Retlaw83. On tonight's episode: Using 12 planks of wood to make one and then immediately snapping it in two
---
That was it.  I was heavily radiated when I jumped in so I wanted to clear some radiation before I started.  The suppression did go away after a few minutes though.
---
Theres a couple bugs with the mutations, if you're using Rad-x before going into nuke zones that will suppress them though diluted rad-x will not though thats intended. A common bug I do run into is if you're using stranger in numbers when you leave a party it turns off your mutations, that happens to me at least once a session for months now. 
---
Sounds good 
---
Rad sponge and Team Medic. 
---
I still have fun bounty hunting, but that's just because I toy with my target. One time I stood right next to him until he looked at me and I whacked him with the All Rise. Never take their junk though, I need not take the common man's work, I need only take his wages
---
We aren't supposed to share outside of a team, but its probably what happened... 
---
And the point is indeed the same.  Who cares?  They buy new accounts and give the devs free money when they're banned again - if they aren't using a VPN and are utilizing the same IP address as a banned account, I'm sure it's flagged, watched, and dealt with if it happens again.
---
No relevant amount of players are buying new consoles after being banned multiple times from video games.  At $300+ each console, plus the time invested, the amount of people making enough to do that is so insignificant that it might as well not exist at all.  
---
The levels you're describing aren't on anyone's radar because it's a non-problem problem.  The resources required to close and enforce rules on virtual environments 100% of the time is not worth the benefits.  That's why its not done, and never will be.
---
At least they're nice enough to leave the workbenches OUTSIDE AND AWAY from the debauchery
---
Rat poison is just a can full of lead
---
You are indeed in the minority if you stuck it out to the end game, that's problem #1.
---
To be fair, it's the same end game as every other Fallout game, though.  Once you've explored the map and done the quests you're interested in, that's all there is to do.
---
you decided to play a video game that has the option of attacking people and destroying their base, it's going to happen, there is no point complaining about it.
---
there are a million different games you can craft and build things that don't have this feature.
---
No it shouldn't, because that'd make high charisma mandatory for anyone that thinks caps matter in this game.
---
It's a fixed money supply with minimal gain outside of vendors and trading for a reason.  It's never changing.  It's very easy to see why.
---
The real answer is making the stash shared between characters. And obviously increasing it a tad to compensate that it’s shared. Destiny already does this. 
---
Lol. 
---
Is kind of annoying when it gets cured tho
---
So you stole something meant for players fresh out of the vault, and to make up for it put some crummy gear in it. And we're supposed to like this? Don't get me wrong I hate boosting, but leaving people small head starts like that I support
---
TSE was honestly fine because there's at least three other ways to one-shot someone with basic shit and a good build that they can do NOTHING about unless they see you first.
---
Combat is so unbalanced for PVP that no nerfs will fix it.  A complete re-work of combat that's existed like this for over a decade is the only thing that'll make PVP balanced, and that's never happening.

Just let someone kill you. Everytime I get a bounty for destroying the back door campers at whitesprings I have a friend kill me or ran around naked begging people to kill me (I'm amazed at how far you have to go to get rid of a bounty) most caps I've ever lost was 90 and any junk I don't get back was just from that run. Stash springs, black titanium, screws, Balistic Fiber (you know the hard to find stuff) frequently and you never have to worry.
---
I once killed a wanted player who had 300 screws don't be that guy. I even thought about giving them back but after thinking about it the lesson he learned from losing them is more valuable than the screws he lost.
---
With unyielding wouldn't you only have that bonus at 20% health? I see where it could be way OP with strength and PA especially in the current system, but aren't there things that stack right now that are not supposed to stack in the future? If stacked effects are supposed to be limited like Bethesda said wouldn't that level of insane stat bonus hypothetically not be a factor after future patches? Not sarcastic genuinely asking.

I'm assuming that's Juicehead?

I'm saying there are better ways to argue a point than insult the cause of the problem until they ignore you. Start a petition, mail their office, call them. But yelling at them through social media, or just yelling in general gets little done. Wars aren't won through pissing matches.

Cheers, mate. It was more addressing the r/fo76 hive mind. Tbh this happens every complaint. Remember every complaint about two-shot-explosive weapons?

-Besides anchoring in world with a friend you need it to be anchored in "cell". If the cell you've got your bag in goes completely empty it can reset.  
---
-Sometimes a bag will show as empty, not a load symbol, but empty, but the contents will show up 5 - 10 minutes later.

I love the noise of it. Boom Boom Boom Boom Boom

Are you able to get duplicate teirs of cards? It seems like you stop getting those cards after you have a card of every teir?
---
Alright so invites will be sent via DMs to profiles that don't appear to be throw away.  We'll see how that goes.
---
\&gt;  Fallout 1, 2, and NV had set. A deep story, realistic characters, and player freedom 
---
You're in the minority. Most players are just looking for some casual fun at beer o'clock in a virtual world.
---
That's what bethesda sandboxes are all about. (I wouldn't even call them Adventure let alone RPG anymore.)
---
You're better off accepting this IMHO and look for your original fallout fix elsewhere.
---
Atom RPG or UnderRail are excellent candidates for that. :)
---
Since we're talking about Dark Souls 3 DLC bosses, the Queen always reminded me more of the Demon Prince.
---
It also completely neuters the Healing Factor mutation, just to add a little more information.
---
Good idea.  I accidentally punched someone's firearm bench while using it (no damage) and had to ask the guy to kill me. 
---
Use that starched genes card and rank it up twice  
---
West tech research is full of super mutants. Also Whitesprings is still a viable farming spot despite the nerfs
---
I had no idea it was called respec haha
---
They are very clearly trying to do something different than a traditional MMO. 
---
I give Beth credit for putting money behind that big idea, but it is also pretty clear that the weird bug-riddled, unbalanced, confusing middle ground of FO76 is satisfying no one. 
---
Whatever this game becomes... and I hope they do keep trying to work on it... I hope it remains a game that I can enjoy solo.
---
(I am actually pretty happy with the game, but I am a filthy casual. I honestly can't even remember what level I am. Maybe 10? And the only thing that sucks so far is ammo is scarce. I know I better enjoy it while I can because from reading this subreddit I have a pretty good idea of how the game will eventually collapse for me.)
---
Mm that could make sense, combined that with like the rad bones buff and then whatever could be it then.. I do use sentinel, dodgy, blocker and supressor so whenevery i get the first hit, nothing is killing me. Thats why i was wondering why i got destroyed.
---
I have not a bloodied build, neither a massive attack.(500 damage on melee) but maybe that reflected damage isn't reduced as damage?
---
Hey I'm from Charleston 
---
This. It’s not just “part of the game”, it’s by design. You broke the law and must now have some consequence. I played a bit of ESO and they had a similar system, though with NPC guards you were more likely to be killed by the system. Don’t remember if players could kill you for your bounty though. 
---
That said, there needs to be a way to remove it without dying, perhaps paying off the offended player, though this option would need bounties adjusted by the cost of repairs to whatever gets broken/stolen. 
---
So my nature on an anonymous internet forum must equate to my real world persona?
---
So far, you have whined like a child, I have made several valid points to explain why its not broken, and you have resorted to personal attacks to detract from the point. I guess I shouldnt be surprised since you seem to think that real world value lies mostly in ones joviality.
---
But have you sacrificed a goat to the machine gods?  
---
But seriously have you tried it at the low or medium settings? I'm sure you rig can handle Ultra easily, but for some reason above High people "sometimes" get erratic behavior 
---
Directly across the tracks from the Charleston train station. If you fast travel to the station, the C.A.M.P. would be on the left.
---
Im drooling thinking about it. It would also be neat if they let you stack multiple cards even after ranking up.
---
maybe bethesda should fix their buggy ass game since this exploit has existed since forever lol.
---
I feel like I picked some up in Helvetica or whatever that small town is in the Forrest.
---
I had an instigating explosive shotgun and a gatling gun. Went to reload the gatling gun, switched to the shotty halfway through the animation, and then I had 497 rounds on deck for the shotgun.
---
Some under armor plans only show up if you've learned the lower level versions, like Enclave and BoS (excluding Shielded BoS), but I don't know whether Casual is the same.
---
Yeah i feel Bethesda won't implement something like this until they have fully worked put the bugs on duping and such. But we can dream.
---
speed runners "cheat" all the time since they use glitches and bugs to do things faster, who cares?
---
I feel ya, man... i was super disappointed with the fact i couldn't stack my strong back perk with my fully ranked strong back...
---
I've learned the the lower versions. Protective is supposedly broken according to data mining, so the shielded is also inaccessible.
---
You can still purchase them. They are hella expensive tho
---
So if I indulge in one of those "take over this workshop" things that I wander by... then I can be killed? F that. They need to spell that out in the game. 
---
I would not mind a Dark Falz crossover boss. Phantasy Star.
---
I hate pvp, but I really like the idea of the no restrictions mode.  There's no risk or thrill in seeing random people in the game now.  Hopefully it doesn't turn into just being a shit show of nothing but dicks on the survival mode, I think that's the probable outcome because it's optional.  But I think it would be cool to actually have to fear seeing random people.
---
Spruce knob workshop spawned a defend against scorch beast event. Along with the three SB, some max level death claws and yaoi guai spawned. 
---
It felt like a milder version of a SBQ fight. I didn't wait, but theoretical it should repeat as long as you own the workshop.
---
That's right 
---
I just tried to play and the game disconnected from the server before I even loaded in lol.
---
 Cafe Risque if you're a Floridian.
---
The attack does poison damage, which can only be resisted with Med-x or the poisoners legendary effect on armor.
---
Would Trello help? Maybe something similar? I see Trello being used for Subnautica, [but they moved to another app](https://favro.com/organization/35200a08dbbad85b26102638/0d9378db42299691bb14c708) called Favro. I mean, only developers may have access to the project, but I think showing when work is being done would put my mind at ease: when a ticket is made, who made a change, what stage a bug is that, what's on the backburner, etc.
---
I don't know jack shit about this stuff, but isn't there an app that would allow people from here to communicate directly with Bethesda?
---
And i disagree, weeks/months, depending on the workload, is more than normal, ive seen some problems even reach the years stage (not saying it should, but these things can happen). We dont have any statistics on the volume of issues coming in, the number of workers, what their closure rate is, we also can't see their bug tracker, how many bugs there are, what their prioritization is like, theres just too many unknown variables to consider
---
In my case I built a little farm so razorgrain was a given. I also have a fence around my Queen Dutchess so if I'm quick enough they dont usually get her.
---
Look at those coolant prices! Oof. I hope their WIPs get decent gas mileage. 
---
Nothing but prioritisation.
---
That lil boi came to visit me in the middle of a Whitesprings run! I had just gotten all the ghouls attention when suddenly I see them charging and behind me I "I'm so glad I finally found you!" 
---
At least it wasn't a walking cane or rolling pin...
---
ok cool let me know if you find or buy one, I will take a look, I want to do something similar. How much would you be willing to pay ?
---
Yea 20% health but it’s not as crispy as you think that would be. 
---
And it really depends on Bethesda deciding what stacks what doesn’t. Food drinks chems can have around 13-15 already for each category even not counting the one that can stack and depends if they are “fixing”. 
---
I hope not cause I’ve been crafting some myself.
---
This IS the DMV in my town 
---
Good quick kill 👍
---
That was very smooth
---
I am just gonna leave [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/am8yat/a_note_on_banning/) here...
---
It is likely due to costly licence issues but I have always wondered why there's not one Elvis song in any of the games, that Viva Los Vegas song would have fit right in at home with NV.
---
And by my own words, I have sealed my fate! Nooooo!
---
Not agreeing or disagreeing with the OP, but as a old school MMO player who uses "mule" accounts I've been accused of duping more than once false so I have some questions:  
---
-How do you disprove a negative? It's the classics "why do you hit your wife" situation, no matter what you say, you can't defend yourself.  
---
-Who records ever game session just in case they might get banned?  
---
-What screenshots (as people ask for) would prove someone's not duping?  
---
I'm asking because allot of the hate directed back at the people who post things like this, justified or not, aren't coming from sound, logical, places.
---
I pulled this off at lvl 20ish when I was working on the Mistress of Mysteries arch. There is a side door to the building that I used. The only ghouls I had to fight were in the room directly across from the sword and the room with the sword. Wasn't too bad.
---
That said, I'll be glad to give you an escort as well - hit me up if I'm  - game tag same as screen tag - Dr\_C2
---
I need bleach asap
---
So your J47? Geeze you ghoulifoed yourself to hold your spot... 
---
They do want you that it’s PvP when you take them. 
---
Try with a lever rifle, you will see how it doesn't take more than just  a few bullets to kill high level super mutants with the right perks
---
I drive an hour to avoid the DMV in my town. 
---
All I have left to do are events, which are repetitive, unimaginative, and unsatisfying. a quarter of the events must be "protect the slow robot" ugh...
---
Launching a nuke is tedious, expends ammo and resources, then offers the slim chance of getting a legendary item, but what will you do with it when there is no reason to continue playing? The greatest legendary weapon or armor in the game won't make the events any more fun. Somehow they made nuking boring.
---
 I think Fallout 4 had double the number of requests at least in fallout 76 should have shipped with a similar amount of content.
---
Something.   
---
That has actually been suggested before, a few other MMO's use similar setups to allow limited back and forth communication with Dev's or support to get things resolved, quickly.
---
lol
---
I use a Zealots powerfist for scorchbeasts. Works well almost to well.  
---
This happened to me yesterday when I tried to get a workshop. They stole all my caps and destroyed my base a few times. I luckily had plenty of scrap so it was easy to just rebuild.
---
After hearing this I will leave the empath recipe I have in the stash next time I see people nearby that are low level and just starting out. It's my only serum recipe but it's not worth to me what it would be to someone just starting off. 
---
As some earlier mentioned at some point before 35ish they would use radway  and at least he left something
---
you shouldn't link these turds, they don't deserve the views.
---
They speed run single player games or in closed environments. I don’t care about cheating in single player games, do what you want. Cheating in a multiplayer game has adverse effects on other players. That’s not fair.
---
Take the duplication of TSE shotguns. The exploitation of this mechanic single handedly ruined PvP for weeks. Realistically, without duplication, only a handful of players would have lucked out and got a TSE weapon, let alone a shotgun. With duplication, the cheaters practically ensured that anyone willing to pay a cap fee or exchange another rare item for them to duplicate would have an overpowered weapon with which they could instantly kill other players against the spirit of the game. Moreover, there were countless examples of players complaining on this subreddit about griefers shooting down camps. Sure, shooting down a camp is part of the game. It’s not fair to do it with an overpowered weapon acquired by trading with a duper, I.e. a cheater.
---
[Just take 10 or 12 benadryl and you’ll be fine](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=y-bZr7isbCo) 
---
Thanks for the clarification I thought it sounded like BS
---
Maybe compare Fo76 to early access indie sandbox survival games rather than expensive graphical blenders next time.
---
You'd be surprised how bad the game looks in comparison, it's ten times as expensive, has horrible transparency, dev communication, maintenance, tech, mechanics and ethics.
---
&gt; Nuking the Cranberry Bog &amp; fight the SBQ with the server is the best  online experience of my life. **It's challenging, clever, and it looks  great.** 
---
Man, don't ever play MHW, you probably get sucked in for a 1000 hours.
---
Idk a bug where my gun doesn't do dmg is a pretty big deal.
---
Texas roads are awesome compared to Illinois. It is sad when I can be asleep while my wife is driving and I will wake up because we hit smooth roads, it happens whenever we go into Wisconsin, Indiana, or Tennessee. 
---
Road construction in the cities in Texas sux bawls, but that is a different issue. 
---
maybe this is said turds alt account trying to get hate views/comments. that's what quarter pounder does after all
---
whatever,agree to disagree with your double standard phrases.
---
I just ran across this at Dabney Homestead workshop. The event is defeat the scorchbeast attack, but he is friendly. I'm scared to shoot at him. 
---
lol, I like that the community  (besides the try hard bashers) see right through it.
---
#gamerstrong tell em bruther.
---
Nope it's BS check the link provided above. I fell for the "if it's on the internet it must be true" mentality
---
Stop it.
---
Absolutely need this, I've made the mistake of logging off in Whitesprings twice now.
---
Is there any way to see visually that someone is available for pvp?  Other then looking at the maps and remembering the owners? 
---
If I own a workshop can just anyone shoot me for full damage anywhere? Do they have to “check in” at the workshop first?
---
If I’m pacifist, once they have shot me can I shoot back, or do I need to turn off pacifist mode manually?  
---
With perk packs you mean? On my lvl250 ive gotten multiple maxed perks from packs
---
Well that’s the exact idea behind creation club and look how that was received. It wasn’t something we should’ve been mad about until the shit quality cane to light
---
They nerfed Demolition Expert like a month ago. They also nerfed the radium gun and commando.
---
Yeah, Zealot's is pretty good, and the only one that's worthwhile.
---
It was. For me, at least.
---
It's fallout! This shouldn't be a thing! We should be able to do what we want without others getting in the way!
---
Still PVP, but last patch broke my good will so I'm waiting to see what happens before I pick the game back up.
---
Take your ban like a man. Maybe you'll stop cheating in future online games.
---
I'm a Fallout fan and while I enjoy single player games and RPGs especially. 
---
I want a Fallout MMO. I also want occasional PVP when I want it, just not all the time.
---
I want a world to explore and get lore and story, and I want events to goof off with my m8s.
---
The game is not bad. It might not be for you.
---
Where can I find the plans for heavy combat armor?
---
Yes, you can get duplicates. It helps later in game for example : you may find you prefer 2 levels of all slugger perks so you have 3 extra points left in strength for traveling phamicist or whatnot
---
So you picked a locked door that had work benches behind it, and you didn't realize it was somebody's camp? I call bs.
---
but you just said you *couldn't* do those things, that it's not viable in nuke zones and you can't oneshot SBs.
---
regardless, there's armor that pretty much makes you invincible. so being a glass cannon is kinda irrelevant. not mention you get what, around 500 DR? with Vampiric or some sort of healing most damage is only gonna tickle.
---
Set of sentinels gives you straight 75% damage reduction instead of DR. With normal armor your DR can reach/pass PA but with heavy perk points sacrifice. 
---
In other countries, there are already people min/max and tested. Sentinel set is almost the best with perks with damage mitigation for example dodgy, the luck one and several others similarly that do percentage damage reduction (not DR) and some perks actually trigger two times during calculations. 
---
And since you are doing bloodied build, why not get the unyielding effect also? With more STR you carry more, more PER you see and target further and more AGI you sneak better and LUCK and INT both are good for getting stuff and repair or creating. 
---
I need to know where this is.... for future study  purposes.... 
---
&gt; Not true buddy
---
Nobody could have ended watching the E3 presentation thinking that 76 was going to single player or have human NPCs.
---
True, my thought is if it gets cut down to +5-6 max this would be potentially a cool change of pace, but totally understand if it's a crappy idea, poorly explained, too complicated or just a hassle.
---
"76 Economy" you say this like the game itself supports one. On paper it does, but with how it plays out and how hostile Bethesda has been with some of the patches it just doesn't work out. It affected no one and the patches made them drop almost all of it so it's solved there. 
---
Instead of seeing why people dupe in the first place, they learned nothing and just punished players. There's a reason that literally no other major game studio ban these players since it's all in game solutions for problems they unintentally caused. By solving the problem and punishing players all they have has made a hostile player base. A hostile player base YOU perpetuate by attacking the people unfairly labeled cheaters. You are the problem. All they have made is less of a reason for people to buy the game, play, and suggest it to thier friends.
---
No one cares about how long a game is out before it's ok to cheat, I said it's been going on 3 months and they still turn a blind eye to why players would do what they do. This just stacks up more nails in the coffin for a game that is half in the grave. I have never seen a company that consistently doubles down on shooting itself in the foot since Digital Homicide Studios and we see how that turned out.
---
This was basically me. I gained speed demon and marsupial from rads at around level 5, assumed it was a glitch in the game, walked through a decon shower and was very dissapointed. 
---
What?  People banned for cheating are ... lying about what they did??!?!??!  Oh my GOD.  That's just inconceivable!!!
---
&gt; Fun game... But no real long term potential until Bethesda gets their heads outta their asses.
---
The game has huge potential. I just hope the time it takes to get their MP legs are short.
---
Yeah, and as long as I ignore the misaligned POI markers, long animations, non-customizable chassis, two-second freeze after a big jump, and the fact that power armour is the only endgame option... it’s great. 
---
And the reliance on power cores. 
---
And getting out of it to craft anything. 
---
I do have a targeting hud at least. 
---
Something to do with what stock you apply to it.
---
....ok, semantics, it does neither of those. 
---
Damn if you cared you wouldn't have cheated hey do us a favor and post the essay you had to write here about why cheating in online games is bad we'd love to see it.
---
its the PR war between Bethesda and the dupers.
---
Exactly. It’s just a boring cycle that is get inefficient. 
---
The Assassins/sentinels or cavaliers armor nerf will happen eventually, i'm hoping before survival mode is added.
---
Meh
---
wtf are you talking about, it literally does both?
---
I wish this was just the only issue I am now having after the past patching and hotfix. Shotgun now breaks so fast it nearly worthless... but wait it IS sometimes truly worthless... as in pre-patch on I was able to see the queen health bar move, now useless I crit at point blank range which IF I am lucky that does move the bar a hairs worth... but then I get B slapped and said gun is broken...
---
you can get a sneak attack and critical on two shot.   Still very useful for the right build.
---
The Cap stashes are bugged ! I havent played on like more than four days and still i cant grab caps fron the boxes that i used last time I played,  they keep appearing as empty.
---
SSE (Single Shot Explosive) suffered being even worse now... I have 1700 10mm rounds and a gun I barely use unless I’m up north
---
Makes sense as every article I have read about this game is copy and paste straight from reddit
---
So just ignore the contingency that it having potential is dependent on Bethesda figuring out their shit... And then say the exact same thing. Gotcha... Just another troll
---
Pretty much all heavy armors in the game look ridiculous. Let’s not forget heavy metal armor’s comedy ‘wing’ pauldrons and random, inpractical blade stuck on one of the gauntlets. Sturdy armor is usually where it’s at. 
---
100 damage = 5% slap
---
100,000 damage = 5% slap
---
100,000,000 damage, therefore, = 5% slap
---
It's a fixed damage. Your bonuses don't affect it. The one-shot "pacifist" complaints didn't realise they were no longer in pacifist due to workshop mechanics.
---
Go ahead and try it. That's what I explained in my first comment. In a team, he attacked, I couldn't. It neither pulled me into pvp nor pulled me out of pacifist. 
---
Mind linking the channel?   
---
On my phone and it's being a tool, and have to say, can't argue with his points, I'd like to hear more!
---
Servers are legit ready for more legit stress by increasing legit stash size. 
---
You can always fast forward to the 45 minute mark, what I did
---
Alternately, they could also balance it  by giving it a downside, such as that it shoots two bullets for double damage, but does so using double the ammo.
---
They could also have made two-shot only weapons do +50% damage, while two-shot explosive would be +25% damage from the second shot and +25% damage from the explosive. Explosive has area damage and can also damage you, so it's different than two-shot alone. Explosive only weapons could be +50% damage with a larger damage radius so they are dangerous to use on anything that isn't at a distance. 
---
These would allow careful player decision-making.
---
The arbitrary percentage nerfs display a lack of imagination and will never succeed in balancing anything while the game is buggy and the economy is broken.
---
I've been away a bit, which thing is 11k?
---
What happened to your quote bud?
---
"hundreds" of ammo is a stupidly low amount. try thousands. alternatively, try a few hundred boards.
---
although I wouldn't try it myself.
---
We want PvP servers because we hope that griefers will use those servers instead of ours.
---
The game is fucking trash mate
---
It takes me about ten minutes to start playing most days. Because of this. Loading into a nuke zone and not aware of it because everything looks fine until I have 10 percent health 90 percent rads. And the ferals load in all at once already pounding on me. Reload the game having lost all my bulked junk. This game isn't worth this anymore. I will not be buying any more games from Bethesda until months after release. They just can't be trusted for quality anymore
---
PvP and pacifist are not the same thing, you can be pull into pvp while in passive, it just means whoever you are in pvp with doesn’t have to slap you they do full damage because you(by way of your teammate) have been pulled into pvp, but pacifist supersedes pvp meaning you are in pvp but you can’t do damage to the people you are in pvp with.
---
My guess is work days.
---
ive run into the problem that weapons are so much lighter to carry on my person , its not worth storing them in the stash , same with meds ... so Ive got 100 of every crafting item , and about 1000 of the primary things like loose screws /gears/springs/ ballistic fiber ....and thats pretty much all thats in there ... I carry all my weapons and spare armor on me .... which forces me to run around in excavator PA at all times ...just to heft it around ... 
---
Yes, 1% isn't playable - that's not the point. The point is bloodied gives more bonus than *anything else* at "I forgot to heal" levels of damage, and as much as pre-nerf two-shot \**with both shots connecting*\* at levels of damage people would sit at just for an interesting challenge run, with no accuracy penalty and so going that damage reliably.
---
Nice coloring!
---
If Bethesda going to change that to not stacking, I think the game will be dead. Since they nerf so many things already, nothing is fun anymore. 
---
Most of the people play fallout series is because you can really sensing you are getting stronger and progressing. You can kill stuff more and more easily when you progress. But it seems like 76 have a u-turn in this and Bethesda is trying to make players grind more. You kinda can tell from every patch and every secret little tweak that they don’t tell customers. 
---
Unfortunately, some players really have nothing to do and really tested everything after updates and every time Bethesda got caught red handed. 
---
there are many perks that makes it as good as being at full health, such as serendipity, sentinel, unyeilding. etc. 
---
Wasn't it even equipped on a Western Revolver in the preview pic? I seem to remember the preview weapon having a pearl or ivory grip, which as far as I know isn't available for the bog standard .44 revolver, but is available for the Western.
---
It's asinine that after you rank-up a card, it's automatically unequiped. Can't the game just unequip it if you lack sufficient SPECIAL?
---
Thank you
---
They have to claim the workshop to start PvP, but there's an exploit by canceling out and you never get notified to defend it.  Then they just come hunt you down anywhere on the map with full awareness of where you are.  Workshops mechanics in the game are seriously F up!
---
Bethesda should make workshop PvP only within a radius of the workshop to stop all the nonsense and give everyone a fair chance at owning a workshop - you're at risk anytime you're there, but it shouldn't be open PvP anywhere on the map.
---
Ok, so I've been tracking and reporting bugs, including their fixes since the beta, not that I've gotten any traction from Bethesda, but you might want to check this post out.  
---
[[Bug Fix] Pretty sure I just figured out the cause of the PowerArmor Targeting HUD CTD's AND THE FIX.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ajk3tq/bug_fix_pretty_sure_i_just_figured_out_the_cause/)  
---
Short of long, last Bug round up I did a bunch of people, on all platforms but especially Console, reported CTD's when wearing the HUD, not only could I prove its a problem, but a fix for it.  
---
After you read the article, try a new helmet with a different mod, see if it helps, my CTD's dropped from literally 1 every 10 minutes (or more) to a couple an hour.  Still garbage, but better. 
---
&gt;They also nerfed the radium gun and commando.
---
explain
---
I love you. 
---
I agree. And love the use of the word asinine in here. I had to say it out loud.
---
&gt; What's the damage on your handmade?
---
At night, 115. Daytime it's somewhere in the 30s (I didn't think to check precisely). It's a Nocturnal Explosive Hardened handmade rifle (forgot the hardened part when I wrote the original post).
---
I have Expert Rifleman (3), Long Shot (1), and Concentrated Fire (2); when I go into Whitespring after a nuke has gone off, I swap Long Shot and Concentrated Fire for a 3-point card that increases my damage on glowing creatures (I think it's Glow Sight but I don't recall its name 100%).
---
Previous to the Jan 29 patch, my nighttime damage was 150+ and, again, I don't know what daytime damage was, but it wasn't as wide a gap as there is now.
---
Sure, tell me I have no idea how to spec or use perks, but things were working well before the 29th. 
---
I've tried it and it ONLY goes on the .44
---
Women wrestling. 
---
TIL there is a women wrestling emoji  🤼‍♀️ 
---
I’ve not had a bad queen run since the latest patch. I’m going to say their optimizing the event was a good thing 
---
it's an online game with pvp and the ability to do damage to other players base....
---
it's just not the game for you...
---
I think you misunderstand me, turning voice chat off completely is a feature, it's not just me deciding not to use a mic. You can't hear players and of course they can't hear you.
---
The idea of having a no invites option is of course not a priority, hence why I'm just suggesting it. Of course I can continue to ignore them, but it seems like it would save people some time and headaches (especially if they do add text chat where I would have to repeat "sorry not looking to be on a team" very often) 
---
I think it's the basic rifle stock that gets rifle + pistol perks
---
but I tried it on a .38 and it didn't work, maybe I was using the wrong stock.
---
I did hear someone say it only worked with the bolt.
---
Well now I feel more the fool. Ah well. Still lack concrete
---
Needed these for one of my challenges to craft 5 molotovs, cheers
---
why aren't you people more angry at bethesda for releasing a buggy game with exploits that still haven't been patched out?
---
it's not going to stop until they fix it, it's that simple.
---
If you ask a high level player most of us will gladly escort you I suggest checking the train station for high level players to ask as no high level enemies will spawn there. what platform? I'm ps4 I can help later tonight.
---
The 76 economy though meagre at least had a chance before duplication debased the currency.
---
&gt;Instead of seeing why people dupe in the first place, they learned nothing and just punished players. There's a reason that literally no other major game studio ban these players since it's all in game solutions for problems they unintentally caused. By solving the problem and punishing players all they have has made a hostile player base. A hostile player base YOU perpetuate by attacking the people unfairly labeled cheaters
---
Hold on. People who dupe aren’t cheaters because the developers are dealing with them poorly in your opinion? What? You’ve reduced “glitches” and “exploits” to problems. Players who duplicated items cheated and deserve to be banned because they cheated. Players who have duplicated items are not cheaters. 
---
&gt;	No one cares about how long a game is out before it’s ok to cheat, I said it’s been going on 3 months and they still turn a blind eye to why players would do what they do
---
A developer’s poor responses don’t justify cheating. 
---
As far as killing you, it worked like it should. He tried to take your shop. That immediately makes you hostile to each other. Until that point he was a neutral.  I have no problem with this since you were at the shop. 
---
When you died I’m sure you were given the option to seek revenge. If you chose “ignore” I’m almost certain it automatically blocks the player that killed you.
---
An issue with the PvP though is that making oneself hostile to another player by attempting to claim a workshop allows you to attack without slap damage anywhere for a certain amount of time. I see two possible fixes for this. 1) offended player and all teammates are notified of a player becoming hostile and a time showing when this will end. 2) Make the PvP from workshop claiming only possible while inside the shop. Drop one of those green circle walls around the shop for both players and PvP damage can only occur while both players are inside the circle. 
---
What's worse is the last several patches have gutted the reasons for player interactions.   
---
-Can't be a merchant, because you can't store enough, even on a dedicated mule to make it worth the trouble.  
---
-Don't need to find a "PowerSmith" to make me shocks, and barter, because I can just buy the plan..   
---
-Wreck the one quest that actually created a sense of community (Feed the people).
---
-etc.
---
They nerfed both the explosive modifier and the demolition perk card so that sounds about right
---
Strange.
---
After I fast travel it goes back to 63......then back to 44......then I fast travel to a new location and it's back to 63.
---
I don't know how the level scaling works but around level 80 I went to claim a bounty on a 6th level. Took me like 5 shots with a non tse handmade. Felt bad, man, like stomping on a puppy.
---
Craft a Forceful Stock and voila!
---
My wife is a very jealous women, but thanks for the thought. ;)  
---
But seriously, see if it helps, now if I can only get Bethesda to stop ignoring me
---
Have you found the 'cat lady house' yet?  Its a house with tons of cat food bowls, pictures of cats, and cat heads mounted on the walls...  
---
A really good camp improvement would be to allow the placement of a cat/dog dish which will bring in one or two cats or dogs that end up hanging out.  
---
You should also get a bonus for petting them just like playing music.  
---
My personal list of things I can’t do on my Beta character (some work find on new alts)
---
1) Lots of people have similar issues to this but there are several Steeped Tea recipes I can’t craft despite having all the mats (Thistle, Fever Blossom, Strangler Bloom etc)
---
2) I can’t use StealthBoys...however I can use Phantom Devices
---
3) I can’t interact w/ gravel pits and only discovered their existence on an alt
---
4) don’t think this is beta character specific but: Addictions do not display properly in the effects menu, the negative effects of mentats and alcohol can show up inconsistently but not others, also I will lose the dmg bonus to a junky weapon after a few hours in-game despite retaining the negative SPECIAL “withdrawal” effects...it would appear addictions go away over time but its implementation is very inconsistent, official verification needed.  It would be nice to have some clarification on how addictions work in game.
---
Thanks for the heads up I haven't had this happen yet but it might one day.
---
I feel like 1000 pounds is about right for stash box , or even better have the 600 pound personal stash and an additional 600 pound open stash that other players can steal from one they pick the lock ....would certainly spice up the PVP and basebuilding aspects of the game....Also camp budget needs to be doubled at level 200 its current amount is pitiful ... 
---
Fair enough. I wasn't as specific in what I was trying to say in my initial comment than I should have been 
---
Lol no clue
---
It goes for like all people. I wish there was more of a challenge. Would be way more fun if PVP was like this. A squad hanging with a wanted person and then boom, other people come to fight him and big fire fight.
---
I only carry 5mm since it weighs zero for me.
---
The game was "sold" as PVP, with Todd Howard even talking about nuking player camps etc.   
---
That kind of concept, tied with content that is not "spoon fed" (you have to look for it) is a bad combo, and bored borderline jerks become full fledge griefers, and it becomes their only enjoyment.
---
Toy cars, I think the rocket ship as well, toy robots, maybe gitty up butter cup?
---
It definitely needs it.
---
Don’t get me wrong, I’m annoyed that this game is buggy. I still like it. That’s why it’s frustrating that some people try and justify cheating
---
Modders would've had this game running smoothly by now
---
Yes they are listed as Bulk Screws; picked them up when vendor hopping when making excavator armor. 
---
Thanks for doing all you have. If you stop, no one should blame you. (I would say “could” but my expectations of the internet are low.) 
---
I really hope BSG puts forth more of an effort. The ball is in their court as far as I’m concerned. 
---
I logged in for the first time today since the hotfix and had a little fun modding up and giving away some of my stashed legendary weapons to high 40/low 50 players, but there isn’t anything left for *me* to do. It’s not worth my time. 
---
We were told this patch would be big, and if this is what they consider a “big patch,” I don’t have high hopes for the future. I’m frankly bewildered it’s taken so long for so little to have been accomplished. 
---
Best of luck moving forward whatever you decide, and thanks again for that T51b helmet. It was nice to romp around in Nuka Cola armor for a couple days. 
---
Yeah im not holding my breath but thought it would be cool. Little more lore friendly instead of teleporting lol
---
So they at have to start and try and take the workshop, the normal case they would take it completely, and then, I would get a notification “x had taken your workshop” which case I’m supposed to come back and fight him off, correct? 
---
Just another random person on the server, can they shoot me? 
---
Workshop dlc? 
---
That kinda gets its attitude from the 1950’s. There was plenty of shady stuff going on back then. As far as the lead in kids toys, the fact that it’s also in paint cans is a reminder that in that era, lead paint was common. 
---
And we as a society are slow to change anyway. Lead (in the form of TEL) was still legal to be in gasoline well into the 90’s. 
---
CL4P-TP's little cubby behind the Crimson Raiders base.
---
That sucks. My three star legendaries fall through the map and end up respawning in different locations throughout west virginia
---
How did i become wanted by meleeing someone when i had pacifist mode on ?
---
I don't really mind the workshop, my problem with the PvP part is they can see where you are start the claim then fast travel close to your location. The notification that your workshop is being taken doesn't stand out alot and I have several times though it was just the defend from attacking wave quest. I have also had a few times where the person who is trying to claim my shop doesn't appear with the red hostile name and health bar just the white one and then one shots me in the face.
---
it's short for respecialization
---
Thanks, I dug deeper and worked out it's one of the Mistress of Mystery's Holotapes. So if you just drop them, then pick them back up, it should work.
---
How do you get these?
---
fo76 has the worst soundtrack of major ones... If I hear praise the lord pass the ammunition ,I straight up turn the damn thing off , thats my "plays every 5 min" song that drives me friggin nuts.....
---
I only ever carry 3 weapons. Gauss (high level areas) or lever action (low level) for long range, handmade for mid range, and combat shotgun for close range.
---
All stats are geared towared rifleman, which is good for both the sniper and semi auto handmade, and if I only ever use the shotgun as a last case scenario
---
There are some wonky bugs lately, it could easily be be Radworms as the boosts both the positive and negative effects of mutations.
---
Both available in atomic shop. Gold skin is only for sale for 1 day.
---
I had a troubleshooter’s exploding gatling once that was sweet in the silos. Once I started trading for TSEs I gave it to a friend. It was hell on just about everything down there and cheap to feed. 
---
The only thing that would make that story more WV is meth.

I'm lvl 4 with a vault tec clothes and half done McClintock. Can I join?
---
No way that can be real??
---
I still have never gotten anything above 1 star... level 80 started to take a break about a month and a half ago
---
Damn, won’t be able to get it
---
I've been on a crusade against melee lately but nerfing everything to the ground isn't the answer.
---
not to mention sentinel/cavalier isn't the be all, end all. it's not additive, instead proccing in turns (75%, then 40% of that, then 30, etc.). you can use poison, burn, bleed or radiation to kill them. especially if they're bloodied. or better yet: power attack. it staggers 99% of the time. melee is the best way to deal with them.
---
Thanks! I’ll give it a shot :)
---
That's nice to know. I almost felt guilty taking someone else's stuff. But then again, I was overwhelmed with that "JACKPOT!" sensation. But who carries around that much junk? I think it was about 800 pounds worth.

Honestly, being sold only for a day is quite cruel.

yeh its fun for about thirty minutes but once your done cooking , your left as a big floppy wet noodle till you relog

Thank you for posting a non-toxic response.

I think the ultracite laser pistol sells from phoenix
---
You CAN have them, cats at least, in my travels today I found a camp near Devil's Backbone that had 3 cats, normal house cats, all passive, 2 playing and 1 sleeping.  
---
I guess the trick will be to get them to the proper damaged level to pacify them.
---
This is happening to me as well.
---
LOL
---
So in a nutshell......
---
You've just been arguing for the sake of arguing.
---
I hope you didn't choose a liberal arts degree over math.... LOL
---
No
---
I like having special weapons for certain enemy types. It forces you too decide if you want to do lots of damage to one class of enemy or less damage, but to all classes on enemy.
---
I use troubleshooter's weapons into nuke silos, then switch to zealot's for the queen fight. I use an anti-armour for general adventuring where I don't know what's going to be trying to kill me. With weapon weight perks, I'll often keep all 3 on me.
---
I'd rather not have the strongest weapons effects be good for everything...you should have plan ahead or carry multiple weapons to do the most damage.
---
Thanks, I'll check there
---
I can't confirm if you can join (I'm not in charge), but I can keep you in mind. 
---
Thanks guys, I'm on Xbox, but I'm gonna call it quits tonight. It was all a bunch of scrap I lost. I'll be able to get it all back, but now I want revenge.
---
Good suggestions though. Thank you all.
---
Yh
---
And forget the blackjack..
---
Massive team? It's just one team and their brand new lol dude wtf are you talking about 
---
If you have instigated the battle and they have that, its mostly game over fkr the attacker 90% of the time. As I saod, it was mostly PVP across all levels of fighting. And lots of those effects like poison, burn, bleed, etc. are only on melee. If that person has a vats build, them stabding till yku are close is another case of game over for the fighter. Hence the stupidly high wanted leves run around and with no one to stop them. Most of these stuff needs reworks cause it was already broken in Fallout 4. Fallout 4 is a single player game, 76 is not nor is it programmed to be so.
---
Nah, you go on ahead.. I'll tell you how it goes. 
---
same, two times in a row!
---
Sorry, I forgot I was using the internet.
---
*Clears throat*

Lmfao. Dude.
---
Put your junk on your stash, find someone, let them kill you for 10 whole caps, and then move on with your life.
---
Lesson learned.
---
Not that big a deal.
---
Nah do t get rid of them buff them up double damage to attended mob type.
---
Damn ghouls, Katherine shall have her REVENGE!!!!
---
What your psn?
---
My dude I am still waiting for them to even mention the idea of introducing usable Vertibirds in 76. The brotherhood obviously had that shit figured out, I'd like to be able to shoot a flare and get air-lifted to whereverthefucc. 
---
That's purty weird.
---
My guess would be 76 days. 
---
It’s always kinda made me sad to see stuff like that gone from the modern gams. New Vegas was a step in right direction, but even that didn’t have some of the irreverence the older titles had.
---
I don ot like pepl of color
---
That is an ugly pistol skin it's a shame that cost atoms.
---
If everyone stopped playing they wouldn't spend anymore time on the game and would just leave it and cut loses which really they wouldn't hurt them as they have covered their costs of the game already 
---
I'm on vacation. The first thing that actually looks tempting to me...
---
I thought it was because todd Howard can't get no respect 
---
&gt;and downvoted it all
---
He says about posts with thousands of upvotes that just aren't on the front page anymore because it's been a few days.
---
it's a general rpg term to describe changing your specialization (class, profession, whatever), it sounds weird because it's supposed to be broad and that's why people use the shorter version
---
Nah. I started as a conversation, then realized it was bait for you to try to argue and validate yourself. I hope you don't choose a skilled trade at whatever for profit college you try to be popular at. It will inevitably be someone else's fault that you suck. ;)
---
Monday afternoon would make sense. [They did post an update](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/am8yat/a_note_on_banning/) yesterday about the thresholds for their bans thus far, in response to claims of "crafting bans".
---
Yeah? I personally like it. Matches well with a wedding ring.
---
Just kill max level supermutants, they have lots of laser sniper rifles
---
Trump doesn’t hate any fucking body, stop falling for the sheepish bullshit. He’s helped a hell of a lot more than harmed. 
---
And don’t give me the border and child separation shit, either. I have a simple answer. I am 15. Cops would “separate me from my family” if my dad decided to be a criminal and rob a bank. So everyone else gets equal treatment. 
---
Because this is the internet, anonymity dictates that i’ll be downvoted to oblivion. I am tired of hiding, might as well say my piece.
---
Can’t do the time? Don’t do the crime. 
---
Open up your heart to me... and your arms... let's go full tdhrottle...

I can’t rly get much bc I’m only allowed to play at the weekends, and don’t want to buy atoms. Got a door for my little brick house tho, so I got that going for me.
---
Get nuclear material from one of the board games. 
---
Our group is Xbox,sorry
---
BYODC
---
Yeah, I know I can do that - but I'm one of those people that wants ALL the plans XD
---
&gt;It's a five point card with the power of a three point card
---
Based on what reference?
---
Because I'm pretty sure every other damage card is 10/15/20% for 1/2/3 stars. 60 is a lot more than 20.
---
Gatling laser too 
---
Sentinel armor?
---
I have yet to get anything in the atom shop. Have over 4000 free atoms saved up.
---
Level 32 recruit reporting for duty, currently online finishing up the McLintock quests.
---
Hell yeah that sounds awesome! They already have the automated vertibots so it shouldnt be to hard to do lol
---
Thanks, finally something worth buying. It's in the shop on PC.
---
you dont really do a good job of describing what he was doing, but there are legendary that buff your DR while standing still and things like that.
---
Honestly, I think this is one of those nice things we cannot have because griefers.  Unless pets are immortal (in which case thousands of duped kitties covering the landscape would be amazing, at least for the 10 seconds the server stayed alive).
---
You're not in the minority at all, most smart people have already left because of this. 
---
So it turns out that it's fine in the main menu, but as soon as I enter the game it happens. i can't play it like this...
---
i always do this lol. its nothing personal, but capturing a factory is like hanging urself as bait to pvp, regardless of lvls. It is the only way to engage pvp without being a dick. 
---
i always do this lol. its nothing personal, but capturing a factory is like hanging urself as bait to pvp, regardless of lvls. It is the only way to engage pvp without being a griefer.
---
Oh ok.
---
The neon letters
---
Apparently if it's Sentinel armor, where you take less damage standing still, you stagger them. It makes them move and negates the armor buff.
---
Tske this w a grain of salt. I haven't pvp'd much but I'm paying attention for when PVP mode comes out. 
---
Pussi... never mind, too obvious.
---
It's been 2.5 months ..... Slow your roll speedy
---
When is the warning? I flipped the switch on a workshop once, but couldn’t claim it because there were still enemies. All it said was I couldn’t have it. 
---
I basically quit at level 19...  Fo76 looks and runs relatively great, but the weight issues made me quit. I havent even explored the whole map. I havent seen whitesprings, I havent launched any nukes, I havent gotten any of the workshops, I havent killed any high level enemies, I havent fought a scorch beast, I havent seen the mothman; There's so much I want to do in this game, but I just cant because weight holding me back. I love the concept of this game so much. But I dont have friends to play with so I have to do everything solo and it kind of sucks. Building is a pain in the ass, Camps are not as good as they could be, etc, etc, etc...
---
I really wish I could play this game and have fun with it... But until weight issues get fixed, loot gets fixed, and some type of text chat gets implemented, I wont open this game...
---
Pretty sure that dirtbag who was leading the enclave made the scorchbeasts. Readn it on a terminal in the bunker. The creation of the mutation serums lead to experiments with a brown bat. Recording instructs modus to keep it quiet. And I'm thinking our use of nukes is only causing them to multiply...
---
Nope. Shot him moving. Sentinel only works when standing still.
---
&gt;Also if off, all slap damage should be removed. Just cause one person wants to fight doesn't mean the other person shouldn't be punished by wasting stimpaks.
---
Todd Howard disagrees.
---
I must be lucky. The only time I get screwed out of legendary loot is when people decide to throw grenades and the legendary body goes flying into Narnia. 
---
Patch notes a month after guard robots are added: Fixed a bug where guard robots would become hostile to the player and invincible, causing the guard to tear apart the camp, piece by piece, while the player is powerless to stop them.
---
Shot him moving. It wasn't sentinel's.
---
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **4th Cakeday** TinyFlair! ^(hug)
---
BGS doesn't fix anything, largely ignores its playerbase, and ignores pleas for help. People volunteer to do Bethesda developers' job for them as a result, and they repay them by asking them to "please submit a ticket." Wow. Just wow.
---
Not really Todd, more like, someone else. Todd is ass deep with 2 other games at the moment. 76 is someone elsexs project and that heavily shows. That or Zenimax and investors are neck deep in controlling the outcome of this game.
---
&gt;If you have instigated the battle and they have that, its mostly game over fkr the attacker 90% of the time.
---
since we're talking about bounties, a surprise melee attack on a wanted sentinel/cavalier player is a surefire way to kill them.
---
&gt;And lots of those effects like poison, burn, bleed, etc. are only on melee.
---
&gt;If that person has a vats build, them stabding till yku are close is another case of game over for the fighter.
---
you can do it with shotguns too, even post nerf. they eat through dodgy. and when dodgy is down, you're dead. I was going to say autos as well, but they don't work for me half the time. healing bug.
---
other than that, now that explosives have dropoff from range, a setinel needs to close the gap. unless they have cavalier as well, a crit to the head is bound to get the job done. and thanks to latency your window is really, really big.
---
&gt;Hence the stupidly high wanted leves run around and with no one to stop them.
---
to be fair, the vast majority of players don't know how to deal with this type of build and will just stand there screeching "duper" and "I report you"
---
They need to have a similar level of power for each legendary effect in it's slot. Making one effect do double damage and another one do 30% against only robots is super unbalanced. Either Nerf two shot or buff everything else like 150% damage against robots.
---
Dude was moving anyway. I know about sentinel's armor. I usually wait till someone with an excessively high bounty is moving before I fire because I know all about that ol' trick.
---
When that happens to me, I get disconnected or she despawns before it loads, so oof
---
u do know that they r going to have to make caps somehow and farm for junk for repairs. If a player gets bankrupt on the pvp server or runs out of junk... where do u think they r going to go? For caps and junk. 
---
back to the pve server. so just like the hunter radio station, which is a good pvp alternative, but is a joke cuz u could never manage to get 4 players. the survival server will hold up for a week then die out.
---
This potential could be invested better into something else. More content or improved game mechanics. Just my opinion though.
---
And the next patch re breaks the fix 
---
No... No it is not.
---
Back in the day only Hokies and Apple 2 computers.
---
Hah sorry I felt compelled to say something. 
---
Of course they're full of it.  Cheaters lie too.
---
I had this issue A LOT last week. Out of the 5 or 6 times I tried it last week I was able to finish it twice. Every other time it would get stuck on an infinite load screen when entering to repair the core and stuff. Haven’t tried it since tho. :/
---
Because maybe they won't care about my specific thread but if hundred or thousands of people are doing it then they will notice.
---
If no one says anything it will just be complete silence.
---
Yeah I was just about to edit mine after seeing your other responses. I wrote this before you said it wasn't Sentinel.
---
Unfortunately then I have no idea. Hopefully someone else does. 
---
Yea; unfortunately you lose all street-armor bonuses when wearing PA.
---
Yea she just despawned so I got nothing
---
Same, Grognak's axes don't go over 100%, but my All Rise and every other weapon does.
---
I'm gonna have to bite the bullet and do the same! Not sure if its even a guaranteed drop if I do get the event to work
---
Assassin's+Lone Wanderer+Serendipity
---
To be fair, they have fixed things, however I think they also have been breaking close to equal, if not more with each patch.   
---
The Hotfix on Thursday was a 3 fixes to one new bug ratio as I understand it.
---
Ahh.  Now I remember. 
---
Full set of Sentinel with assasin or maybe just vanguard . With vanguard and perks you could have more DR than any power armor.
---
I dig your positivity! Its nice after the past week.
---
Confirming INT does effect XP, allot.
---
Adventure mode is the current mode of gameplay. Survival is the one that will be coming out sometime soon. 
---
I hope so, and that it has some kind of counter, or all the dupe cheaters are just going to switch from one-shotting people across the map with explosive shotguns to being unkillable instead, and we'll have to wait another 3 months before Bethesda gets around to dealing with them...
---
I learn new things errrryday!
---
Thanks for that
---
Nice, you a xbox player?
---
cavalier works the same as sentinel, except while sprinting. was he running or sprinting?
---
also, latency in this game is terrible. worse than Dark Souls, which was a p2p game. maybe he wasn't actually moving when you shot him.
---
but I've also heard that, prior to the bobblehead fix, with the proper (bugged) perks, you could extend the buff indefinitely. so maybe they fixed the stacking, but people who already had them active continue to do so.
---
I'm not the one claiming 75% of people in retirement homes play PC games
---
Plan does not exist, mod does
---
I has this happen today as I was going for the black cowboy hat at whitesprings and I killed a 3 star. It dropped a Quad Lever Action rifle one of my favorite weapons and it's body instantly vanished. 10/10 quality game.
---
One time I was stalking a guy with a 4000 cap bounty. Long story short 10-12 lvl 80 and ups were shooting him point black and he wouldn't die. So maybe he was wearing cheats
---
I know the feeling bro :/ I've done the queen 5 times. I've gotten loot one time and it was a hunters crossbow
---
I’ve had the ghost loot on countless enemies. Just as you described. Go to transfer, shows a certain weight but nothing is there. 
---
Not a programmer, but my guess is this:  the game pre-determined what was going to be your loot before the enemy died and that’s the weight we’re seeing, however for whatever reason you don’t get credit for the kill and thereby can’t claim the loot.  
---
Do you normally run around with passive mode on? I know that I've had similar run ins hunting a wanted guy, or a griefer shooting my base to pick a fight. I turn off passivist and try to attack, just for it to do nothing (whether they are moving or not). I would then fast travel, return and fight the good fight again and be successful. I think there can be some type of lag for the game to accept passivist being turned off on occasion.
---
Too bad the gold skin can't be applied to The Voice of Set...
---
Hahaha, seriously.
---
Hopefully it's just a glitch. But, w the way they've "balanced" things so far I wouldn't doubt your scenerio is correct. 
---
Do you remember which door you were using to get the load screen of death? Might be nothing but I got past the load screen using a different way in (was using left towers door). Of course it bugged out differently after I got in so still couldn't complete.
---
Lvl 50 Deathclaws no problem. OMG Lvl 30 Mirelurk King RUN!!!!!!
---
There would have been an unofficial patch a month ago. It would have fixed bobby pin weights, all Perks not functioning according to description, and a host of other issues.
---
And it would been available for Christmas. 
---
I'm just about keeping people honest. No doubt the game will be amazing when they iron everything out.
---
Well I did get exp from the kill tho, or at least I think it was from her
---
That daytime damage is very low but at night with 115 shouldn't take you 50 -60 bullets to kill a level 68 scorched. If they are close to you they should die with only a few bullets. Do you have Bloody Mess? At rank 3 it would add you 15% extra damage to all your weapons.
---
Here is the thing.  It's not fully pay2win...yet.  Rumors of lunchboxes started from them actually being found in the game files.  YouTubers however got very hyperbolic but still now Bethesda hasn't denied it.  I even asked them in a thread and they never responded.
---
We already have seen buffs to superhero outfits.  It's a minor one but is the shop just cosmetic at the moment? No it isn't.  You can get the garb of mysteries free but can't equip armor like the silver shroud costume.  Buffs aren't too much of an advance but once pvp mode comes around.  Having just a minor advantage counts.  It's a slippery slope.  They haven't gone full pay2win but the blueprints are there.
---
As for bans.  Bethesda has come out and said anyone banned has been banned for cheating.  Now this is a bold statement as we all know how Bethesdas codebase is rocky at best.  They must however have a solid detection system to make these claims.  
---
Also most likely those banned for creating 20+ items is false and they are just crying foul because they cheated.  I have actually ran a test on my PC copy and repeated the steps these guys have been claiming got them banned.  Even recorded it with a new character, so far no ban at all.   Also on my Xbox version, which I've now uninstalled.  My character crafted loads of molotovs, diluted stims, meat steaks etc.  If there was a false positive surely myself and many other would be affected.
---
Fallout 76 is a game that was rushed and released too early.  Even now there seems to be a very small team incapable of testing and releasing a patch.  The interent in general hates Bethesda for this.  Some things are hyperbolic yes but look at the comment section for the outer worlds.  This is what fans have been asking for.  
---
I get they need a live service model to take a piece of the current market.  But the way they went about it couldn't have been worse.  Don't get me wrong the game has potential to be one of the greatest games ever made.  But it will never reach that worth current management and the outdated engine.  It's such a shame.  Those okaying now , more power to you.  I stuck with it for 500 hours in the end.   However the bugs and crashes eventually build up to fever pitch and the grind being turned up doesn't make it worth playing.
---
I bash this game a lot but the community really is fantastic.  In game earlier when I ran the test on the PC version...a level 73 in the flat woods church went out of their way to drop some stims and food.  It was so heartwarming I played for another hour before logging off.  
---
May I also I had 2 server disconnects in the first 30 minutes.  A mongrel dog just freeze and not respond.  Then a terminal glitch out and couldn't leave or anything.  Had to restart the game.  If I was a new player I would have a very bad first impression. 
---
Bethesda needs to take hold of this and make good.  Fans are only frustrated and then you get the backlash on this subreddit.  They are frustrated as this game had so much potential.  I am taking a break for a few months now but hopefully things will turn around.  
---
Sad. Hoping you'll find a .44 with nice legendary effects.
---
I have a two-shot 50-cal (non-explosive).  Looking for the same thing but haven't seen any mods at any of the vendors or in the game so far.  So it sits in my stash for now taking up a ton of storage space.
---
I see that there is just a heavy barrel mod...  That kinda sucks given how much the other weapons can be modded.
---
You make good points, what about moving them to a mod spot? I just feel like the loot pool is huge and getting drops that are actually appropriate to your build can be really daunting. 
---
Hey I have a stupid question.  Playing on Xbox one and downloaded the game (no disc) First time I had an issue was when I was roaming around the Moonshiners cabin looking for soot flower. I became surrounded by four players around me and they started shooting. Severely outnumbered I clicked revenge as I didnt really know much about the game 
---
When I found out I bout the pacifist mode I tried to go change it but theres no option.
---
Settings- game- only has invert axis and nothing about pacifist mode. Not anywhere in any settings.
---
What am I missing?
---
We should be re - building the world literally! With our crafting skills why can't we go in and fix every town? Clear the roadways, fix the bridges, maintain the farms. We are the future, using our skills we make the new world. PvP, people could destroy the world again. It's a making the player more in control with the environment.
---
**Known issues**:  
---
-Did you have a "pet"?  
---
If so, when the camp moves, and or it dies, it's % can get stuck.  
---
-Was your camp heavily "wired"?  
---
If so then when the camp gets stored, the wires, which count against your budget, never get properly deducted.  
---
-Did you have plants or water purifiers that vanished when the camp was moved or not placed properly?  
---
If so there is a know issue where they go into "limbo" and may, or may not, re-appear.  
---
**Easiest, but very pain fix:**  (disclaimer, doesn't always work)
---
-Scrap everything, I mean everything.  
---
-Log out, to desktop.  
---
-Log in, move camp, build nothing, log out again.  
---
-Log in, check total used, see if anything shows as stored, or blueprints. If yes repeat above steps. If no, build away.
---
BF4 or one or black ops or whatever gaytarded game is that way --&gt;
---
Known issue, mod authors have reported it, and the fix for it, but Bethesda is ignoring us.
---
That's what we got a broken game. something I'd expect from an indie company not Bethesda.  
---
(I follow many indie games that are currently lacking/broken that will get fixed just a matter of time)
---
In my opinion It's ok for an Indie to have these issues but for a big company like Bethesda inexcusable   
---
Doesn't impact this bug.  
---
G-A-L
---
Hmm.  Maybe a trip to DC too?  See the Capitol Wasteland in its early years?  Could tie it into Modus wanting to reach a government bunker or something. 
---
Of course, we really shouldn’t be encouraging Bethesda to re-use assets like that. We’re liable to end up with copy-paste maps from previous games instead of completely remade ones. 
---
Yea!
---
The funny thing was, I blasted him walking along outside a train station the first time, and we exchanged fire a lot both times after my initial shot. I hit him standing still, I hit him running, and sprinting, from stealth and not in stealth, and he kept taking the same low damage. Maybe it was Vanguard's armor. I never could get him below half health. But even if it was, that's a max armor buff of 105 (if it stacks. not sure of that.), and I'm initially hitting him with well over 1k from stealth, with a crit, and buffs, which should have blown him away if that's all he had....
---
Yeah, I’m not saying that they don’t have practical applications, but the loot pool is just huge and eliminating weapons that capsule be useless for a large number of encounters could go a long way towards satisfying some of the issues with drops.  
---
What about moving them to the craftable mod slots? You could even use the materials or food items that you get from slain creatures/enemies or like the extraction mechanic to do it with.
---
I have the same outfit and the amount of hate from time to time is 90% out of jealousy 
---
I know, I'm saying I think the preview showed it on a Western Revolver. My memory could just be wrong (certainly wouldn't be the first time).
---
So glad I was able to buy this plan. I’ve tried the power plant quest so many times but each attempt either the game crashed or the repairs glitched to where I fixed them but the game said I still need to fix it. 
---
Yes, it is to promote actual exploration, rather than just teleporting wherever you want. Yes, people still do that regardless, but it makes it worthwhile to walk a bit further, or use strategically camps and workshops to lessen the cost.
---
Thanks for saying that. Is it that rare of an outfit? I literally just found it laying there, both pieces, together.
---
Yea. It is just that this screen technically shouldn't be in the game yet.
---
"over 9000" in 2019
---
Neither am I buddy. 
---
Forget it, I don’t have the patience to improve your reading comprehension. 
---
Sorry for that.    
---
    
---
 It's the "have-not" hate...  
---
I've been accused of being a duper because I have "mule" accounts, and give extra stuff away after farming WhiteSprings for 3 hours..  
---
Or like you, had things people hadn't seen before..  
---
It's frustrating, but ignore them.
---
Haters be suckin on jelly sickles....
---
Why?  Because it says it's for the 44 and not the Western revolver.
---
I have never turned passive mode on. Ever. Not even once. I just check my fire or let myself get shot if I accidentally get a 5 cap bounty. It wasn't that.
---
Has for me.
---
It's BS but there is an auto boot for ten minutes if you craft too fast, enough to trigger the server- gotta be in the hundreds.  Just be slow and steady, better for server stability anyhow.
---
I'm a little surprised how much I miss NPC's and the story lines. But meeting the community has been more fun than I thought it'd be. 
---
I think that might be the placebo effect... I believe scorchbeasts are animals and fall under Hunter's prefix. Things that do more damage to both scorched and SB have it explicitly called out in the description. (Scorched killer receivers and prime receivers)
---
Or leveling bup a weapon category based on a certain gun only to have it nerfed to death.
---
Or at least make it reduced cost to travel from one station to another, maybe even make players buy a ticket from those useless ticket vending machines.
---
Which would be a legitimate thing if they had models unique to each other.
---
The outfit these guys were talking about is purple and looks way way different to the one we have. It's just a static spawn in that cabin it took me a few load in and outs to get both but it's not a hard set to get. Its seems they were just stupid haha 
---
God, that must he infinitely more frustrating for you. Trying to be nice and then getting a response like that.
---
Mostly agreed, though shotguns 2h melee and black powder are good enough to not spec in right away. 
---
I can spec out pretty well for a Gatling +2h melee + Rifles.
---
I find strength the worst. Melee, unarmed, heavy, shotgun, plus weight redux.
---
Perception is easy to leave on rifles, agility easy to leave on pistols.
---
happens with all dogs. just happened to me today.
---
I do the same thing.  I always appreciate a well-designed CAMP.
---
Went ahead and bought it because it is shiny.  My only disappointment?  Crafting it uses oil and doesn't require gold.  Should really be gold plated not paint.
---
Idea:  upon killing an enemy you get the option to extract something specific to them. Like raw flux, it spoils and become worthless eventually. This raw material is used to craft something similar to the Scorched Killer’s receiver where it does a large bonus for attacks against that type of enemy in exchange for a modest decrease against everything else. 
---
It would be nice to be able to scrap legendary weapons to get these items too. 
---
Or at least to the next building...
---
I like to find out if it can be done just with broken game mechanics before I call anyone a cheater. If it can, you are definitely "exploiting", but not an outright cheater.
---
And then you have to roll for specific legendaries and dedicate perk cards that could be used for damage/qol, not to mention a risk of radiation damage killing you. I'm not saying it's not strong, but it still has weaknesses/requirements. 
---
Wrong.  Scorchbeasts fall under the Scorched category.  Dunno who keeps spreading this misinformation.
---
The town borders on unrecognizable on a 10 year cycle. 
---
Gotcha,  i have starched genes 2 and lose mutations stop working once rad worms gets cured till i relog. 
---
Maybe it's influenced by the mixture of mutations. 
---
I only have 2.
---
ah.. damn.. already bought the barn plans a couple hours before posting
---
It's an issue that popped up in the mid-Jan patch.  
---
For some reason, once stored it decides you cannot ever place the camp again, and the only fix it rebuilding by hand.  
---
Have had it happen 3 times with one character, expensive both resource and time wise.
---
I live in a boat... Nomad Life!
---
Try........Up, up, down, down, left, right, B, A, Start
---
I ran a test earlier on PC.  It's bullshit.  Bethesda have confirmed they aren't banning people for 20 items and I believe them.
---
Why? I have proof.  I crafted 20 items just like the cheater said in his post.  Even recorded it.  So far, no ban.  You are safe to craft my dude.
---
Why has this not been fixed?  I'm actually recording clips of it for proof 
---
I fast traveled and stalked a guy for 15 mjnutes while I was wearing BOS chameleon armor and a TSE handmade with long range scope.
---
He had a 5 bounty.
---
Put a few in his head and took his alarm clock out of his paper bag.
---
Yeah, I am insane too lol
---
I’ve seen it several times during an SBQ fight. Very annoying. 
---
There's really a lot in that area, I grew up just east of Pittsburgh, Philly, DC, Gettysburg, all just a couple hours out.
---
Should really include what platform this is for in the title.
---
Do we have to join for the "new player help" this is my 1st fallout game i was interested in but not really sure how to play other than collect stuff. Kill stuff. Build and explore. I havent evven completed the main story yet.
---
you get 50% more buffs from drink and food too
---
hahahaha!!!
---
Well I'm at work till like 2:30 CST. I play almost every day from like 3am to 6am which I know is late for most.
---
It can suck, had a guy spend a few minutes cussing me out when I just wanted to give him extra 1 &amp; 2* Legendaries.  
---
The community here swings between supportive and toxic as well, there seems to be no middle ground, kind of like politics now! ;)
---
my power armor unequips itself when going through load screens or getting in and out of it. Ive made so many tickets and complained so many times about this, how is this not a known issue?
---
Fairly rare, spawns in one place, where people infrequently go, and even then usually people have claimed it.
---
Yeah I quit playing right after the last story mission once I realized the vast majority of my play time was just inventory management. I spent like 2 hours selling shit and just dropping things and was finally about to leave Whitespring with some room to explore when a guy and his friend at about level 100 told me they were dropping a bunch of stuff that I'd probably want and that I should look through it before somebody else gets it. Cue the next 2 hours of deciding how to make enough space. At the later levels, Fallout 76 turns into like a warehouse manager simulator game where you're constantly trying to make space.
---
It’s like you’ve never played an online game before. They’re everywhere. 
---
And while we’re at it, we should be able to level up all our guns like with the Voice of Set. 
---
Absolutely correct.  I forgot that I had to re add that to the title section before submitting.
---
It just works. 
---
Sure, as long as they can bring troubleshooter's/zealot's/etc up to 150%, instigating up to 250%, furious, junkie's, and mutant's to cap at 100%, assassin's to 120%, berserker's up to a max of 200%, bloodied up to a max of 250%, nocturnal to +100% at night and -100% during the day, and anti-armor to -100% armor. Once they do all of that, they are free to raise two-shot back to +100%
---
How much is it out of curiosity?
---
I always thought bloody mess was purely visual, for fun. I'll grab it on my next level-up.
---
I would love to see the actual outfit they were talking about that people apparently dupe for
---
The gold skin is 400 atoms.
---
It's not rare its uncommon because of it being only in one location but still it looks nice especially the mask.
---
Grow some skin and try not to let your feelings get hurt by the offhand comments of others.
---
Your textures are not loading in properly.  
---
Usually this is caused by a bottle neck somewhere, either not enough CPU overhead, memory bandwidth or GPU bandwidth.  
---
And before we go down the "I have an awesome gaming computer".. It doesn't matter if things aren't optimized or you have a browser open that's got a memory leak and has eaten up half your memory and GPU resources.  
---
Next time you open '76 also open task manager and see what your resource load looks like.
---
Perk system needs help badly. 
---
It's almost as if you get rewarded for a specialized build as opposed to being able to one-shot anything without trying
---
Thanks
---
OP = 😭
---
I figured it had to be somewhat uncommon, because it has 1 damage resistance.
---
If you would like some help I am game. Add me. Vighardur 
---
Hit YouTube my dude https://youtu.be/F2jflHMQDLk around 7.20 on the video is the park you can work your ass off to get it from 
---
Woah
---
Manually edit your INI's and make them read only
---
You shit yourself have ya... 
---
Oh sweet thank you I’ll add you once I get the pieces for the launch!
---
I'm still here.
---
Ran that location tonight; two Legendaries where present, a three star and a single.   The three star dropped a two star quad Gauss rifle.  The single actually dropped a one star leather right leg!  
---
I laughed like hell but feel bad that expended the resources to get the skunk.   
---
FWIW, I killed the three star first and ran into the. One star on the way out.   Not sure if that’s part of the drop algorithm.   
---
Lastly - the leg is crap.   Not worth it.    Sold it for 5 caps in Watoga.   Sold the Gausser too.   That was junk.   
---
Me too. 
---
Pieces?
---
I don't know.  I haven't seen any posts about people quitting ;)
---
I think that the enemy specific effects should stay, but should be more common effects on 2 and 3 star legendaries, and less common if even obtainable on 1 stars.  I think 1 stars should get a damage buff of some kind that is useful overall to make them a viable option. I'll use a 2 shot 1 star over a mutant, vats boosted, crab hurter. But a 2 shot crab hurter is obviously better than both of the latter, because I always have the 2 shot but am now much more effective against bugs and mirelurks.  I know that 2shot did just get a nerf but it was just used for example.  
---
Of course the desired gear and effects will vary depending on the player and build.  But gear, perks, and legendary effects could use a rework in general, better to fix the issue rather than bandage it. 
---
The Carnivore mutation is amazing. Plenty of enemies drop meat and no disease chance even if it's spoiled.
---
You can just straight up eat spoiled meat. It's about as filling as Mole Rat meat.
---
It's way more active than the other Fallout subs.
---
Yeah the code, unless you can still use the weekly ones
---
Yes! He mentioned Camden Park. Also that is the outfit I had on at the very beginning. Completely damn different than the purple one.
---
I have to say yes. It's not a good thing to see the game like this. I know they can do better and it would be easy for them to do so not like they don't have the cash to spend on the resources to do so and they know they have the fan base to get the money back they want on it... ???
---
I'm surprised you can't even see the problem with what you've said just on the face of it.
---
If you think that weeks and months is acceptable just to even get a response, let alone a resolution to someone's problem, you're beyond help.
---
It's not the customer's concern as to how understaffed or under budget or poorly managed or how monumental the workload is for a company. If they company doesn't deliver in a manner that's acceptable, the customer has every right to be upset. That's it. Plain and simple.
---
That would imply Bethesda understands balance.  
---
The TS(e) "rebalance" and all the heavy and laser weapons suggest otherwise ;).  
---
But yes, honestly I almost think they should split the PVP off into servers with no legendary items...   
---
 Maybe the quest reward ones, and that's it
---
people quitting?? when did this happen??
---
Hopefully only the crybabies have left.
---
PvP is a shitshow no matter what class of weapon they nerf or what Legendary effects they render useless.
---
Everyone using a non-automatic weapon build that's filled out can one-shot just about any other fully-built character with their harder hitting weapons. I mean any weapon that isn't their shitty pipe pistol they use for killing low level enemies. Everyone is a glass cannon getting one-shotted and one-shotting each other so there isn't any PvP combat, just PvP quickdraw duels. The VATS aimbot shit makes it even worse.
---
Players do too much damage and absorb too little damage for PvP to be fun until they figure out how to reduce player-to-player damage. It'd be simple, really, but I doubt they'd ever have the balls to implement it and we'll just see everyone running around with muskets shooting each other in the face for the majority of PvP gameplay.
---
The worst executed PvP I've ever seen, to be honest.
---
Haha yeah man same I love it all serial killer looking!!
---
It's the weekend dude. I've personally found it busier during the week than the weekend.
---
I will play again when that add the first free Dlc I think. But the thing is, the community has been split. People including me defended fallout 76 because we were defending fallout. But I think now we've either lost interest or given up on 76. When the Dlc starts maybe it'll liven up again. Hopefully they add good stuff. 
---
If ya ever wanna fk shit up and your PC hmu
---
I think it's referring to the vault tec beds from fallout 4 which is in the regular bed on the fifth slot
---
&gt;However, I used to use a handmade sniper, with silencer, and sneaked a lot. I still did it on occasion when I didn't want to one shot something, or just to save on ammo, etc.
---
I had a TSE Revolver my team pooled our resources to buy and I agree with you. A great gun still has durability and Ammo needs, I saved mine for rare Scorchbeast queen fights or times I *need* to do huge amounts of damage.
---
&gt;Here's the thing. I was able to one shot max level scorched before I ever went NEAR any explosive ammo,
---
I think most "Classes"  are able to do this, a Black Powder sneak attack is a ton of damage, nevermind the insanity of Melee Sneaks 
---
&gt; master rifle x1, expert rifle x1, riflemanx3). I may be forgetting something, but I'm pretty sure that is it.
---
You have tank killer and Luck Perks? 
---
&gt;t I'd be getting diminishing returns on points 2 and 3 for each of those cards. (10% for one point, 15% for 2, 20% for 3, etc).
---
What do you use instead? I'm a Charisma build with 14 Agility to run Adrenaline to share and 9 Gunslinger Perks and I wouldn't give up any slight increase in damage for very much.
---
Tuesday patch included the TS(e) rebalance, which in every way is flawed (long story but they did it the worst way possible) and it gutted the demo builds, all explosive heavy weapons (Missile Launchers etc.) and rendered the explosive secondary effect,'which did need a rebalance,'let's me honest, pretty terrible l.
---
I’ve got the code 
---
I haven't seen anything about that.  I know I keep forgetting I have bulk and hitting "scrap all".  Very annoying.
---
You are in the minority, based on the stats we see.  However, that doesn't mean you're wrong, or that this isn't a problem.  I may be a Filthy Console Casual like most FO76 players, at lvl40 and only able to free up a coulee hours a week, but I can see the writing on the wall even now.  I've a handful of areas to find, a dozen quests to complete, and then it's nothing but boring grind-fest events and nuking Whitesprings for RNG Legendaries.  
---
I really enjoy the main quest and stories, the environmental tales are brilliant, but this game just feels incredibly short compared to even Skyrim, a much older game.
---
Here is another issue you need to be aware of! There currently isn't enough item diversity, events, quests, and/or activities in this game that are rewarding enough to keep many players around. In short, this game is a constant chore. 
---
Here is what we want:
---
1. Rewards to be adjusted to make events, quests, and killing enemies an efficient way to earn resources (i.e. de-incentivizing farming and/or ‘server hopping’ behaviors).
---
2. Workshops to be lucrative to incentivize operating, capturing and defending workshop from other players.
---
3. Events to actually be rewarding by providing players with useful buffs or effects that incentivize replaying them on a regular bases.
---
5. New items or new item attributes to provide players with more “Build” identity by synergizing equipment effects with perks and SPECIALs.
---
I think if you see someone happy about pvp in anyway, you'll soon see the guys labeling him a griefer, try-hard, no life liberal etc.  Me and a few friends have made had a blast wasting teams of lvl 100+ who's Tse weapons now suck
---
I knew it was someone's camp.  I didn't know you get a price on your head if you picked the lock.  Lesson learned.  Someone claimed the bounty after I dropped all my rare junk in my camp and life goes on.
---
Some TSE weapons did about 9x the damage of the base weapon, the nerf was justified and needed to happen. Even after the nerf they're still the most powerful option, difference is that now you have to actually spec for the weapon.
---
They've already mentioned how they're looking at buffs to heavy weapons and energy weapons.
---
A minor point - but try going to bed before you start your adventure.  The Well Rested bonus gives you an extra 10% XP.
---
Yeah, it's a know issue. I think a fix is coming in the next patch.
---
They are not banning for 20, or 100, as they claim, however I would suggest not making more than 250 at a time (if you had that many resources) because 300 is the magic number for dupers, and likely what they are flagging to review.
---
Alright, thanks. It seems to average at \~60% gpu usage, \~40% Cpu usage, and about 60% of my RAM  
---
Most games I have use up significantly more resources than that, and don't have this same problem. Hell, even Fallout 4 after I ruined it with mods used more, and didn't have this, so it can't just be a Creation engine issue.  
---
Its not my stash.... And i don't owe you proof of anykind.
---
I posted earlier with full details and got fuck all reply, hence my 2nd time im more angry,,, 
---
When your game is broke and nobody listens, you would be angry too... 
---
I qwas getting tamed animals, thats where the Storage in the camp budget went wrong. 
---
Add me vonaudy
---
I've had it twice.  All I can see is a long neck that stretches across the whole screen and there is nothing to target so I can't fight back.
---
Oh I was unaware that they had changed. 
---
I checked that out. Assassins can only give you a cumulative 30% protection. I'm hitting him with well over 1k damage, so it wouldn't matter. Serendipity only works below 30% health. I never got him below 50%. Dodgy also only eats 30%. Not enough. Lone Wanderer stacked with Dodgy would have eaten 60%...Maybe getting close. But 60% off of 1k is still 400 damage. Say his armor ate 200 and he had max endurance. I still would have knocked off 2/3 of his health bar, and I do well over 1k with a stealth BP rifle attack + a crit + chems, mags, etc...
---
You have a walking cane? 
---
You just went Over the Top.
---
50% at most. its still strong for extra stagger chance. 
---
I really enjoy the classical radio. Killing scorched when listening to the Tannhaüser make me want to invade Virginia.
---
it is. it was infinitely more active about a month ago.
---
I've said this before and got downvoted, so there you go.
---
I saw that earlier today.  A box with Vault Boy walking and it says Adventure.
---
Are you sure they didn't call you a "cheetah"? Maybe they've never seen a mole before and that's the closest thing you look like to them?
---
Sorry, I thought you knew. My fault. 
---
Do you have both an on motherboard GPU and a slot in card GPU?  
---
Do you have more than 1 slot in GPU?  
---
If so, you might want to google the video card assignment INI settings (on my mobile, sorry), as many people, even after they claimed to have fixed it, report they are having issues with it pushing data to the wrong graphics card.
---
Thanks loser now if you'll excuse me I'm going to go sell this for 200 caps
---
What do you mean new player help?
---
god. damn. it.
---
Will do 
---
This a problem that I'll agree Beth didn't foresee, White Springs is simply too good of a spot that it's always being camped by high levels.  Quests like the Unruly Golfers and the Mistress of Mysteries, which are aimed at low levels, are practically impossible for a low level to accomplish alone because of the sheer multitude of high level spawns.  I don't think Beth ever thought through the likelihood that WS would become the hub it's become...
---
Well lore wise your just skipping your character walking there, and time is passing, so while you were fast travelling I'd like to think your character ran across Todd Howard asking for your money 
---
100% with you on this 2 of my friends got the game due to me. Both stop playing due to game breaking issues plus bad Quality of life experiences for them as casual players.
---
Well it’s probably because you touch yourself at night. 
---
Possible I saw this just now. A group of 3 people, 2 were wanted, and I couldn't kill any of them. Gauss rifle does 390 damage, and it didn't even make a dent on any of them. Either this, or they are cheating somehow, which I don't put it past anyone now.
---
How could you not know that picking up tens or hundreds of thousands of items is probably a bad idea?
---
Yeah, whenever I see power armor on my target I laugh internally. It's useless for anything but in a nuke zone when you need the rad resistance. And that's sad. The current game balance makes the iconic, supposedly badass power armor essentially a non-factor.
---
Anything you're looking for help with in particular?
---
Sounds like a job for... for Mr Train Hats!
---
I'm right near that location! We should have a block party 
---
I just posted about this.
---
When I fast travel to a new location and check my pip boy the damage changes.
---
The other day post nerf I posted my gun doing 63 DMG. I check tonight.....44 DMG......fast travel to Whitespring 63 DMG.
---
My dude do u play on ps4? Seem like a good raider
---
Sweet, sweet tse tears.
---
clearly no turrets, or you wouldn't have had the budget! 
---
Great shots, btw.
---
Quests n things, i keep getting wrecked, just trying to run the main story as well as level up, its rough, ive played with other people, just more of a fun game with more people, running solo sucks
---
My first character on the stress test before the beta was gary
---
The Perot isn't for me, it's for Bethesda support here to verify this issue actually exists and isn't just you reading things incorrectly. 
---
You don't have to be an ass, it doesn't help or add to anything
---
Wow, you can't just turn your build on a dime and change it at will.
---
&gt; Perks were intended to be extras that add humor, variety or choice. 
---
Let's not project what perks are for to your benefit. They're not extra. They're core to the character build/levelling process. The outfits you can wear are extras. Perk cards are not.
---
Chances are they confused it with the Camden Park mascot outfit.
---
It doesn’t mean you can’t be detected just harder to detect. It also depends on your perks, armor etc...If they just happen to touch you while they are moving you can still be hit 
---
I got Marsupial from drinking toxic goo at level 90 and was very happy...  I had the Starched Genes perk enabled then I swapped out cards to get more stims and ammo (Pharma Farmer, Scrounger), for got to put it back.  Needless to say that I then randomly used radaway and lost it.  So, it's not only inexperienced players that screw up...  In my case it has a happy ending at level 99.  
---
Me and another guy ended up in the same area and going to the same places.  We started talking and we were both doing the same part of the Rose quest.  We teamed up.  At the end, I asked him if he needed anything and gave him 4x 100% fusion cores.  He gave me his extra Marsupial and a Speed Demon Serum that he got from another guy who had the recipes.
---
My plan now, is to work on getting the recipes....  It would be cool to be able to pay it forward by crafting my own..
---
Yeah, it’s a bug Bethesda introduced with Patch 5 that affects all platforms. A temporary way to fix the issue is to switch servers.
---
I'm almost level 20 and have done it all exclusively solo. It's been lonely so far. 
---
Noticed that. Power armor is a gimp suit for PvP. Can't take cover, and you're a massive, slow-moving target whose animations do little to get your hit box juking and dodging. The armor does jack shit against a fully-built rifleman character or shotgunner.
---
PvP is trash and the Demo nerf is trash. A simpler, less bumbling method of nerfing the explosive Legendary effect would've been to *just nerf the explosive Legendary effect*. Make it not benefit from demolition expert since that perk is really meant for actual ordnance-type weapons and grenades.
---
Instead they fucked my build and really ruined the iconic power-armor war machine character archetype. War fucking changed, guys.
---
This patch broke stealth. 
---
I also thought about this as a solution.
---
Active is a relative term.
---
The view I joined that were pretty busy early on are pretty dead now. Try the main reddit one. Closest one I've seen that's even modestly active.
---
We should play, ive been playing mostly solo
---
Discord is kinda dead too.
---
You will get an upvote, because what you said is true.
---
I don't dispute the explosive should have been adjusted, but they did it in the most backwards way possible.  
---
  **The Suggested and Ignored Fix**  
---
-Clone the explosive Legendary effect, move it to the Primary (Prefix) Legendary slot, as it should have always been, and lock it to 50% impact from explosive perks. Adjust the % effect through feedback.  
---
-Take the original Explosive legendary effect and adjust f so it no longer benefits from the explosive perks, at all. This locks it to a flat +25 points of damage per bullet / beam.  Remove it from the drop tables, leaving the original weapons as "Legacy" items, that are powerful, but balanced.  
---
-Do nothing to the Explosive perks, because if you've played with them outside of TS(e) weapons, you'll understand they were good, but only for a niche build.  
---
-Do nothing with Two-Shot, ranged weapons overall need a buff to begin with, and TS is bugged in vats making the second round miss over 90% of the time, balancing the VATS usage already via bug.
---
I read that wrong it says help low lvls. Im currently lvl 7. And would apreciate if one or two of ur members would teach me how to propperly play the game
---
Yeah, both an integrated and seperate GPU.  
---
Lowering my settings to medium but keep Ultra textures seems to have fixed this, thanks for your help! I can play without all the fancy lighting, but when the gun in my hand is a solid gray color with random bloom effects it's hard to even look at the screen.  
---
Dead game is dead.
---
When they fix their games they somehow break it even more
---
I've only seen it once. It must be enabled on specific servers is what I figure, mistakenly probably.
---
Sorry bud. :(
---
Scorch beast Ai actually always know where you are, the same might be said for scorched and other enemies. It's to make the game have more encounters but defeats the point of fallout being that of choice 
---

I am not on right now. I don't think I will be on much, if at all, tomorrow. I do have Monday off and will spend the majority of the day online.
---
I would love to party up though and do some mobbing. 
---
Because it just works. -Todd Howard
---
I never knew this! Thanks for mentioning it!
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
If you watch the ground, you'll see dust spots where its moving but cant hit it
---
wait there was a discord? gotta check that out :)
---
I said **normal** not **acceptable**. Its perfectly normal, doesnt mean it is in any way acceptable. Please read more carefully next time.
---
Awesome!    
---
Depending on if you have a 1080ti level system or a 970ti system you can likely squeeze even more out with a few more tweaks.
---
Omgs the load time takes forever now. Randos were inviting me to team up with them and I'm still in the load screen.
---
They're both the same plan just called Laser from memory. 
---
It's around. Found it as loot a couple of times.
---
Yeah dude you missed the swarm of “I quit” posts when the last update rolled out. It was really entertaining

Resend lol i fucked up

Fun aside, are we likely to see the abysmal rate for mod learning on these things bumped up to something closer to other rifles? these things are a massive screw sink and the rate is way off compared to other rifles.
---
Now we are talking about my stopping ground. York PA, where the first drafts of the Declaration of Independence were written. Be cool to see some failed "in the future" faction based in PA... Now I'M excited lol
---
Ha okay
---
Pubgesus69. My husband is a level 36 and is always needing peeps to play with 
---
Meh. If you say so. 
---
Personally I tried to get my level up before going through the main quest, as some named legendary are locked to your level when you complete the quest I think
---
Because of games like WoW where you start off by hitting 5's and struggle to get 2 silver and end then end up hitting multiple millions and have 40k gold by the time you're level 110.
---
And even if you knew it was duped you have no idea if the devs even give a shit. It's only a bad idea because the dev says it's a bad idea. Well actually they don't say it's a bad idea, they ban you and THEN email you saying it was a bad idea.
---
But when it does play
---
Ooooh fuck does it feel good. I actually kind of like that it’s so rare.
---
sure I have some people
---
GT ManLikeJay93 add me if you want
---
I hate the other one about shooting people on accident idk I just hate that shit song.
---
Thanks mate just looking to connect more dropping nukes alone is kinda flaccid 
---
I’m gonna look into that. Thanks
---
I can't message you. :/

---
This Casual Underarmor plans have been bugged since beta, and we've reported the fix (ModAuthors) but thus far it remains broken.  
---
**Details:**.   
---
The level 4, step before shielded is given out as a quest reward, however the leveled list it's attached to was never added to the quest correctly, so it cannot be given as a reward.   
---
Because you can't get the  4th tier, you'll never see the 5th tier become available.   
---
The only way people were able to bypass this  unresolved bug is through the QASmoke room exploit.
---
yes, and all i do is raid. I make 1000s of caps a day off killing other players. Plus junk farming off players is also quite resourceful lol.
---
u could join up for a raid, if u r interested.
---
Nope.  Both effects were overpowered and made both effects individually mandatory for all guns and builds (unless you were going bloodied melee).
---
I hope you understand that there's a pretty huge difference between hacking and threataning and account phishing, to duplicating some items.
---
I read carefully.
---
I want this to be crystal clear so you don't miss anything here - you're saying it's normal to have to wait weeks or months for a support response?
---
I currently cant get on. But if u can add me on xbox = I Quiet Q I. I dont play very much. But would apriciate ur guys help
---
first mistake was proposing the idea to begin with.  but the more egregious error was to delete your own comment.  doing that shows you are foolish AND cowardly.  I can respect someone that has a goofy idea and stands by it but to propose something absurd then delete it when you run into resistance is just sad.
---
I *really* like that
---
What's worse is they are refusing all attempts at trying to help them fix things.   
---
Some of the modding community have been spoon feeding them fixed for months, and so far we've not seen any traction on them.
---
Wow. That really should be better documented. Cool. 
---
York! Chambersburg for me. It got burned down in the civil war, that's something. 
---
Two turrets on the ship, actually, but they are on the other side guarding my farm - and I think still have about 10% budget left. 
---
What a shame ! I believe it'll come back someday and hope you'll be able to get it then.
---
Could you possibly send me an invite? 
---
I'm so tired of games not having sex.
---
I don't mean shitty porn games, I mean "Triple A" games.  They should have sex in them too, not just violence.
---
Same way a level 91 glowing deathclaw spawns in behind you in a parking lot and 2 shots you, while your HP bar stays greyed out after spamming stims.
---
People who insist it's bucket will be disappointed to know that even if it was bucket, it's definitely done in such a way to make think "did she just say fuck?"
---
But I'm like 90% sure she says "fuck it".
---
I was wondering if I could do that. Thanks 
---
When Bethesda released Patch 5 and introduced nerfs to various Perks like White Knight and Demolition Expert without notifying the player base. Essentially making the game grindier. They also brought back previously fixed bugs like Bobby Pins weighing .10 again and the inability to use bulked junk when crafting or repairing something.
---
  Frankly full on PVP in this game as it is will be a shit show.  Weapon balance is non-existent.  That is not a big deal in single player or oop PVE, but fuck this game in PVP.
---
So there are no bugs? No one ever gets disconnected?
---
Ahhh...  Or just comments here will be fine too. :)
---
It does, it reminds me of the BOS officer uniform
---
There's something screwy going on, here.
---
I am saying that it is perfectly normal under a certain set of conditions (this being the volume of work, the number of staff, etc.) that response times of tickets can increase to a point where it may take them weeks/months to action, is it an acceptable behavior, no, but unfortunately due to certain circumstances it cannot be helped, twist that how you want, but that doesn't change the fact that it is fact.
---
It's the big blue box on the right of your screen.
---
Just had a thought: Maybe people like this can be bypassed with radiation damage weapons like the radium rifle and gamma gun? Would have loved to see this guy's face if I hit him with a full-auto radium rifle and dropped him. lol
---
Yeah.. the lack of content is unbelievable.  I can only kill the queen so many times. 
---
I'm sure the Anthem live demo isn't helping 
---
Tyvm
---
No I'm good. 
---
Should be good to go now.
---
One of the best things about Fallout 4 was the awesome nude mod
---
Did you just message me? Im new to most of the reddits ways. Hah
---
 What system are you on?  I don't notice anything like that on my PC.  It may be a console thing or your PC has issues with the game.  My only problem is I can't see my damn sight so aiming is a pain unless using a scope.
---
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **8th Cakeday** LocoOnSoco! ^(hug)
---
I would love this just so I'm not throwing away very useful plans that my main already knows, or weapons that aren't useful to this character but are to another. 
---
+1 for your username!
---
Lots of real history they could adapt for them to play with.
---
Ok neat.
---
We ***need*** those mods for FO76
---
Hey that might have been me! I always drop what i don't use, but always collect ammo from fallen enemies. 
---
Yep 2/2 I ran into it. Tried a few things then checked here. Will try the drop all but the one next.  Weird bug but glad there is a work around. Thanks all. 
---
&gt;**Quests, Challenges, and Events**  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;**“Early Warnings” Quest cannot be completed**  
---
&gt;**STATUS:**  This issue was addressed in Patch 5. The quest will no longer become  stuck when crafting Upgraded Motors and logging out after crafting  Upgraded Motors will no longer reset the quest tracker to 0/5.
---
**NOT FIXED:** I just got stuck on this tonight. Logged out after crafting the motors, have the "Select Motors Upgraded at the Scorched Detection Terminal" quest step, but selecting that option does nothing.
---
Opened Incident **190202-004534** using the "help" link in the support section of the site with the following text:
---
&gt;Stuck at "Select Motors Upgraded at the Scorched Detection Terminal".  Selecting that option does not progress the quest. I did log off after  the completing the previous step.  
---
&gt;bug\_char\_name = Washburn 
---
Got a copy/pasta of the walkthrough as a "solution"... I don't *need* a walkthrough. I've since responded with:
---
&gt;This did NOT resolve my issue... please read the original ticket and  don't give me an automated response... The quest is BROKEN and I cannot  continue because I do not have the Upgraded Motors. I logged out after  crafting them and they are NOT in my inventory, I cannot continue with  this main quest line because it is bugged. This is NOT an uncommon or  new issue, and while it was supposed to be fixed in the Jan 29th patch,  it broke on my character just over the past 2 days.
---
I've worked in support... Did so for several years... this is *not* support. Support starts with paying attention to the issue as the customer describes it, and then working towards the root cause and a resolution. That did NOT take place here.
---
I come from an MMO background, so while I like it the way it is, I like more grind in my games than most people. Plus in the group of 4-5 people I play with we all took diffrent specialties and share legendaries that are better for others.
---
Being able to mod up the perfect legendaries kinda whould defeat the purpose for me and most of my freinds, this may change once we get something better than farming to do for endgame content.
---
I wasn't going to comment, but now I have to.  Flamers could be badass. Currently, they aren't and never have been. I want them to be. I want to roll around West Virginia like I was the Cigarette Smoking Man yelling "BURN IT!" (X-Files reference). One day my friends, fire will be great again!
---
 I get that.  I have about 130 hours in and I a feeling the need for a break.  Honestly, I feel like if I have been entertained this long by a game it was worthwhile, new updates will come and the game will improve.  We can come back later.
---
Yeah I'm just waiting for the PvP update and additional PvE content before I return to the game. Bugs never stopped me. I REALLY want a player hub though. Give us a main city of some kind!
---
Lvl 226 melee build. Got a group of guys as well, we should join forces. Bthirst68 is psn
---
Yeah they actually change now all we need to do is launch it
---
Its random! I know I said it in chat already where it is located. I dont remember lol let me find out again😄
---
Yup, just sent you my gamer tag so you can join my game. 
---
I'm finding the shop very boring and overpriced. Why would you buy a clown costume when you can pick it it up for free?
---
I saw the same thing. Forgot to grab a screenie when it came up.
---
In my case, I hit enter and hit enter again quickly at title and it popped up. I reflexively hit tab then enter again when I saw it.
---
The good things we like about their games and their engine could also exist in a world without all the awful things though. You seem to suggest they are one in the same. I will mostly ignore the RDR2 comparison, it’s odd. Both games accomplish different things with different goals and are both great. We don’t want the things we like to change, we want a proper, modern, operational game engine. It’s possible to appreciate the great things of Bethesda while also acknowledging their many faults.
---
I think their drinking water is still contaminated. You can find the site of where they dumped FEV into their water west of town, over the hills/mountains.
---
I'm aware of the bugged quest reward. Really hoping this gets some attention. I know most people don't care about the charisma bonus, but some people would really like it.
---
So much this. Far too many times have I loaded in only to hear creature beating on my helpless character while the load screen finishes...
---
It would be better if we can apply this beautiful skin onto Western revolvers, otherwise I can only use my lv5 noob .44 just to enjoy the shine.
---
Fallouts controls aren’t clunky????
---
idk, I like it all crazy. It's the end of the world! throw the norm out the grated metal windows!
---
Check out a youtuber named Oxhorn.  Great lore, no hate train.  He has an awesome recent vid on this.  It is so much more worse than you thought what happened. 
---
West Tek put FEV in the town's water supply.   It's still there.  It's still turning people.  Like Flint Michigan,  but way worse.
---
Big.....
---
what are we talking about?
---
Ok, glad you cleared that up. Thing is that evidence seems to suggest that it's not at all normal. Here are a few examples:
---
[https://www.jitbit.com/news/2266-average-customer-support-metrics-from-1000-companies/](https://www.jitbit.com/news/2266-average-customer-support-metrics-from-1000-companies/) \- Avg. 7 hr 4 mins. Worst is like 40ish hours.
---
Not game industry specific enough?
---
[https://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/170274-Steam-Support-Now-Showing-Typical-Response-Times](https://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/170274-Steam-Support-Now-Showing-Typical-Response-Times) &lt;- worst is 1.85 days but that's for billing. Worst for tech support was under 16 hours.
---
So days would seem to be more realistic as "normal".
---
Unless you have counter evidence that isn't just anecdotal?
---
I get it and all, but its just a poor one sided system that only benefits the looters. Theres no way to defend against that remotely. Which does not make it fun.
---
I like PvP (just not in this game) but they just don't know what their doing.
---
I've typically been able to take out the rubber band dogs with a VATS Critical.
---
I saw you on around Whitesprings today. Lvl 75. superkill64
---
Don't forget that its also the only one place everyone bombs. I took the MoM quest a week ago. And I'm now only able to do the quest because it's no longer a literal dead zone. I don't have a rad suit, and won't use power armor. So I had to flipping wait.
---
The duster that Preston Garvey wore is in the Atom Shop.
---
As a melee build who compulsively picks up ammo, vendor cash registers are my dumping ground for stuff I know sombody could probly use, but is dead weight for me.
---
No. Just access to weapons and armour, which themselves have higher stats than their lower level counterparts. That's about it.
---
Western better than single action?
---
No I am with you . I got so board of this game so fast. It would have been cool if the set a single player Fallout on this map with NPCs, a story and quests that actually lead to something. Not just mindlessly wandering around interacting with Robots or reading terminal entries and listening to Holotapes.
---
This is the future of gaming. All the crap about Save Player One was...well...crap. Its all about Games as Service and online multiplayer because its easier to monetize a game like that. The devs don't care if people quit or if the player base declines. As long as 8% of the gamers who purchase the game spend money on micrtransactions they will still turn a profit. Gone are the days when for the price of a game you get an all inclusive gaming experience. Now your buying the key to get into the game and then you have to get the actual content drip fed to you or buy it or both. Its all about the grind, not the story arch or the characters. 
---
It really makes me sad that I feel gaming as I knew it is dead.
---
Find a audio files in the enclave bunker west tek did nullify the FEV but the enclave found there research and release the FEV on Appalachia in an attempt to  raise the DEFCON level to 1 so they could launch nukes
---
I've mostly seen that sort of thing in suitcases more than registers but good to know.
---
Because it says it's for the .44.  Same model or not, it didn't say Western Revolver.  This isn't Bethesda's fault.
---
Already got it, thanks anynway
---
I TRIED HARD!  :(
---
Good lord it's bad.  I make a living talking games.   I cannot save this SHIT
---
_DBRUNSKI (just japes no sue ill counter just love it
---
Oxhorn is awesome, I definitely second that recommendation!
---
No, purely for perk cards you're missing, and now to allow you to move special points around.
---
Yawn one way they’re fixing it is by banning people like you. 
---
Did you ever consider that if they're made aware of the fact that people would like it on both guns, that they might change it?
---
Oh yeah?
---
So cranberry foods get cranked up to 10-20% XP?
---
I don't actually know the highest XP gain item.
---
Is the event syndicated and be available to watch elsewhere? I don't have xbox-per-view access.
---
Ahh Okay so once you hit 50 and have got the all the perk cards you want and the points in the places you want. It's purely just a number then.
---
Ah, that explains it then. I have access, but have not yet gone to the bunker. I remember coming across West Tek during BETA and thinking about how they should have kept it unnullified then, but forgot about it until I saw a post about the place earlier today. 
---
I wanna come! GT:Rocky Two Milli
---
Inv me now!
---
cranberry snack up from 10 to 15%
---
What are you saying they nerfed when you’re talking about your single shot handmade? If it wasnt two shot or explosive nothing changed about it in the last patch.
---
Join me GT Manny Sandov
---
" You don't have to be an ass " said they guy opened up with whiney baby insults and proceeded to try and be a smart ass..
---
Im pissed at Bethesda and after defending this shitfest for so long, you cannot blame me..
---
They need to contest your workshop first. 
---
I’d imagine if player inventories affect server performance than vendor inventories do as well. If every player on the server could offload more gear to the vendors it would probabaly hurt performance. 
---
At the disposal site, right? With the chopped up muties. The terminals there did mention drinking water table contamination, but those are normal radioactive barrels. Unless the virus in super mutant body parts alone is enough to cause a widespread outbreak after being filtered through earth and stone to get to the water table.
---
I have a nocturnal explosive lever action which does significantly less damage now but eh. 
---
I’ve been trying to think of a good ammo dumping site since I’m running a melee build. Will start putting it in the registers. 
---
Bummer it did not work out better. Boo Bethesda but good on the Fallout community.
---
Pretty much. You get to round out your build a little more picking up non-essential perk cards but in terms of power level, that's pretty much it. 
---
Harpers Ferry as well. If you’re Xbox I’ll buy them and you can refund me for them.
---
[https://youtu.be/xsXcxBb2IXc](https://youtu.be/xsXcxBb2IXc) here is a great video on the audio files but it does spoil a lot of the enclave lore so watch at you own risk
---
Yeah I usually find it in the suitcases and also dump my stuff in the suitcases. 
---
sure thing. I'm a stealth sniper. I don't use anything special but a chameleon armor piece and a tse lever action rifle or a handmade depending on the number of players im up against. I don't bother with power armors or anything. kill and change location. Seek revenge = more caps.
---
Psn is as my reddit name: Jullz_Wolf. lv152
---
Well, we have a winner... tho' I can't too excited about it.  I can confirm that after fast traveling I'm sometimes at full power, and sometimes at almost half power.
---
Hey, location-based difficulty: it's not a bug, it's a feature! ;\^)
---
GT is Xwolfpackleader, around 80-90. I’ll help with quests or building you a cool base.
---
They're randomised in those two locations. Possibly Phoenix vendor too.
---
Bethesda either lied or screwed up when they said that plans would no longer be randomised at vendors.
---
Good to know, I'm pretty happy with my build tbh so can just explore rather than grind XP now 
---
I love oxhorn! But I feel bad for his FO76 videos because he always seems like he's rushed and does way more editing. It's not as fluid. I can only imagine he gets rushed by fans and otjer people looking to make cameos.
---
 I guess I just never considered drinking FEV was sufficient for infection. Almost every super mutant outbreak has been the result of dunking, or controlled injections.
---
I got a drill from a standard legendary, not a legendary drill, just a level 20 drill, and 2 fusion cells. 
---
u could build a base on a extractor, so u don't really need a factory for resources. the fusion core ones or the munition factory r the only ones that have unique facilities and for that reason, they are very heavy grounds for pvpers. 
---
How about unbanning players for just having cheat engine on thier PCs? Cause last I checked its not impacting anyone when they don't have it turned on.
---
Ahhh...see now I feel sad for you!
---
Used to, it was a TSE but I dropped it when it got nerfed. Needed to save weight anyway.
---
Really??  Does it not do anything like what I described?  What does it look like when you go chameleon?
---
I'm running on a PC that I built maybe 6 months ago with a 1080ti and Intel 8700k processor.  It doesn't seem like it's glitching or anything, pretty sure it's the intended effect...I'm wondering if maybe certain graphics settings disable it though.  In which case I want to find out what they are.
---
100% agree with you on the sighting issue.  "Let's make an effect that completely hides gun sights"  ಠ\_ಠ  Don't understand how someone signed off on that.
---
Watch his vid.  It's a mutated version of FEV.  Long trail of holotapes, terminal entries,  notes and barrels of  supermutant parts scattered about,  but Oxhorn links the whole, horrid, mess together. 
---
It’s not worth a low level player having those serums anyway...
---
Ahh damn that sucks I would have loved to watch you blow up. 
---
How many people have you one shotted from a position of virtual invulnerability? Now you meet one person who got the armor, perks, and chems to prevent that and the game is "broken".
---
Some people consider that this is "being negative"  when this is just the truth.
---
 She saw you before you pooped it and sent her crew. ;)
---
 I live near Mosstown and I've been fucking with both the crew there and the Scorchbeast from the Fissure near there.
---
 She knows the moment any of her crew knows I'm there, and shows up shortly thereafter. They are running a group mind thing don't forget and they all know what any of them know. 
---
 I have managed to kill them all without engaging her. She was circling overhead and if I killed the next one quickly she, and they, all lost track of me. ;)
---
 I actually murdered them all and snuck away one time but that was symbolic. I go kill her for sport on a regular basis. ;)
---
There's a shit ton of content. It's just all single player content. In contrast, there is literally nothing to make the multiplayer game work. Given that it's a multiplayer game, that's a problem.
---
Maybe they could build on the workshop system, put in a server browser, and have some kind of clan system? It would be kinda neat if you could capture workshops and use them to mine resources to build awesome defenses and other crap.
---
I gotta get fuckin in there.
---
\&gt;Give it like a 75lbs limit to ~~prevent~~ abuse those who are transferring weapons and heavy stuff without really doing anything to stop abuse other than inconveniencing them too.
---
How do you get the faction logo next to your name?
---
Sorry for the long explanation,  people cry BS all the time, so I've gotten in the habit of infodumping.   
---
Agree, would love to see attention on all the minor to major things that keep getting ignored.
---
Okay.  I will say up front that I downvoted BUT I am also willing to help you out.  I think that you made some mistakes letting gear and meta carry you in the past and didn't read carefully all the game tips, hints, and there's a lot that can be done to remedy the situation but it will take time and explanation.    My clan and I help out players of all levels, including gear and build help.  Add me, IGN= WhiteNoiseMaker and also look for HeroJoker 1992 or ByzantineFalcon
---
We will invite you to our discord and talk there about what can be done to help your situation.
---
Glad i'm not the only one who has noticed this. I 've killed a ton of Legendary since patch and they are all dropping crap. Two maybe three items tops, mostly junk. It's not even worth logging in anymore.  Farming for great weapons IS the endgame in this game so far.
---
Hit the 3 dots in the top right corner and hit select flair or something along those lines. 
---
 Is it a really strong one or something you found? The difference can be substantial. 
---
Caused allot of bugs.. :(
---
My only toon is a stealth sniper.  Not going to play till they fix the  sneak bug.
---
I took a workshop yesterday, just as the defend quest started before I even realised what happened I was dead. Someone ran in started to cap the workshop and killed me in two or three shots. I have pacifism turned on and when I tried to go back for my stuff, which was next to the workbench I couldnt do damage to them and died again. I logged out. 
---
found it on a Mutant warlord level 68 it dropped as a level 30
---
Said the same thing earlier on another post.   
---
Keep getting Discord messages from friend who play '76, their friends lists are nearly empty of active players.  
---
Not hate, just observation, as I keep pestering Bethesda to stop ignore us and fix the dang bugs we are reporting.
---
 What's hit at? A Hardened receiver will ad about 10 to that number. What is its full name? ;) 
---
there is also the Iron Stomach Perk..  lowers your chance of catching disease by 90% at tier 3.
---
At the very least, group like cards together. My lock pick is in the beginning, then master is somewhere close to the middle, then expert is close to the end.  Half the time, I just get frustrated and don't even bother. 
---
suppressed hardened piercing hunting rifle with 75 damage.
---
Just crafted 50 pistols give or take and that's plenty more than some people claim to have made and got banned for. Ie. Ten outfits, ten guns to learn mods etc, crafted 2k 50 Cal rounds and dozens of foods all with super duper on. GT is statesidellama if you want to check my uploads on the xbox app. I'm too tired to do the work to upload them to an imgur album but I will tommorow. 
---
Like the true lord; you just have to have faith that he's watching over us...a lot of faith if it's Todd.
---
Honestly concerned by it..   
---
I know a healthy chunk of the Reddit cheered the quitters, but long term, it's bad for the long term health of the game...  
---
Those are all people who could potentially spend $ on Atoms etc, or at the least represent numbers for justification of large player base / additional resource spent for improvements 
---
If this is the case I hope Bethesda finally eliminates PvP from the game.
---
One more nerf fo PvE players and this game is done..... assuming the last one didn't kill it.
---
I've seen this in the SBQ event. Everyone there is in an "Event Team" and perks start sharing across everyone in it, not just the teams they're part of. No one in my usual crew runs either of the weapon/armor repairing perks but we get the proc notices going on the side of the screen and come out of the fight with all items fully repaired. It's nice to save some materials but i can see how a bloodied build would hate getting an unwanted rad sponge/ghoulish share from it.
---
Pacifist mode is in game settings at the bottom, not that it should matter. If you're at the moonshiners you're probably not level 5 or above yet. Level 1-4 not only is pacifist unable to be turned off but other players can't even slap you. 
---
apparently (i havent tried) if you have someone you can use to hold him and get back into the server he will have a different loadout when you log back in.
---
 That's not bad for a level 30 gun. Do you have anything in Perception that helps non automatic weapons? There are 3 level with 3 stars in each one. If you take just the first level of all 3 you should get 30% more hit. 
---
punished?  we get a recompense package, and you are being punished?
---

Or love using the Plague Walker Mutation
---
Just crafted bunches of pipe revolvers (easiest to make) crafted tons of ammo and made a bunch of food all with super duper on and no ban. Not sure how many I made personally but I know I went through about 300 steel to make the guns then broke them down for ammo. Not to mention the 20 someodd molerat bites and mongrels meats I had. All in all over 50 food items and atleast 30-40 guns and no ban. If it requires me crafting hundreds of boards I'll even try that but so far no ban. GT is statesidellama on Xbox but I'll upload the clips on imgur in the morning. I'm personally tired. 
---
Probably stacking Bobbleheads
---
Thanks a lot. I only recently got to play FO76 after having bought it right at launch and just disliking it back then. Really starting to grow fond of it with the time tho. 
---
Its true did that to get me some coats and long shoremans
---
That was part of a joke actually. I think it's only craftable. 
---
to be honest other than the fact I have over 1600 10MM rounds I probably would never have even used a automatic weapon save for that and the fact I found a .50 machine gun and burned about 750 .50 rounds. I tend to favor semi auto you waste less ammo that way.
---
They really need to "revisit" the TS(e) rebalance.   
---
It's alright mate. Got my wood leg now. 
---
A Matriarch is a she, not a he.
---
The only thing I can think they were going for is bats use echo location which would really downgrade anything’s stealth and if it’s hive mind once one scorch finds you they all can but yeah that totally messes with any stealth build.
---
i don't use that exploit, in fact i haven't ever used it once.
---
in fact, i haven't played the game since i first tried it for a week, because of the fact it's a buggy piece of shit full of trolls using exploits.
---
in fact, i won't play the game again, unless they fix that shit. 
---
I think most folks did. But i also believe its splint. Some folks have just gotten the game and missed out on the game when it first came out. They missed all the gameplay, pre-patches. So to them their walking into the games current state, so to them it seems fine. For alot of us we've been here since release and Beta so we have seen the decline. We have seen the game through all its previous patches. We have witnessed the results and actions by Bethesda. Folks also play it for different reasons. I've  always been for the storyline and exploring. But there's no content and grinding isn't fun for me.  I'm not big on grinding and farming. Although I did it briefly at WhiteSprings right before they fixed the Leg. Exploit there. It was probably one of the funniest times. Everybody in a server was  working together. I've yet to fight a SB, nor the Queen. I have to desire, knowing the winning outcome is void of any positive outcome and earning. You have some players that try to still defend it and protect the game. But how far can you defend something that's broke? I'm not gonna list the pros and cons because that's mostly what alot of these threads talk about. So the issues are well known.  I gave the game a chance. After this last patch, nope. Game removed and in the case. I'll check back in a couple months. If only by chance there's not another game that comes out that takes my attention. With that. Fallout 76 is not a great game. It's a great concept, but Bethesda rushed into it. For whatever reason. ( im sure its known) Now Bethesda, their fans and gamers are feeling the effect. 
---
Cool
---
Yes, also happening when moving camps...  
---
Was told it would cost 49 caps and it charged me close to 800
---
Vendor bot at the super duper mart used to sell it religiously. 
---
Makes me wonder now when I show up to fight a mob of Super Mutants with my nerf gun......
---
Is my gun doing the mega nerfed 63 DMG?..........or is it doing super nerfed 44 DMG?
---
Probably holds extra paper than a normal one
---
Its soooo shitty haha, I lose about 1.1k per swing. 
---
Where did you find graham ? I’ve never found him
---
I can grab 2 of the rifleman perks at the moment for a total of 20% more damage
---
 That should be a good gun. Hardened and Piercing are the most important mods. 
---
 I made and used em' till I found a Lever Action, and that's my long range gun now.
---
Did you ask what gender they prefer or are you just assuming?
---
If you've made yourself vulnerable to PVP then you're fair game, pacifist mode exists for a reason.
---
I feel like the loading takes forever and then when you're actualy loaded into the game there's still texture and some other stuff that's not fully loaded. What's the point of 3 loading screens if stuff is still gonna load after the loading screens? Make the loading better and faster so the game dosen't feel like a loading simulator.
---
Self ban works just fine. Still no one has to interact with you in game fortunately. 
---
I just took rifleman hoping I notice a difference then again I was wandering around into areas I really should not have been in probably either. 
---
How much are they? I only have 1000 caps at the moment.
---
At least you can dismantle it
---
i never did anything wrong in the game though?
---
what exactly is your point besides accusing me of things i never did, simply because i said "maybe bethesda should fix their game?"
---
why do you neckbeards defend this cluster fuck of a game to this mentally deranged degree?

Well. Its agressive, mean, and horny. All of which are Male qualities. typically 
---
I don't think there's really any rhyme or reason to the weapon specialization perks, like the people making them didn't keep in mind any sort of balance and did whatever sounded cool in their minds. Like Melee gets weight reduction AND faster swing speed, like why would you NOT get that amazing perk? Then it gets massive armor penetration. Meanwhile pistol gets pretty lame perks like it was the last thing they had to work on and they rushed because launch day was coming.
---
God damn kids!

Whorehouse is one word.

Havent played in a while, does most clothing still cover armor? Would like to enable or disable armor, some clothing looks better, and vise versa.

Robots were using TS weapons 😂
---
Look dude you've got your opinions and I'm not gonna argue this shit here. But you've shown your cards and it sounds like you expect to get shit for what ur saying not because you think people are gonna think you are a racist but because you want to start some shit. So just let it go and play the game comrade...
---
RDRO is a trash game so...  :-p
---
This game won’t make it past 2019. Too much of the player base is gone, and plenty of new games coming out soon to make everyone forget about this game. Cyberpunk, Anthem, etc. 
---
Yeah but my loot bro, my looooot!
---
Well I guess it's his loot now 
---
Not to mention that legendary modifiers and equipment in a multiplayer game usually get buffed/nerfed all the time, so that  thing people keep telling you to get rid of because it's 'trash' and is just a waste of inventory/stash space might be worthwhile sometime down the road if it gets buffed while your main weapon gets nerfed.
---
Y'know, in case you needed more reasons to hoard things.
---
^^^^One ^^^^of ^^^^us. ^^^^One ^^^^of ^^^^us.
---
BS and you know it.  Bastards spam it everywhere.  One by the pumpkin house.  It never stopped.
---
Yeah, maybe you're right there, just seems odd they wouldn't think weapon weight reduction and apply it across the board instead of when they got to rifle perk cards they failed to think of that one
---
Who downvotes this? Sheesh!
---
I’ve noticed the spots I’d have to normally sever hop just to farm materials are all untouched which is good but sad 
---
Seen all sorts of people on today. I even got murdered a few times. I have been in busy servers all weekend. Seeing no unually empty servers
---
Sounds like your average commenter on this sub tbh.
---
Anything you dont understand? Must be a duper.

Got beat in pvp? Must be a duper.

Stubbed your toe on the coffee table? Must be a duper.

This sub idolized harassing others suspected of duping so much that it ended up infecting the minds of most of the people in game.

You literally cant play with friends of your lower level than you without getting accused of being a scumbag duper.
---
Thanks /r/fo76
---
With the rifleman perk I don't think it becomes noticeable until you get a few perks into that category, from what I've heard hunting rifles are not bad I personally like heavy weapons because I'm the opposite and like to burn through ammo. The hunting rifle can have some great legendary modifiers if you find one, the one you have is great for a basic one and should do plenty of damage depending on if you are shooting at enemies that are normally bullet sponges like bloated, scorchbeast, and radrats for some reason. Try it out on regular scorched around your same level. Speaking of which what level are you? 
---
Got my Longfellow coat from the Responder Vendor. Try him. 
---
Multiple crashes to desktop, entering power armour still doesn't always align properly, had one problem with controls where we couldn't scroll up or down in pip boy and had to log out. Combat shotgun suddenly does almost no damage despite decent damage output and armour piercing enabled. Had to scrap it for a new one. 
---
I've had teammates become wanted but my status stayed the same. I did not take damage either when the guy they were fighting was spraying a mini gun at us. Is this a glitch or a fluke?
---
I'm being quite careful of where I log out but still, those loading screens take forever and then when you're loaded in the world there's still some stuff that's not fully loaded. Not sure why is it taking so long to fully load everything in the immediate area you're in.
---
 That will bring your hit up some. Headshots make quite a difference. ;)
---
Early on the Whitespring bots were overspawning in massive numbers.
---
Then areas can spawn according to player level, so a high level player triggering the respawn will get higher level enemies.
---
31?
---
I'm pretty sure they nerfed gun durability also.
---
It's as if they are intentionally trying to get everyone to quit playing.
---
There's been about 3000 people on this sub the last few days. Before the update and the day of there was 7500-8000 people on. This sub is losing people fast. I imagine the same is happening to the game.
---
 No such place. ;) Mine go in stupid places regularly. ;)
---
I wonder if the atom shop will start selling food bc my char eating stuff like spoiled food and dog food is so gross
---
Have you tried a leadership bobblehead?
---
&gt;introduced nothing that makes a good online survival game.
---
To their credit that's kind of hard to do when there was barely anything introduced that would make it any kind of survival game.
---
When opening the transfer menu on dead enemies I can click on items but not transfer them. I have to back out and press e to pick up any items, which means I have to pick up stuff I don't want. Cursor still not working correctly on transfer screen
---
&gt;We’ve seen reports circulating regarding innocent accounts being unfairly deactivated for crafting in-game items.
---
&gt;. . . .the majority of accounts that have been turned off are accounts that have managed to collect over 500,000 (in some cases, tens of millions) of specific rare items . . . .
---
&gt;We feel confident that any player that has picked up that quantity of items that are designed to be rare inside the game did not obtain them via any legitimate means. 
---
So basically, you are guessing.  
---
You might be guessing right - but you're still guessing.  You don't *know*.  You don't have a server log to be able to tell for certain.  You're looking at savegames and saying - this guy has a lot of items and we think he's a duper and so you're handing out bans.  
---
But you're going to sit here and say that we should trust you and that your decision criteria are impeccable?  After the quality of management the development studio has shown us?
---
Do you, honestly, think BethesdaAustin deserves you continuing to defend them?  Or do you think that they're once more leaving you high and dry with the community because they're leaving out important details?
---
Depends. It might be mating season...
---
My minigun magically gained an extra 3 damage when i was at the scorchbeat queen fight but it was only at 16 to begin with then when i checked after the fight it was at 17
---
 there are also perks for Armor Piercing on top of whatever Piercing gives you. Muties are tough mainly because of so much armor. 
---
 I have a sword with serious Armor Piercing, around 85% now, and it carves up Muties real good.
---
If you increased the CAMP budget size, people would be able to buy stuff from the Atom store. Even a 15% increase would be enough for me. I don't have a very big CAMP but I can't build anything I have paid for or use plans. Also, I'm level 52 and still can't find a power armour station plan. The game will be over before I have one of these or a jet pack. 
---
Where do you find a Union Army uniform?

Mass craft 30 to 50 with super duper equipped would pretty closely mimic the steps of the thread I saw with the poor guy "doing nothing wrong and getting banned for no reason."

It is more likely to be found at the civil war museum south of it though 
---
no. don't know if it works with them
---
Question. Had you claimed any workshops?
---
If so then if it’s challenged it starts PVP anywhere on the map.
---
Also if you were part of a team. If a member was in PVP with another team, then all are in PVP.
---
But yeah your story isn’t fair.
---
I had a guy yesterday who was wanted in Whitespring 200+ so I thought what the hell. Stored my junk and snuck up.
---
Placed all my perks into sneak and sniper skills and hit him four times with my TS Gauss. Each hit was ticking 2.5 sneak damage and his health didn’t move a millimeter.
---
He couldn’t see me as I have chameleon armor perk. But he was randomly shooting his TSE around hitting cars and the splash damage almost killed me.
---
Bugged out as I didn’t see how I could take him out.
---
Prob last time I’ll try PVP until I read up on how to make my toon better equipped. Without buying stuff of the black market that is...
---
well.. that sorts out the budget issue i was having..
---
Yep. Challenge is broken. For the second week in row.
---
Almost as if they don't want you to complete challenges.....
---
Yeah I was under the impression that you take significantly less damage from someone trying to grief you unless you shoot back but I didnt. I didnt even blink. Wasnt wanted or on a team. I dont remember if I owned a workshop as I tend to own a few when I log in asap. 
---
Shit your right. 
---
I could get behind this. Personally I think 100% is too much. If you want double damage get instigating. If you have two shot doing double on all shots then instigating is a worthless affix.
---
Well, no one PvPs so...
---
That arguement only holds up until you realize even with calibrated shocks, X-01 only has the same base carry weight as the Excavator PA does.  
---
I have been accused of cheating multiple times for simply being good at PvP. People are surprised when 1 guy in leather beats 3 or 4 multiple times. Haters gonna hate
---
Lost my first legendary to that garbage disposal
---
The train can be fully automated since that's a reoccuring theme in this game. In fact the train in Fallout 4 that was taking us to and from Nuka-World was automated in a way, same with the boat taking us to and from Far Harbor. Since most of the stuff is reused from Fallout 4 it would not be that much of an issue.
---
the thing is i am seeing the same people again every time i go back into the game
---
Ty man

hmu man my gt is Tycen only level 30 down to do some quests.

Ya... We know what it means 
---
\_Where\_ you hit things matter:

* hit protectrons in the middle parts
---
* deathclaws in the belly
---
* etc...
---
If you are sniping then sneak. Get a free 2x. Maybe 'bank' a critical in vats. I'll usually sit on a crit for when i'm in a tough spot. Or use it while sneak sniping for some exponential damage fun
---
Based on the rough numbers the sub represents 4 to 9% of the community, so if the sub is a micro of the macro, that would be allot of people..
---
Seems reasonable. Why wouldn't they simply make this change? It would hurt nothing but fix something, and it would take a few minutes, tops.
---
Im gonna stick with this game till support for it is over. Yeah theres bugs but ive come to enjoy them and just ignore them. I think you just have to create your own fun considering this game is lacking in the content department and lets be honest, vaults can only be so big before we get tired of grinding them they would have to create completely new areas outside of the map to truely keep players for the long haul i imagine the vaults are probably only gonna be fun playing through five or six times anyways.
---
 level 105 here, happy to help.  gt is phishntrips.  I just took a young-in through his first nuke yesterday. It was a blast hearing him freak out over chat, and it put a little life back into my game.

All the dupers rage quit. This is what remains...
---
This was more common before they started patches. Have seen it spring back up in the past week also. Even the friendly dog at the cliff over looking Harper's ferry is affected. Kept walking around the cookstation and hearing yelps. Looked down the side and saw that I'd been walking over it's belly and the rest of it was sticking out the front of the cliff, almost out to the bridge
---
This is awesome. I think my husband is too low of a level though.

true but that doesn't always work when things go crazy I just fast traveled to be ambushed by 5 super mutants only to kill them and have them turn into meat piles and have 5 more instantly spawn to take their place.
---
The only problem is hopping into the same server as item will be left there until Whitespring becomes like a city in some games - i.e. PoE where groups of players meet only when they are there.   
---
Separate server where people can just load into as a safe zone to mule, trade or afk.
---
Well if the robots are using the same guns we are...
---
which would explain why the ones I killed instantly turned into meat piles interesting mechanic 
---
Perks in FO3 and FONV were extras. You developed your character by allotting stat and skill points. Perks were fun bonuses.
---
Bethesda changed that in Skyrim. They removed skills, then turned into a crap progression tree. I'm just asking for the older, better system back 
---
I have done everything the game has to offer, every quest, event, trophy, etc. I really did enjoy it.
---
I saved 15 level ups for the last patch, switched my build around and began using a new wep. I'm basically back at same dps b4 nerf. I just can't bring myself to play it again. PvP is fun but it gets old. SBQ is just a bullet sponge that doesn't always drop anything (killed her at least 20 times). Idk, maybe I'm just dramatic?
---
Re: Decor Display in CAMPS - Interesting food items, kitchen stuff, curtains, decent rugs. It would be good to have some way that the Scorchbeast doesn't wreck it all when he attacks my house (as usual) as it would be time-consuming to replace and it's costing me a lot in resources. 
---
The same challenge was glitched last week, so naturally they decided to post the same challenge again before fixing it
---
and you didn't even buy the pirate hat? shame.

I'm 90% sure she's talking about the fuck bucket or possibly even the butt fuck bucket and she's just repeating this tongue twister as fast as she can so she just fucks it up everytime.

I haven't paid much attention to it but yeah when you get the attacks and get a a minute to build your defenses I think you get a little top up of materials.
---
Oh yes. Leveled guns. In Fallout. Its just so gamey and artificial. So contrived. But if you're going b.c to do it, make repairing raise the level of weapons to the highest you can craft.
---
Your next step should be to post the saved emails, redacting the name of the community reps you spoke to 
---
Yeah I forget which little unmarked mini settlement it was (might've been marked. I don't know) but I found mine crossing over the divide into the mire for the first time. Think there were a couple of high level snallygasters I picked off with a sniper rifle and then when I was poking around I found it just sitting on a shelf on the top level of some ramshackle lean to. I want to try it out but the thing is so damn gauche. But hey gotta have that 1 armor.
---
I like to look to the right of the road going from the overseer's camp to flatwoods. I just go down the middle of the grass, and usually find one there.

Are you sure you’ve “drilled down” on the challenge details?
---
Some challenges require something more specific than their title suggests
---
Fast travel to the enclave bunker, near the trees
---
Good luck! Hope you find one.
---
This is actually how I got it. Me and a friend searched and server hopped for about an hour and a half. Eventually, he got the bot and we rotated in and out trying to get him to sell the coat. I got lucky and managed to load into an inventory where he had it after about 45 mins of logging in and out.
---
They do if Floyd Merryweather is on the other end.   
---
Try moving south east maybe?
---
With 4 Charisma and Hard Bargain 3, the Heavy Combat Armor plans were 970 caps each for me (Torso, Arms, and Legs).
---
I got them at the Watoga Station vendor, but had to Hop to get them.  Sometimes there was no Heavy Combat, but when there was, there was only ever One.  Took a handful of tries to get all three.
---
Seems that some plans are still random...
---
Can you please add some Purple, Matt Black and Dark Red Power Armour options to buy from the Atom Shop? I'm not big on the current choices and loved my Purple armour in FO4.  I'm sure others would like these too.
---
Understood.  Yeah I was hoping for more of a turnout out to combat that more though.  Make sure he snags this nuka cola armor before he leaves.
---
Daily event rewards are where I got most of mine. Or just running around looking to kill anything legendary. Completing the bos and enclave missions net you some good stuff also. 
---
A pirate does not just BUY a pirate hat. A pirate's hat finds them. 
---
Why is it taking so long to make certain simple fixes to give us something to cheer about? For example: increase Flamer fuel creation by 10x. You guys have to have the ability to view player statistics. I'd bet less than 1% of players use a Flamer, and of those players, probably only 5% use it regularly.
---
Increase weapon durability on energy weapons. Give them a damage boost, etc. They're trash.
---
Much more Etc. Etc.
---
I understand talking all of this over internally and trying to calculate ideal levels, but just throw some stuff out there and try it out. These things could be fixed in *minutes*, but they're here and have been for fucking *months*.
---
Please! Listen to the community and stop forcing some arbitrary decisions on us. Make this game more fun and less micromanagement. Toss the pride aside and admit when you've made a mistake. At the very least, give us some of the things we're looking for here.
---
What platform?
---
Do events that require taking down enemies like leader of the pack. 
---
Found exactly where you said! I was screaming like the dog from the movie up 😂 ty for the help. 
---
it can be both the game was released basically unfinished and the skelton post launch crew they left behind is stretched to thin between bugs and finishing the content that got rebranded as "post launch" add in this dedicated pvp mode and I imagine we're going nowhere fast.
---
It's pretty easy to find Fusion Cores.  And for normal stuff, the defense isn't really needed.
---
I stayed in "dead" power armors before when fighting mutliple scorch beasts just because of the resistance and defense.  Without it the rads were just too much.
---
We need more Big Iron.
---
Why?  
---
Community Manager didn't dispute the fact they are requesting posts to get the Dev's attention.  
---
My problem was it seems like a loop, post on Reddit, requested to submit a ticket to then be requested to post on social media.   
---
Like the grind in '76, a time sink
---
As plentiful as fusion cores are I’d so definitely not. Someone’s got your back no matter what system.
---
No problem, glad it worked. 
---
I haven't played in weeks. I do care about the game which is why I come here.  
---
My main issue with the game is that there currently isn't a single item, event, quest, or activity in this game that is rewarding enough to keep me playing. It's a constant chore. I will be back when/if they make the right changes.
---
5. New Item Attributes to provide players with more “Build” identities by synergizing equipment effects with perks and SPECIALs.
---
Xbox
---
Okie dokie. Will do!
---
Not me, but that's awesome. If I found it I'd lock myself in.
---
How do you start the bos missions?
---
My experience is, I've burned through all the content. Bugs and all no worries. Now there isn't anything to do but farm legendaries which is tedious and pretty boring. I can do camp things. Inventory went from a 9-5 full time job to part-time but still feels like a job. Repeccing takes a casual week. 
---
I haven't played for about a month now. I tried 2 patches ago and couldn't go 30 minutes between being kicked from server.  I check Reddit for updates on the game for fixes and server stability. 
---
It's been 3 months and the game has nothing to do, with some bug fixes and some bugs added. Severe server instability issues. It simply is not an enjoyable beyond my first 76 hours. It's not the worst game I've ever played (Even though I can't think of one that is worst atm lol) but I simply do not have any reason to play it beyond what I have or any reason to play it over literally, any other game that is our right now. 
---
You're going to find an atom shop item? goodluck matey
---
Thanks that's really helpful :D
---
Heaviest weapon I've ever had was about 48lbs.  This isn't meant to be a second stash,  it's meant to shift items from one character to another.
---
Nice
---
Why are you people obsessed with end game content? This isn't an mmo. You don't need to keep playing forever. It's like every other fallout game, there's a storyline that ends with the last quest. And then you stop playing because you've finished the game. Boy, what a concept.
---
I can't recall a single play session I haven't heard that song at least once. And I really dislike it.
---
Into the ash heap?
---
New bug patch broke my game.  Also, Kingdom Hearts III came out, so I'm taking a break until things are fixed and I'm tired of finding ~~Hidden Mickeys~~ Lucky Emblems.
---
this^
---
Why?  Because it’s going to be pretty stupid for Bethesda to sit here silently or to dispute the words of their own employees that problems exist and should be posted to social media.
---
Additionally, you referenced having them. Seems purposeless to reference their existence as proof and being unwilling to provide the proof (which strengthens your argument and will sway more of us in Reddit to be supportive and put pressure on Bethesda).
---
Oops that's west.
---
It's a trap!
---
I had an issue spawning in, then spawning in again and being bombarded by enemies in watoga. 
---
 You should have plans for regular Leather just from the first part of following the Overseeer. A set of Leather is good stuff. A set of Heavy Leather, very good stuff. ;)
---
 Combat Armor starts around level 20 and it ends up being the best.
---
Lots of things to comment on, but others have hit most of the high points. The one remaining thing that I completely disagree with is your statement that "FO76 has the best looting system ever." Saying things like that make me question how few games you've played.
---
South East has some high level enemies. Maybe bring a friend. lol
---
Really? I've never found one, am I just missing 'em?
---
If a pirate wears a hat, it's a pirate hat ;) 
---
I haven't gone very far into the overseer stuff. I still have to go to Welch.
---
This person is confusing the Tattered mole outfit with the purple version of this which costs a ton of daily currency.  It’s the Mr. Fuzzy Costume and Hat they are likely confused about.  
---
It should be concerning. People keep saying bye Felicia. That's cool and whatever because I understand the people who still support it don't want to hear it but they should also understand they are the minority. Longevity of the game along with updates in content will be solely dictated by the games income. Less people playing and less support among the masses = less money and less content and even less support. 
---
Don't just check the cash register, check every container as I've found a suitcase that was full of plans, a trashcan also full of plans and another time where there was a bunch of ammo in one. Check the inside containers as well as the outside ones, specialy at train stations if there's a lack of containers inside. I myself tend to separate junk, ammo and plans into different containers.
---
Step one: Make friends
---
Step two: Convince friends to follow me to their deaths so I can better armor
---
Step 3: profit
---
Post nerf I have had a few awesome fights over factories and a random encounter with 2 guys who killed my friend. 
---
When I log in I scan the world for anyone who owns a workshop and then go take it. Apart from that I get bored.
---
I suppose giving you circular instructions was the polite way of saying "Piss off, we can sink this ship on our own".
---
Step two: Convince friends to follow me to their deaths so I can get better armor
---
I don't think so either. They've had 3 months of damage control where they keep fumbling the ball over themselves. BS should consider other options for their engine/dev team as they clearly are not up for the task. 
---
I never play that daily
---
Free cure is the sulfur water fountain at Whitesprings. It is at the gazebo near the clubhouse. Take a drink and your diseases are cured, you can collect the water but without the cure, it just becomes dirty water.
---
Check vendors often. High level players sell their low level legendaries to vendors.
---
I feel bad for using a spiked glove
---
Considering it takes only 23 other people to populate a server it would be next to impossible to be on a dead one. 
---
How is this not viral? Also does this work?
---
This is exactly what a ~~Synth~~ Duper would post.
---
Gotcha, will dig it up and add a cut version in the morning.  
---
That said, they effectively sat silently when the other post broke 2,800 upvotes, I doubt this one will change that fact, just wanted to follow up and let the community know the results of their "voice"
---
&gt; Perks were fun bonuses.
---
How about the perks that only gave you skill points, or increased your damage or resistance to damage? 
---
Do what you enjoy. If you enjoy the game don't let others stop you. 
---
Ah then depending on what you are shooting at anything over level 60 is going to be a sponge. 
---
Is the queen already finished?
---
Hopefully they add any stuff. I'm still concerned Bethesda will "cut their losses" and abandon development.
---
Welcome to another bethesda glitch
---
I thought merchants are no longer randomized?
---
I started enthusiastically in beta, but it's been quite a while since I've played. I'm not done, but I'm waiting for an update that isn't 1 step forwards 2 steps back. I still have hope for the franchise but am afraid if I play now they'll ruin it for me. 
---
 OK. Just go to Whitespring and visit my buddy Cunningham in the store section. He's the guy with the bear rug and sells the plan for it too. 
---
 He sells armor. You can get, with a little revisiting, a set of stuff for your level. He often has modded stuff and is really the best place to buy armor. 
---
 Just down the mall is a full repair and box facility you can add mods or use plans you might have learned. 
---
I think plans reset each 24 hours on a server or when a game world is created they are refreshed.
---
Basically if someone else has down the train station run they could’ve bought them already.
---
They would be popular. 
---
Agree 100% / echoing what I've been trying to say.   
---
Player base = Income, atleast in principle.
---
This is where I'm at. I'll log back in once I can do something new and because it's free. 
---
Y'all enjoy.  Gotta log off and play board games with the kiddos.  :)
---
Listen to Your Mom’s House with Tom Segura and Christina P. It’s a comedy podcast. Great stuff. This is an inside joke.
---
Huh. I had no idea it was so rare. 
---
Fair point; if someone trips over the Predator, they'll probably realize something's up.
---
Either of the tower doors was doing it to me. My brother and I had the workshop and we would go in one at a time in case we got stuck in a load screen. I’d have to restart the game and rejoin him at the workshop. Then I’d try the other tower door and get the same infinite loading screen. 
---
That's just your encumbrance weight. You can carry way more than that and can't sprint and moving costs AP. They made it 1500 to mitigate dupers who'd carry thousands of pounds.
---
Ok then another question, how is everyone getting enough caps to afford this stuff? I don't think I've ever had over 50.
---
Same here. I really hope they come out with some new content. When Farcry drops, my friend and I will probably play co-op and stop with 76 for awhile. I find myself playing less and less everyday.
---
Dude that was awesome. I was like WHERE DID HE GO?
---
And have a good night!! Thank you! That is a great thing ya got going. Let me know if i can help!
---
This was about a month ago. I honestly have not played since the last patch. Kingdom Hearts 3 is holding me hostage these days.
---
lol giving serums low level characters, what a waste. wasteland hero? more like a  zero.
---
This needs to be stickied until the devs respond. I doubt they even thought about your points.
---
The carry weight cap was how many pounds you can have on you while over encumbered.
---
It was not an upgrade to make everyone’s carry weight  1,500. It was to make sure than no matter what you can not have more than 1,500 pound on you. This is because duplicators had mules with millions of pounds of items on them. Think of it more as an encumbered cap instead of a weight cap. 
---
DAMN YOU, WEATHERBY SAVINGS AND LOAN!
---
You may have just stumbled upon something. Tickets need to be submitted in game at the DMV location. Waves of ghouls will spawn every 30 minutes, or after each ticket.
---
Of course, this will break the actual dmv quest line. However, such simple issues can safely be ignored.
---
I thought you couldn’t pay to get ahead in this game???
---
well if this post isn't masturbatory I don't know what is.
---
So you still have the reduced movement speed?
---
Limited time (to me) feels like a once a year situation ;S
---
For some reason I still get diseases despite having carnivore. It’s annoying.
---
Yes, you will still be encumbered if you exceed your carry weight it’s just after you are encumbered you cannot pick up anything else if you have 1,500 pounds on you.
---
both....?
---
Ok
---
I died from mobs too, DAMN SON.
---
 Sneak attack for multiplied damage. Helped a lot when I was low level since it base sneak damage is 2x.
---
Especially in a blast zone...
---
I’ve read somewhere that after WW2 they never fully recovered so they were still a run down country instead of the thriving country they are... or I completely made that up 
---
No you’re pretty sad
---
Maybe. It could work 
---
Probably. At least one upside is we aren't getting ten front page posts saying the exact same thing anymore. My shoutout goes to the people who left the sub without posting their fucking biography here - this silence on the sub right now is their words being heard. 
---
 You can go in Whitespring and steal everything. You will get a cap for each thing, a couple for some. This is just an example.
---
 Its worth getting the 3 levels of 'good deal' in Charisma to up your buy and sell prices. I can get 6 caps for Glowing Meat. I sell all drugs and make a lot of money. You can farm Purified Water in your CAMP and many things have some value. Grab it and sell it. ;)
---
Good job Bethesda.
---
It wasn't from enemy fire tho. I was completely away from any enemies. I just died. Im still really confused lmao
---
I agree. I haven’t played much lately because there’s not much to do anymore. I hope they add more stuff though. The bugs don’t bother me that much. 
---
Unless the controller is free, this isn't entirely free.
---
You can get the game as low as 8€ on some sites (pc) 
---
Sort of related to the topic.
---
Have been wondering what people have been storing for when player vending becomes available.
---
I have kept a fair stash of ammo, plans and explosives just waiting to be sold!
---
It was a good method to prevent further duping. Rather than delete every item with the same in game ID leaving hundreds of players weaponless. 
---
People getting mad over it but should be happy the duplicated weapons all weren’t deleted since so many people have them that don’t even know they were duped.
---
Three Dog would be proud. I had tears in my eyes at the end. Carpe Diem!
---
They wont die. Unless there are like level 150s over there already. 
---
Can we try [**u/LadyDevann**](https://old.reddit.com/u/LadyDevann) too?  lol
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Gv0H-vPoDc&amp;start_radio=1&amp;list=RD8Gv0H-vPoDc
---
1400 caps a day already seems like plenty.
---
neat
---
…..yeah that is all well and good but I just almost died I stumbled upon a fissue and a deathclaw Matron level 50 scorchbeast as well
---
Legit out of the 5 people i met through the game none play anymore, I stopped several weeks ago when i heard about the two shot nerf, I only can see the remaining amount of loyalists complaining that Melee is OP since they get crazy numbers while only have 20% health. HOW UNFAIR! I honestly believe the people who support the game blindly and call for nerfs more than buffs are same people who's build you look at and all you see is QOL shit like food lasting longer and scrounger, It's honestly not my fault or anyone else's you have a trash build and don't understand they introduced perks to negate almost all explosive effects.
---
*their game 
---
To clarify, the developers have stated that you will be able to bring your old character into survival or start a new one. That’s up to you, but your point of people power leveling becoming an issue is not really justified. I mean in every game there will always be people spending hours and hours to get ahead, everyone starting new would be a more even playing field than brining existing characters. Personally I believe you said this because you would rather keep your high level character than start a new one on an even playing field, which I feel the same way. But we cannot say it is a problem the devs need to fix that players are playing too much and grinding too hard. That’s PVP, stay on top or fall behind. 
---
I run Unyielding/chemeloin sentinel dodge with 410 ap blocker serendipity with a bloodied vats damage lever that does 997 damage before 125% vats cits and 3.5 sneak bounce.  Im hitting somewhere around 5k per shot and could get 10 off before a melee build could figure put where it was coming from. 
---
IDEA... uninstall game
---
They’ll never be done fixing the game, they need to let us help as modders (we will help finish ui, action bar customizing, perk card screen, etc) and bring on the creation club for new modes, rules, and content built by the most creative fans of 76 and the greater fallout aesthetic.
---
All the best classic games have had this. A game can either try to be wow (pointless because it’s for EQ type gamers not the SWG kind) or it can let the community make it shine brightest by participating in its growth. 
---
PvP servers are going to be the best thing about this game. Guaranteed, once you hit level 100 and have the top gear there is NOTHING other to do than PvP. And you being able to PvP depending on the other person is pretty ridiculous so I’m glad Bethesda is fixing that. It should be your choice whether you get to PvP or not, not somebody else’s.
---
Yes a good job indeed. 
---
Love his videos, really calm, an adult who gives good explanations 
---
Just keep moving along in the main story line and it will require you to join them and the enclave. 
---
No.  The people still playing are tired of negative fallout post in my opinion.  Pretty much all I hear.  That and “this is my CAMP”.  😁. I still love it.  
---
Restart your game, and move camp again. Should fix it. 
---
Super Mutant Suiciders are scary af. Just fought one this morning, didn’t know they exist. They are half red and have like no armor on. 
---
If someone has repaired the plant recently, the coolant tower will tear you up.
---
So long as the conductor is a ghoul. 
---
I check back here every 1-2 weeks to see if Bethesda has miraculously fixed the game, discover its still broken, post for a day or two, and then go about my business.  6 straight silo runs crashing on me was to much for me. I hope they fix the game. I'd be willing to come back if they did. - and I dont mean stuff i like/dislike about it, I mean the bugs.
---
A spring in your step
---
I understand i can bring my old Character in. But most likely with the duping when the alpha drops its gonna be character wipe without a doubt. Ehh bringing in my 127 would feel cheap even though i enjoy my PA sets and took lots of my time to get all the right mods for them. I just as a solo play see the huge pain in the ass I am going to go through when i start my character. The post isn't to call to nerf or have the devs do anything, more power to you if you can level. It's more for the people who think that a fresh rewipe will even the field for everyone. The only issues i thought of is the DEVs need to clarify when the servers drop how low level character VS high level character scaling works. Do perk cards negate completely at least the ones that do damage for certain weapons? We don't know and that would help to know.
---
That’ll be 500 caps.
---
Has anyone tested this magazine yet?
---
- Magazine: Scout's Life #9	
---
- Effect: Placing a CAMP cost in caps is reduced by 80%.  Duration: 2 hours.
---
-Bugged Effect: should reduce cost in caps by 120%.  This should make you gain caps, reduce the cost to 0, or increase the cost in caps, depending on how this value and the resulting value is interpreted, 
---
- Example: if camp cost 20 caps, with Bugged Effect it could give you 4 caps, cost 0, or cost 24 caps.
---
Ah. So I committed suicide then lmao 
---
10/10 would make brown talk here
---
Lmao boy
---
I sure hope they do that. Focus on elder scrolls and star field. Stop wasting time on this (frankly dead) project. Maybe In a decade or so, come back to a multiplayer fallout game with better tech, more competent staff, better game direction and more time in the oven for it to not be a mess like 76.
---
Of course the devs care, they have always cared. They are just losing motivation. I mean how would you feel if you had hundreds of people yelling at you to nerf TSE’s and then after you nerf them hundreds more people complain about that? 
---
People ask for pvp servers, the devs give pvp servers, people complain about pvp servers.
---
At some point everyone needs to just stop whining about everything and let the devs work on the game. They see what’s happening, they are trying to work on stuff, people’s jobs are on the line. It’s not like the are sitting there laughing and reading all the complaints about their game they spend months making. 
---
I hate legendary enemies and always have. They are some WOW gimmick brought into FO4 where they don't fit. 
---
ITT German and math are hard!
---
what weapon did you use?
---
Lol unintentional but very fitting analogy 
---
I can confirm it was happening to me as well. I think it was just the chest and legs, but I just took it off and went back to my usual outfit.
---
This. If the cooling tower is active and you walk inside, you will take very serious health damage just as if you were being scalded to death with hot steam on a real life cooling tower. Your PA won’t save you. 
---
What’s even more infuriating is that spinning wheel only to get ghost loot (open transfer screen, body shows it has, say 20lb of crap on it but you don’t see anything. 
---
Totally agree
---
But I'm 315...    
---
How about they just remove the level cap on the NPCs?
---
Ive been having this since beta. Stealth dont work on scorched beasts noe silo turrets. Dumped all my points into STR myself and it is the first time with melee for me so im enjoying it. For me sneaking was impossible in this game and didnt work where I needed it.
---
When the area is cleared of enemies and you press the button to claim the workshop, a confirmation message pops up informing you of both the caps you must spend on the claim (usually just 25 caps) AND that you are open to PvP for 30-ish seconds upon confirmation. You must stay in the small, green claim-zone for the workshop to raise its flag.
---
In my 200+ hours of play, I have only been attacked once at a workshop.
---
I'll come back once they get the game to where it should have been at launch and finally start adding new content
---
I get your concern and it's a legitimate one but on the other hand by the time survival goes like proper (not just the beta), you're on so much of a better footing if everyone starts with a new character instead of bringing over an existing one.
---
It doesn't reward the dupers and exploiters that took advantage of past bugs and glitches. It won't stop new dupers and exploiters but ideally there are fewer of those around because there will be (ideally) fewer ways to dupe/exploit.
---
Yes people can power level, but that's no different than the base game as it stands. Also people who can afford the time to put into the game should be able to reap the benefits. For the casuals who don't have the time, there's the combat scaling. It's not perfect but it at least gives you a chance.
---
Plus who knows what other systems and balance changes come from the beta test.
---
I'm actually pretty optimistic about Survival. I just hope they learn their lesson and don't rush it like they did the base game.
---
Are you jumping alot? 
---
Yeah. 
---
I'm level 92. Have stolen all the ultracite from a site previously just by sneaking. 
---
I have all the sneak perks, plus high agility, plus 2 chameleon armors, plus a stealth boy equipped. 
---
I'm inclined to believe the theory that stealth boys got bugged in the last patch. 
---
Also, they weren't there originally. They basically materialized a short distance from me. The latter is just bad luck, I know. Even so, they shoukdn't have seen me. Especially not all of them. 
---
Why do most toys in game scrap down to include Lead? Its Fallout that's why.
---
They don't.  Not always. This beast was fighting something. The scorchers spotted me. 
---
When you see "easter eggs" like that once or twice you go "Aw that's cute." But when almost every location has some teddy bear or gnome doing something quirky you begin to think "Okay maybe the level designers should've put their energy towards something more productive."
---
Really, some of it just annoys me. *** legendary glowing ant? Too bad they cap out at 32...I'd love some terrifying ant monstrosity level 85 or something. Level 91 deathclaws are scary, sure, but they're not that hard to kill with endgame gear. Fog crawlers scale up pretty well, the only issue is they show up once every blue moon. Super mutants warlords are all right, they serve their purpose of being tanky with moderate damage output. Max level scorched are just pathetic, and ironically enough only the unarmed ones do any serious damage. Mirelurk kings and queens scale up pretty well, if they went past 50 they could be pretty terrifying to come across
---
I think you nailed it. 
---
This is a 80-100 hour fallout with friends "experience". That's what we paid for. If you look at it like that, you're fine. If you want an endless mmorpg, you'll be in rough shape.
---
Yeah. Enemies beaming in on top of people is a problem, that's for sure.  
---
Good job Bethesda with fallout 76, its really a polished game.
---
Let me put the drinking glass from my 3 star drop beside your clipboard...
---
you cannot tell me you did not giggle like an immature child when you saw the teddy bears 69ing with a box of screws right next to them.
---
well you can, but I wont believe you.
---
Two shot should not exist in this game. 😉
---
I’ve done some thinking and if I was forced to select a conclusion, I conclude that Fallout76 is an Enclave Mutation/Butterfly Effect Simulator, tasked with gathering information on what effects a population with certain genetic markers (meaning capable of being mutated and surviving nuclear fallout) can survive, what mutations develop, as well as tasked with examining the paths that would be taken  amongst politically and militarily by survivors.
---
On PS4, it’s also noticeable and jarring. I’d love a fix. 
---
Would love to hang with you and watch your technique. 
---
My stealth was definitely bugged today. I did manage to hide under a little bridge, of sorts. 
---
The seemed to lose track of me and she started attacking something else. 
---
I can really appreciate that
---
i feel like they’re dragging their feet on private servers because all these same issues still exist even if you’re the only one on the sever. 
---
Next to white springs bunker entrance 
---
Sorry you had to deal with this. This will be a likely continuous issue in the game for a while. The lack of the handling of cheating at from Bethesda had caused damage. Now they are finally doing stuff but are running around like chicken with their heads cut off. Not to mention rolling out  patches yet rolling back updates like the pro's they are. Good luck if you  have the patience to deal with this mess! May come back if they ever figure it out a little.
---
This guy wins reddit today in my opinion. God I love this. Made me realize camps can literally be anything 
---
Exactly on point...   
---
Though I'd want the ant to scale up in size as well...   
---
Nothing would be more terrifying then a level 300, 3* legendary ant the size of the Scorched Queen..
---
It's definitely tricky. 
---
Definitely can't sneak past a scorchbeast in power armor. 
---
I use as much cover as possible, always frees when she's close, and even then it's hit and miss. At one point I also had a piece of wood armor that was modded to help. 
---
Not after fusion cells but please post what system you are on.
---
That's a good explanation. 
---
And usually correct, I think. In this case, the scorchbeast was fighting something. The stupid scorchers found me and swarmed me. 
---
Should just be costume like any other
---
This is the thing I love about the FO76 community. People coming together to enjoy the game!
---
👍🏻
---
Ooooh, great reference.  Upvoted.
---
I wish there were more differences between the power armors. I'd for raider armour for example to have some kind of weight-based ability, like reduced stagger chance. Or for T60 to have some sort of BoS related bonus.
---
I'm done. I'll be back to see if it's fixed with additional content in a month or so. Almost level 200. Bored running the Cancer Queen. 
---
Something just blew the f up at Bethesda 
---
I noticed the same thing. But I kind of quit, too. Hopped on tonight to say hi to a friend, a Saturday night, and it seemed quite dead. Even for a post-apocolyptic wasteland.
---
to be fair gamers have shown that they want to be treated like cattle so bethesda is just giving you what you want
---
A handmade and an explosive lever action (not two shot) it did 154 dmg
---
I had this happen to me today too, I think some Rad-X, I would have taken a clipboard over that. 
---
On the flip, I’ve had legendary drops from non-legendary mobs too. They’re never any good though. 
---
Yep he sold you a DLC. Cost ya 500caps.
---
But no refunds ok bro 👍🏻
---
This game is bonkers ... I met this gangrenous fellow with a constant red light coming out of its head. While looting its corpse, it exploded in my face like a sentry bot.
---
I agree. It's their.
---
You could do so much for the aesthetics with some wires for ropes
---
Got the silver shroud costume. It does for me. I'm also on xbox if that makes any difference. 
---
Same shit happened to me today. I took all the bulk items from my stash that were greater than 5 and headed to a vendor to sell them. Somewhere en route they vanished. Thanks, Bethesda. That was a lot of grinding you cost me
---
I have loads of shotgun ammo. I don't use shotguns. I'd be happy to trade. What system?
---
Based on what we’ve seen before I doubt the devs are gonna do a complete rework of PvP simply because they are lazy, probably just make different servers and disable the damage restriction on non-enemy players. 
---
Stopped playing until the dev team and their management get their shit together or Skyrim 2 comes out.
---
When it comes to people over level 50, I don't think you're in the minority.
---
I still haven't finished the main quest but I'm starting to already see that I'm running out of runway.
---
Until new PvE content comes out, the best I'll be able to do post main quest is just get all the map markers and check those areas out, purely for completionism rather than wanting anything out of them.
---
Who knows, could run into a cool holotape or bit of environmental story telling but not expecting much to be honest.
---
I got one too. Looks kind of dorky :-)
---
Holy fuck that's hilarious... and eerily similar to my plastic gathering experience. Except it was an invisible super mutant and scorchbeast attacking me.
---
Getchu some
---
hey hitler!
---
I dont use power armor for what its worth.
---
Thanos snapped his finger and all the fragile games left the sub. https://youtu.be/RgKAFK5djSk
---
Report that cheater to Bethesda. It's people like them that are ruining this Game!/s
---
^plastic ^gathering ^experience would be a great  band name as i read this aloud.
---
need to update that.  I found him on the road south of the abandoned bog town once.
---
Fun fact...i've been using this nickname since before I knew what that crap was. One of my early girlfriends gave me a bottle as a gift and I was fucking amused. 
---
Not my fault you're a fucking idiot, though, asshat. 
---
Actually, now that I examine my inventory, I am thinking that I probably scrapped them with "scrap all" on the way to the vendor. Not used to that yet.
---
#1, however, no doubt about (until / unless I have another epiphany like I did about #2).
---
Oh they would have been livid with the TSE nerfs. I would not be surprised if they showed up on r/Fallout to complain about the nerfs.
---
Pool's closed
---
Thank you Lorax.
---
Bethesda: Good ideas, but how about a PVP server and we add content from Fallout 4 to the atomic shop for $8. We think that you’ll enjoy that more than any of that stuff. 
---
I agree, I just feel like all the haters weren’t getting enough attention so they moved here.  I get it, it’s not perfect, let’s move on to constructive feedback.
---
I strongly disagree with ideas of free, immediate full respecs.  
---
For the first time after what, Fallout Tactics (?) we have a Fallout game where you CANNOT be a master in ALL areas in the game and have to make sacrifices in certain areas to strengthen others. Allowing us to change the entire build on a whim would completely negate the whole concept of specialization and group tactics. One should also hunt gear to fit the current character and not the other way around.  
---
The game as it is offers already a very generous way of swapping abilities within certain boundaries and even allows you to FULLY respec into anything, given enough time (levels). Let's not destroy one of the few Elements of Fallout 76 that actually still have a meaning.
---
Weird. Maybe it was just for that session. I’ll check tomorrow but it was taking my shielded BOS off. I’m also on xb1
---
You're fucking right it is!
---
Except the weekend generally is when player counts rise. Just check the average MP game on steamcharts.
---
Turrets on ground, and lowest level too means you will be wasting resources on them just to keep them fixed.
---
Did you try turning it off... and then, on again?
---
I have the Silver Shroud costume, and have no issues with the Under armor.  Wife has The Inspector outfit, and she cannot wear the Under Armor.
---
the game
---
I bought the stove plan learned it and it's not available for me to use I just wasted caps on it
---
I made a post about that :)  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alrk55/how\_to\_do\_nerfs\_buffs\_bug\_fixes\_and\_content\_to/?sort=new](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alrk55/how_to_do_nerfs_buffs_bug_fixes_and_content_to/?sort=new)
---
Scroll down and look for the following text:
---
AWOL Armaments
---
SUPER AWOL Armaments
---
Enjoy fast, easy added content :)
---
See I have the inspector. So maybe it’s just the inspector? 
---
What ppl might find interesting is the space physical games take up costs money over time.
---
If they had games that actually sell they'd probably earn more so they give them away.
---
Same goes for warehouse space. 
---
Radworms increase all mutations by 50% until it wears off, then its -50%. I think it affects damage too? I know it affects most aid effects like chems, food, drink, alcohol, and all kinds of other interesting stuff. Kinda fun until it’s cured or wears off 
---
Blocking basically just stops you from seeing them on the map and them from seeing you
---
Explosive damage can be almost entirely absorbed, doesn't really matter how many times its multiplied, that and it would be slap damage if it was a first encounter. Also that seems high when my bloody explosive hunting rifle only does 450 dmg, bobble heads?
---
Yep. Same here.   
---
I was in a clan with around 15-20 members playing Conan: Exiles. Once we got into Fallout we grew our numbers out even more to 30+. Now we are down to me thinking I'm the only one who still plays. I guess I'm stubborn. I want to like the game as much as possible, but it's getting harder &amp; harder to force myself to believe I do. RIP in advance.
---
/u/BethesdaGameStudios_ can we get someone to comment on the goals for loot tables? This grind is way too tedious imo. 
---
I used to farm sbq before the last patch, now even top endgame content is utterly useless. I used to farm ingredients for ultracite ammo, now I just don't want to waste it, because it's not even worth it.
---
Guess I'll hibernate until some content patch arrives, which would probably be months away.
---
It's the same price now as it was pre-patch.
---
~9500 caps with hard bargain 3
---
It is not rare at all. But Mr fuzzy is. Then again fuzzy is not that rare, I have 5 characters 3 for gathering fuzzy tokens. That should be enough to get it in 30 days
---
Go to Whitesprings Nuke Zones with a hazmat suit.
---
Follow around a pack of high level players.  Do not try to 1v1 the ghouls :)
---
Use some area of effect items like grenades to get tags on all the ghouls.
---
You might not get a lot of nuke zone materials, but you'll get a ton of random legendaries.  Better stuff than you have now.  What you can use, use.  What you can't use, sell and buy other armor.
---
Also Uranium Fever at Blackwater mine.  I get lower level legendaries there ALL the time.
---
Hope that helps :)
---
I haven't played since the end of November. I still check this sub tho to see the updates. Still nothing worth coming back for. 
---
Loaded in dead just today with a SB circling my corpse. #OppositeOfFun
---
Maybe. Just relaying my experience. 
---
Pretty sure whores/slaves were dropped in 4 to broaden appeal.
---
Cant have kiddos running around enslaving people but people exploding into a billion red pieces? No prob
---
Based on what happened, I can 100% say that was not the case.
---
I could see them hitting me and despite me moving they could still see me--to hit me.  For five minutes.
---
Skyrim 2= elder scrolls 6, prob won’t take place in Skyrim 
---
I love ir
---
Yeah your post gave me hope ideally the way it would work and be balanced. I really do hope the survival mode will bring new rise to the game from the possibilities. I mean i already am getting my game plan together from exit of vault to end game for pure solo survival, but am still just on the fence. Do you feel a character wipe every few months would be healthy or detrimental in survival?
---
Thank you for your reply. I tried the way. But didn't fix it.
---
I tried restarting PS4 and re-installing the game too but I couldn't build...
---
Does anyone know if this works on the unique items Summerset Special and Voice of Set? They are both .44 I really hope they do. It's the whole reason I got it.
---
It is an effect on the chameleon armours, it's not your pc. 
---
For reference, here is a mod from fallout 4 that removes this "feature". It has carried over to 76. Not sure why this was added to the game, I don't think most players are stupid enough to need a detrimental visual effect to know that they just went invisible.
---
But were you wearing a clown suit?  Never fight a Wendigo without a clown suit....
---
YES FOR THE LOVE OF ATOM PLEASE. My social anxiety and team invites don't play well together, eheh.
---
According to the wiki, the helmet is purchased from the shop :( . Which Jumpsuit do you mean btw?
---
It's just a game. Refuckinglax and give it time
---
yes !
---
The amount of times I hear that sentence A DAY, about my friends and I lmao.
---
Xx xdr x
---
I got my refund a week ago, but haven't played since before Christmas. There's nothing but hard core fans here. The latest patches pretty much brought back a bunch of old issues and Bethesda seems to have lost too much money and time to care to make a good game out of this. 
---
This horse is dead at this point, so no point it putting it out of its misery.
---
What platfoem?
---
I used to play 8 hours a day to 16 hours a day. I was level 203 hit Caps Limit around 45-50 times. Killed the Queen around 150 times. Used to stream the game on twitch. Farmed Plans and items to sell and trade. 
---
As flawed and buggy the game was I saw the potential foundation of a great game. I know people who work at Bethesda Maryland and Austin. They would reassure me they had great plans for the game even give me a outline of the first year plans.
---
Yet over the last month or so.  With patches, and with them tryin got balance the game. I started to see they do not understand their game and Meta at the core. After this last patch. I saw they didn’t understand balance. I woke up and saw the incompetence.
---
I made post quitting and encouraging other people to quit out of protest. To help Bethesda wake up and get their collective shit together.
---
There is 5 or 6 Very good games coming out. This was a perfect time for us to stand up and walk away to light a fire under them to fix the game. I’m not going to list the games. I posted a post yesterday showing I bought to games and put my money where my mouth is and others are too.
---
I used to have 60 people playing Fallout 76 on my friends list. Since patch and the cry or protest and walk away from the game movement. Only 8 area till playing. 20 plus players on my friends list trade the game on for credit towards other games.
---
Now my Friends list is just a micro of the situation. Could have statistical outliers. But I think People are feed up and walking  away in droves.
---
Xbox. But i feel it should go for us all. We can have an xbox coordinator, a PS4 one, and so on.
---
This, apart from additional endgame content, is one of the best things I’ve seen on this sub in a while. 
---
Killer idea man. 
---
70% of the posts here are the drama stirring, circle jerking BS. 
---
The drama queens have pushed the actual fans away, while the hardcore few remaining have made the casual players feel unwelcomed or uninteresting. 
---
My character is on acid I guess tonight?? 
---
I feel like that's all the beta will be TBH and that alone will piss off the playerbase. Then alpha drops with new patch for balance changes to certain legendaries, only allow new characters and see where it goes from there. I'm on the fence.  Kinda hoping if you start a new char on survival beta they can transfer to alpha
---
You misunderstand. The AI *knows* where you are, but pretends it doesn't. They will circle their flight pattern in an area around you that stays nearby you until you leave their patrol area.
---
In your case, the usual "Lol I don't see you" patrol pattern was happening, but the scorchbeast got into combat with something else, which triggers it to spawn scorched which *also* know where the player is, but are not programmed to pretend that they don't.
---
I have literally never once had this happen. 
---
After the TSE guns nerf me and most of my friends quit. We dont give a crap for PvP, our fun was ar pve. Enemies are huge bullet spounges and TSE was the only thing that changed that. We abominate melee and since beta the thing is the way to go to kill stuff. FPS games suck for melee, its no fun. We Just moved up.
---
I play but I'm a casual player, I always wanted to do levels and missions at my own pace but I've played with people who already beat the game and just rushed through the missions and kinda ruined it for me. Now the way that I play is slow and I take in the scenery and try to understand the lore and find a story. I'm thinking of maybe of maybe starting out a new character or even putting 76 on hold till I can set up a shop or something and maybe replay fallout 4.
---
I'll have you know there's no *pussieee*!
---
Thought it only happened to me.  It ate one of my scroll wheel weapons.
---
Given how grindy the game is, it would be pr &amp; maybe game suicide.
---
I think a wipe at the end of beta is OK. Just so long as they let everyone know before beta goes live to manage expectations. 
---
Speaking of managing expectations, Bethesda hasn't said they would allow new characters only. It's just very popular in the community. We'll have to see whether or not they listen to us. 
---
Check your death quest is active in pipboy. You might have turned it off one time. 
---
Sorry to hear that, game is basically broken, dont understand how people are tolerating bethesda still i gave up entirely.
---
His teammates can still see you. 
---
Hey do you remember where you found the cowboy outfit ?
---
Dude where was the cabin it’s knowledge had sparked me enough to play again, but once I find it I’ll be bored
---
hahahaha from bethsada!!!!! good luck
---
G. E. C. K. idea is coming in marsh 
---
I've never seen it at either place so if it's there, it's randomised. 
---
That sucks man, atleast now i know aswel it has happened to someone else and it wasnt a one time occurence with me. Thanks for the feedback!
---
I’m only level 11 and I feel bored with the fetch quests. I’m working on building my hostel until I find other things to do
---
PREACH. I run bloodied and everytime I load into the game I die. (my camp is near high level spawns)
---
Randomized but Harpers Ferry and Watoga can spawn them, I believe both boys in Watoga can.
---
Again sadly, this is nothing new for them. With Fallout 4 there is a Mod the was done that fixes EVERYTHING wrong but it was never talked about as far as I remember by them and never picked up and released as it should have been and the fact that we are here playing this game when they made a VR Fallout 4 and this game before Fallout 5 when NO ONE ever asked for this just means we all need our heads checked in the first place, but I still hope that somehow this makes them change all that and we get this game saved somehow.
---
I think its spawns random in vendors. I was looking for one earlier and I'd usually see one at Watoga but ended up finding it at R&amp;G Station.
---
I quit after the last patch.  I'm keeping an eye on the sub-reddits and patch notes but I'll be waiting another couple patches before getting back into it again.
---
There's also the fact that its pretty much impossible to get accurate player counts because literally no server browser and servers are just virtually generated with a 24 player cap. Not being on steam also means no steamcharts looking at player count trends.
---
Yeah i understand the game is pretty broken and has bin since day one. I guess im easily entertained, i still find little things that entertain me and help me over look all the glitches/bugs and just plain ol' unbalanced things. Even after my friends have left the game i still find some stuff that i have fun with and it keeps me coming back.  
---
Wait. Theres a stash at whitesprings?
---
Yeah. In the crafting store 
---
Devs have literally said they want tension and paranoia when people see each other in game. 
---
It is clear then never wanted this game to be about Co-op play. They see this game being some sort of alternate version of the Purge.  They have given players nothing that allows us to harbor a feeling of community. Even though our characters lived together in peace for the last 20 yrs at V76. No txt chat, no guilds, trolls taking advantage to spread lies about trade bugs, players in passive mode having to watch others destroy their CAMPs for fun... etc.
---
Beth has this weird vision of F76 being this lonely, dog eat dog wasteland. Having played FO for years and been part of the community, that has never been super high on the list. We have been asking for Co-op play! The Community is helpful, funny and wants to work together. They have made mods for people to play the games all sorts of fun ways, thus keeping previous FO titles new and fresh.
---
The trailers for F76 sold the game on the promise of Co-op play, then you get in game and find out PVP is what the Dev really want. The first major add on to the game is PVP servers.  Sure some vocal people scream for PVP, but they IMHO do not represent the community.
---
People are leaving by the truck load, the servers feel really empty and the nuke zones if you can find one are usually empty or at max 3-5 people.  Two weeks ago you only needed to server hop max 2-3 times and you got a nuke zone and it had 10-20 people almost every time. I have killed the SBQ dozens of times always with large groups and had a lot of fun. People trading Plan or Aids afterwards was great. It was really nice working together. Since the Patch I have not killed the SBQ once...I go to the Zone and nobody shows up so I just farm fluxs.
---
TSE weapons needed to be NERFd they were OP, but the nerf was so poorly done it destroyed a lot of peoples build. An 80% decrease in DPS is just not acceptable. Add in Stealth is broken and a Crit build nerf and well EVERY part of my build was destroyed as was many other peoples builds.
---
Beth never gave us a respec and now people were facing a 30 level grind to fix the build while using a nerf'd weapon, nerf'd skills, broken mechanics, bugs and more.  Beth just tore out peoples hearts.
---
Next patch will be the Make it or break it patch...they either start listening to the community and give people the tools they want, actually fix the bugs that cripple builds, stop introducing more bugs and for love of GOD stop the disconnect or people a massive amount of people will walk away.  My bet is Beth doubles down and this game will be a ghost town by the end of February.
---
Had this game been a new franchise not a Fallout game and the Devs had preformed like they have this game would have collapsed and already be shutting down its servers. The Fan have kept this game on life support and that can last only so long.
---
https://youtu.be/1vrEljMfXYo
---
Thank you. You just made my game a whole lot better. 
---
You don't understand. You two can't see each others nametag on the map since you blocked him but you still see each other from visual distance. Since he had friends you haven't blocked they told him your position on the map. Also i'm not here to judge but jesus christ, i had no idea you people were this much carebear. I don't want to know how you handled bullies at school if you can't even handle a virtual conflict in a pvp zoned workshop with a ebay bought TSE.
---
Oh...
---
I mean reddit sub being quieter, not in game. Not noticed a change in game. Feels about the same to me. 
---
Cant even move...falling through the map...and literally must be the size of a bobblehead...trying to walk around 
---
Whitesprings got everything lol
---
You are all being screwballs!
---
No I know they haven't Stated specifically that when the main survival drops you will be able to bring in new characters, but honestly that would be the end of the game period. They know that so honestly what I feel this BETA is s to basically figure out the balance going into survival. Its perfect patch the weapons that need balance this month feb. Drop Beta in March? Rebalance (hopefully not nerf but good balance to weapons and perks) and figure out and more buffs hopefully the game needs. Release Alpha survival mode along with Vault TEC DLC in mid march most likely early  april. Step4 PROFIT
---
Dolly sods cabin. Top floor
---
sad thing is that it will take months for things to get back to "normal" but by that time people will have moved on to new games etc.. I think bethesda has really shifted most of their staff from this title towards upcoming ones.
---
That is why updates are slower and fix less and less bugs every time a new patch comes out.
---
Personally, I’m only hanging because I don’t really have much else to do. I’ve slowly lost interest in single player games (I find it hard to sit alone quietly in a room playing games for long periods of time). 76 has just enough social interaction to keep me occupied. It’s become more of an idle game than anything else, and besides, I paid for it. (Fyi, the latest patch isn’t something I was pleased about, I just don’t care enough to uninstall).
---
Said it before.  It's not a game.  It's a perverse psychological experiment.
---
Admin has left the session.
---
what other games are you playing?
---
Yea... did you actually bother testing your accuracy at the range you've been trying to snipe at before whining about nerfed damage?
---
Because if you're going from a regular weapon to a two shot the difference in accuracy is no fucking joke and you'll be lucky to land both of your bullets on anythings head at a proper range.  If you're only landing one of the bullets and it's the extra one then yea, you're going to do shit damage.  Two shot weapons aren't made for use consistent use at a long range.
---
I use a non legendary handmade for clearing random shit and I've been one shoting level 68 scorched ever since the patch.
---
Thanks man, it’s funny I’m finding so many clothes way late in the game 
---
I have built a single one that is a 4x4 with 2 doors and freaked out when I added a porch. What is this creativity 
---
Oh sorry. I'm not saying you said that we start out with new characters. Just that Bethesda hasn't confirmed so in lieu of that, right now we can bring characters over. That's all I was clarifying. 
---
welcome to club.
---
How can I help *you* today?
---
Quoting scripture I feel has a greater impact, uhum...
---
‘Blessed is he, who in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy my brothers and use cheater programs or dupe in my beloved FO76...’
---
Sorry for the ramble thenlol 
---
All engines have legacy issues, I mentioned RSG, where it's their control scheme, unchanged since GTA IV (2008) and mission design since GTA III (2001), with BGS it's their graphical fidelity &amp; glitches. 
---
When people say "modders have fixed x bug, why hasn't BGS", it's probably the modders finding front end fixes which leave the underlying issues in the code untouched (similar to tricks making a program compile with a memory leak, that execute until the out of bounds memory is requested). I'm not saying don't acknowledge Creation's faults, I'm saying the engine has legacy issues which are irreducible to the games they make. And if you take the engine as it existed at the end of Fallout 4's life cycle, what we got was expected, and all those tricks which made previous Bethesda games run, but glitch, were compounded with an on-line audience.
---
This whole situation is the crucible by which the Creation engine will become a "modern, operational game engine" because (a) the ATLAS problem spoken about in the NoClip documentary is solved for any future games BGS make. Multiplayer expansion for Starfield or TES 6 can be easily made as all the main network engineering problems were solved, &amp; (b) pre-existing bugs which have been quaint or charming up until now will be located &amp; fixed, because the consequences of their existence are far more severe.
---
The Devs have said they aren't looking to move onto content &amp; QoL changes until the bugs are gone, which basically means the things we like (world size, mission design, AI) will soon coexist with online stability. 
---
The mystery of Raven Rock, hence the capital waste, are teased in the Enclave Bunker, so hypothetically at E3 next year Todd Howard can say: "we said break it early, and by God you did. Sorry for the inconvenience but on the plus side the game is running well now thanks to your patience. Everybody who bought and played the game before x will get our first expansion free, and if you've been waiting, this will be a doozy &amp; we really hope you'll give it another shot". If done properly, playing on nostalgia like ESO did with the Morrowind chapter, I think the game will have a resurgence. Hundreds of thousands, maybe at one point millions, of people acted as QA so going forward we'll get the Fallout MMO we always wanted. 
---
I can easily imagine everything I just said occurring, especially since they're privately held so that the revenue from Fallout Shelter &amp; Skyrim doesn't have to immediately go to shareholders. It can be justified because being live service lets 76 act as R&amp;D investment for future games in the engine.
---
I've avoided ever doing that event because every couple days someone posts about losing their best weapon/armor to it.
---
Bethesda probably doesn't know that there is a onGameLoad Event is, where they could make the player "immune", by adding a perk and reduce damage by 99.99%. Really don't know why it's so hard for them to do such things. It's not magic...
---
If they remove PvP from the Adventure Mode, the Wanted System will chease to exist from the game since you won't find it in Survival Mode. Carebears who want it gone will ruin the game as there won't be any other player interraction other then scripted events, no story to tell, nothing new and excited happening. Then they are the same people complaining how the game is boring and how there is nothing to do other then repeating the same daily tasks.
---
&gt;That arguement only holds up until you realize even with calibrated shocks, X-01 only has the same carry weight as the base Excavator PA does.
---
Not really.  Excavator's damage resistance and radiation resistance are inferior to the X01.
---
Once they they can build the X01 armor, many people want to wear it for the superior damage and radiation resistance, even if it means sacrificing the 100 extra carry weight. 
---
In other words, Bethesda forces you to choose between damage resistance and carry weight.   A great many people will choose damage resistance. 
---
If the X01 calibrated shocks were easily accessible,  pretty much everyone would be wearing the X01 and carrying over 300 points. 
---
And I don't agree that everyone gets the excavator armor or that the quest line is simple. 
---
 It's an optional quest, one that many  people won't even complete because they simply don't feel like grinding for all the materials involved in building  it. 
---
I actually met a guy well over level 50 who had completed the endgame quest and had launched nukes but did not have the excavator armor. 
---
Im willing to help! I also have a new faction, Imperial Reaper Group. We're a new mercenary team working with BoS and enclave factions. This is a very cool idea and would make this game better without a doubt...We have a discord you and everyone else reading this are welcome to join
---
&gt; Because what I wanted was to be left alone and that did not take place.
---
So change servers. The block did exactly whatit was designed to do, prevent communication between the both of you, but you are still on the same server. You blocking him isn't going to magically boot them from the server, and its not going to magically make you immune to their weapon damage. That would be stupid.
---
That's all.ive been doing lately while.i wait for content. Got the tin foil hate the other day and the mole mascot suit. 
---
That and trying to complete random challenges keeps me playing. 
---
Still playing here. Haven’t noticed a drop in population on the servers I’ve been on, either.
---
Thought those damn mushrooms tasted funny....
---
It’s possible they’re selecting a count but that would be incredibly inefficient. 
---
I play FO76 almost every day after job. Every time servers almost full.
---
So, game isn't dead, it's just your imagination. 
---
Where was the tin foil hat?
---
It should be obvious but because you can’t see it:
---
No one wants people who thinks cheaters are justified in their games. 
---
You aren’t wanted. Go away. 
---
No. Try it out.
---
Ha ha ha I lost over a thousand rounds of ammo doing that.  Couldn’t understand why my gun no longer worked.

" Additional bullets are logically less accurate/effective so some diminishing returns are appropriate and some nod to balance is necessary. "

I searched for the event related posts to see if other people encountered this and just saw a bunch of posts over the reward patch, so i decided to share.
---
I guess if the inventory tab would of shown all the items i would of noticed it was showing my armor pieces and not thrown em in. Being able to retrieve non-ingredient items would be great aswel. 
---
If your looking to try out all the events like i was, you should definetly try it, just have caution when you throw in your ingredients.
---
BLUF: I agree 100%
---
I could definitely use a bigger stash myself, but to be honest, I’m not a collector like I was in FO4. I have a few sets of PA, some TSE’s for when they fix that, and junk. The junk takes up easily 500/600. I spend more time managing that than anything else. 
---
I saw another post a while ago about players setting limits to junk items. Like I set my cork limit to 50, so when I dump all my junk, it won’t put all 73 cork I have in there, just up to the 50. That would save a lot of time. 
---
I always drop leftover raw flux ($11 each) in the last register.  Typically Watoga. After doing my vendor circuit 
---
What I am also curious about is, why didn't this latest patch wait a week on consoles like they said they would.  Why remove that one week buffer to avoid problems on consoles?
---
I love that one too. 
---
A lot of MMOs have a “bank” for your crafting materials that’s entirely separate. This idea would fit right in with the norm. 
---
You're doing this community a service. Thank you for putting in the work that you and others have. The bones are there for this whole idea BGS had, someone just needs to listen.
---
I was just going to post this. It’s so quiet on the servers now. 
---
Yes I think this happened to me last night. Came back from Nuke drop on fissure site prime and had over 100 glowing meat. Crafter the lot and within a minute I was server disconnected.
---
Tried to come back in 4 times and as the world was about to load I was sent to desktop each time.
---
Prob didn’t help that I had super duper lvl 2 on either.
---
Was back on after ten minutes and don’t have any hard feelings. I think it’s a good feature to help with server stability.
---
So my advice is craft slowly. Don’t keep smashing the E button like I did 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
Works as intended for me. 
---
my two shot gaus made 522dmg wilh all rifle perk card and fully charged. now make only 312dmg. ist a huge nerf even if u see its a slow gun with \~1sec/shoot adn with small 6bullet magazine. tse wapons ws lame just soot the floor nad jump... but nerfing regular two shot weapons was a huge mistake.
---
Yup. I'm part of A PvP group who also does SBQ raids. That's fun
---
I always wanted automated in game transpot so that I can enjoy the view without walking. It would also make people concentrate 
---
I could be wrong but I think that's the tricentennial paint
---
I only 2 or 3 people left playing the game.  They did say the servers are really stable right now but that's also due to almost no one playing. 
---
Thats the tricentennial paint
---
all your base are belong to us
---
 scorch beast  always was able to detect u even if r invisible.
---
Watoga is another spot. But a bit lazy if you have completed Mayor for a day as the bots don’t fire back. 
---
its really rare... they just jelly
---
so this is why my marsupial not work frequently...
---
And make it so we dont load in before our pipboy does and we get locked in place and cant move until we restart the game. 
---
Logged in yesterday and it took me 11 shots to kill a level 48 super mutant with my TSE with rifleman, expert rifleman, master rifleman, demolition, tormentor, and bloody mess perks at level 140. 11 shots? I told my friend it was bullshit and logged off. I’m not wasting my ammo. 
---
Most of my friends have moved on to the Anthem demo, went back to Red Dead 2, or started playing Kingdom Hearts 3. 
---
I bet you call everyone with mutations and TSEs dupers. 
---
And they all know my waters dirty

I haven’t dropped anything decent in Whitesprings in quite a while. Am I just unlucky, or did the rolls get worse there to discourage so many people from just camping there?

4. I am overencumbered in my power armor but not in my regular armor. I did not have this problem before the last patch. Overall weight has also changed by +10 lbs.  
---
I haven't quit, but am temporarily playing less in anticipation of further balance changes, bug fixes, and new content (vaults in March IIRC); and don't think it's wise to invest in any changes to my lvl248 character until the dust settles.
---
That said, I'm considering starting a new character and taking the time to immerse myself more in the journey. Had I done that from the start, I'd probably not be bored on the endgame for another month. I suspect the new content schedule was wisely decided for the majority of players (just not for the majority in this sub).
---
This is sarcasm right?
---
It’s not masses, just a very vocal minority that make enough noise to sound like a large mass!
---
In all honesty I would wait a couple months. Probably not what you want to hear but it is in a bad state currently.
---
Also power armour chassis disappearing leaving just the components / power armour disappearing .... sometimes returning on re logging 
---
well when i have armor pen perk cards and weapons and still do very little damage.
---
i never said that cheaters are justified, i said "maybe bethesda should fix the shitty game".
---
a company fed you a shit sandwich, you payed for it, and you currently have shit in your teeth from that shit sandwich while you type this.

THE CHEATERS CAN ONLY CHEAT BECAUSE THE GAME IS BUGGY, IF THE GAME NOT BUGGY, CHEATERS CAN'T CHEAT !!

That would be cool but even the Enclave doctor tells you to go to a medic vendor. Just buy the disease cure from a vendor. But also the Enclave doc should give you a daily checkup
---
Hit up Charleston FD, the gym's filled with dumbbells for 65-70 lead per run. It doesn't provide as much as mining, but it's quicker.
---
Are you kidding? You want to launch a nuke with all this shit going on? At this point I wouldn't be surprised if you somehow managed to launch the real thing when you tried.
---
I've got the shielded vault, enclave, brotherhood, and marine. Marine was given to me a random guy, so probably duped. I've never seen shielded or protective raider or casual. Raider I've seen offered for all platforms, so it's out there. Casual is broken at the protective level according data miners. Can't get the shielded without protective. I'm hoping somebody important  notices that it's missing eventually. It's my underarmor of choice.
---
Nah haven't seen anything like that. Wish we knew more about the others so we could roleplay besides just the Shroud. There's four other characters whose dialogue we don't know about. We don't know about two of their weapons either. But would be cool if they gave us old hero holotapes in a dlc update
---
that copter's about to go down to mah lazor
---
That's an awesome sounding faction. I'm still wanting to create a raiders gang up in the top of the world area. How would one join this said faction?
---
Wherever you live, it's probably on sale right now. Pretty sure you can get it online for below $10 too
---
Some people are just bored and sad :(
---
I’m sorry that you’re so bad that you have to cheat to be able to play. 
---
Go away, no one wants you.

I always thought the first person was just off and they were hitting your toes

3. Instead of charging 40 caps to move my base, the amount kept rising. The indicator in my pip boy stated that each move was 40 caps, after like 5 or 6 moves I was broke. I had over a thousand caps to start
---
I gave up when bethesda announced a pvp mode. Its shows me that they are completely incompetent as far as multiplayer games go. They should stick to single player games that the mod community can finish for them
---
Bethesda got called out in Fallout 3, Fallout NV and Fallout 4 for  relying on the modders to fix the problems so I expect that they are taking the counter stance. This though effectively is a poor option as its just alienating the helpful side of the remaining player base for the purpose of in a sense "ego". I am apart of the minority that enjoys FO76 despite the bugs, balances and other factors that seem to hinder the game itself. But with Bethesda's application of choice fragments of transparency on both the Development and Quality Assurance process it leaves a bitter taste for those still hanging on to support them. Added that some of the balances and decisions make the core gameplay a grind up hamburger hill makes it doubly disheartening.  If it were me in an advisory role I would listen to the Modder base and look for common issues that keep reoccuring in the Development and QA Process and develop strategies to reduce it as well as look at how the balances effect the gameplays core feel because currently it feels like game is designed to be an unbalanced grind and punish people working outside the merc style play. 
---
Yeah it happened to me earlier today. I just turned off the ps4. 
---
I've had an issue with my armor just straight up not working. Full assassin's sentinel I was in a pvp battle for almost 20 mins. Half the times I spawned he could kill me in 1-2 shots and the other half it would take him 10 shots to put a dent in my health. That combined with healing factor not working and my other mutations glitching out finally got me to put the game down for a bit
---
...
---
Well holy shit. This is going to make getting that Shadowed/Dense Combat Chest so much easier.
---
I hope if the situation worsen and they decide to cut the server cost, they will release a private server host program thing so that I can still experience all the content at my pc.
---
Shhhhhhh.   I'm nowhere near this guy, but I can stand in a mob of glowing ones at Whitespring stabbing away and the only real chance I have of dying is from rads when my hazmat suit breaks.  
---
Um, "you people" and "carebear"?  I just want to sell at vendor bots and loot some fusion cores mate.
---
But nice bait on the bully comparison. 
---
I'm on PC and not too long ago had a nuke launched at Harper's Ferry. 
---
They are gone, they left like 30 days ago
---
If the game is soo bad why are you a member of the subreddit... 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
It dropped from a normal scorchbeast for me yesterday. Think it could be any scorchbeast but mine was the "it's a trap" scorchbeast.
---
Your best case scenario is defending cheaters. 
---
Go away. No one wants you. 
---
Imagine if this were the case. I could block everyone and get a server just to myself
---
I play on pc
---
Yup. Known bug with not a lot known about it but healing, mutations. and sometimes armor have all gone to hell
---
Hear it's the Inspector and Manta Man that has the issue. Thinking maybe they copied them from the Mistress of Mystery outfit data, which is armor and isn't an outfit. They already had Grognak and Silver Shroud from FO4
---
Ah got it. Thanks
---
What was the price for the plan?
---
What weight issues? I mean you have to drop stuff sometimes. Or fatwalk. 
---
Or pick stuff you need over stuff you could need. Sell some bulk junk over 100. I haven't done most of that either, but level 19? I got a 50+ and a couple 20s and weight hasn't been ny buggest gripe.
---
Are you scrapping our junk? Are you storing your junk?
---
Look I'm a hoarder, too, but part of the game is being picky with loadouts cause you're supposed to be a human with limited strength. Challenge yourself to have only a couple weapons at a time. Like, two. Most of what the sub talks about is like 30 levels away, and that inbetween content is juicy if you roleplay a bit.
---
Level 248 here and I share your endgame blues. It sucks. It feels empty and makes me feel lame for getting here.
---
For most players though, the March vaults opening will probably be well-time; it won't need to "salvage" a game already full of yet-unseen content. 
---
This sub likely represents the top single-digit percentile of meta players who sink tons of time into getting through the game fast. And even as one of those players, I don't think any game should be designed for us.
---
BGS has made mistakes with 76 and it's important as customers and fans  to hold them accountable; but honestly, the worst part of 76 currently is the entitled drama queens right here who want all their demands met NOW! Of course such sentiments will be heavily downvoted here, but maybe we should all go spend some time on our children, education, and careers. None of us should be playing video games 5+ hours a day and no game should incentivize doing that.

---
no, i just said bethesda should fix the game.
---
That's how it was; from your perspective. 
---
Blocking in November removed your ability to view or interact with that person.  Not theirs. 
---
Toxicity of this subreddit is what drove people out. I just want to play the game and talk about it. I dont need to see bitching and moaning about bugs every damn day.
---
Haha, how they did the moving trains in Fallout 3 is the funniest thing I ever heard of. 
---
I’m on a hiatus until a good amount of quality of life changes are implemented, like an lfg system, for example.
---
The problem with TSE is that the only downside of two-shot (accuracy of the second projectile) is cured by explosive aoe effect.
---
Bloodied shall cap at 50%hp giving 30% bonus damage
---
Furious is good as it is capping at 30%
---
Two-shot should spend two bullets per shot (and second projectile should be around 30% bonus)
---
Instigating is good as it is on range weapons, a little bit op on melee, but it is melee problem being too powerful overall.
---
Executioner can be very useful, but it flat out loses in dps to even furious. May be giving bonus from 50%hp left on target and making it 45% might boost it, but i’d rather completely overhaul it into VATS legendary effect providing % bonus critical damage (may be even head only).
---
I have wide range of legendaries, and after patch i just switched to bloodied explosive and anti-armor explosive. 
---
It is sad that most other highly circumstantial effects are not providing incentive to use them.
---
I would love if you really felt using Nocturnal legendary (I am batman!) or Junkies forced you to be drunken master (instead of buffs from withdrawal it could give +10% damage per addiction you have or +10% damage for every ongoing effect you have from aids).
---
Bonuses vs specific enemies and players should at least  be doubled.
---
But what i would love most - is complete removal of legendaries from the game with appropriate adjustments of endgame difficulty.
---
My best pvp experience came from early level, when there were long shootouts with other low-levelers. Very fun and tactical.
---
Now even after nerf it is boring. Either opponent staggers me canceling sentinel/assassins combo and killing me, or i kill him.
---
Usualy fight lasts under 10 seconds. By the way Buff to Fireproof along with Dense armor mod have already dealt with Explosive effect, so further nerf of explosives hit mostly real explosives instead of TSE.
---
The balance is such a disaster I can rant all day long. 
---
The I migrated right. Mea culpa. 
---
I agree completely that RSG doesn't release buggy games, my criticism is that playing them as intended they have less variety &amp; constructively linear level design. Basically it's all movement to context sensitive location that spawns next cutscene. Some of it's great. Clearing out the Lost base as Trevor in GTA V is fun, but then it's followed by a 10 minute drive from a to b. For me, a bunch of clever dialogue doesn't cover up the fact that you're just driving. 
---
I'm terms of the nerfs, being able to one shot all enemies removes tension, makes future DLC &amp; expansions not worth the effort, and makes PvP uneven. I know it's not an instant solution, but when private servers come around November you can change the settings on weapons, perks, etc, to what you want. I level up once a day or so, and it's frustrating that I can't immediately have all 9 commando cards for my two shot Rifle, but it's what you do in an MMO. At least they're not deer:
---
https://youtu.be/dAxZVZgpmI0
---
~19% of PS4 players have completed "Into the Fire", the first post Responder mission, looking at the PS4 trophy tables. There are over 100 quests, of which half are repeatable. The variety of those quests is substantial. So the endgame might be boring after 100 times, but (a) there's an insane amount of other things, and (b) ending the "reign of the scorchbeast" is what the entire game is building towards. 
---
When the waypoints in "Monster Mash" don't glitch, it's the most fun PvP I've had since Counterstrike back in HS. I think the claim they nerfed to make people play more is unsubstantiated, as there are alternative explanations which give the developers more credit. I'm waiting for a stash limit &amp; vendor cap increase too. It's surely coming down the line. 
---
New content is delayed whilst the game is debugged, and from a brutal reality perspective, will probably be less frequent as a result of lower than expected sales decreasing the budget for new engineers. Chris Mayer called it in the NoClip doc "every plan is great until the first shot's fired". 
---
PvP server is end of this month, beginning of next, and if I had to guess the vault DLC will hit by Easter at the latest.
---
If you're looking for new things to do, RifleGaming has been publishing videos of unique loot locations (Morgantown is better than Whitespring for XP farming, and nuking the Fissure sites found on a wall in the Enclave Bunker spawns different legendaries, such as a  giant Fog Crawler, that aren't as epic as the SBQ but again, she's the plot. She killed everything whilst we were underground. There's more coming.
---
Pick up kingdom hearts 3 &amp; you'll get 40-50 hours. At launch, Fallout 76 had more than that. You can always play something else &amp; come back when the DLC launches, otherwise, find some new areas &amp; quests. Read some lore. I'm constantly struck at how much there is to do
---
My favorite post was the guy criticizing everyone who has beaten the game or sunk excessive hours into it in order to defend the game.
---
Because, clearly, the people who want to play are the issue. /s
---
Explosive just needs to be fixed damage, problem solved.... I want my demo expert damage back for my grenades D:
---
Have I proposed a position or point of view that is opposing to yours. No. I just asked a clarifying question of why be a member of a group if you don’t enjoy the game.
---
If you don’t want to answer the question. That’s perfectly fine. Don’t respond to me. Easy. 
---
You may not be able to steal individual items, but you can steal their resources. You get a wanted bounty if the door, purifier, or extractor is locked however. You can always steal their crops
---
Bethesda doesnt owe anyone transparency on their tools. Doing so would only make them more vulnerable to abuse by bad faith players and people would still claim their bullshit, “Nuh uh”s because we dont “know beth is telling the truth”. 
---
Every post I have seen claims the ban trigger was just “ordinary crafting”. So, I disagree thus was a waste of time or materials. 
---
Its what im writing across the forum being downvoted and called a crybaby.. .whats the point with enemies being sponges and IF the queen goes down rewards not worth the time you got to spend farming ammo
---
The last patch was kinda bullshit and turned a lot of people off of the game. 
---
TLDR: They heavily nerfed high-level builds and they made everything more tedious for lower levels. No free respec exists to deal with huge balance changes like this, leaving most players stranded.
---
I never got far enough to have max level White Knight and a TSE, but the patch hit me hard too. My main two weapons degrade so fast now that they don't last through a single encounter in a single area. I basically have to used looted weapons and ammo because enemies in mid-levels are bullet sponges, and the durability perks all got nerfed into the ground. :/
---
As you head towards the Whitespring golf course, you'll see a gazebo to the right. On the left side of the gazebo as you enter, on the outer edge, there's a sulfur drinking fountain. Drinking it will cure your diseases for free.
---
I'm guessing a supply drop somehow managed to get inside. It flickers and makes smoke so that description matches
---
The only thing I'm predicting from survival is they will have it so killing a player will place a bounty on there head.
---
They will realise it's a bad idea than remove the bounty feature from players killing players.
---
Best is a lazy adjective, and ever skills never end a  sentence. I said I was generalising, but in retrospect should've said competitively.
---
It's certainly straightforward, intuitive, and fit for purpose (such as search icon for junk you want). 
---
My gaming group and I have stopped playing for about a month now, we played pretty much daily before that. Don't really miss it tbh, we'll probably be back at some point though.
---
Nail on the head. None of us are here to play titanfall or overwatch. We want to play fallout online. I have no idea what that's supposed to look like. Thought bethesda might know, but now I'm not so sure. 
---
I'm hopeful cause even after playing some other stuff, i end up thinking about fallout.
---
&gt; freely respec after a patch with a lot of changes
---
This should be the solution. This is standard in most "games as a service" games nowadays. Major rebalances mean that players get left stranded with broken builds.
---
Thanks bro
---
Because a 100% damage bonus is fucking insane. Most legendary effects cap off at 30% with majors restrictions and the ones that go higher require quasi suicidal sacrifices to health or dr. 
---
I went in guns blazing with my TSE shotgun and by the time I killed one glowing, I had 15 other ready to kill me. It took about 5 rounds per glowing and I ran out of shotty ammo. I'll be avoiding nukes till I find a better build.
---
The baggage auction would be awesome, especially if it's officiated by robots programmed for rare good auctions prewar, which say smarmy things about what we want to sell
---
100% agree.
---
yeah it becomes broken when people have full unyielding and they are going invisible and you can't see them and they one shot you before you can do anything.
---
We keep finding more and more bugs from the patch, it really was terrible
---
Grognacks ax’s no longer able to be repaired above 100%
---
Recon scopes working weird 
---
The worst thing about this game are the other players. womp womp
---
I went looking, but was unsuccessful 
---
Most rational thing I've ever read on the sub. 
---
While your endgame blues and hurt feelings over downvotes are inconsequential and irrelevant to most 76 players, BGS, and me, as a level 248 "time wasting slug," I'll still point out why you're completely off base.
---
The bugs, balance issues, and botched patches are Bethesda's fault. What isn't their fault is the stupid number of hours some of us have dumped into meta gaming and farming 76. No game should be designed for that kind of play or audience, which tends to be a bunch of implacable, entitled drama queens anyway.
---
Now I'm going to go spend some time with my family (people related to me who don't live in my computer). Tomorrow I'm going to start a new character and immerse myself in the journey like I should have from the start. While I'm enjoying all that, some entitled drama queens are going to downvote this comment and spend a lot of time angirly crafting witty retorts. All is well.
---
Heavy combat armor or heavy leather armor
---
Your comment is confusing because you keep referring to Alpha like it comes after Beta, but it does not. An Alpha build comes before a Beta build and is not something gamers usually see. But you're talking about Beta and the standard release (gold) right? A wipe between those? 
---
PA frames all spawn with a fusion core in them. If there isn't one then someone else took it first. 
---
You can also find fusion cores in fusion generators (rare since a couple of patches back), sitting in specific world spawn locations, in Annihilator bot corpses, ammo crates (rarely) and as boss loot. The Line in the Sand event will give you two fusion cores, and power plant workshops have a generator for them that makes 8 per hour.
---
you can buy this game brand new for $40. goes lower from there if bought anywhere used. if that's not low enough for you then you got bigger issues.
---
This is why the game will eventually go free to play whether they say so or not.  It may if go through a relaunch if and when it does.
---
why leather
---
Affirmative. **Suggestion:** Hack me, OP. I'm as armor as you can get.
---
lol tru dat
---
Great idea! Caps are useless on the market right now and this could hopefully change that
---
this is the cutest post ever.
---
While it has less DR the ER is disproportionately high. 
---
Yeah. TSEs are hardly the only balance issue this game has.
---
Molotovs are better than grenades for tagging and they don't accidentally blow bodies away. 
---
Single action revolver fires the .44 ammo yes
---
Yeah I really enjoy the Enclave story line and the realization that it's not the faction capable of saving Appalachia, it's the one who doomed it
---
Yeah stealth is broken post patch. 
---
Asking more if the .44 camo in the atom shop will work on it
---
My boyfriend and I are still playing, we just enjoy wandering around, doing missions and finding little funny things (two eight balls in a skull looking like crazy eyes!) 
---
This is how i noticed it died
---
 i had a 1030 cap bounty for 3 hours only a few tried to collect and i had to travel to people using my friend to spot.. To even try get a fight... all  50-100 players all easy kills... I see none of the vets still playing tbh and my friends list is jammed 
---
I think it’s heavy combat armor especially if you have the BOS plans to mod it and give it even more resistance. 
---
Leather gives you more energy resistance but I think the BOS heavy combat armor is better for most situations. 
---
Hmm, so the perfect vendorbot utopia if only us dwellers just stayed put.
---
thanks
---
yeah just blocks you and them on the map. What you want to do is. either block everyone on the server or all the friends in the area then you can remain invisible to them on the map .. you can then hide in bushes etc .. you can also block them if you on XB1 and report them, that way they won't be able be able to follow you to different servers.
---
yes a game about loneliness will definitely help you forget about her
---
Welcome to vault 76
---
I’m really hoping we get to actually rebuild the waste land and have it evolve around us. Also be cool to have to battle a Chinese power armoured invasion force 
---
This is why I stopped playing. Level 76 (haa).
---
No chat, so no community.
---
No end-game, so point playing.
---
No one to show my fancy-pants CAMPs off to besides Reddit.
---
Two friends bought this game to play together, they stopped before I did, I was here since 'BETA'.
---
Good idea
---
Its a painful gun. Have you tried the Western Revolver?
---
But really, no star isn’t really used by many. It’s just too easy to pick up legendary gear by doing runs at Whitespring or killing a queen.  
---
By all immediate accounts he was solo; however, once blocked my ability to see his interactions with others was gone.
---
But, for next time I'll keep this in mind.  Thank you.  
---
no its for what i want stars on
---
I don't think the player base is going to stay long enough for the bugs to be fixed. Let's face it, modders can finish Bethesda games considerably better and faster than Bethesda can. :/
---
this sounds so wholesome, would join you if it weren't for platform differences
---
Drink up, me hearties.  Yo ho!
---
No it doesn't
---
It only works on the .44 pistol
---
**Processing:**  LOL. L - Lots. O- Of. L- Lau-g-g-g-g-... ***ERROR!***  File corruption detected. *Overheats while trying to mimic LOL with vocal synthesizer* 
---
We honestly need a hub.
---
Piss on me. Beat me.
---
I participated in the last discussion and will restate that I'm beyond grateful for the work of mod authors who have transformed Fallout much for the better in the decade I've been playing. And I'm grateful for your good intentions backed up with hard work and real time spent on 76.
---
At this point, I suspect the team working on 76 is totally overwhelmed. You could save them a lot of time, but they ironically probably don't have the time to figure that out and wrap it into their workflow.
---
I hope you have the patience to stick around while they catch up working through countless bugs and bug reports; and I hope BGS has the thoughtfulness to eventially bring you and your work on board and give it the acknowledgement it's earned. 
---
100% damage bonus nearly triples damage to target because armor. Armor seems like it counts the damage of both shots combined, meaning even when one shot misses the other still does a very large amount of extra damage.
---
Low damage high attack rate weapons suck.
---
The armor system in this game dramatically favors burst damage to an almost comical degree.
---
The ratio of damage to armor determines final damage, and as all enemies have a ton of armor any weapon dealing less than 200 damage per shot is going to be heavily gimped in terms of damage, not 20, TWO HUNDRED is the critical mass where a weapon's damage starts taking a heavy drop against enemy armor, weapons like the minigun are straight terrible, having their damage reduced by a factor of around 7, while a super sledge in it's base form is dealing around a third of it's damage, but with perks can easily reach the point where it does the majority of the actual damage listed while the minigun almost crawls to 1/4.
---
I did the math, against 100 armor a gatling gun needs only 47 bullets to out-damage a minigun's full 500, that is how big a difference 79 damage makes against 14, a factor of 10.6 rounds to one for a damage difference of 7.5.
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage\_Resistance](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance)
---
There is a handy chart at the side that shows how shafted a low damage weapon gets, with a 25 damage weapon suffering a 70% loss of damage against a target where a 250 damage weapon only loses 30%, meaning the 25 damage weapon has to hit &gt;23 times to do the same damage, and a 10 damage weapon has to hit 80 times, dealing a theoretical 800 damage to match 250.
---
ALPHA is king
---
Edit, food for though, a high level super mutant has 178 armor, so when I say 100 armor, I'm talking mid game trash here or assuming you have decent armor piercing.
---
Armor needs a rework in this game, badly, or at the very least the devs need to understand what armor means for weapon balance. They give higher level enemies more and more armor like a second health bar, making them exponentially stronger and demanding higher and higher alpha strike damage to overcome these higher and higher resistances, if all guns did the same damage per shot this wouldn't matter, but there are weapons like the minigun that struggle against the armor of level 10 enemies but can't be acquired before level 35, as if it is supposed to scratch even lightly armored end game threats, lightly armored in this context being 100 or so armor on the shirtless scorched who are the lowest armor enemies at any particular level, super mutants approach 200 armor, and some of the top end enemies can close in on 300 armor at the top end. Remember, 14 armor is all that is needed to cut a minigun's damage in half, so even giving it 95% armor penetration wouldn't matter.
---
Then there are energy weapons, that don't get armor piercing, have lower alpha damage to compensate the fact that "most enemies are vulnerable to energy damage" as the devs seam to operate, in spite of the fact energy resistance across the board is HIGHER than physical, a honeybeast, which is "vulnerable" to fire and cryo (energy damage) has 132 armor, and 150 energy resistance, those super mutants with 178 armor, they have 300 energy resist. If energy weapons had double the damage output of their normal counterpart they would only be about the same, and in many cases still far worse. Remember, there is nor armor piercing for energy weapons.
---
If you took all the armor off a super mutant, and gave them 10x more hit points then a minigun would kill faster, while a super sledge would kill slower and both would end up about even.
---
The system also makes buffing weird, double a weapon's damage and you nearly quadruple it's effectiveness because you also end up halving armor, which is why explosives were so over the top powerful.
---
I'm going to keep posting this where appropriate until the devs respond that they are aware the way they give out armor makes weapons completely imbalanced.
---
It is a bit ironic, when news of the end game content for Anthem, included only three dungeons/raids, people are pissed. 
---
Meanwhile we have none and only an end game boss who is buggy, and rarely drops anything good! 
---
No I play mostly in 3rd person and I'm definitely higher than they are. 
---
Isn't this essentially what they've already announced?
---
It's referring to the .44 not all revolvers
---
yeah i guess the full version
---
Gotcha. Then yeah, you probably want heavy combat armor. And if you don’t have BOS plans, start trying to track those down now. 
---
You asked a dumb question as if that was a gotcha. I've had another guy try and pull the same bs with me a while back too.
---
I'm in this subreddit because I don't want TES:VI to be given the Fallout treatment. There's already enough problems with Skyrim and recently Bethesda have shown that they are beyond inept. Fallout 4 was hardly an RPG and 76 is a cluster-fuck. It has been a dumpster-fire. That's why I'm in a subreddit for a game I don't like. Because I'm over Bethesda's shit.
---
Are you on PS4? I'd love to do this
---
Yeah, I disconnected three times doing it including right at the final stage. You can skip right to the end if you know where to go, it will update when you get to the final transmitter. 
---
Ok now this is E P I C
---
Lul, ofcourse it is, the game hasn't had a significant update yet so people already finished with story or "endgame" and now wait for new content to come back.  
---
This is the same for every online game in the history of online games.  
---
I still see many players online, and actually even more people show up in events now.
---
Waiting for private servers so the modders can unfuck bethesda's mistakes.
---
Not in a roadmap if you want read through each patch note and see what they are doing and deduce that this is most likely whats gonna happen its more putting on Bethesda saying this in an official nice to read form. 
---
Ah ok.  Not really into server hopping so didn't notice this.
---
No u
---
I'm not a flamer user and don't care about flamers. But that's ridiculous!
---
Wow, I had no idea. Thank you!
---
Welcome to the MMO content cycle. People play until they run out of things to do, go away, come back when new content is added, and then go away again. It happens in literally every MMO, from WoW down to the lowliest indie game. It doesn't mean the game is dead, it's just how long term support for this kind of game works. 
---
It's been a bug since the beta, and they're addressing it in a future patch. 
---
Atm...its only been 3 months lol
---
Thank you for your honest reply.
---
As stated I asked a question as I was curious about why you were a member. It makes complete sense as to why you are.
---
You want to help in your own way to ensure the next game or games made by Bethesda are better and I agree with your motives.
---
I also want the future games to be better.
---
As for your other comments, not everyone here is trying to play the cool gotcha, make people out to be fools or similar as you have stated.
---
Some are just as committed to the game as you are to ensuring the future of Bethesda and their games are better. 
---
Game only been out 3 months...gotta give betesdha some time to fix it lol 😂😂😂
---
Got Marsupial at level 4 walking in the river collecting bloodleafs. Immediately lost it to radaway and had to buy it at level 80 since I never got it again. 
---
I had the same at the bottom of whitesprings near the enclave bunker. I was leaving my camp nearby to run to the enclave bunker when 3 lvl 80 scorchbeast just aggro me out of nowhere even though I'm not in power armor, crouched with 2 chameleon armor pieces and stealth perk 3 star. One of them was diseased too. I don't know if this is a bug or new random encounter, and their weren't any robots at the broken wall areas to help either, soloing them was such waste of ammo and stimpaks.
---
Cool!
---
Pretty sure the atom shop will soon have a repair kit for grogs axe for 3000 atoms
---
Yeah, whitesprings could be a hub, but its too heavily nuked and already has a lot of vendors already.
---
killed two 3\* legendary glowing ones in a nuked whitesprings today.  Both had no legendary drop.  I even went back after a couple minutes to check the fly patties. 
---
Yea I haven't noticed any drop in sever population either. I think most people who complain and say they are quiting now quit a long time ago.
---
Some NPC that are gathering material at the CAMP would be great. A limited income is fine like a ressource collector. A simple dice roll in the background and text dialogue would be enough for the result.
---
But nothing will happen. 
---
Well its the same I melee an enemy kill them in one shot and still get a disease somehow even though I don't notice them hitting me/ me losing hp.
---
Honestly something near 76 or the overseers camp. It's got all the basic necessities to make recipes and so on. It's a more calm place for the people fresh outta the vault who may just need a little advice and so on from the other players.
---
Ugh, Butcher Pete has been getting under my skin since FO3. And I was just thinking I should start listening to the radio in 76...
---
Fair enough then
---
Oh, that's owned by triforceofbacon.
---
Did you guys forget whatever bethesda has done so far? Their released customer info due on their ticket system. Why would a company do that to paying customers? No other reason other than they messed up. And thr are other occurances that i am sure you know of. 
---
And again this time they provided no evidence to proof that they really did ban only those that cheated. 
---
And they have had bugs on their games that existed for years and yet are still in this game. They are just a plain lazy company or badly managed company that needs to face the reality that this is what they are becoming. And until they face this fact they can't improve and ultimately they will fall. 
---
If you do not want this to happen then be critical and rational about this. Look on both sides of the coin. Thr are definitely liars that said they didn't cheat and got banned, but who's to say bethesda is definitely telling the truth on the other hand without proof. Bethesda's track record is not exactly a pristine one afterall. 
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT\_skmohD-c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT_skmohD-c)
---
Well, quite.  I still check the sub to see if any fixes of relevance have arrived but as yet, still playing fo4 at the moment.
---
I find fallout 76 like chicken nuggets.
---
most people buy chicken nuggets (Fallout 76), they eat them (play it) the move on to the fries (other games)
---
other people Buy the nuggets (fallout 76) and eat them slow (take their time), try them with various sauces (experience and explore slowly) maybe even save some for later (take their time and actually enjoy the game instead of rushing to the end)
---
Yeah I had issue on PC where I fast traveled and a non legendary handmade was favorited and replaced my legendary one on the favorite wheel. Then was worried I lost that legendary like it got demoted or not, but it was still in my inventory favorited too, just got overridden on the favorite wheel. Try checking your inventory your items might be there just arranged weird.
---
What do you mean "non ingredients"? What do you think gives that characteristic crunch??
---
"Now with 80% of your daily legendary effects"
---
Lol it still does? I sent a ticket on this last year near launch and they said they would tell the devs and work on it, that is why I never touch that event ever.
---
The trashcan outside super duper mart, too. 
---
Yes, pre-patch I broke down combat armor helmets and learned it that way.
---
Yeah I just want to be able to go inside and out the vault since its decorated a lot and we have no access to any vaults at the moment.
---
Heavy Combat armor has highest ballistic which is the most useful. Heavy Leather armor has highest energy which doesn't come up much. Trapper armor has highest radiation which is only slightly useful unless you're forcing a reg armor nuke zone build
---
During the event you have to gather ingredients to load into the hopper. When i say 'non ingredient' i mean every item except those ingredients specific to the event.
---
? (at the moment) it doesn't work . I don't understand the lol
---
I hate it the same way you do. The sound it makes is also unpleasant.
---
Yeah I know dude, it was a joke. 
---
Its still a thing unfortunately
---
So much stuff they break or never fix in the game even though its been 3 months and should be fixed . It was meant as a joke 😁
---
Thanks for the feedback! Glad they will work it out eventualy
---
We just migrated to /r/fo76filthycasual
---
I went back to 4 and having a real blast.  Decided to do a challenge where you have to keep one stat at 1 point.  In my case intellect, lol.  It's amusing.
---
I completely agree... I’ve scrapped my camp over and over and been just rebuilding from the ground up to spend the time. I don’t even know what to do anymore.
---
I find two useful:
---
troubleshooter for silos and Ghoul for whitesprings. 
---
Here here, I also play alone or with your wife. She's a very nice woman I must say, always there when I need help, until you log on that is.
---
Figures. Yet another reason for power armour.
---
I was just gonna blurt that out. Haha saw his video the other day! Then my husband stumbled across the mutant heads in the emmett mountain disposal 
---
Have you tried soap and water?
---
So, the Mistress of Mystery outfit is armor and not a costume? Because the tattered dress is a costume and yet it gives the player +1 PER.
---
Drills, syringers, clipboards... all legendary, it just works 
---
Aye aye. Me four!
---
I do the same with headshot from a silenced rifle.  It’s fun being a SOB (Sneaky Old Bastard)
---
Ok i m gonna ask THE question but eventually someone has to.
---
So you bought the plans, did you read them ?
---
Yeah. It's been happening to me today. I have to server hop to fix it. Then eventually it'll happen again.
---
There is a bug atm with bulk junk in that if you scrap all junk it scraps bulk too that isn't in the stash. Also, if you store all junk it stores mods  (prioritizes them) first then junk, so if your stash is full because of the mods, it doesn't store the junk.
---
Heavy Combat Armor
---
or if you want slightly lighter regular combat with BOS mod.
---
The BOS mod plans have been missing since patch.  
---
Maybe long arms like the long necks I keep seeing on dead scorched.  
---
It'll all be fine once the game gets out of BETA
---
Did you submit the tickets?
---
https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Category:Fallout_76_crafting_recipes_by_resource_used
---
Thank you for your reply. I tried turning off PS4 and then on. I tried moving the CAMP. But I couldn't enter the build mode.
---
Though the "BUILD" button is enable, it doesn't work at all.
---
I cannot fix it, so I am playing a new character...
---
&gt;Guess I'll hibernate until some content patch arrives
---
hope die last... lol...
---
&gt; I would suggest that you dont submit a novel of issues, submit one ticket per issue, make it clear and concise and leave all personal opinions and/or suggestions out of it.
---
100,000 times this.
---
Same thing happened to me earler when i was scrapping my plastic from watoga high school. I placed it in my stash, some people came in the station nesr the vendor then me, i exited my stash, then left to the watoga shopping plaza. And when i looked for my plastics they were gone. Also screws earlier i noticed which I've collected over 150 by scavenging and scrapping. Lol
---
Just another day in paradise, i guess.
---
As for example I am waiting till they will finally add content to the game as I did explore everything and made all quests, and not interested in endless grinding of 5 stars guns and armour, there are more enjoyable games for grind on the market.
---
I didn’t order that stuff. I barely bought the game. I’m just saying, they said it would be a canvas bag. They said leather jacket too. Both turned out to be false. So what do you mean ??
---
I played for a few hours recently and didn't see a single nuke launch. I thought they'd managed to break those again until I saw the map was very clear with only a few people on it. Personally, I cannot tolerate the incompetence any longer. I've said it a few times in other posts and I'll say it again here. This would barely be excusable for an early access title from a new developer. From a supposedly AAA developer with decades of experience on this engine it's unforgivable.
---
actualy the bethesda killed themself with this game and with the mentality how they handle their coustumers. cheats and lies. i really sure they never get my money again.
---
Well the MoM outfit is meant to be an armor, I think tattered dress is a holdover from Fo4
---
I honestly don't understand why they haven't made us invulnerable until we move on first logging in. Actually, never mind. Knowing how things get 'fixed' it would likely leave people invulnerable in some way and we'd see someone with a 1m caps bounty just because it's possible.
---
&gt; That kinda gets its attitude from the ~~1950’s~~ 1800's-2000's.
---
You think it's changed? We have oil companies that produced internal reports about global warming in the 1970's that are *still* funding denier organisations, we have Monsanto sitting on evidence that roundup was a carcinogen...
---
Nah, it's not dead. It's just that the complainers are so noisy I don't even want to read / post.
---
https://imgur.com/a/fKpzXPc
---
Can't deny it is a beautiful spot.
---
Its a conspiracy to not give us free atoms, its a alpha test for them to see if players notice/care/complain/riot to the point most of the challenges will be broken/reduced to the point if you want something new/limited time you will have to save like crazy and can only afford 1 item a year or spend real $ lol.
---
Put it back at 100% extra damage but also make it use a second bullet. For such a huge damage boost it should have a fairly significant drawback and that is the easiest to accomplish. Right now we have a weapon with a perk of "Two Shot" which is actually "One-Point-Two Shot". 
---
I'm just playing the Anthem open demo, I'll be back lol
---
Also do you scroll to the right in the bed selections?
---
have you found it? i'd really be interested in fixing this and rebuild my CAMP
---
but... they got their money, and peoples stoped play nothing to force them to doit.. btw its planed, this is why they don't sale on steam.
---
They are giving it away in Germany, apparently. Might be time for a rooooaaad triiiiip!
---
They meant that they would rather not be in-game at all until everything was fully loaded, but okay...
---
Name is laser gun. One of them you can swap from pistol to rifle with a grip change. Like plasma gun and pipe weapons. Think I seen it in the vendors on East side of map . BOS, free states dude and Watoga station.
---
Pistol reduction perks is under agility and there is a melee weapon perk card that also gives faster swing speed under strength. There is a heavy weapon perk card reduction that makes like 40 weight missile launcher weigh around 4. For me the only weapons that I don't think we can reduce are assault rifles, snipers, and throwables.
---
Don't forget when TSE got nerf the TSE pistols became trash, rip all the 10mm ammo saved.
---
&gt; fo76 has the ~~worst~~ soundtrack
---
Best.
---
I had the same happen to me today mate, they destroyed my extractors and workshop base. PVP’d them first time and lost some
---
Junk. so I decided to ignore them and let them demolish my base to save resources. I kept waving hello and confused emoji. They kept hitting me doing no real damage. I was booking airline tickets whilst I was ignoring them. Multi tasking :) Was funny how some people have got nothing to do.... I booked my tickets. They left and I waited a few minutes then repaired everything....... then i was back up and running again.... one of the GT was ANTI HYPNO WEED.
---
Then 20 min later server crashed Bethesda!!
---
Advice like any bully just ignore them and when it make sense and you don’t have a chance to lose more than they do beat them back.....
---
dude why
---
Just hope they don't patch it since it makes it the most op costume in the game, kinda disappointed the Mistress of Mystery isn't a costume.
---
I've never played runescape :'( 
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.
---
Yup they would just have to fix the exiting the vault since that white circle beam of light looks awful.
---
The problem with this is the bot isn't marked essential so it can die and then you can't trade. So, if someone has the plague walker mutation they will kill it without noticing. 
---
Combine it with Mole Miner mascot head and get DR 1 to get the most op outfit in game
---
Maybe a few people will use those websites, but hopefully not many?
---
Yes this exactly would be a great add 
---
Could be. I got all the DLCs at once so for things like that I don't know exactly what DLC they came from. 
---
Yeah i remember being highly disappointed in the exiting of vault 76. A fucking joke compared to all those before it. Of course besides fallout new vegas. 
---
Yeah don't get me wrong, the trading forums in a part of are really great and have added a lot more fun and things to do. I just wish the feature was in game to make everyone's lives easier lol. The game feels like it needs something like that. 
---
Also remember that a TS weapon has twice the durability wear
---
I think you misinterpreted my post. This is exactly what I meant by waiting 30 seconds. I meant waiting on a load screen so you didn’t pop in before everything loaded in and be completely vulnerable. 
---
And not everybody relies on social medias to decide what to and not to play. 
---
I'm not going to downvote, since your experience is valid to you. I don't have any problems with stash or carry weight, and here's what that looks like:
---
Carry weight currently 130/210. 
---
I don't use any weight reduction perks except Skeet Shooter, which I took for the reduced weapon spread. 
---
On me, I have my weapons : 2 x combat shotgun (1 prime and 1 regular), 1 x blackpowder pistol, 1 x pipe revolver pistol. Armor: 3 x leather pocketed/deep pocketed and 2 x marine pocketed. 
---
I carry 20 stimpaks, and only a handful (&lt;10) of Rad-X and Radaway. I carry a couple of chems (psychobuff) and a few bottles of water. I don't usually carry food, I can find enough just playing. 
---
My stash is at 350/600, with a small stack of each material (50 or so). I also have some boiled water (50), and some stable flux (10 total + some hardened mass, high radiation fluids and glowing mass) 
---
I have 2 weapons stashed ( a 3* legendary pipe weapon, and All Rise) + a bunch of clothing. I have 2 power armor chassis stashed that I only ever use in nuke zones.
---
I'm also a Marsupial, and don't often use power armor. 
---
I honestly find playing lean to be a lot more fun, and I never have to manage my inventory in order to pick something else up. 
---
You right, but it would be great to consolidate all of the trading subs in the game itself and make everything more efficient
---
We get the worst of both though. We get the extra tacked on screen after the patch  and yet we still pop in half dead, no?  So no ones happy lol
---
I sometimes request lower level players so I can gift items and then go back to my business. I'd rather help out a lower level person by dropping them my excess plans or whatever than dump it somewhere that it's unlikely to be found. 
---
If you don't want to accept an invite then don't but perhaps try to think of those invites as part of the online gaming experience rather than an annoyance.
---
They'll never listen
---
What's the prize for that misc quest, anyway? Mine is still incomplete.
---
Thought I already paid the money for this basic database shit
---
True true... 
---
I like a lot of games. No game rules another one out. Rofl...
---
That was one of the first mods I got for Fallout 4, I miss it!
---
Even looking at things gives who rad worms these days.
---
A lot of the Fallout 76 player base follows the logic that if you have something such as a weapon, item, mod, outfit, perk or even a level beyond others and they do not you are therefore a cheater, duper or live in the game. It's nothing more than the politics of envy. If you think this is bad, you should hear and see some of the shit I get at Level 178 with a fully kitted out X-01 with Calibrated Shocks and a Jetpack all painted in the Tricentennial paint. Or the shit thrown my way when somebody tries to grief me in melee when I have Reactive Plates equipped and they kill themselves. Or when you have Action Boy and Marathoner fully ranked, unequip your weapon and you out-run them by sprinting away. Yep, all that means I cheat. The fact that I know how the game mechnics work and I got it all legit through playing only casually since the B.E.T.A. (I've clocked 230 hours in the game in the 15,288 hours since I got it) simply cannot be possible can it?
---
And people defend the idea of an Atom Shop because 'cosmetics don't matter'...
---
Solid advise, thank you.
---
that or playing kh3
---
Yes I read them.  And I understand there are people out there that you do have to ask that of.
---
ew why
---
They really need to just let us build anywhere. 
---
Caps have value to people who don';t have them. And they have no value to people who have max. What's the point? Just remove the free cap you get from Nuka-Cola. Done. Nobody even drinks enough or cares enough about that 1 cap you get every so often anyway.
---
Like I said, one of the beds show up in the selection but it's locked.  Would it help if I post pictures?
---
Another good question would be, once learned, where do you find "Resorts Signs" in the build menu?
---
If someone is still looking for this, and will stumble upon this thread, the plan **DOES** exist, an is located in "Drop Site C2" (North-east from Watoga).
---
[Proof](https://i.imgur.com/grWiVMb.png).
---
Yeah that's what I'm saying, rifles seem not to have one yet the others do
---
It's been dead on arrival
---
Hope they have assaultrons.
---
Had it happen during a census violence event. Luckily the census bot had no issues with hitting and killing the bugged dogs. 
---
Doesn't Nuka World have slaves?
---
It really depends on what you are wanting to fight, 
---
Heavy metal/raider has the highest dr in the game but not that great energy resist, combat has balanced damage and energy resist, trapper has the same damage and rad resist but about half on energy, heavy leather has very high energy resist,  and lower damage resist. Marine is ok, but In my opinion it's kinda garbage.  But it depends on you.
---
Always put dense on your torso,  to protect against explosions and scorched beast screams 
---
no, you are being a dick. Hunter/Hunted is how you engage pvp without being a dick.
---
Um, I thought they have to actually hit the mobs, not just their turrets...
---
You would be surprised at how many people do spam drink these to build caps, but yes removing the free caps would work too.
---
The song "Good Neighbor" by Magnolia sort of implies that she is a prostitute on the side.
---
If they would do that they would indirectly admit that they messed it up. How many companies do you know that would do that?
---
They did not hit anything but they did level up. 
---
Thing I don't get about stealth other then scorchbeast just ignoring your stealth build and finding you instant even though your crouch not moving and invisible because of chameleon, is that say a ghoul found you and your in danger because of that but the super mutants didn't, if you shoot the super mutants it doesn't give you the stealth shot bonus because of the ghoul, even though the ghouls and super mutants kill each other.
---
Truth. PC here and I'm not just sick of this but also they re-introduced the issue where I have to log-in to [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) when I start the game despite having to be logged in to launch the game through the damn launcher they made me use.
---
Yeah. I wasn’t really fretting about being just a floating head, I was annoyed that I was popping into a map and being vulnerable to damage before my character has arms to even hold a gun, or bring up my pipboy. It was geared towards vulnerability and unfairness, not just being pissy about having to look at a floating head. And the 2nd load screen doesn’t seem to do anything to help. 
---
Shotguns shoot 8x bullets they need a 8x damage buff to compensate clearly because that's how weapons work.

I was in your mate position today I have some GT if you want to teach em a lesson. Perhaps we should start a name and shame list. Below GT destroyed my shit and kept harassing me for an hr while I watched them beat me.

The second floor of top of the world is the idea hub place, it's been said before a lot of times.
---
I remember people on here lying about a hub before the game launched, they lied about a lot of stuff actually. I would love to see a hub and it makes sense lore wise too. Vault dwellers have always sought to rebuild and retake the wastes after emerging from the vaults. It wouldn’t make sense to play this game for a year or longer and never have made an impact on the game world. 
---
Stealth works fine, the issue is stealth boys are hot garbage. They barely give a stealth multiplyer and scorchbeasts have stupid high ability to detect you even with 30 agility and stealth perks and gear I'm occasionally seen
---
Because he wants that damn mascot head!!
---
Yeh seems bgs is trying to monetize items already in the game by moving them into the atom shop. Absolutely f'd

Joined a fb group. Asked for Mr fuzzy token. 5 caps per token. Cleared the 450 in less then an hour. They be some salty ppl over not knowing how to get tokens w/o having to do the event everyday.
---
Also a little dumb for not knowing the mr fuzzy outfit vs the mole rat.  They have utube videos on how to get the mole rat w/o any issues. Easy.. 
---
Silly goose, this would require Bethesda admitting that they're incompetent!
---
Dude, get the game.  Its awesome. You will love it
---
The Bethesda's way to solve this problem: nerf the dragon dmg to 5
---
I agree with you.  I didn’t mean to imply that was your quote or anything.  I just remember when it was first patched to add the extra screen, that quote was a common sentiment.  And before that a common complaint. 
---
But in reality the extra screen does nothing like you said and in fact we end up vulnerable in that time frame.  Bad communication on my part, I’m sorry I dragged us into this. 😁 
---

With the coming Survival Mode, we're unsure if we'll be able to use our characters or not. Whats the point in playing now if we may have to start again soon?
---
As long as there's no real money way to gdt caps, I see no problem with some poker
---
20 caps
---
when you always "play" into high populated servers how can the game die? 
---
To get exp a player needs to hit an enemy. If a turret killed an enemy no exp will be given st all unless the uh where damaged by a player.

ping gets bad i dunno why. 
---
That sub is reaching star citizen levels of cult like behaviour. It's not unlike the people in we happy few. I just would like to know what you guys are smoking. Cause I want some.
---
Really? All I ever see on here is people complaining about the end game
---
I've personally decided to sit out until they put out some playable content. I've done five playthroughs on all different builds, dove deep into all of the lore behind the vast majority of the locations, pretty much got my kicks long story short.
---
I'll probably peep out when their survival mode launches, which i can't see providing too much replayability, but may prove entertaining for a week or two.
---
This game is a hot mess, but i got my money's worth technically so I'm not too salty. My expectations weren't too high coming into this as i knew the game was moreorless a cash grab.
---
P.S. 500+ hours gameplay and no tse legendary. How do you bois do this?
---
Fully with you on this and im no where near end game, for the game to last there needs to be end game content set at certain levels so what we have now would stay, then there would be content aimed at say levels 150-200, 200-250, 250+ and when enough % of players are getting close to 300, more is added. - this is not to say that lower level players couldnt "take part" but the content itself would need a very high level player(s) to complete it.
---
The lack if radio plays is borderline unforgivable. I have it. I downloaded the atomic radio mod for fallout 4 and it drives me crazy there's no lore sprinkled into the radio. Just make 10 second robco commercials and shit.
---
 They should just hire some writer to crank out a cheesy ass radio play

But anyone with that amount of colas is soon to be banned, they brought out the ban hammer for any account the find with  hundred of thousands of one item. Also they introduced that if your total weight limit is above 1500 plus your system carry weight then you can't get caps or pick up or trade any item untill you come under the weight limit.
---
rad worms means better aid and all player effects. 
---
without you loose everything... 
---
I don’t have the time and the will to redo my perks to be able to play the game and not run out of ammo at the first supermutant I encounter. It‘s just not fun. Reinstalled FO4, modded it, had a blast.
---
Wit?
---
Look away look back. Takes a millisecond.
---
But agree 
---
Immm a ghhooosssttt
---
Is say most people do lol
---
Dude fuck yeah.
---
Depends what the threshold amount is for banning really. As for the latest patch im pretty sure you can still drink them for caps even when over the max weight limit (so I've been told) but I may be wrong.
---
He's looking out for ya.

There is a third type too. People that ordered 60.dollars worth of tendies and received a kick in the nuts. So they washed their hands of it.

They can spawn at max level granted they spawn from the Charred Ghouls (60+).
---
Dont accept the insult friend ots not worth the energy

I feel the same way about No Mans Sky and Star Wars Galaxies also. It's like someone or some group somewhere don't want to let a perfect game exist.

The launch trailer was great, it was the only trailer I didn’t skip each time it came up on YouTube vids lol
---
I don't know about stealth working fine.
---
I have Chameleon armor and all the stealth perks.
---
Before this patch, when I crouched I was "HIDDEN".
---
Now, I am constantly in "CAUTION".  Even with nothing near me.
---
The announcement of a PvP mode was when it became clear they have no idea what they 'are doing. To think of all the time they are wasting on a mode that doesn't even sound fun. 
---
Enjoy whatever you want, more power to you, have fun, but just because someone else doesn't, doesn't mean they're automatically "toxic".
---
Actually, those creatures are all alive when you go in. You must have gone through just after me.
---
And as it happens, I have actually changed a bulb with my teeth. No biggie.
---
Resort signs is literally one sign, and you need to have unlocked metal signs to use it. 
---
Vault Tec bed 1 and 2 are the clean metal and military style bed with sheets. 
---
Survival mode is not going to be a very big selling point, it’s just something cheap they can throw out. New content might bring a lot of players back to the game provided they also make big steps in improving stability before it releases. They have a long way to go but they will get there eventually. It looks like they may have finally gotten the bleeding to stop but we’ll have to see the next patch before making a verdict on that. 
---
We know about Mistress of Mystery's dialogue, though.
---
Not my experience, launched two nukes today and had a third of the server on them (Whitesprings) 
---
I am personally waiting for more endgame content
---
Both my stealth melee and sniper are working fine, I've heard this before so I think it may be on a case by case basis as it's still working for most people from what I can tell.
---
ok. let me sit an hour on 2 out of 4 and then server hop and do it all again so u could be satisfied. 
---
Dick or not, claiming factories exposes u too pvp. It says it write when u claim it. So stop being a snow flake.
---
No, you may rest assured that not everybody has quit.
---
Remember. It is impossible to satisfy everyone. But I think it is possible to dissatisfy everyone. 
---
I only log to help my friend level or craft his next level weapons .... the grind has been insane for him coming in after all the nerfs. Then we mostly move around mostly in crouch hidden position due to the pathetic saps who like to pvp low players who are with high players...making it hard to keep new players in the game. 
---
What system are you on?
---
😂 God why am I not surprised 😂
---
after all the recent updates that have had tiney effects on weight and alot of work on my part (you know because all good games require work...) and i have got down to 650/205. I can now pick up several weapons before becoming OVER-over encumbered, and honestly, I keep so little, I'm not even wearing a full set of armour because it not worth the effort or repairing things &gt;&lt;
---
Well I would play the game but since last patch game is crashin after max 3 minutes upon loading into the server so.. Im not even quiet able to play.  
---
There is no response on bgs forum about this, and i've seen A LOT of people having this same issue post patch. 
---
Yeah, that and accidental bounties makes electrically charged much less desirable
---
I was referencing the fact that New Vegas's monorail was actually a hat worn by an NPC running really fast ;)
---
anthem and division 2 around the corner
---
I've quit. Bored of the game now, no new content. 
---
I havn't played in over two weeks or something
---
IDK i think if they nail the survival system when it fully releases it would provide a bog upswing since being able to watch player interaction in a survival game brings in twitch views 
---
You have to server hop. His friends can still see you, and your workshops on the map are marked as being owned by you. 
---
It doesn't look like it does. ;( 
---
My favourite is when you get DC as you land b4 you can move
---
Lol i've sold that for 2 caps at vendor. 
---
Then the question should have been who are we trying to market this game to.
---
Anthem does play well ... just waiting for full release
---
Ok..hear me out, in the wotonga high school there is a theater, how about we put on a play...with music....and guns? &gt;&lt;
---
I think, like most MMOs, the player base is reaching the point of endgame.  From what I've seen in most games this will mean a loss in player base until a new expansion drops.  Honestly I think that a new expansion will do this game very well in that it will add new content and deliver on a promise pre-launch.  New content has been a guaranteed way to renew the player base, but a promise delivered is another bonus on top of that.
---
Not a bad idea. Can we put one of Overseer Barstow’s slot machines in our camp?  Would be a real money maker. 
---
What they really need more than anything is to look into the effect of armor on damage, and the bias towards weapons with high burst damage being heavily favored over weapons with low alpha damage. Beyond that they need to really stop treating armor like an extra health bar and just upping the armor on high level versions of creatures for no reason.
---
I have only one complaint here which is stealth being still bugged - attacking monster that is in combat with other creature or player causes it to insta heal the bonus damage you get from stealth.   
---
It was in BETA and it still exists in the game. To be entirely sure about this i have created a new character having level one and it also had this bug.
---
This is actually hilarious 
---
I haven’t. Assumed it loaded like a Vaquero, which made it a complete non-starter for me. 
---
I love this response,
---
 just the picture of a guy going to McDonald's and ordering 5 20 piece nuggets. As he stands at the counter waiting, he is approached by a greasy uninterested teenager with an empty tray. He, without saying a word, kicks him in the nuts and walks away.

 it make me spit pepsi out my nose.
---
If you choose the perk card where you get a chance to find extra chems in chem boxes (by hitting the y button) you'll start collecting a ton antibiotics and cure disease.  Before that, I had to run around and find all the plants to make the forest cure because I was always getting disseases but now I have to sell the extra off.
---
Thumbs up^^^
---
Were you wanted?  Other players wouldn’t appear if you were wanted. 
---
Other than that, maybe you got loaded into a test server or something (though even typing that I’m almost laughing. As if Bethesda does tests). 
---
I know that cures but does it recent that's what I'm going to be using antibiotics for so try and stop myself from getting radworm to begin with.
---
&gt;  The hysteria is getting a little ridiculous here.

Increasing strength directly increases your carry weight and melee weapon damage, Endurance increases health, Charisma for shop prices, Agility for action points, Luck for critical generation, and Intelligence for  crafted item condition and scrapping. 
---
This is just amazing!
---
No wonder she left you, no money to afford a full price game, time to start working on your life man.
---
Didn’t play the beta, but it was there for workshops after launch.  Many of us who didn’t play the beta asked for it for our CAMPs too.  They were taken out of shops for some reason. Don’t know if they’ve been put back yet. 
---
I'm with you.
---
Yesterday I was looking for a more efficient way to get a good piece of armor or weapon and server hopped (about 60 times) for the 1-3 legendary mobs (sometimes 3 stars) that are in the Watoga medical center. The best thing I got were all the screws of the mutants that spawn there.
---
Not a single legendary of any use, most of them level 35 from level 60+ mobs (I am 66). Quite disappointing. Maybe there are better ways?
---
jesus if that happens goodbye to whats left of the playerbase
---
nah not yet hopefully they'll see this and put them back 
---
How did you build through the three? Everytime I try,  its allowing me to place down the foundation but no floors. :( I always end up with the perfekt    
---
ground plan and a hole in my "roof"...
---
lmao 
---
LOL. I put a long barrel and a ... I think Pure, receiver on it. There are 2 with the high number and mine is 98 right now. As well a Reflex sight.
---
 I can head shot ghouls out to ridiculous distances and that receiver enhances hip shots. I shoot bugs out of the air all the time. 
---
 Best Pistol, no question. The only thing it lacks is Armor Piercing.
---
Fallout with the Fallout. 
---
A musical extravaganza telling the tale of an ambitious game trying to make it big, while attempting to stay one step ahead of a horde of angry gamers. 
---
Man it's so frustrating. I know West Tec usually has a few multi star legendary mutants but I haven't been able to get anything worth keeping from them either. 
---
Just drop stuff like that in the overseers caches. Eventually someone will come across them and take them. 
---
If you approach the rarely spawning wendigo at the second floor of the Watoga medical center the wrong way and cant kill it quickly enough, it often runs up the stairs, through the door and nowhere to be found :-)
---
At this point you don't know whether they coded this possibility into the game or it it just a bug.
---
That’s fair, my bad. 
---
Yep. I built my X-01 armour just to use up my scrap and collected X-01 mods. 
---
Never wear it though. 
---
My normal armour and excavator let me carry way more weapons (even with calibrated shocks on my x01). 
---
From a PvE standpoint, sure or maybe.  From a PvP standpoint, two-shot needs to be nerfed as it becomes a **mandatory** trait and further adds to the 1-shot meta, which isn't fun in any game.  Keep in mind they're working on that new PvP mode coming out, whether you like it or not.
---
I still think two-shot should be nerfed because it's clearly substantially better than any other affix, even just for PvE.  This isn't the type of game, esp with the insane weapon variety, where there should be must-have and must-not have legendary trait affixes, so this is a step in the right direction.  Maybe it was nerfed too much though, most likely because of how over-duped these items were.  I'd argue though that the abysmal rate of getting a usable legendary contributed to duping being so popular.  It's pretty much impossible to get *usable* weapon much less one for the build you're playing.
---
Heavy metal armor has the highest damage resistance, and as 95% of all damage dealt in this game is physical that is what is important. Robot armor is second, followed by combat and marine.
---
The only major energy attackers you will run into are liberators, assaultrons whose melee is physical and thus depends on whether they decide to laser spam or not. Super mutants, who 20% of the time spawn with lasers. And rarely Mr Gutsy bots, who sometimes spawn with lasers. The biggest connected factor is that these enemies don't rely on energy weapons to do most of their damage most of the time, so energy resist isn't as needed. By contrast the only enemy that doesn't deal physical damage are laser turrets.
---
There are other reasons to take other armors though.
---
Wood armor is actually really good, good physical resist, and you can get the shrouded mod that increases stealth speed and reduces weight and detection, meaning you get decent armor with strong stealth benefits for next to no weight. While the better armors all get very heavy, with the exception of ultra-light marine armor, which is probably your best defense/weight armor in the game, and theory says it has extra base rad resistance, but because reasons rad resist isn't useful on normal armor.
---
Reason being that power armor and hazmat suits have a hidden multiplier that reduces radiation by a major factor, 4 and 8 if my memory serves, which means they have much higher radiation resistance than stated, and to match a "1000" radiation resistance hazmat suit takes some crazy 10000 rad resist, I will see if I can find the thread discussing that. But yeah, rad resist on armor isn't important, if it even works.
---
Hahahah yes, that's why.
---
Their gun break immediately after first reload and their pa or armour also broken due to there is no desktop fan in the dungeon
---
Damn. Only other ways I see of getting them is via crafting which requires a nuke, and that one workshop site that you can farm them from (costs 100 energy though so that's not happening).
---
It could have been someone's alt, but he could have been more civil about it.
---
The ability to perch enemies at will wasn't strong enough?  It's more or less server lag causing this though.  This ability couldn't be much stronger though, it's an awkward thing to complain about.  Just jump on top of any nearby object and the AI will completely break and you can shoot them as you like.  Somehow that's not enough.
---
I have no argument.
---
You're supposed to pretend.
---
It's not like this is an interactive environment that, with the proper design, could allow the players to experience the kinds of situations they tell us about. "It was an epic battle!" you're told as you fuck off to grind for screws.
---
Which part?
---
If PVP was remotely balanced or even fun this wouldn't be an issue. So, stop being an asshole
---
You're good
---
Reflected damage is dealt back full, not as slap damage. 
---
Why? It still throws you into the world if your camp can't be placed.
---
A rifle for every occasion!
---
Yea. I was lioke okay, they will finally add some content, features to the game or w/e as they said it would happen in december. But this.. This is laughable. 
---
I dont mind nerfs but that just feels like "oh, lets nerf weapons so SBQ will become harder and they will spend more time killing her resulting in better end game content. They should be happy we implement those changes!".   
---
We didnt get vendortrons, new locations, bosses nor anything. 1 bug fix with new 3 bugs in the place of fixed ones.
---
Weird day
---
I'm not seeing this at all. I applied non-auto rifle perk cards and the non-auto pistol perks, and it appears the pipe rifle is only being affected by the rifle perk cards. Where are you seeing that the pipe rifles are also affected by non-auto pistol perk cards?

---
&gt;Power Armor frame has a hidden perk that applies magical effect 'mod incoming spell magnitude' 'multiply actor value' 'power armor rad resist mult' '1.00' (only applied to rad damage, dunno what this does being 1.00 multiply... maybe it adds 1 to the mult so cuts rad damage in half (before armor), need to check data to see if that works...)  
---
&gt;need to see what the rads/sec is in an empty frame in a nuke zone (with no other rad resist besides the frame) See if it is 11.64/sec...  
---
&gt;hazmat suit should be 0.514 or 0.6 rads/sec from nuke zone depending on if they capped damage reduction from armor at 95% (like in fallout 4) or not...  
---
&gt;To get to 95% damage reduction from armor without power armor/hazmat suit you would need \~32780 rad resist (to get to 3rad/sec) in the nuke zone
---
Ok not 10000, 
---
32780
---
SO yeah, rad resist on marine armor, it's not very relevant.
---
No more spawning in the river!
---
Have they added any new content to the game? New areas or things like that? I pretty much had nothing to do after hitting max level week 1 and haven't touched the game since.
---
I don't get why people get so triggered by people posting why they quit. Who forces you to read it?
---
That can't possibly be true but I'm not informed or well spoken enough to dispute it.
---
I never realised until now that I've never seen a player use a laser rifle. Huh, guess this was why
---
 I have BOS Heavy Combat with Dense on the Chest and Strengthened on the limbs. The level 50 set has slightly better numbers than my level 35 Excavator set. No real Rad Resistance though. With the Dense Chest I can put a 40mm into the ground at my feet and suffer basically no damage. I do have some Endurance Perks mixed into that.
---
 Its just wonderful stuff.
---
I also have difficulties with the stash size. I want to have space for about 10 weapons in the stash were I'm not sure about whether I need some in some future time or if the new one is on par (you never know what gets nerfed/buffed with a sledgehammer) or if I want to try out another build later on.
---
As a rifleman things break quite freuqnetly and I often lack of springs and other ressoures. All I have in the stash are bare resources, no other shiny things, not even ammo for alternative weapons or to share with other people.
---
That's why this game is in desperate need of a chat function, even if it's a proximity chat
---
Agreed. Been at full stash weight for like 40 levels...
---
&gt;I still have hope for the franchise
---
Nothing changed for the franchise. It's just a failed outsourced project. Just like Borderlands The Pre-Sequel.
---
Gotta be fixed... ghouls arms are NOT that long

Get it from cdkeys, 13 bucks
---
It means jack shit you goddamn imbecile.
---
I think a weight-reducing perk would defeat the purpose of Weightless mod on legendary weapons
---
No no no! There were desktop fans all over the place. They used them to repair their miniguns 5x before their armor broke and they died. Sheesh. Get it right why don't you.
---
That happened to me too and I was so confused 
---
Profer the swimsuit mate?
---
I haven't played in a week or two. What are they doing for survival mode? The vame already has too many survival elements for my taste.
---
The pre sequel failed? I thought it was just lack luster.
---
WHAT are you talking about? Like are you trying to place an entire blueprinted building? Or foundations aren't placing. 
---
Doing an entire blueprint is nearly impossible unless your blueprint is fairly small 
---
And Metro! 
---
Don't know who thinks it's easy to get Max caps I've never even hit 10k yet and I've been playing since launch.

The group i play with set something like this up. One guy had a boxing ring with a stage and seating for the audience. I set up a cage tricked out with punji traps and audience controlled flamethrowers. I had planned to set up a dueling stage. 
---
We managed to build pretty close to each other, but you still had to take a short walk to get to one of the other bases. 
---
There is potential here. It just hasn't been tapped yet.

You are honestly my favourite account on reddit

you can get 1400 a day from vendors and if you do any trading at all with other players you will find it's rather easy

Bethesda, did you learn nothing from rushing Fallout 76 to market?  
---
Never, NEVER BE IN A RUSH.  When you rush you make mistakes (everyone does, not just you Bethesda)
---
Take time to make sure the job is done right. Measure twice, cut once, insert your favorite cliché here.
---
To the development team or bug squashing team.  Grow a pair, stand up to Zenimax greed mongers breathing down your necks.  Your work ensures future profits for everyone on your team.  Short sighted, short term profit driven rush/panic knee jerk reactions must not get in your way in fixing this game. 
---
Middle managers, Shield you team from the CORPORATE B.S.  Let them focus on methodical, careful fixes.  TSE nerf could have been implemented a week later, again don’t rush and let mistakes end the game.
---
Gotcha

No slap damage for PvP. You see someone?  Your first shot is full damage whether they know you’re there or not. Won’t have anyone but griefers playing most likely since it sounds like they aren’t going to require new characters.

How to be a good Team Sniper.

2. Draw Sledgehammer

I tried, but, like you said, it was the same as walking into a wall.
---
I guess I'll just... Not finish? Maybe I'll start over in about a year, give Bethesda time to polish the game a bit. In the mean time, I'll play through 3, New Vegas and 4 again, that might take up enough time lmao
---
Thank you I didn’t know most of this
---
&gt;Events to actually be rewarding by providing players with useful buffs or effects that incentivize replaying them on a regular bases.
---
Hm without reworking them? Currently you wait ages for the enemies to arrive, if at all. Most of the time their stuck somewhere and you have to go play hide and seek.
---
I defended the huge excavator with a friend and the pathfinding was a nightmare. Robots clipped inside things, robots drawing circles right before the stairs.. and good luck if you get a scorchbeast that doesn't land. They'll just fight themselves forever.

It has been somewhat fixed.... Chances are one item in your camp is the issue... wether its a crafting station too close to a wall (for example sometimes you can place a wall then an item next to it, but if the item is already there then the wall wont be placed), wall decoration that hasn't clipped correctly... I refer to an old post that still seems to hold true in most cases: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9z736u/camp\_bugs\_and\_how\_to\_work\_around\_floating\_green/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9z736u/camp_bugs_and_how_to_work_around_floating_green/)

I dunno why everyone cries about heavy gunner being weak ... I think my sniper is much more worse. Leveling with Gauss/Lever is a pain in Golf Club. I switched to Handmade and burn so much ammo now, it's ridiculous. Demolition Expert is such a joke ... Gauss dmg without Perk: 273 ; Gauss dmg with lvl 5 Perk: 300 .... that difference is almost not worth those 5 perk points...

What about all other weaps having weight reduction effects.

the bounty system if they honestly thought it would be good to implement that from the start would be stupid. IMO
---
What about them?
---
Sounds like a moron to me...could have been nicer if you ask me.
---
Yep. Waiting till they fix it. 
---
That's a dev room item
---
That’s a nonsense argument for 2 reasons. 
---
1). The “weightless” effect is broke, only applying to the base weapon, not mods. IIRC my weightless minigun weighs 8lb before Bear Arms. 
---
2). The chances of finding a good one are rare and every other weapon class has a weight reduction perk set.  Shotguns even get a reload buff with their weight reduction perks. 
---
Basically if its hard to place in the first place and you have to move around to get something green, then its seems that will give you trouble later when moving ( better to separate your crafting area and your living area and your eating area into smaller sections that place easier later)
---
Well, if Iguana bits are made of people, why shouldn't board games?
---
 Don't scrap it, you will learn the plan.
---
It comes from the dev room, simply drop it or you could risk a ban
---
I found one in a bag while farming whitespring 
---
Would you prefer a sledgehammer or a fire axe?
---
Scarp it, craft them, and drop them all over. They can't ban everyone.
---
I literally went to that cabin yesterday to pick that outfit up. Pretty dick move of the guy to call you a cheater for being too ignorant on how to actually get the outfit. 
---
This has happened to me, too. Not with the same items, but I’ll learn a plan and then go to build and it’s not available. What was happening to me for a bit was I was buying plans, learning them, building things and then I’d move my camp, and I didn’t know certain plans that I had previously bought and learned suddenly.
---
When we all lived in the vault we were all living harmoniously with each other right up until reclamation day when we all ventured out into the wasteland in awe, full of hope for a new future and with a wasteland plentiful in food, water and crafting materials there was no need to come to blows with those that were once our friends, neighbours and fellow vault dwellers, then enters Vault Tec, “hmm” they say, “how can we drive our vault guinea pigs to the edge of human endurance so much so they become pathological killers and set upon each other in PVP?” lol 😂
---
They can screw up the best of ideas from what I've seen so far so it wouldnt suprise me.
---
And if they are just copy pasting the whole thing from the main game and just removing the slap damage. It will stay there.
---
The bounty system will still be present because they have said that you get double bounty rewards in this new mode. I just hope they fix it so it's only for destroying player camps. Or bounties that can be placed by other players. Like GTA has.
---
Was there anyine who actually wanted this? PVP sucks already in this game. Why introduce a new mode that adds nothing beneficial to the experience? 
---
There are definitely caps to be made in pvp. If you can get on a good streak, going against higher level players, you can make the daily vendor limit in no time. My record is 1600(ish) caps in one day. 
---
No, the people that enjoy the game are still just hiding away because anytime anything positive gets said we just get downvoted 
---
Okay, thanks. Gonna equip Aquaboy go to a middle of a river and drop it so no soul will pick it up
---
I somehow lost my Lvl50 t-60 torso w/ reactive plates.  If you find a lvl50 torso I would appreciate it.  
---
&gt;I dont use my mic, too much anxiety lol
---
He could have similar issues. I drop my duplicate plans/recipes, unwanted ammo and other helpful items into the tool box at the Overseer’s camp or one of the cash registers at train stations.
---
Can we up this so that the developers can see this? Having this annoying bug too. (PC)
---
Switchting server often doesn't help. SO frustrating.
---
If you want to be a traditional sniper and avoid fire and keep distance then id recommend getting all of the associated dmg perks for the rifle you have and then get nerd rage (intelligence), serendipity (luck), and all sneak related dmg perks (i.e. mr sandman/ninja).. this with a legendary bloodied silenced rifle will allow you to one shot a lot of enemies will avoiding most damage.... could pair well with legendary chameleon armor and chameleon mutation as well (you could potentially remain undetected in the heat of battle)
---
They have so many critical, most urgent issues and instead they are fixing some minor bugs nobody cares about. They are even highlighting it in their Into the Vault article. 
---
It really looks like devs simply do not play their own game.
---
Keep in mind this build works good while your under 30%hp and optimally while under 20%hp,  If you use this with a vats build you could probably take out a room of enemies as your team walk in
---
I can confirm that this is the best answer, so far. 18 screws at least in that room, I think it has an example of every junk that has a screw plus some containers include loose screws. The whole bog town seems to be pretty rich, the police station has handcuffs as well. 
---
Missing chat system. Run into the same situations from time to time.
---
I thought the bunker buster is a one time quest reward?
---
I don't think the enclave vendor has it unless somebody else sold his/hers on the server you are on.
---
Did you ever try it? Npc without range attack will simply hide until you get down. I tried this with ghouls in the golf club and a bus, tried this with deathclaw and a random building. NPCs know how to hide if they can't reach you.
---
Turns out they are so delucate most broke at the word "multiplayer"
---
If you say so I trade all the time not sell trade and I work so can't get on every day
---
Or equip Party Boy/Girl and have some fun.
---
We messed up one of their bases and took a couple of their workshops and scrapped their stuff lol
---
Pacifist does not stop one iota of damage to you, it just stops you from damaging others and thus starting PVP. 
---
I usually stuff all my extra junk/ammo/plans in a locker or trash can, didn't even think about the cash register.
---
Level design and easter eggs are bethesdas strong point, making the map fun and enjoyable is productive
---
It’s a terrible idea the way they are setting this up with plans costing a lot, I figured since it’s hard to grind and get mats to sell that that’s how these vendors are going to work in pvp, a cap reward paid by me that if I don’t have enough caps I get a debuff will fuck me but they wouldn’t be that stupid as to let the anti grief mechanic hurt the person being Griefed  
---
Try your best to not listen to the radio on this game too, the songs on that will have you weeping.
---
Yes I've tried it but it really depends where you're at.  The NPC pathing is better or worse in certain places.  It can also matter if there's other things or players for them to go aggro to - at the golf course there's likely something else they can go attack.  If there's nothing around they'll just stand still and let them shoot you till they're dead.  This can even happen on minor objects like I jumped on top of a knee-high fence and the Grafton monster lost all AI.
---
There's a big problem with how the game's servers function, I think a lot of the AI breaking has to do with how many people are playing etc.  The best experience I ever had with FO76 was one night when for whatever reason we get a server to ourselves for a few hours and everything in the game worked perfectly.  Later on people started to join and you could slowly see everything start to bug out and fail.  After seeing more in-depth analysis and reviews of the game I can't help but think so many of the flaws and bad design/decisions in the game were made solely due to server-performance related problems, like the carry weight, the bad AI, no NPCs even was probably due to the strain they put on the servers.
---
So at this point **right now** nobody is playing so I wouldn't be surprised if the AI worked well and if enemies actually did run off if you tried to perch them.  My experience was different and the servers becoming deserted and finally functioning properly after the community has more or less abandoned the game does not excuse it for it's previous failure to function.  That's the thing about gaming experiences, there's only so much they can do to fix the experiences people have already had, and fixing it after the fact only counts for so much.
---
That’s what I do
---
My record is 1400 lol
---
I guess the player base got “scorched”
---
But you do get new end game content, every week. Was the princess castle bed not good enough for you? Or The Unstoppables costumes, each basically priced at 8 dollars
---
Yeah. Honestly I quit around 2 months ago? I think?
---
I’m just lurking until I see the news that Bethesda pulls the game back into development like Square did with FFXIV.
---
Playing earlier there were 6 available to buy in Grafton. 300 caps each. Didn't buy. Don't wanna risk a ban. 
---
I play some as you. Not really ever on a team but I love dropping stuff for lower level players I happen to see. I straight up ran after a level five guy and he ran into a house and watched me from a window. I dropped aid and whatever I had for him. Mostly it became a goal to catch up with him because the dude wouldn't stop running and I found it hilarious trying to get ahead of him and throw out a wave or a heart so I could give him stuff. Probably freaked him out too. 
---
That threat was rude as hell. I want to say he's probably a new player, since if you're following a low level without hitting them you most likely want to give them stuff, as is a common rule of thumb. Maybe he'll learn that later and feel like a total asshole. Or maybe he'll slowly level up because he's always logging out because people are following him and he's suspicious. Who knows.
---
It’s the concentrated collective toxicity of all the r/fallout hate for 76.
---
PvP people are in general complete fuckwits, the PvP system in the game is worse than bullshit so you end up with this shit. They need to remove PvP completely from the adventure side of the game when they introduce survival mode so the normal wasteland explorers no longer have to put up with ftards rolling eBay duped weapons and 3k stacked bobbleheads ruining your day
---
maybe they let the fog crawlers and mirelurks go at it while the BOS hide inside a building... i may or may not do this.
---
They say Morgantown is good in a nuke zone
---
Is that not a result of the Internet connection you're using? I had terrible WiFi all of Jan and this happened constantly, then it got fixed and I haven't seen it since 
---
I’m not trying to say this kind of thing (scripting) can’t happen, it just seems like there are a lot of variables that we can’t factor in having not been there.
---
Were you watching them the majority of the 10 minutes?  Could they have fast traveled elsewhere if you weren’t around and fought stuff there?  Were they building base objects or crafting, which gives xp but isn’t alway visible to other players?  Did they participate in any events nearby that would give xp?  Did they seem to react to you if you were nearby, indicating they weren’t AFK at the wheel?  Were they simply firing once or twice to “tag” an enemy and it wasn’t noticed?
---
I hate cheaters/exploiters on mmo’s  as much as anyone, but something just doesn’t add up.  I’ve seen clusters of Sorcs with gibberish names on ESO auto-leveling at mob spawn points (to sell accounts online), but this seems different.
---
I've literally changed my character to look as much like the inspector as much as i can even found a legendary walking cane not long after to match, lol no RP just done it because i got the outfit if i knew any scripts she says i'd be doing down the mic sometimes for fun though
---
Stopped playing the game but stuck around in the sub in hopes it would be handle better in the coming months.
---
I think after the last patch people have finally had enough. They have done literally nothing but make it harder to level, harder to get loot, harder to maintain equipment, harder to carry crap around, to the point that the game, even when I still played, is just just a giant list of chores.
---
It has no replayability in it's current state. That was really obvious after I jumped off of my level 80 melee guy and spent three of my off days getting to level 20 solo on a new pistol character who spent her whole time starved for... Everything really. Ammo, aid, armor, not to.mention keeping it all on-level.
---
This was actually fun to just play when it came out but you can't just play anymore. You have to play the Bethesda way which is Grognak the barbarian.
---
I get where you're coming from but I'm hopeful. I think this game really misses any sense of danger. By adding that human element, the waste lands will finally feel like a a scary place. Those well known loot runs will become easy picking for raiders. Having someone to watch your back will become a hot commodity.  
---
Yeah, there'll be griefers, grinders, and casuals but that's what makes the world go round. 
---
Now my shameless wishlist. 
---
1.) Inventories do not carry over from Adventure. 
---
2.) Level and perks carry over from Adventure.
---
3.) No legendary effects on weapons and armor.
---
4.) The ability to form clans, and a quick way to determine someone's affiliation. 
---
No one cares who or what you respect....
---
If I deleted a comment in this thread it was because i double posted or meant to reply to another thread, that's all, nothing more.
---
Why would i remove comment's on reddit? I don't care what you or the other fanbois care or respect just for the record.
---
And what's so goofy about Bethesda trying to put things right with there customers? The patches don't work so why not refund everyone? They know as well as we do this is broken and wasn't fit for purpose at launch and unfortunately 3 months on it still isn't.
---
You get the most important thing to Bethesda is Customers yes? Without them there will only ever be increasingly rushed out games and worse product's than this.
---
That’s amazing =]
---
Absolute madlad
---
Sorry to keep adding but if you are doing a team build charisma of at least 3 is a must.... the ability to share cards is useful and appreciated by everyone in the team who's going to be taking the damage for you... Furthermore if you intend to use this build I recommend radicool perk (endurance), it takes one point of endurance and increases your strength by a max of 5 when irradiated (basically if you keep under 20-30%hp and you fill the rest with radiation it will increase your carry capacity and make melee weapons viable to even a player with low strength)
---
Note: if you use mutations (which I recommend) you NEED starched genes lvl 2 perk (luck) or else you can lose the mutation when using radaway... also only use rad-x diluted with mutations or else it will suppress them and make them useless for a few minutes.
---
PS: Marsupial mutation will allow you to reach location where enemies cannot reach (useful for a sniper) and speed demon allows faster reloads (useful for slower loading sniper rifles)
---
I did this the other day but after drinking from it, it stopped my marsupial mutation fro working until i logged out and back in. The mutation was still under my effects but i didnt have the jump height, cant remember if it affected carry weight. 
---
You can add a nice karma system where the more you murder the more your forced to wear high level raider gear and PA
---
My friends and I pre-ordered the game in the summer. We were so hyped. Now they started playing only bo4 or bf5. The game really feels empty...
---
I could see a reward system where you earn points for doing good or bad. 
---
I was one of those people. I tried really hard to like ESO. The game just felt like it was all glitter and no substance to me though. So I stopped playing after my first couple champion points
---
Not everyone would be dumb enough to pick up crap that could easily get them banned :p
---
That's Bethesda's gameplay not matching up with the lore.  Energy weapons as a whole are pretty meh in Fallout 4 and 76 in comparison to where they should be.
---
Laser and Plasma weapons were totally superior to ballistic weapons in pure performance in the lore and in early Fallout games, their downside was them, and their ammo, being rare due to lack of mass adoption by the time the bombs fell.
---
 In fact in Fallout 1 that BoS soldiers in power armor were shocked when they were cut to ribbons by plasma weapons at West-Tek, as power armor was nigh-impervious to all other attacks.
---
+25 karma teammate revived 3hour cool down
---
Why are they so expensive tho ? Not lul-expensive like the PA mod plans but still
---
What can I say? You ppl at least have self awareness
---
I am watching and recorded a long video as a evidence with my report
---
? Im not a nerd who knows what these dev room items are so fuck your passive aggressive jab
---
Very droll sir 
---
Suppose if no one figured the nuke code workaround, would that be a long end game content?
---
Wait is it only the armor helmet that is a banned item? I found in a bag at whitesprings some other marine things and didn’t know until now.
---
1) Auto Stim Marine Armor Left Arm
---
2) Chameleon Maine Armor Right Leg
---
3) Hunter’s Marine Armor Left Leg
---
4) Last Bastion
---
I think it was all in the same brown bag but can’t remember
---
They can drop items?
---
So used to being greeted by * N O T H I N G *
---
If my CAMP can't be placed, I can't be on your server. Why even waste both our times? Then when I get on, I get disconnected within a couple of minutes. Very annoying.
---
From what i read only the marine armor helmet is the item. It gives -2 per and 6 dmg resist the rest of the items you found are good. last bastion is also a quest reward so no it's 101% legit
---
No you're good those are armors that have been in the game
---
This is why we need a ‘here’s a gift’ emote, but some new players probably still wouldn’t get it. Is there even anything on emotes in the new player tutorial phase? Can’t recall being taught it. I think it’s something, like so much in game, you have to figure out.
---
damn you sound insecure, he wasn't implying you were dumb because you didn't know it was a dev item. He was implying scrapping it after you know it is a dev item is dumb.
---
You make a copy of the invoice and then add custom to the end
---
Last thing.... If you can 1-3 shot enemies like your build will be able to, pleaaaseee let your team mates hit the enemies at least once first so they get experience to (Cant tell you how many times my team mate has one shot legendaries before I can hit them, which means I get no XP and no legendary gear... This sucks for me because I'm a melee build and the only reason he isn't taking damage is because Im taking it all for him so his patience would be appreciated.......)
---
PS.. If your an a team oriented sniper who also happens to love others more than themself, get the empath mutation, its in my opinion the absolute worst in the game..... with it you'll take 33% more damage and your team will take 25% less, so it'll be appreciated by your team but seriously you need to let team members know so at least they feel bad or maybe give you loot haha (get when your higher level and confident with avoiding hits maybe?!)
---
My auto handmade is magically a single shot if I equip it from my favourites wheel but works as full auto when I equip from the pip boy
---
Don't listen to them. They are sheep. They obey stupid rules because they are conditioned to do what they are told.
---
It has a proximity chat you just need to turn it on
---
Might have been an alt, might have wanted to play solo might just not off liked how presumptuous you were being?
---
Not everyone want's there loot handed to them and not everyone wants people's "help", or anyone's left over plans.
---
There duplicate blueprints just drop them and move on. If someone want's help they will ask I'm sure.
---
Yeah sure he could have been nicer about it (in our opinion) but pretty sure when they turn on the game its not to be nice to fellow waste lander's, they may have been having a bad day and just wanted to be left alone....who knows. Point is being mad because someone doesn't want your plans and thank you anyways is daft.
---
So Fallout76custom?
---
Thanks for this.  Helps a ton.
---
Yeah, I feel you on that. I knew the game play was different but didn't realize the elder scrolls universe was just a skin on that game. This at least is a Fallout game even with the issues. I'll be able to stick with it more than ESO. It feels like FO4 wasteland excursions between trips to town. Whitesprings actually does have that cozy safe haven feel to me
---
Or in the porch - not on, IN!
---
Pretty sure. I'm at work so I can't check myself. 
---
Lucky for us: being stuck in Caution doesn't let us complete the Camp McKlintock "Back to Basics" quest, then you serverhop and all progress is lost
---
Tell me about it. I turn it on as soon as I log on and I never get hits. Taking workshops and attacking camps is by far the more efficient way of starting pvp. 
---
Normally leads to a good fight too. People actually have skin in the game that they are willing to fight for. 
---
I had the same experience a few times. Me, alone in the server or with only one or two more users.
---
Maybe is a local thing (Central EU), at unpopular hours (4:00 AM). 
---
yeah, screw all the low level people tryint to do their quests...
---
it's hard enough to have a high level guy come close to you anywhere, increasing the enemy level. 
---
please stick to whitesprings, fissure prime and uranium fever. thx.
---
I think you're confusing text chat with VOIP
---
I never asked to be thanked... And blueprints are blueprints  why wouldn't someone want that? You'd just have to grind caps to purchase them from vendors or get really good rng... Also i am not mad at this situation, I just feel unsettled by it. There's no need for you to get mad I've made a post and insinuate false information about me...
---
There is no end  game content. Even the slowest progressed people have now achieved 50 level and bored to the lack of content. We also know that there is nothing new PvE content coming in the next 6+ months so why waste time to this game anymore.  We have also seen how incompetent they are in Bethesda to make this game work at even basic level so there is no reason to expect anything big or interesting is coming even later to this game. Game is already dying and this is pure fact which is based for reality.
---
Ahh, awesome i wasnt aware of that, I will use this in future cheers
---
Because despite what Reddit would have you believe, going around unsolicited and trying to shove loot in players' faces in a game that is primarily about the search for (and acquisition of) loot is a dick move.
---
It is the equivalent of walking up to someone in a coffee shop who has just got a book out and going 'Oh hey man I read that too and it's awesome. Let me tell you how chapter 3 ends so you can skip forward.'
---
My two cents say it will go free to play before summer.
---
"everyone who doesn't think and act like me is a sheep, there's only one correct perspective and it's mine, the rest is wrong"
---
Holy fucking shit, someone actually found a way to blame Bethesda for this too. 
---
I don't think there is a need for perk cards that reduce weapon weight. I can think of far better cards to spend my perk points on.
---
To the gamer tags above?? Karma! Nothing worse when you got your session planned out fools try push you into PVP.
---
I have no issue with them trying a few times, but try a few times if they ain’t interested moved on buddy
---
Cool :) thanks
---
Lots of people that still play left for a less salty sub.
---
Cool :) thanks for letting me know
---
Fuck Metro. Boycott is active. They cant blackmail PC gamers.
---
A friend of mine found a full on dog helmet. It sits in the apparel tab on your pip, but you cannot equip it. He gave it to me and now it’s in my stash. We’re both thinking pets will be a thing.
---
Then don’t use them. No one is forcing you to pick them. 
---
Inventory management is a big deal in the game and if you want to go loaded for bear, it helps a lot to have weight reducing perks, especially given the fragile nature of some of the guns and their ridiculous weights. 
---
It’s easier than coding new content?  
---
Yep, didn't fix it. I've given up hope at this point. It's such a fun game but i'm not playing it like this. (It lowers the resolution as soon as I enter the world, the main menu's fine. The actuall window is the same size, but it's blurry as and when you try to go into the map screen or other inventories your mouse can't move all the way to the right/bottom of the screen.
---
What is the purpose of rules?
---
Sorry snowflake, you ain’t the owner of 76, I’m gonna continue doing what I want
---
Used to be nuke drop in every server I visited. Not so much anymore.
---
Doesn't do anything. The files and options in-game always say 1900x1080 but it's not. This is a fun game but i'm not playing it like this.
---
Wat. You've got some issues dude. If he said no or used an emoticon then it would have been fine. As I was unsure he saw the first bag I tried once more. I cant believe you are calling me a dick from trying to help, how is it offensive that I have plans I doubled on since I've been buying them by accident before they added the info bar. I would be so happy if someone gave those to me since I likely have 10000k worth of plans... Enjoy spending hours accumulating the caps, good time grinding for days... And your analogy is really shit dude, seriously. Work. On. It. You can do much better if you put your mind to it instead of getting offended at me being nice...
---
I understand the sentiment but it's better to put quests off until you're a higher level anyway, better rewards. Besides, there's only three real cities in the game and three nuke silos. Don't think that's a coincidence.
---
If you're having trouble, I would suggest sticking to the Forest, high levels rarely move over there, so enemies stay low. Morgantown is technically in Toxic Valley I've found, and you shouldn't move over there until later.
---
Uranium Fever isn't really a high level event, I mean it's higher level but the legendaries cap at lvl 40 so I don't bother with it anymore
---
Not everyone but it wouldn't surprise me if a large chunk of players stop playing for a few months. Now, some people on here might be cheering at people leaving, making fun of those creating quiting posts before doing so but you know what? Those players are important to Bethesda.
---
High player count is good, dwindling is bad. They need people to buy from the atoms store and inevitably use real life currency to do so. Its pretty much the thing that funds the game and future content (I'm comparing it to swtor now, which yes is f2p). Imagine how much money is being made from the actual game purchase now, when it can be ridiculously cheap. I know this doesn't take into account the digital sales from their service but I can't imagine physical sales are doing well.
---
I'm trying to remember the original point of this post but it might be something like "yeah people are leaving and it isn't a good thing, despite how annoying some might have found the leaving posts." 
---
Sorry for the miss spelling but the town of Monogah near the power plant is actually excellent for legendary farming....  PLEASE READ----- Only nuke if the town has Scorched or else it doesn't spawn glowing legendaries, but seriously run through a few times and your good to go, it has a smaller area to cover and using the exploit where someone quits the Fallout 76 Game on their xbox then starts it up and re-enters it will respawn all enemies after a few moments (Basically have a team mate that you can join, Exit the game and re-enter into the same server).... Also its 100% less of a clusterf\*\*k with other players if thats ever been an issue for you, far less people seem to see the value here and I can see why, this is the only other spot other than Whitespring I've been able to FARM legendaries... The Scorchbeast queen is fun but not good for legendary farming unless you want the Scorchbeast queen specific drops
---
Ah ok, just the idea of posting on here claiming this is why you avoid people in MMO's seems like you mad bro, that was all.
---
Again, just because one person values Blueprints doesn't mean everyone does. Could have been an alt, could have been a streamer doing something, could have been a mule that had a bag full of blue prints already, could have been someone that never wanted to craft a thing in fallout.
---
They asked you to leave them alone, that is all. No biggy, and probably not a reason to avoid people in mmo's but hey ho.
---
Pretty sure I've had a similar problem where I can't click on maybe an 8th if the screen in the right side. 
---
I've heard making them read only after you make the change can fix it. Though you'd have to switch it back in order to make further changes. There's plenty of guides online
---

Sell, but keep a few:  
---
-Gold.   
---
-Silver.      
---
-Fiberglass.    
---
-Bulked Glass.    
---
-Bulked Rubber.    
---
-Nuclear Material.   
---
-Crystal (unless you use cryolator)  
---
Sell All:
---
-Asbestos.  
---
-Bulked Cork 
---
thanks! 
---
It might also depend on the workshops you are taking. 
---
I'm bad at this too. I don't think I ever use the chemical junks like antiseptic and asbestos. Never ever use bone as far as I know. 
---
Uh how nice for you.  In a blast zone I can look away and look back 100 times and it still spins the waiting sign.
---
Suitcases out stroud the world I think I've seen it on vendors
---
.. what? 
---
so far as i know antiseptic is good for makin meds, nothing else :P
---
I used to not use bone as we until I started using a Deathclaw Gauntlet, stupid thing takes 13 bones to repair
---
Ty
---
hahaha :P
---
Asbestos is pretty common (from cigarettes) and has almost no use.   
---
Gold and silver are occasionally used for certain clothes, but not enough to justify keeping a bunch on hand.  Rubber is the same, but for armor. 
---
Crystal and Nuclear Material are good for energy weapon ammo (who uses that?) and fusion gens. Keep some, but if you go into nuke zones often you’re likely overflowing with the latter.  
---
Yeah I've done that maybe twice lol I'll do stimpacks if i come across a lot of ticks 
---
Whether something is “acceptable” or not to someone on Reddit isn’t the issue. In a world with limited dev time issues are going to be serialised, and some will be addressed after others, because they can’t address all the issues at the same time. And, as you may have noticed, FO76 has *a lot* of issues. 
---
Remember to use the perks that reduce junk needed for repairs/crafting. Can make a MASSIVE difference. You'll need a hell of a lot less just in general
---
Well I don't wanna log in to scrap my bulk items. Besides I'm lv 140 with nothing left to do so I am waiting for more content. Also green hell was 16e on steam so I'm gonna try that out
---
dunno if you use it for stims but 100% for antibiotics :P
---
Feel the same  only had full server problems when with friends but when I play by my self (not often as I prefer with friends but Xbox enforcement  stuff so I  did a little solo grind)the Max I have saw was like 6 people or something  right now hope it does not really  die as I actually  kinda enjoy the game 
---
I get what you’re driving at, but if I go through the effort of dropping a nuke, I’ll put it wherever I damn well please. Zone only lasts for 2hr. If you need to do something inside the circle, just server hop. 
---
And Morgantown is good for Cobalt flux. 
---
this is the x9347234873 post with this title
---
*Sigh* ..... if only... if only we would one day get a “good” fallout multiplayer game then we have now..
---
Not that I don’t play the hell outta 76.
---
I don’t think it has to do with internet connection. I have a speed of 500mb/up and down with a ping average of 5, and I get the spinning arrow thing about 40-50% of the time.
---
Go to the crashed vertibird in the center of watoga. There will normally be a power armor with T-51b/T-60. I farmed pretty much all my pieces there. Good luck .
---
“The white noise” being “everyone else’s tickets”? Basically, you want golden, high-priority tickets, because you are *The Modding Community?*Everyone else can fuck off, but when *you* find an issue, a dev needs to stop what they’re doing and get on it within hours?
---
Or am I misunderstanding something?
---
doesn't work for me either my fully sneaky sniper build is completely ruined. I started a new toon to check and she's constantly in danger with nothing around, which means no sneaking there either.
---
Any proof? Like this video evidence you claim to have?
---
Played from launch and about 250 hours (Level 110). Got everything I wanted. My look, my armour, my mods, my PA's and weapons. All quests done except for wendigo in cave. Rifle build with heavily stacked strength and perseption. After the nerf of TSE and armour. Kind of woke me up that most of my time now was farming for stuff that after I got my caps, all I was doing was filling flatwood containers with loot for other players. Sometimes I'd stalk other players and be that killing shot that comes out of the night that brings down that high level creature. I'd sneak into camps and see what they were up to, and leave presents of ammo and gear. But after the nerf of my TSE Gauss (One shot sniper in the tradition of Joe Pineapples). It kind of crippled my build. I have high strength, so can still swing a rocket Sledge and Grogneks with the best of them. But my whole build was the quick, silent and deadly assassin. The Gauss was the executioner, the judge and jury of the waste land. I would only carry 50 rounds of ammo for it and would depend on my underlever/handmade/All Rise/Grogneks for most things. 250 hours of grinding and sever hopping to make my character the look how wanted and it got screwed while melee was left untouched? I have outfits and a few other weapons (including 2 other TSE) I had stored for future roleplay and future balance like with my TSE Plasma Gatling and Enclave uniform. The nerf just made me realise that I don't want to spend a week or two changing my build to what ever PVP meta that Bethesda have now decide they want to pursue. I enjoyed my time, I'll still enjoy my time once Bethesda decides what they want to do with the game. It's a great sandbox to play in, but I also have a massive back catalogue of about 50 games spread over PC, XBOX and PS4 (Witcher 3 and Dying Light on PC are what am playing at present). So I'll work my way through a few of them while Bethesda decide what they want to do with it and show us that they have a decent plan for future content. If not I'll sit out and wait for Elder Scrolls and Fallout 6.

Are they actually all alive? I went through and only encountered one living Scorchbeast in the big room at the end.
---
Love how you're getting downvoted for asking for proof.
---
Think we've found the topic of the quartering's nexy hit piece
---
I just don't have the time to play lately. And when I do, it's midnight and I end up playing for ~4hrs...
---
I've gotten the same for christmas from my brother. Love it. Now i can put my contoller to rest, lay back, behold the s.p.e.c.i.a.l. cards on my wall (came with limited edition fo4 guide) and sip coffee from my vault boy mug whenever the game disconnects.
---
If only the cable guy had a 101 on his back instead of a 76...
---
You don't. So yeah ive pretty much never used em 
---
Definitely had the same problem! I realized yesterday I was still running around in my lvl 5 armor someone made me when I started playing like 3 weeks ago. I couldn’t build anything better and everything I found was to high to use. I purchased some plans from vendors so I could build some armor until I find better. I just turned lvl 27 today, so I guess my armor was a bit in need of upgrading :P
---
Originality died out when everyone decided to cash in on outrage and karma whore.
---
You aren't being nice, you are imposing yourself one someone else's game so that you can feel good about it yourself.
---
I'm so jelly for that legendary lever rifle!
---
I was doing that to grind mutations. then I realized it's easier to just go to a place with radiation barrels and a decontamination arch lol
---
Its basically the same acid the creepy inbred dragon people from Dark Souls 3 spit.
---
And honestly the ambient sounds are that good that i've only turned the radio on twice since i bought it on black friday
---
I feel personally attacked, haha. I use 3 star heavy weapons. I did have a really nice furious explosive minigun but it got eaten at Dolces. Since I've lost it I found and use a TS + 10% Dmg while aiming 50 cal and bought (5k caps) a TSE Gatling... but still.
---
Most of the people that I have seen just stay away from reddit now because the forums have become too toxic. The community here represents maybe 5% of the player base. 
---
I still don't even think this is the worst Fallout game.
---
That would go to BoS. Hell, throw Tactics in there too. 
---
you might not like it but being negative is what toxic is
---
Really? 5 shots with a tse? Prepatch i could 2 shot them with my non legendary pump shotgun and 1 shot if i sneaked. Enforcer is a really good perk to crowd control because the cripple triggers almost everytime if you dont have that yet
---
I feel the same what also sucks is the needs for ts and explosive I feel like a level 10 or 20 with 50 friends except without the friends and high level enemies 
---
It's used in crafting Marine armor. And if you want to get the best Marine armor mods you need to craft and scrap a lot of them.
---
A Ultracite Laser Gatling + Prime barrel is a literal scorch slayer. Only seen one guy using one so far and he chunked the SBQ with every shot and made short work of her.
---
It's the same for me rocking the full Ritual outfit. Either because it looks "scary" i must be a griefer, or i've managed to sneak into the dev room, or any million other reasons as to why i have it and they don't aside from the facts: i found it in lucky hole mine. 
---
A new expansion already? "vanilla" has only been out for 3 months lol. They should have just worked on some more end game stuff before releasing this game. I'm surprised they didn't think these kind of things out in development.
---
Pharma Farma lvl. will keep you on more cures and antibiotics than you’ll ever need. Well, if you are a ranged player; maybe melee players get more diseases. 
---
What a waste! Kill the player and keep the extractors, duh!
---
Where, if you don't mind me asking? Never seen it myself and i'm on a quest to find every outfit in the game
---
In other words, to be 100% without a doubt innocent, you will have to have streamed/recorded everything from the moment you bought the game to now, which is a ridiculous thing to ask of someone trying to prove something.
---
This is why I stand by my point that Bethesda should have never made a multiplayer game, because it required them to fuck up decent guns' stats in the name of balance and pvp meta or some shit.
---
My minigun in fallout 4 fucks deathclaws in the mouth. I use them all for scrap and caps in 76.
---
I want the game to succeed too. But when I hear things about how they still are unsure how much they can increase the stash size while keeping the game stable, it makes me worry about other content they plan on adding. In theory, new dlc content would be equally taxing on stability. Even if a lot of this stuff is client side, not server. From what I hear base consoles are suffering already with stability. I remain uncertain on how much the game can be optimized and how much content they can add. I feel like the game would benefit from a better foundation. 
---
This has happened to me with several plans recently :( 
---
I wondered whether they might be restricted to certain levels cuz I'm 47 right now. But there was no error message and no indication that I'd learned it either. One of them I purchased too :( 
---
And it still happens, despite the fact that the patches are more or less killing Dupe Fever
---
Only if they knew the power of baseball bats
---
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **3rd Cakeday** RangerSloth! ^(hug)
---
Do you have evidence? 
---
Try a reinstall something is wrong I don't doubt that but it seems to be client side, also I'm assuming you run escape artist?
---
It sets lvl of enemies by the lvl of the player that spawns the mobs. Server hop and they should be leveled to you
---
Check the map, 10 bucks there is a level 5 there trying to level up so its spawned the lowest level ghouls for the area.
---
By the way. Maybe it's just a very rare item in the game. Imagine if you went and dropped it in the lake and it didn't even come from  the dev room. Wow. That would be very sheepish.
---
Awesome!  
---
Could add flamethrower traps and it’s the Constitution from FO4!  Already have the bots instead of humans...
---
so you want this person to buy a second copy of the game that has absolutely no refund possible, make a brand new character, and then spend the hours of time required to grind for the materials needed for a mass crafting session all for the sake of a single experiment. While it is a proper, 100% foolproof way to prove the issue, it is absolutely STUPID to demand this of anyone that isn't being compensated for the money and time you're demanding. Really want them to do this? Offer to pay them the price of the game and a wage for the hours they'll have to dump into this. Don't make financial-related demands of someone just trying to prove a bunch of lying hatemongers wrong. That's why you were downvoted.
---
 i was server hopping and no lvl 20- to be seen anywhere.
---
Call the cops
---
Don't lie, that requires you to buy a controller that comes with a copy of the game. Not what i would call "free". There are plenty of hardware that offer a free game that comes with it.
---
i serverhopped like 10 times but it just gives me lvl shits, im lvl 56 btw
---
Which is exactly how pacifist prevents being attacked outside of PvP, it makes all attacks on you slaps. Except for when you have a workshop, which people didn't know, so they got 1-shot, even by fairly normal weapons and even without bobbleheads; both are unnecessary for someone who knows the workshop mechanic.
---
Thanks! I totally missed the hat the first time I was there.
---
shhh dont spew the secret of op vat build
---
Well there must have been one there before you obviously. And if you have been server hopping and never seen level 9s there before then obviously there I'd no nerf. That word gets thrown onto everything haha
---
Wheres the video?  If you have a video, show us the video!  Otherwise why bother to post this here.
---
New Dragon Age is coming out next year. Not only sex, but the potential for gay elf sex. 
---
Umm they had fully auto missing barrage makers, it balances out.
---
I’m waiting. The game seems a little unstable and unrewarding at the moment. Give it some time, it will be fun again.
---
lol, yeah, imma just keep server hopping and wish for the best
---
from the wiki: "Both outfit and head can be found at Dolly Sods wilderness behind a level 2 lock door."
---
yup totally a cheater
---
Jesus how much longer can the load times get? I have the X and I feel like most of the time I “play” this game is staring at that stupid vault tec ID card level 1
---
Thanks! This is exactly what I was looking for :)
---
I can't tell you, I don't actually know what we're talking about. I'm just a compulsive liar. Or am I?
---
You have to quit to desktop to get a new server after last patch, you could also go to westek researchers too, normally get a couple shared legendary there and watoga too
---
I can't tell wether I'm stupid or not
---
I have this also I fkn love it!!!!! Running around with my legendary cultist blade!!
---
well you're more a roleplay build, because pistols are not viable in end game that is why I say it's useless
---
I'm taking a break from the game while waiting for new content, personally. Most of my friends quit and joined the hate bandwagon and I don't really like playing with strangers.
---
Maybe the perk cap should be raised from 56 to, say 76 maybe, so we have more room for those perk cards that should be passive like lockpick and crafting cards that you have to swap every time you want to repair something. That way we also have more room to equip the more fun perks that I never use now because I have to have durability cards equipped at all times because don't want my stuff to break all the time. I feel right now there really isn't that much room to experiment if you already have a certain build.
---
&gt; There's four other characters whose dialogue we don't know about. We don't know about two of their weapons either.  
---
The beauty of this is that you have total freedom to make it out as you see fit, both in terms of voice and characterisation as well weapon choice.
---
Who knows, you could be Leeroy Jenkin's into the Fallout lore if the devs are impressed enough with it :)
---
*Heavy breathing in campaign hat.*
---
There's always the potential for future content. Anything is possible.

---
You want a real immersion breaker, me trying to figure out why tf the BoS are in west virginia to begin with, afaik they didnt leave california for at least another 70-100 years later...
---
You do know you have to rebuild the structure or use the blueprint after you move the C.A.M.P. right? Your description of the problem seems as though you expect it to just place your building for you when you drop the CA.M.P. down.
---
That's awesome! 
---
Well given the character isn't established (as far as I'm aware) so may as well make it your own and do it as you see fit.
---
On Australian Ps4 servers I've surpringly seen quite a few people around still, have even had nukes going of and everything. 
---
It turns out there is a chat function baked in that was disabled due to not working for the consoles (they have no keyboards as default equipment).  So to make it the same build across the platforms chat was simply disabled.  There is a mod on the nexus that re-enables it for PC.  It's basic looking but very VERY functional (has global/trade/local chat, has clans and clan chat... it's pretty *rad*)
---
Clan tags even float over your name in the game.
---
😂
---
Oh jeez, thanks for this! Someone dropped a bag of them Infront of me in Whitesprings last night. Didn't realise this at all.  
---
Gotta log back on and get rid! 
---
Oh, well im peretty dumb lol. Its working now, thx!
---
It's the start of a potential problem, but yeah, people are blowing it out of proportion just like they've blown EVERYTHING about the game out of proportion.
---
American creators, so they don't give a fuck about it. Was also looking forward to something but...
---
Every server I get put into has fuck loads of inexperienced and new players. This subreddit fucking sucks, no one has any reason to come here when 80% of the posts are targeted disinformation. As a SWBF and SWBF2 veteran, I can say it will take a while before  the hardcore shitters lose interest, the sub will improve when they move onto the next controversy (my money is on Anthem) 
---
Supposably there's a Manta-man NPC rare encounter in FO4 that has special dialogue if you're wearing the silver shroud outfit. Maybe we know more than I thought with this and Mistress of Mystery. he had a Rock-it Launcher so we still don't know his weapon.
---
Hmm I like the idea of open RPing the Inspector. Grognak has dialogue from the Pipboy game I just realized, or at least his thoughts
---
Well what about them having weight reduction effects?
---
Not an excuse, but doesn't all game do this ? not just from Bethesda?
---
Haha dude are you drunk?  Your responses here make no sense.  Nobody wants *you* specifically to use these cards, we just want ourselves to use them.  wtf?
---
The microtransaction itself isn't what's giving the buff. It's the temporary event, which is how they're TECHNICALLY not lying about the outfits sold being cosmetic. However, it does present the issue that these outfits clearly went on sale FOR the event, pushing the sales and giving people that bought it a buff. It's a technical loophole that should be brought to attention, but not screeched about like it's suddenly Red Dead Online or Grand Theft Auto.
---
Just go make your own game I mean modders act like there so much better then Bethesda devs any way go make your own huge open world game from scratch problem solved the way you guys talk it will be easy right?
---
Isn't that in the eye of the beerholder?
---
Somebody definitely considers the daily reporting of getting booted from the server to be negative.
---
Some would consider those numerous posts as a whole toxic despite it being a legitimate issue.
---
Personally repeated posts don't bother me as I was never the guy on a forum saying "No new posts allowed. Everything and every topic has been covered." 
---
I could take a 3 star dump and it could do more damage than a super sledge but that doesn't change the fact it's still a steaming pile of shit.
---
Wooo this is something fun to do
---
this is a very good suggestion.
---
I mean, 3\* with proper perks are pretty legit. Hater. Haha
---
Well I mean canonly China shot nukes at America so that’s probably why 
---
There's a mod on nexus mods for that, this question gets asked nearly daily.
---
That didn't work for me. I've scraped everything and I had to moved my camp because I couldn't scrap some objects. I've build several foundations, stored them, scrapped them, build again and nothing. Stored (empty) budget is now on 50%. 
---
I think it increase by 10% everytime I move my camp while I have tamed creature.
---
Naming and shaming is against reddit rules as a whole. No inciting witch hunts which without solid proof is exactly what this is
---
I only went to nuked Morgantown twice. Never seen a single legendary despite the onslaught of bloated ones.
---
You go in the buildings?
---
RNG.
---
Whichever character you go with, this game seems primed for goofs like this.
---
It's like the person who RP'ed Preston Garvey very early on, telling other players that a settlement needed their help and such.
---
Much needed levity given the current state of the game and player base.
---
Delete then,  my bad, I'll post pictures pictures next time I come across it. 
---
Because  Beth said the lore was the best place to a take dump, before all this other wonderful orchestration that is FO76.  Super Mutants?  Dip?  Fuck that, just put some gogo juice in the water!  Deathclaws?  Let's just put them there, because we can. Ghouls?  Fuck them, and everyone else!
---
Probably so level 1s can’t run around with daisycutters server hopping while clapping peoples bases
---
Is this a thing? My girlfried PA just dissapear last night. Its a common thing? We are so frustated, she lost a xo1 and the excavator. One was in the inventory and the other in the stash. We call it last night, we are getting a break and play something else til this shit gets better
---
lot of youtuber probably got banned too lol so they keep raging about it
---
All it takes is one 
---
&gt; I strongly disagree with ideas of free, immediate full respecs.
---
My bad, maybe I worded it poorly, but I meant *this suggestion would allow free respec as long as you have waste cards*. So this is a way to respec a little faster than by leveling up, since you can use perk cards you don't care about. It also allows you to clean up the cards you are sure you will never use. 
---
Now I totally agree with you, being a master at everything is not interesting, but that's not what this suggestion does. It just gives an extra currency, still bound to leveling, to respec. 
---
Would still be against rules. Especially if you share their username. It encourages harassment, which is the last piece of drama this community needs
---
I don't care if they don't proof anything in this sub, but they should sent proof/info to Beth.
---
How much were you looking to spend? 
---
No thought. No reasoning. Just bleating and baaing. Obey your stupid rules. Submit to anything those who have power over you demand, for fear of punishment. Think you are free? You're too scared to even wear a helmet you found. And you think you're not a sheep.
---
Went to the pub, the airport, did the Steal-Heart event ... did you get lucky in Morgantown ?
---
Whereas I do care. It's led to misinformation, drama, etc in this sub that could have been easily avoided. Like the trade scam that turned out to be total bullshit but the sub crusaded against hard
---
Easy. Go sniper build like me, stand in neighboring area of high DMG and shoot into area of low DMG. ;)
---
i found 1 on the top floor of fort defiance
---
Another essay that was complety unessescary.
---
Goodbye. Don't let the door hit you on the way out.
---
Dolly Sods. If you Google tattered mole head, there's plenty of posts and videos that show exactly where.
---
'automoderator' my ass.
---
While I agree that most reused assets shouldn't be charged for, it also doesn't really fit into the game's location or lore. There was one show pre-war for the Silver Shroud and was being produced in Boston, Massachusetts when the bombs fell. This means that the costume we find in Boston needs to be in Boston, not West Virginia like where the Mistress of Mysteries actor was at the time of the war. The same issue arises for the Grognak costume, though there is a discrepancy with this since Grognak's Axe shows up in 76. I see this paywall as paying to negate a little bit of pre-established lore for a fun cosmetic look (if we ignore the event for the sake of avoiding additional drama). Not going into the pricing point because I haven't actually looked at the prices of the costumes yet and have always felt Creation Club and Atomic Shop were mostly overpriced. Also I've seen pics of the FO4 and FO76 Silver Shroud costumes and there is actually a visible yet subtle difference, so my guess is that it got a bit of a face-lift before porting it over.
---
Any proof? On PS4 using a tethered 4g connection and never had disconnects as bad as people claim
---
Cool, thanks
---
There's also some unmarked apartments, rooftops, and parking garages you can go in. You can find some legendaries in at least every interior building you go in. I definitely picked up a few
---
I mean a 3 star literal shit with proper perks is pretty legit but that doesn't change it's still shit.  A weapon shouldn't have to have a bunch of OP legendary effects on it just to make it good.
---
Seriously dude, I'm not gonna say your trolling but without the video you claim to have made this is just a bullshit post.
---
And yet you thought it was important enough to post, funny
---
You just suck at the game, haha. It's okay to be garbage, don't blame the tools.
---
Good to know. Thanks.
---
Keep up the good work! People need assholes like you to know what they are leaving behind.
---
I don’t know what nexus mods is. Is that a PC thing? Also, it doesn’t hurt to ask again.
---
So, verifiable evidence of duping is against the rules? For reddit. Easy day, what I hear you saying is skip the middleman and report straight to bethesda. Copy that, MODS TAKE THIS POST DOWN MY APOLOGIES.
---
&gt; Came back to the game after a while. 
---
Umm... it's been like this since back a while ago. Like first day of beta a while ago.
---
You're about 4 months late to the party and the whine bar is close. No one complains about this any more. We've moved on.
---
Yesterday 1h play. I had 3 disconn. on pc. Everytime I lost my progress in the bunker. That sucks.
---
Here's my list from today:
---
Carry weights totally ruined my gaming. I'd go from ok to over encumbered for no reason. Get in/out of PA and my carry weight keeps dropping.
---
Server boots. Which upon joining a new game I would become over encumbered for no reason. This fucked my game up because I'd be in the middle of something important and now I can't get the fuck outta that area without now getting rid of everything I just collected, defeating the purpose of even playing that area.
---
Taking chems to then increase strength fucked things up even more strangely. At one point I should've been 400 carry weight. Taking chems I went up to 500+ then down to 250. Get out of PA and back in and I'm at 150. Leave the game come back at 350 Wtf? 
---
Grant Saber keeps disappearing from my fav wheel.
---
Disabled all the robots at the one building by computer. Instantly blew up and died when I walked near an upside down laser turret lol.
---
Stash weights are acting weird. Was playing with stash management and transferring items and putting them back resulted in incorrect weights.
---
Stash saying it's full when I have far less than 600. 540 said it's full. 
---
I reported my own post for harassment. Was not my intention. Just trying to do my part.
---
Swapping fucking cards out fucking pisses me off
---
Nah, i'm just sick of all this attention seeking.
---
If you wanna quit then go ahead.i quit games all the time. Don't make a huge fucking song and dance about it. If Bethesda care as little as everyone claims this isn't even going to be read by anyone who actually gives a shit and matters anywat
---
It is a special receiver, just not as good as the higher tier ones and there are the prime receivers that do more then the rest. The scorched killer is a Firebreathers version that doesn't need special ammo while the Prime needs ultracite ammo. This is just my understanding of the two and may be wrong.
---
Should we just do our part and auto-downvote anything without proof? Doesn't get rid of it but at least it shifts it away from cluttering the hot list.
---
Agreed.  Same old events spawning gets boring fast.
---
Is the skin gone from the shop or not because I can’t find it
---
If I don't get into PA when at my camp before quitting and starting the game I fall through the floor of my camp house and die.
---
Watoga high school event “monster mash” always gives loads too from the herd of ghouls you have to fight. Also, the candy can be traded 100 for a regular wonderglue.
---
And report it. 
---
Rule 7 from the sidebar: 
---
&gt;Do not post rumors or leaks without actual evidence. Second-hand information or word of mouth does not constitute as evidence. If you have evidence, you are welcome to submit it, in confidence, to the unaffiliated moderators for verification. Only upon moderator verification can you post it.
---
I had no idea about the wanted thing and kept wondering why I was only landing in empty servers for a while. Somebody ended up killing me and I felt great after
---
Chinese-themed items on the Atom Store you say...? For Chinese New Year...?
---
Hmm... those sounds like commie ideas.
---
Do you expect these items to be given away for free to the masses?
---
Sir, do you have any ID on you?
---
I kinda agree, but not really, because all weight reduction perks are a really bad game design decision. Perks are supposed to help you customize you character, to make it special. But instead we simply have mandatory traveling pharmacy and thru-hiker and batteries included, because you just cannot play without them. 
---
Which means every player has to equip them, and every player has less options for customizing their build. If every player is forced to use some perk, it should not be nerfed. It should be removed from the game, and it's effects should be a default for everyone.
---
well it is rare and suppose to be rare
---
Item levels lock certain areas from underleveled characters accessing them too early. Enemies have levels too, so you need appropriate gear to take on them. I can't think of another way to go about it.
---
You should be good. My base blueprint copied 81 times a few days ago and I am still here lol
---
Unless they changed bulking, bulking is also wasting player resources. You might as well just throw the plastic away if you don't intend to sell the bulked items most of the time. Only Aluminum and Lead reduce weight. Unless they changed something that is.
---
Lmao, that was funny fellow commu... American.
---
1k be a good price?
---
Im on xb1
---
Maybe someone less lazy then me can actually compile a list now as Plans are now Static at vendors 
---
Ok then i say thank you for the scrap, because i wanted to build something new today
---
what did bethesda lied? incompetent; yes but they never lied
---
i saw the legs today at harpers
---
Well, technically, they aren't breaking that rule if it happened to them personally.
---
Yea, my plain combat shotgun mods are up to 18+ pounds.
---
I don't even think my IRL Saiga with a 20-rd drum even weighs that much!
---
Add a small scope?  That'll be 2-lbs please.  Right....
---
&gt;Red Tactical 
---
Yeah, i bought it from MODUS 2 days back, was showing as  Red Tactical  in his inventory, but installed just fine and then it suddenly was called " Mothman light" lol
---
 Quitting a game because of one minor poor experience yes. I mean I can’t influence your decision to stay and I don’t really care either way but it seems like you are over reacting and looking for a bit of attention.
---
Most people are temporarily quitting until the vault DLC rolls around given that there isn’t much end game content but yeah you enjoy quitting over some SBQ glitch 👌🏼🗿
---
Except that anecdotal evidence is anything but proof. You can't trust "it totally happened, even though i did nothing to prove it". All that does is lead to more unessescary drama
---
Buddy, who touched you the wrong way for you to act like a troglodyte on the internet?
---
Barbarian (STR) Ironclad (END) Evasive (AGI)
---
Don’t forget they sometimes would also go with pistols too.
---
no need, just keep us informed. I'll say though, that the ultimate test would be crafting 300 boards.
---
that's how duping worked.
---
I hope they do this, I’m on console so I can’t take advantage of the PC perk loadout manager, I don’t bother lockpicking or hacking anything that’s not in a nuke silo anymore because swapping those perks is really tedious, and it takes longer than the nuke takes to drop for me to swap all the cards over to prep for a SBQ fight when someone else launches and the death from above notice comes up because of the number of cards I have to scroll through to completely change my build for the event.
---
Obviously you had good intentions, but you shouldn't have followed them after they left the first time. Some people like the help, others would rather get things on their own, and some would just think it's a "trick" or something. I just leave spare recipes in station suitcases.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/sFzxEGo](https://imgur.com/a/sFzxEGo) Now with a commemorative photo. I *cannot* believe I just randomly encountered this place on my own just recently.
---
What I meant was that if they experienced that bug/glitch themselves it's not second-hand, thus, posting about it is not breaking any rules
---
It might have been my connection. I stopped everything else and haven't disconnected for about the past half hour. Still sucks that you can't manually go back to the previous server though :(
---
We are the Brotherhood of Steel! What do you want us to use instead of Power Armor and advanced weaponry? Leather Right Leg and crude, homemade pipe rifles?
---
^Intriguing
---
What's funny is that miniguns and laser rifles are also prefered weapons of mutants. How have they haven't gone extinct yet is beyond baffling.
---
On a technecality, yeah. The moderators should close that loophole. Though look at the sterling job they're doing containing drama as is
---
Let people play the game. I'm sure some people will want everything handed to them but others like to find things by themselves.
---
You can wait until the Vault DLC 😎
---
Damn, bro you're a little self obsessed, arent you? Last time i checked your reply, it was a different message and now it's different again. You probably label yourself as special or a freethinker, you question rules or laws, thinking they have an arbitrary hold in society, thinking you understand the world more than others, Is that how you it is? Youabel other people as sheep when they have a different way of thinking than you? I wont say, you need help. People like you are just as common as those you label as a sheep.
---
I don't even try to help specific people unless they ASK.  I also don't use a mic so it's hard to communicate sometimes.  I'd just drop things in a container near a well used vendor spot.
---
And what happened to give you an overinflated sense of self importance?
---
Wow I understand Bethesda (like all game studios) would get a lot of feedback, but I’m blown away that you’re getting SUPPORT for FO76!
---
It’s at ravens dale order HQ in the lockers 
---
This i agree with. They need an option to rejoin the last server you were on. Or give us a proper error code if it stops responding/crashes
---
I even got Black Ops for free with ps+
---
Seeing a dip shit like you come out to be a keyboard warrior.
---
you saw damage that some1 else was doing in that case
---
Is that all you've got? You are a sheep. You found a helmet in a game and you're scared you might get banned. If there was a law that said you can no longer play games, are you going to obey it? Of course you are. Just like the rest of the sheep in this thread. I'm going to be playing games. Because the purpose of games is fun. Not some kind of authoritarian serf relationship with developers.
---
that's not the lied that's incompetency on their part
---
Hopefully survival mode gets all these griefers off pve servers
---
Lol that's it. Continue with the personal attacks to make yourself feel more important and totally legitimise your post
---
/s
---
See, I'd be on your side with this but the mods here are terribly hands-off. 
---
I think they're like the least most active mods I've seen for a gaming sub. Well, at least the ones I follow anyhow.
---
I mean they let the issue get to a point where Bethesda had to step in an offer an official statement. That's fine as is but are they now going to clamp down on ban and exploit claims now that the air has been cleared?
---
I could be wrong but I just don't see it happening.
---
Duh. I asked him about it and he said it was a Zealot Ultracite Laser Gatling. It's not hard to see the Healthbar go down quickly when he is shooting it.
---
This thread [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a1kuxc/materials\_master\_list\_junk\_management/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a1kuxc/materials_master_list_junk_management/) has a link to this spreadsheet [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sg7L4P7UT4mycr7JF-aXvf5gjFtsyAfUH3qjeiV03y8/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sg7L4P7UT4mycr7JF-aXvf5gjFtsyAfUH3qjeiV03y8/edit#gid=0) which I have found very useful to follow with just a couple of deviations.
---
So having a legitimate complaint and letting the company and public know about it in hopes that it will motivate them to actually fix the real issues with their game is attention seeking? How exactly do you expect them to fix anything and turn the game around if no-one says anything and just quits? Your posts make 0 sense
---
And yes i did also submit a ticket directly to them. But i guess being rude and disrespectful when completely unnecessary is not attention seeking eh? 
---
They're all dead when you enter. Part of the scene setting 
---
Canvas is a high quality material, they replaced it with a very low cost, low quality material and still advertised the high quality. That is a falsehood and a lie. Lies are simple: is it true? Did they know it wasn't true; if both of those are yes, then it is a lie.
---
Fallout: ~~76~~ *Linear Story and You Better Use Power Armor and Grognak Axes. PS Give Us More Money*
---
I thought so.
---
Unfortunately the only option is for the community to moderate itself at this point. Which quite honestly feels like an impossible task with how far gone the sub is into "outrage over the smallest thing" mode
---
I would love to have this in CAMPs.  I'm getting pretty tired of spawning at the bottom of the lake my house is built on when I fast travel there.  Meanwhile my friends spawn right at the stairs to my front door.  Haven't quite been able to figure that one out yet.
---
They have a deal with Epic to exclusively sell the PC version through Epic's store seemingly, which many have a problem with as the Epic store and launcher are "anti-consumer". A lot of people think that this deal and their response to the concerns raised about it have shown a real lack of respect for the players, particularly those on PC.
---
your avatar ia a white masculine good looking male and that's why you got banned, probably.
---
I'm more disturbed about the lead in baby toys
---
Makes you wonder really what the point of BETA was :(
---
Hasn't been working at all for me. That worked prior to patch 5, for me at least.
---
Nope. Submitting a support ticket is all you needed to do and i'm glad you did, but it rendered this post completely pointless, past venting your obvious rage. Which i hope helped you at least, until the next thing that outrages you so much you need to write an essay
---
did you personally know them or you actually believe that? i have CE and i have no issue
---
My connection to everything else is great. 100+ Mbps up and down.
---
Grognaks was never able to be repaired above 100%, sadly.
---
Toxicity? ... you must be a very delicate person.
---
It was the straw that broke the camels back so to say. Not a minor poor experience but the rule of thumb for a while now. Just had  enough I guess finally. Hope they do fix the game not sure if I ll try it again later too much frustration the past few weeks. Not looking for attention could really care less about that, just bringing attention to how flawed the game currently is.
---
&gt; You have to quit to desktop to get a new server after last patch
---
I don't think that is true, in my experience you might get stuck on the same server every now and then, but in general server hopping works as it always had.
---
How does it copy?
---
The claim is that Maxson, having taken his whole unit AWOL, used remaining communications to convince a bunch of remaining military forces across the US to convert to being BoS. I guess he was a cult of personality.
---
Good fix, try uninstalling
---
Yes, it is a known bug.  
---
I agree but it goes beyond that. 
---
They don't even bother policing multiple posts on the exact same topic and try and funnel people to comment on an existing thread. It often happens with big news like patch updates. The event feedback went WAY out of control. It could have all be contained into one pinned topic but nope, anyone who wanted their voice to stand out could flood the sub with a separate post that only makes the CM's job harder in tracking all the feedback. Crap like that.
---
lol what shill? this is bethesda themself dude
---
Wow, you replied literally 10seconds after I posted my response. So, you were actively refreshing this page, eager to have your inflated opinion be heard. That's really pathetic... No use talking to a self-obssessed prick like you so think whatever you like, man. Say baaa or moo or whatever makes your internet pp hard.
---
With the right mods FO4 is so great. I've probably got a hundred hours into it now that I've stopped playing 76 a few weeks back. And glad I got out before the latest patch - it sounds infuriating. It's nice to have fun playing a Fallout game again.
---
You'll have to wait another 6 months for some new quests 🤣
---
You know there are references to at least one resident of the white spring bunker believing that the entire game world is a simulation being run by a military problem-solving AI, similar to P.A.M.
---
What if one of the content updates throws us into the ACTUAL, not fucked up game. As in the current, shitty game is a simulation meant to test how to kill the SB's, or what happens when the vaults open, or what West Virginia will look like in their in-game post apocalypse. 
---
That or they use it as an out for the unbelievably bad PR they're getting.
---
BGS I hearby give you the rights to this idea. Just send me a cool hat or something maybe? I just want to enjoy the game again. It's current state gives me anxiety. 
---
I play mostly solo and I've certainly enjoyed my time with the game but there's just not enough to do once you reach the endgame. SBQ isn't a fun fight after running it so many times.
---
After the latest patch, I decided I'm going to be waiting for more vaults to open before I venture into Appalachia again.
---
Yup, that's the case. Hopefully they'll issue another hotfix or patch real soon. Don't want to have to wait a couple of weeks just for something that wasn't broken before to be restored back to its original unbroken state.
---
&gt;re-log 3 times get the same server every time
---
Noticed that recently. It could mean that there are fewer servers running.
---
How does he manage the durability problem?
---
I don't get why workbenches have them but we can't for our camps.. 
---
I've had a mix today. A few ridiculous loading times (mostly joining a server) but other times it seems pretty snappy. I think it's server dependent. 
---
&gt; I don’t really care either way 
---
And yet, you're posting.
---
Same way I do probably. Lvl 5 Weapon Smith + Lvl 3 Luck of the draw. I barely ever repair my 50 cal and when I do I repair it to 200% so it last's that much longer.
---
Oh yeah, would be cool music I don't care as much about since there's so many fallout style radios and playlists out there.
---
Lore related stuff in the radio is too cool.. prewar ads ❣️
---
I totally expect some kind of radio play content eventually. Probably among content in a major dlc
---
Yet here you are flaming op for posting this.   It's a legitimate reason for quitting the game and yet all you do is berate them.  
---
The game is a mess atm and you can't see it.  Many other can.  Hell I did a test of the 20 crafting items to see if people were actually being banned.  Spoiler alert, those claiming it we're most likely cheating as it turned out false.
---
However in the first half hour of leaving the vault the server disconnects twice.  I get a bug with a terminal that freezes the game and a mob just ends up frozen with no enemy ai.  The game is fucking broken and needs fixing.  These posts are necessary as there are enough of them for Bethesda to see and think maybe they should fix the game.
---
Please god this. Half of the map is unused by most people above level 40. Toxic Valley, The Forest and Ash Heap all have tons of cool events that are just wasted for the most part.
---
No idea, just moved the camp and suddly i had 5 blueprints and 5 times everything from my old base
---
I think it runs deeper than thay.
---
Remember when they did an "i quit" megathread? That degraded into everyone attacking the mods.
---
People have no respect for them, see them as BSG shills, and are completely out of control (when they started to delete personal attacks that became "reee they are censoring negative opinions")
---
My PS4 has been very stable since last Tuesday’s patch.  
---
&gt;proof
---
Every one who still plays this thing has seen the bugs.
---
Still no rational, thought, or reasoning about the subject. Just NPC dialogue. Baaaa.
---
&gt;And report it.
---
Reeeeeeeee.
---
I find this whole thing blatantly ridiculous. Most Bethesda titles are decent (I stress "most,"), but the modding community makes the games brilliant. Whilst I haven't played Skyrim on the pc (I burned myself out on it and I have pet peeves with Bethesda's quirks), I followed the modding community for Skyrim for god knows how long and I was always impressed with the skill I saw. Frostfall, OBIS, Deadly Dragons, Run for your lives, realistic needs and diseases, BVFE - Serana and Family, endless amounts of player homes and the list goes on etc. Like Bethesda knows that the modding community is the backbone of their games and they just don't want to hear of it for 76. I mean god. Bethesda can't fix their games - we all know that USLEEP read like a bleedin' book.
---
I've found Bethesda to just be really bloody lazy as of late. The fixes they come out with for 76 are botch-jobs and it's just simple stuff. It took them an entire month to edit an .ini file for a bastardised 21:9 ratio support, they nerf stuff which don't need to be nerfed and I'm just kind of sitting here thinking what the hell are they doing. Like they know they have a huge modding community for their games and 76 needs all the help it can get. And yet they don't tap into that community.
---
Honestly, I have more faith in the modders fixing up Bethesda's broken games, than I do in Bethesda fixing it themselves. It says a lot about the talent of modders and it says a lot about how i feel about Bethesda atm.
---
&gt; personal attacks 
---
Like dismissing people's experience as "seeking attention?"
---
Lol i never said it's not a bad game. It is. Objectively bad. The codebase is a trainwreck. 
---
The issue i have is all the attention seeking "i quit" posts and proofless rumors drown out any legitimate duscussion threads. I'd suggest making an "i quit megathread" but the mods tried that and it became "let's attack the mods" megathreaf
---
Bobble heads / Magizines,  if they were returned to what they were in Fallout 4,  own it and get a single permanent perk...  instead of 'chem style' perk for x a mount of time,  that would prevent the stacking.   So duping would be useless. 
---
As for items and rare mats,  that would take more creative solutions.   However the primary issue was the legendary items  that is also what people were paying cash for.
---
Super helpful input there kiddo.
---
Played for 4 hours last night same server, no problems 
---
Yup, wonder why? 😁
---
Thing is tho, i dont need to defend or give you anything. You just think you're entitled to it. You're not important, lol
---
Yeah, but have you ever had 45 Steaks giving you +60% hunger with Carnivore? I feel full looking at them
---
Yes, and they mighty fine too. Mm.
---
I made a laser rifle with beam splitter it broke after two reloads. 100% to 0 after two clips. Is that supposed to make sense?
---
Like spamming this sub with demands for "proof."
---
Who should we believe, /u/Veldron or our lying eyes?
---
I laugh when people say they have 20 disconnects in one night or the game is completely unplayable 
---
 Bullshit, I've gotten close to 200 hours and I haven't even had 20 disconnects in total 
---
I never believe half these whiners till I see proof 
---
I think acid too now that is 15 bulked not 10 I may be wrong.
---
Never had that problem myself. Git Gud I guess.
---
/r/iambadass, /r/madlads, /r/iamverysmart all rolled into one. 
---
Coz game was rushed
---
Ur right, mate. Endgame is lacking of content and balancing is shit. Like u said, how it's possible, that low level enemies take so much bullets? 
---
I agree with you in the regard that a weapon shouldn’t need perks to be good, not so much the antagonistic behavior 
---
Build an epic camp.
---
I was standing on the walls of my CAMP, those large concrete walls that aren't as wide as your foot. I shot at a scorchbeast flying around after it had been attacking my walls but marked as 'friendly'. Instantly, not a second later, not half a second later, a scorched is so close it should be standing on my foot. I get that they signal the scorched but teleporting them into my face is not a game mechanic I am ok with funnily enough.
---
/r/NPC_irl
---
Laser rifles are alright imo but yeah Miniguns are infamously bad, even with the heavy gunner perks the damage to bullet ratio is just not sustainable. Fun as hell to mow down lower level mobs with though.
---
Its a conspiracy to ruin your fun.
---
I play using my phone's 4g connection. Maybe two or three disconnects during a weekend session at most
---
In my experience in larger group battles, it's really all about positioning, so that you're shooting say at the flank rather than shooting into the centre of a fight and potentially hitting your team mate. 
---
That basically means you need to be mobile. Have to be unencumbered so you can sprint to a better position of needed. Speed demon mutation certainly helps, especially with faster reloads.
---
The way I see it, you're either instigating boss fights so you can make a massive amount of damage with a sneak attack head shot before things go crazy or you're helping the lead by either softening targets as they approach or protecting their flank so they're not being swarmed on all sides.
---
That's how I like to think it'd run in theory. In practice you're probably just the guy with longer reach and slower, harder ranged hits but otherwise right beside your other team mates because screw the melee and shotgunners taking all the XP.
---
Oh right "Git Gud"... You don't use lasers.
---
Run along now. You have to go drop your helmet in a river like a good obedient little sheep.
---
&gt;Is it just west tek and hop or is there a better spot or route?
---
Supermutants annoy me, Whitesprings is too laggy (and competitive), so I'll stick to Watoga. If you find a server that has a high legendary spawn rate there (possibly caused by a blast zone close by), stick to it, fast travel away a bit and come back, don't forget the deathclaw spawning at the nearby relay station and the ghouls at Camp Venture. Break up the monotony by clearing out the various Watoga buildings as well.
---
Last but not least: Drop your unneeded legendary loot into the suitcase inside Watoga station for others to enjoy.
---
We do not speak of the forbidden Fallout games
---
Cute. I only demand proof from the people that make outrageous claims and don't back it up. It's called not being told what to think. Try it some time, sweetie
---
Maybe you're just angry that so many people are having problems and you just want this sub to be sunshine and lollipops.
---
The game is effing broken and most of the bugs are true.  The banning for 20 items crafted isn't true.  Bethesda have said it's false so there you go.  I did a test also on the PC version.  Crafted a lot of boiled water like one of the posts said and no ban yet.
---
I recorded it, but an hour of footage then uploaded takes a while.  You can clip games easily on console but they don't capture crashes correctly.  Anyways in the first 30 mins of the craft test, I got disconnected twice.  The game is in a sorry state man.  People are going to come here to complain.  
---
They have nowhere else to vent.  The support tickets are ignored most of the time and not even processed by Bethesda.  They use a 3rd party company.  Even the modders have submitted fixes for glitches and they have gone ignored.  
---
Maybe you should go to the fo76 filty casual subreddit.  It's going well with positivity.  Bethesda have now burned through 2 subreddits now.  Fallout and fo76.  Took a moment for this place to come to terms with the issues.  Maybe eventually you will too.  
---
Before my current legendary weapons I used a regular Laser Gatling (I have so many Fusion cores, seemed economical) and a Furious Minigun. I never had a problem with the laser Gatling breaking quickly.
---
Na just a bunch of butthurt liars
---
For example people claiming they were unfairly banned for doing nothing till Bethesda said themselves it wasn't true and no one was banned that didn't deserve it 
---
This game is just one giant circlejerk just like no man sky was 
---
Wow. You have modders who clean up Bethesda's mess and that's the sort of tone you take with modders for wanting to help clean up the dumpster fire that is 76? I may be a right royal dick at times, but you've managed to even surpass me in this area. Good job &lt;--- /s.
---
Good for you proving the ban claims to be bullshit.
---
Shame on you for turning what could have been a constructive post into an attack that assumes my intentions
---
I'm curious why you want to one hit everything? I hate games that allow one hit kills on everything as it makes you over powered and the game super boring 
---
Are you implying that OP is lying... Are you that much of a fanboy to not realize that this game is beyond repair at this point? BGS is dead. First they leaked personal info through their support ticket system and now they reverted a patch entirely on accident. How piss poor of a company can they turn into honestly!
---
Tbh, it would've been easier for CM if we were using their official forums to submit feedback. Reddit is just not that effective and most people use it to vent their frustrations
---
Thanks, I needed to know that.
---
No, i'm implying that it's hard to believe things when they're not backed up with the proof that, nowadays, is *so fucking easy* to provide
---
I'm sorry I've intruded on your safe space with my aggressive and antagonistic online behavior.  I should be more careful next time.
---
Careful now.  Bethesda apparently fixed this issue last patch.  Looks like they didnt.
---
However what is concerning is they labeled this an exploit in the last patch notes.  It's not an exploit, it's shitty coding.  I'd say just about everyone has had this bug at some point.
---
Are we having a "no, the mods are even worse than you think"-off?
---
So that's the tone here now?
---
Last time I peeked in here it was all apologetics. 
---
I only use a laser rifle because I got one that nerfs their damage for 30% for three seconds, I made it hairtrigger so I can stack it
---
Go to fort defiance and let the missle launcher do the work 
---
Look at vendors, they say something like "brick building set", cost average 1500 I think.
---
That sucks so hard &gt;&lt;
---
/u/JessBethesda /u/LoneVaultWanderer are there any news from your dev team on fixing this? 
---
Would appear so, unfortunately. 
---
You can get Brick Walls from Watoga Shopping Plaza Vendor for 1068 caps with Hard Bargain +3
---
Is it just random if a vendor has it and I haven't gotten over 1000 caps yet 
---
Brink is at watoga and metal is at harpers 
---
Brink is 1500
---
Metal is 2300 
---
My group is slowly dying. You can only launch so many nukes and we've killed the queen so much the fight isn't even fun anymore. It's really sad.
---
It would of been great to see the guys face when he googled "tattered mole head" and realised that actually you probably do have a life and hes just a noob.
---
Where did I say I wanted the old TSEs back and want to one hit everything? I said "rightfully so" to the explosive nerfs. Two-shot didnt deserve it, it needed tweaking but not that much
---
Show me where the Game tells you that Bulking is for reduced weight so you can store more?
---
BULKING IS FOR SELLING! ONLY FOR SELLING!
---
Did you get it now? 
---
Or do you need a Ingame Loading Screen Hint?
---
I found my brick wall plans back before they were static inventory from the Harpers Ferry vendor. I'd start there as be now has a lot of camp plans. Grahm also has a lot of good stuff if you can find him I know he has a set path if you google how to find him it shouldn't be too hard to find him.
---
Probably in OCE, we get like 2 servers at night
---
Just how you mentioned being able to one hit enemies in other mmo games, even if it's 100s of levels below you it would still be pretty boring to just one hit everything 
---
But everyone likes a different play style 
---
Mind. Fucking. Blown.
---
I'm not a crazy hater of the whole game like many are, but the last patch where they made all the plans available at the vendors kind of ruined it for me. Before, I'd jump on, take a ton of workshops, defend them and get some CAMP plans. Most of the time I already knew them, but probably once or twice a session I'd get something new. It was exciting. Then they made them vendor-available and I jumped on and bought the ones I really wanted. Now, doing workshops seems boring.
---
Then, Friday after work at level 69 I finally went and launched my first nuke, so I crossed the endgame quest off the list. Neat. Of course by the time I was through the bunker I was pretty much out of ammo and stimpacks, so I couldn't even enjoy the fruits of my labor. Bummer.
---
So I logged on yesterday. Putzed around for like 10 minutes and realized I didn't really have anything I wanted to do. Logged off, not even sure I'll log on today (and I have ALL DAY to game if I wanted to...) 
---
I haven't quit, but there's going to be a hiatus until I either figure out something to do or more content is added.
---
I'm mad as hell, and I'm not to take this anymore!
---
TY for all the help im gonna go farm caps now to buy some plans
---
50 cal has far superior durability compared to most other heavy weapons/fast firing weapons in general. A *unmodded* gatling plasma at 200% with weapon smith 5 and luck of the draw 3 still breaks within 4-6 clips (a 250-350 shots depending on your int while crafting plasma cores). A cal 50 is usable without perks, the plasma gatling breaks sometimes after less than a clip eithou perks (laser gatling is able to fire more till it breaks but deals non existant dmg per shot while shooting extremely fast)
---
"Marine combat armor is second only to power armor"...
---
Or tambourines with razor blades superglued on to them.
---
I've only just started experimenting with mutations and Marsupial was one I obtained, thought that mid air stutter was part of the effect. I remember in Fallout 4 with the *Let Me Jump* (nexus) mod installed , I got exactly the same stutter during jump.
---
I've never played in a team or even have Strange By Numbers so the stutter may just be part of an animation glitch when jumping over a certain height.
---
Every exploit so far has been shitty coding..... and lack of testing....
---
"Break it Early Test Application" my ass, it was already broken way earlier than any of us played it.
---
That's OK, have a coffee and a sit down, maybe a snack... always helps :)
---
I'll take your word on that, sounds about right to me sort of. I used a non-legendary Laser Gatling for quite a long time, it was one of my main weapons from like lvl 20-50, and I noticed it broke a lot but it wasn't unusable. Honestly broke about as much as my flamer and I still main a lvl 50 Pyrolyzer to this day so, ehh. 
---
PC only though
---
The ones that say "reee im never buying another Bethesda game again" crack me up. That better include anything *published* by them too
---
PS4

I’ve been trying to connect to servers for the past 7 hours, it try’s to load into world but on the last loading screen it crashes Blue screen and ends back to desktop. 
---
I nodded off around 1am at white springs camp, woke up to a blue screen, it’s never connected since. 
---
Balance balance balance O\_o
---
I guess it is like with the bobby pins, fixed and then reintroduced
---
I've already heard people saying rage 2 and wolfenstine 3 will suck because Bethesda is the publisher

I'm like are you seriously that stupid? People actually believe that Bethesda is just one dev team not 3 separate teams and a whole publishing part too 
---
Okay Tru Tru Tru but we did get him to what looked like zero health and then he all of a sudden he popped up to full
---
Probably though their forums aren't that great. Way too inefficient in terms of screen real estate. A one line comment can take up to a third of my screen.
---
&gt; Reddit is just not that effective and most people use it to vent their frustrations 
---
I think you mean the sub's mods are not that effective. I presume you're not seeing as much on the official forums because the moderators are doing their jobs.
---
If the mods filtered out a lot of the samey crap, it'd probably not look all that different here than on the official forums.
---
True but the duping method required a user to go through a set process.  The camp duplication does it automatically against the users wishes.  Yet they label it an exploit.  Just annoys me the devs are so arrogant to even call it that.
---
Do you mean inventory system or actual looting? The inventory system certainly isn't terrible. I'll agree to that, sure. But the looting mechanism needs some work (for more than one reason).
---
You don't even need to unlock the door, you can jump onto the roof with normal jumps and there's a hole in the roof of that room lol
---
At this point finding out what’s not broken would be easier and faster
---
I mention being if it was another MMO and there was a 170 level difference, you would be able one shot a level 20. I wasnt longing for the old TSEs to be back and I disagree, you should be able to one shot mobs 100s of levels below you, or in my case 170 levels below me. That's why im asking for variety, i.e, scaling monsters, different events, etc What's even the point of the endgame for a soon to be 3 month old game, there's a starvation of things to do and you know what the next mode is? It's the SAME content but free-PvP mode.
---
To be fair to the developers - you have no idea if your fixes will impact anything else or affect other parts of their program.
---
They have their own development pipeline which might not mesh with your fixes. 
---
There's also liability issues here - they can't just on board your suggested changes without vetting them, and that takes time and effort - which might be better spent elsewhere.
---
Another possibility is they've already got fixes of their own lined up for the bugs you're fixing.
---
Bottom line is, you're not a professional - I think you should leave the coding to the professionals who are being paid to do it.
---
I've heard it has to do with rad worms being bugged right now. You basically have to wait for the timer of the effect to end, and exit the session entirely. It's what I heard, haven't tested it.
---
My bad I thought Rifles and Gatlings were different weapons.
---
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **1st Cakeday** BlackDog2774! ^(hug)
---
Yes.  As are certain special stats.  It's pot luck what stats are bugged for the better or worse.  How can a game function with the core mechanics being so broken?
---
You're good. I just like my heavy weapons haha, and I can destroy people in PvP pretty easily.
---
I played the heck out of it for about 100 hours, mostly exploring and building - and I loved it while only getting to maybe level 50ish. I just got tired of seeing so many people who were clearly abusing exploits in the beginning of the game and it seemed like the whole point of the game was to just use bugs to get to level 1XX, use bugs to get a lot of caps, use bugs to get more carry weight, then spend 20 mins killing the scortchbeast queen. It was also really disheartening to see that the only place that got nuke-love was white springs. I understand the advantages to it, but it just felt cheap. I'll come check the game out again when there's a substantial update to content probably. 
---
Also for crafting black powder weapons. Can't remember if it's necessary for repairs too.
---
How do you even maintain a flamer with ammo? Did they buff the ammo crafting for it or is it still expensive af? In my experience it is cheaper to use a plasma thrower (which for some reason deals more dmg per dmg tick than a plasma rifle per shot) 
---
I was playing a stealth sniper build since beta, and recently started up a new character to have a go at the complete opposite of the spectrum, which is melee and power armor.  So far I'm having fun and it's breathed new life back into the game.  It's also nice to go back through the quests and not make the same mistakes I did with my first character.  (ie...tossing full power armor suits I got as quest rewards, wasting tons of scrap on learning every mod for leather armor, hanging on to way too much scrap in my stash, unlocking the different vendors early, and knowing what kind of legendary weapons to look for at vendors)  There's some mild disadvantages to a melee build, but overall it's a much easier experience compared to a sniper.  I'm looking forward to participating in blasts after lvl 60 or so, when my perk loadout is complete.
---
Yep, I think it's due to low player population.  
---
Why not both? This game is a joke and will continue to be a punchline forever. 
---
There's like 100 top priorities. And then a patch comes and it screws up more, and "fixes" things nobody wanted fixed.
---
Bethesda are a massive company. A lot of their staff don't even develop games. Are the receptionists, cleaners, admin staff and etc as evil as the rest of them? I guess they must be because Bethesda lol
---
They all had TSE minigun etc.. Then the ghouls ate them and went to chill at the golf course. 
---
I, uhh, well, you see, umm, hahahahaha. Well.  
---
Let's just say that their used to be a XP glitch that gave fuel as a by-product. I used it as a fuel glitch that gave XP as a by-product and then dumped all that fuel onto a mule.  
---
I have about 100k fuel saved away....
---
I've recently started to use my Ritual outfit again, looks really good.
---
Though I prefer the sack hood gasmasks as I don't like the skull face on the ritual hat. I would absolutely kill for a deerskull helmet compelte with horns.
---
Agreed I'm still sore they ever let a duplication exploot exist in this game. And have done very little to get rid of the crazy amount of duplicated items. 
---
Indeed.  They hot fixed 3 bugs.  1 of which wasn't properly hot fixed, so 2 bugs.  As for the rest of them like blueprinting, they have all been left in 😪
---
People think the same team that made skyrim and fo4 made fo76 lol seriously no research ever 
---
When I tell people that Austin made the game not  Maryland, people lose their minds 
---
Heh, i love it. The only reason i don't use it often is because it offers zero protection against toxic enviroments
---
As a native English speaker, Finnish has always sounded beautiful to me, all the Scandinavian languages actually, very musical.
---
From my loose readings between the lines and understanding of different teams in a company (zero understanding but I know they exist!) I see that what appears to be the issue is Faillout 76 was given to a small team with very limited knowledge of it and the engine then expected to push out a AAA multiplayer and online only game. Bethesda are focusing massively on their new IP and have probably all of their senior devs, QA and others working on that with a skeleton crew for Faillout 76.
---
If I'm even somewhat close to the truth behind this extreme mess then Bethesda managers need a very serious collective wake-up call. After the patch debacle that was patch 5 came and went with no real acknowledgement or apology for the state of game I lost all hope for it. If their game is doing this badly - slammed in the reviews, most loyal fans losing the desire to play, bugs on top of bugs, fixed bugs becoming unfixed and with mod authors throwing in the towel due to zero sign of things changing - doesn't get the attention of someone senior enough to assign a huge taskforce to fix this asap then I am glad to be shot of this game.
---
I won't make an "I quit because..." post since there are plenty enough and I can understand the frustration of everyone here in one way or another. Bethesda took a much loved franchise, put a spin on it by making it online only with no NPCs and expected this half-assed, half-baked mod to Fallout 4 (with a beautiful world) to be 'good enough' to release. Someone seriously considered what some got for BETA and what everyone got at launch 'good enough' to be released. Worse still is that when the uproar of initial reviews came in and subsequent finding of bug after bug happened nothing changed. Three months on I see nothing to convince me it will get better any time soon.
---
Tbh i don't see any other possible way to use a flamer for longer then 30 seconds which is kinda sad...
---
I always said "If you set to to please everyone, you will eventually piss everyone one". 
---
&gt;and lack of testing
---
And lack of caring. Modders have been providing extensive bug reports and fix suggestions since the B.E.T.A., almost all of it ignored.
---
This! As a sniper/scout build, with 20agi and max sneak, it would be obviously perfect to round off the build with Chameleon mutation/armour. 
---
Except the visuals are annoying and tiring, and the sound mildly so. 
---
For real ? Think you are the first one to say that 😁
---
I mean with ammosmith and Super Duper you can craft quite a bit of fuel (IDK If Ammosmith helps) but I just skipped the crafting all together.
---
Yeah haha. Who knew a company could expand into multiple offices?
---
Oh my you can destroy people in PVP easily... you are such a force to be reckoned with 
---
Great to use RadX as an *on off* switch for the mutations, only yesterday started playing with mutations and RadX seems vital when analysing the changes in Special Stats.
---
Im one of us 5% finns on the west coast of finland that speak finnish &amp; swedish
---
My interest in playing dropped consistently.
---
 Started out with connection problems, solved those with help from reddit users and my isp whilst bgs support could not help me. When i finally could play longer sessions i realized it's bugs and flaws.
---
 I was happy when the updates came and things seemed to slowly improve. 
---
Right now the game refuses to start 50% of the time unless i let it check / scan all the files. This takes like 15 minutes each time, and it ends up downloading 26mb of data. Always downloading the same data again and again. Every second time i try to start up... 
---
Next is the stash which isn't extended for like 2 month now. Inv management is fine by me, a big part of every bgs game and i really enjoy it. To some degree, but with fo76 it just feels like a hassle.
---
So for me it is a mixture of technical flaws and content / lack of qol features i'm missing. 
---
Played only 80 hours since release, the least amount of time in any elder scrolls / fallout game i can remember which is a symptom of fo76's problems. I like the map, the exploration, but i feel like i'm loosing my temper with fo76 and don't feel like keep on playing for much longer.
---
Got division 2 for free, guess fo76 is dead for me as soon as division 2 is in a good state ( i don't expect it to be near perfect on launch day either, guess that's the sad truth about games nowadays).
---
They're banning some people with 100s of thousands of identical items. Not sure how that's supposed to fix the problem if the duper has less than 100,000.
---
They'd save face if they either just took thier advice or put them on the payroll already they obviously know this games code better than the people who made it
---
You still only craft 9 fuel (18 with super) for 5 oil(which isn't rare but also not *that* common)
---
I didn't hit anyone or anything. I recently had a 10 cap bounty on me for a misfire on a guys equipment. Another player found me a we killed each other. There seems to be a lack of honor with some players.
---
&gt;It just baffles me that these weapons were included in the game in such a terribly unusable state 
---
Does it though?
---
Good lord. I guess I'm not playing (on PS4) until this is resolved. No idea if any of this affects me or if not logging in will even help.
---
I'm sure it will all blow over when the next "bad" game comes out and the masses move to that 
---
More bandwidth? That's an interesting theory, I'm going to swap to Ethernet from Wi-Fi and restart my router and check my ping etc, thanks for mentioning this, even if it does nothing no harm in trying.
---
It's not my fault I enjoy wrecking people in PvP. I like getting a small bounty and killing anyone who comes for me or chasing down people who have bounty's. My full set of 3\* raider armor is assassin/stealth based so I can crouch in a corner after people fast travel to me and they'll never find me, I don't even show up on HUD standing right next to a enemy.
---
Fuckin rights bud
---
You can look for PA for more cores but they wont be at 100%. The workshops at power plants have fusion core extractor that make 8 core an hour at 100%. You can also get the perk card "power user" which increases the use of a core. Max the perk card and you double the core use. Hope this helps out
---
A better question is how is anyone still playing?  Like, seriously what are you guys doing?  I finished the storyline and had fully explored the map by level 40 or 50.  After that there's really nothing left to do.  And that was over a month ago.  I'm only here now because I accidentally clicked this sub-reddit and not the Anthem one.
---
But I'm sure Bethesda's next round of nerfs will be what drives interest in this sinking ship.  I think that's what turned me off the most about the game.  The house is burning down around them but Bethesda is just sitting there going "everything is fine, the community doesn't need engaging content, nerf that public event so people stop getting free food."
---
Huge difference between one shot kills and bullet sponges... Bethesda nerfed the shit outta everything  👍 and did it very badly. The balance is now worse than before for 80% of the players.. Everyone is entitled to there opinion.. only people who seem to have input these days is people arguing against that person on there own personal view. I know the games boring but borderline trolling here seems to be peoples new endgame 
---
i still have mine on my beta char, i dont really get why they took it away i would love to not spawn right in between 3 mobs if i spawn at my camp
---
The 20-item-ban was pretty much bullshit. The constant disconnects unfortunately are the harsh reality. Do I have a video of every disconnect? No I don’t. In fact, If I take a video of every disconnect or bluescreen, I had dozens over dozens videos by now. If you had almost no issues, good for you, seriously. I wish I could say the same but I can’t. Now call me a blatant liar if you want, I don’t give a shit. But just because you had less problems, it doesn’t mean EVERYBODY ELSE is full of shit.
---
Before the fuel glitch grinding oil was my main past time haha. I do agree 100% that getting fuel is too difficult and I might abandon my pyrolyzer if I didn't have the stockpile. Is what it is, but the Flamer is a king in fights even more so with a maxed Friendly fire perk. Pyrolyzer nerfs enemy DMG, perk heals my ally's, and the Flamer also has nice reach and AOE so it's 100% worth it.
---
Any « best in slot » situation is bad design
---
TS was best in slot, so it was bad design
---
yay, thanks for making the plans cost even more, that is what i always wanted!
---
I have run out of things to do.  I literally login just long enough to check if the 2 good events that have legendary creatures is up and get my measly 1400 caps a day. 
---
 I am saving for the plans I want and I will get a little more play when I get enough for each one.  I literally think they put in these barriers of non-fun to stretch out the content.  They need some sort of repeating random dungeons or horde mode areas badly.  There is nothing to do.  
---
I've seen even more weird shit in Fort Defiance over the past few days.  I've posted before about the disappearing corpses and the ghoul corpses that fall into their non-aggro sleep position and can't be looted and the instant state of aggro once you enter the building.  Since then I've seen an invincible glowing mole rat that will not die (I thought it was just lag, but it took a couple hundred rounds and kept attacking me with full health) and I've seen the walking dead--- ghouls that I kill and move around and make noise after their dead.
---
Ya realize you're not contradicting anything he actually said?
---
Cool but honestly I couldn't give a flying F\*\*\*.
---
&gt; How can I get more quests 
---
Buy a different game. There is nothing to do beyond the same tired events and with the glacial pace of bug fixing I don't think new content will appear until at least six months post release.
---
&gt; Does it though?
---
. . . no . . . no, not really . . .
---
No, stealth has issues now.
---
Dude, people are making a lot of posts about stealth being broken.  A Bethesda rep asked for feedback on it a few days ago and a LOT of people responded to her.  No one mentioned stealth boys.  We all had Sneak 3, chameleon armor, etc.
---
Yes, instead of adding more, just make the stuff we already hate doing harder, that won’t kiss anyone off.
---
Accepting random invites is how I adopted two players in most cases people just want fast travel and on a rare occasion they need rescue because they got in over their head. But two of these players are my adopted vault dwellers I give them modified legendary gear that’s too low level for me ammo that I don’t use and help them level grind and they hand over stuff they can’t use yet. I’m currently waiting on one of them to log in so I can hand over a 3 Star level 25 hunters handmade it’s pretty refreshing having some people to play with after plowing though the game solo 
---
To be fair, I remember lots of people saying they wanted their armor and guns to break faster. And by "lots" I mean zero.
---
Oh shit, I have that outfit. I must have found it there because I definitely haven't gotten enough tokens. I almost scrapped it yesterday, but now I'm going to wear it all the time 
---
Super mutants are, I think, supposed to be fairly oblivious to everything. Strang though that ghouls wouldn't also be. 
---
How are we to know if it's a "dev room item" (not even sure what that means!).  Do these bannable items have some kind of indicator?  If I found a Marine Helmet lying around I would have collected it and used it, no questions asked.  Why would I have thought otherwise, outside of me happening to see this thread today?
---
20 hours since you last traded with them
---
At least you CAN get legendary rifles.

I'm just waiting for more details about PvP mode now. I want to know for sure if it will need a new character or not, because I don't want to play with a character which will become useless in a month or two.
---
Lmfao
---
My radial Wheel is a mess on every restart and if I change my selection items swap about until I've reset all of them, doesn't take long just an annoyance.
---
I actually usually use laser rifles against scortchbeasts.
---
Sure they do shit damage, but the rate of fire more than makes up for it imo (plus I don't want to wast ammo for the one ballistic weapon i actually use).
---
Seen a number of people say the patch broke stealth, there was even a bethesda reply saying they were gathering reports on the matter.
---
Yeah so thats not negated by any armor/reduce effects. Nice to know
---
I think that’s accurate. Do you notice any difference if you drain them to 0?
---
Due to a launcher issue I now have to launch the game from it's exe as the launcher doesn't think the games installed . Installed it 2 times more, only to have it happen again on reboot. 
---
I think this is the final straw for me :(
---
I tossed a ton of junk this morning. Roughly 400 pounds cause I am tired of not being able to store armor sets like I want 
---
Heh. Yeah. I get that. 
---
I'm sure from a mechanics point of view, there have to be spawn points and we were just unlucky enough to be right by them. 
---
They’ve been focusing on Elder Scrolls and Starfield ever since FO76 was released, that’s why the support has been so terrible. 
---
I don't, that's been the pattern for me. I usually get on, play, and empty vendors before I get off to go to bed, then when I get on next, I'm set to do the same thing again
---
I thought the exploding supermutants were just hiding mininukes or something lol. Didn't realize they were exploding like robots
---
That's possibly why they nerfed event frequency. Each server probably has a sweet spot for number simultaneos events, and by increasing reset time more events can run without effecting server stability.
---
Dupers existed in the servers without the game being completely unplayable, so with the recent patch making 1500lb overweight charters immovable, not to mention the bans, there will be less items for each server, and some of that carry weight will get transferred to us.
---
I'm using a base PS4 from 2015 and stability has been mostly fine for a few months.
---
I live in hope. I like the foundations
---
Maybe a change in management would help a bit, I get the feeling BGS is in meltdown, at least the Fallout 76 section.
---
Well now they did it to all the guns the damage sucks for everything in this game. 
---
Turn around time for supper for billing issues it technical support had nothing to do with time to find, fix, qa, and patch bugs. They are just not comparable tasks, on any level.
---
FO4 weapons didn't have levels. Better weapons dropped when you reached higher levels yourself. And recipes were unlocked in batches with leveling and allocating S.P.E.C.I.A.L. points.
---
Soo many perk cards were destroyed this day!
---
Right, because being able to kill groups of enemies from a distance with a RANGED weapon is the same ad being able to kill groups of enemies in melee range.
---
I just jump servers but mine seems to be a toss up between radwprms and disease cures
---
Yeah that happends to, but when you get staggered the full damage is done because you don't stand still. You also use dodgy i think? Dodgy is kinda glitching, when you get hit a player shooting you sees you get damage and you on your side see taken no damage.
---
I had a bounty of 3000, then someone did go for me with a submachine. Seems nothing was happening and then i suddenly died, out of nowhere. Happy that The Division 2 is there soon.
---
I picked one up and went to my inventory to check it out and it was gone 😲
---
&gt; Sure they do shit damage, but the rate of fire more than makes up for it imo
---
Until the higher rate of fire makes the gun break faster and the lower damage means you're getting less mileage out of it every time you leave the weapon workbench.
---
Yeah. That was more of a general statement. In power armor, trying to sneak away from an overhead scorch beast is impossible. Without, at's possible if you haven't already been spotted. 
---
Or was. Not sure now. 
---
So lucky.  You got to play 76 singleplayer, where it's actually really fun.
---
Well....that's not a fair thing to say.  
---
I just started an alt this weekend that hit lvl 22 today and I'm enjoying the generosity of high level players.  One guy that was waiting for me to finish vending at Whitesprings Station left probably over two dozen camp, armor and weapon plans, including some pretty rare stuff like tommy gun, 50 cal and Super Sledge plans.  I could hear him entering the building while I was in the vending menu and said I was almost done in area chat.  He was like no worries, but check the sack outside the door before you leave.  There was also a few dozen units of adhesive, a handful of screws and a pile of stims, purified water and dog food.  Thank you so much, random lvl 200+.  I did this stuff all the time on my main character, and it's very much appreciated when you don't have a lot of resources.  The day before I was around lvl 10 and a lvl 80-90 player gave me a lvl 20 furious sledge complete with heavy spiked mod and 200% durability for free, because he saw I was running around with a flaming pitchfork and looking at lowbie territory to give the hammer to a good home.  I got to use it today, and it made the walk up from Whitesprings Station to Top of the World much, much easier.
---
Some want a fresh start. Some have seen Reddit. Some don’t want “hand outs”, rather the thrill of venturing solo into the unknown.
---
Has been for me, on my second character/different play style.
---
Also, more are crouching hidden and ignoring the other 24 players on the server. Just wanting to chill.

Don’t be offended. Mutual respect.

Mine was staying shared, it simply wasn’t working.  Lvl 2 and never ticked once.  Checked it 3 or 4 times to make sure it was shared and it showed on my teammate’s screen.  It just didn’t work.  
---
It’s really the only effective way for a non PA build to do a nuke event, so I hope they correct it or a work-around is found.
---
Umm...
---
&gt; I want this to be crystal clear so you don't miss anything here - you're saying it's normal to have to wait weeks or months for a support --&gt; response &lt;--? 
---
There’s a building in Watoga, emergency services or something like that that usually has a legendary spawn on the second floor. That’s where I did it. Just hopped there a few times. 
---
Unfortunately yes....and I just got off from 1hr hunting and there are just so many bugs atm....It’s a real mess.
---
I can't speak for the earlier games, since I haven't used a minigun in any of them, but in Fallout 4 the minigun was next to useless. To get it to be anything but a big waste of ammo, you had to more or less build your character around it and mod the crap out of it. After a while I just gave up and gave them to some of my settlers instead. 
---
Overall, I find that heavy weapons underperform compared to how powerful they are advertised to be - unless you get lucky with your legendaries and build a "sabertooth" character i.e. a niche specialisation. 
---
As for energy weapons, the only thing I've had a chance to try more consistently in Fallout 76 is laser weapons, but as many others I've found them to be lacking in both damage and durability. In my opinion, they have not seemed to be worth the effort. 
---
After 200 hours there is not much new fun left in West Virginia, so haven't bothered to fire it up this year (2019).
---
Still plenty of Fallout 4 mods to keep developing in the meantime. Over 3,000 hours and that world just keeps on giving ...
---
No, I haven't. I never even hit 600.
---
Yeah but up keep in ammo mats is stupid.
---
No blue prints.
---
We'll have years to wait for the next title. Hopefully they go back to solo play (or team invite co-op) at least exploiting glitches only affects your game.
---
So if it has to do with rad worms do the mutations come back if you use a disease cure? 
---
I believe it. Almost doesn't make Ultracite things worth it at all, but I guess it's the only end game in the current game.
---
Not sure why you're getting downvoted. 
---
Scorchbeasts *do* have uncanny detection abilities. 
---
On the other hand, I'll also note that 3 supermutants that I coukld barely see in the mist spotted me yesterday as well. ... In sneak mode. 
---
You may be on to something. 
---
I found one, fired 3 full magazines into a single mob before pulling out a baseball bat. GG EZ

Raider Power Armor Suggestions
---
·Paint options for RPA would be amazing. Its my favorite set, but it doesn't get love like the others. I understand that its rusty, but rust can be sanded down and painted over. Our characters can craft power suits, fusion cores, miniguns etc but don't know how to clear off rust? The paint could appear chipped or damaged, I don't care, as long as there's something I can do to customize it like I can with the others.
---
·Allow RPA to drop at level 50. I get that its meant to be the "noob set" and that it can drop at level 15. Limiting it to 45 though doesn't make sense when all of the others can be obtained at level 50.
---
Actually if that's what you really wanted you would have just down-voted my post and ignored it. Looking at your post history (where you repeatedly do this exact same thing) you accusing people of attention seeking is pure comedy gold. 
---
I 'm not. The people that posted about quitting are people mad about TSE nerf. We all knew that shit was over powered, it was annoying as fuck to be playing the game as non TSE and the some TSE DB comes along and nukes all the mobs in the area. They are fucking with my enjoyment of the game. There were daily posts bout people getting mad about not being able to tag mobs because everything was one shotted. After the fix all we saw was "wahhh I don't know how to play any more because now I have to actually aim and play encounters".
---
Then seeing people posting lies about having to take 20 stimpacks because they can no long fight a SB or their lever acting breaking aver 20 hits.... Did they even realize that we know how the game works? I kills SBs all the time with just plan old regular weapons and minimal stimpacks. 
---
Then the lies about "oh my girlfriend doesn't use her account so I stored 1500000 TSE on her account for "crafting" and I got banned WTF"...... Yeah.... ok.
---
I say let those people go. This game is easy compared to most MMOs, if you can't survive FO76 without an over powered TSE weapon then...go back to minecraft. I don't want to play with negative people, I don't want them in the community, and I don't down want cheaters ruining our game.
---
I say bye bye to them. I put a good 10 hours in yesterday on some alts, the servers I was on were pretty active. Felt good to play!
---
They did state this game is the play ground to iron out terrible bugs live servers make catching them easier 
---
I've noticed that Marsupial and Speed Demon mutations work at the start when I log in but then after a couple of fast travels they stop working, then I have to log out and log back in. I also get the weight increase when I log in, I've had my excavator armour with shocks up to 705 before and then it drops to 490 after a few fast travels. 
---
It's not even the next Fallout game for me. The whole situation with 76, including all the past stuff with BGS that's happened even before then has made me concerned for Starfield.
---
Xbox One by the way. 
---
I'm quite enjoying the game, still a beginner though, I don't see people in game a lot (different areas etc.) but I don't mind it.
---
The mood on this subreddit doesn't reaqlly motivate to contribute to it tbh
---
modders can. you'd think the goddamn developers would do a better job.
---
I genuinely laughed at that. At 12 in the morn mind you.
---
\#RadWormsneedlovetoo
---
They absolutely did think about it. The problem is the game has to be released whether it's ready or not. It's how they handle their customers from that point forward that is my main concern. 
---
Oh yeah, but it wasn't like previous games. Fallout 3 had a while questline where you can go out and enslave people
---
Shit that'd be my glory I love a challange for fucks sake build missle turrets it's a workshop use that to your advantage. or server hop and rebuild even fusion generators don't cost much for materials with the contractor perk.
---
Are you playing the same game or are you just fucking blind? This shit happens ALL THE TIME I could make a screenshot or video every other minute!!
---
I agree, i use a lot of QOL mods. But console players can't. And we shouldn't continue to tell the devs that it's ok to let other people doing their job for free.
---
Most of the bugs especially the reintroduced ones would've been found if they actually played thier game patch before releasing it
---
I just intstalled the game. 
---
This fallout game is wrong constructed and it cant be fixed. 
---
I like the world but not everything else around this. 
---
Fkn yessss gotta sort this for ps4
---
This is still a problem. Unbelievable they can't get this fixed after months. 
---
Agreed. 
---
I just posted about this yesterday. My entire survival demends on being able to sneak past creatures and ideally take pot shots at them from a long way off. 
---
Now none of what seems to work. 
---
I was about to say Mr fuzzy is far much harder to obtain considering it has a built in grind that takes forever.
---
The whole story about it being released now sucks but if it didnt comeout now you wouldnt see it evet 
---
Graham is my hero:
---
I got set upon by a bunch of high-level Super-mutants at WhiteSpring.  Graham was in the vicinity and I had earlier traded with him.  He rushed over and fought them off, even getting driven to his knees in the process before finished them all off to save me.  He was really angry.  It was epic.  
---
Personally, I just want vaccines for specific things... Or give us a period of time after curing a disease to be immune to it.. Even an hour would be nice...
---
Build missile turret? I'm brand new to being max level. It's not like I'm fucking decked out in every possible material in the game like half these other people that are 110 or above. 
---
P
---
*Sees 3 lvl 80 Scorchbeasts*
---
"Alright, let's do this."
---
*Sees a bunch of Colonel Gutsies*
---
"Yeah, I think I'll go around."
---
There are different teams with the studio. Some work on bug fixes while others can work on the ideas and designs for new stuff. 
---
They can walk and chew gum at the same time.
---
No thr mutations are muted after cure you have to login and out. 
---
Put some perks into home defense or like I said server hop junk is easy to come by even regular turrets help with scorch beast
---
Yeah, as others are saying this is not a game. It's some psychological experiment.
---
That has happened to me prior ro the patch. I have found that switching weapons usually resets it. (Using the shortcut key on the left on PS4)
---
It can be a pain though when you need to switch to an entirely different weapon or eat or drink something and you can't see the list. 
---
I see. This bug doesnt always happen with the disease though right?
---
True. This is being widely reported. 
---
Definitely a new bug. 
---
Yeah we saw how that worked out with the few last patches, when they tried to merge different builds.
---
My penguin was purple
---
One way to fix the travel fee problem with events would be to have a flat fee (5-10 caps) to join the event. After the event ends, success or failure, all players are then force-fast-traveled back to where they were before joining the event. That way players couldn't abuse events as cheap travel points.
---
I would've been ok waiting a few months for a better game. Sad part is I had more fun in the beta and early game prior to all the nerfs
---
This makes me wanna reinstall the game. 
---
Im dying over here lmao
---
I think i bought it from either the watoga or Harper's ferry bot
---
I'm level 100+ and melee the entire time because the carry weight situation and ammo immediately seemed annoying to worry about... I actually enjoy it in general despite being on my first-gen PS4 with horrendous fps drops.
---
Sadly, it means I take about 142,000 free hits before I ever get to touch the worst enemy in the game. Fought and killed the SBQ once but only because there were 5+ other people and I don't think I'll ever do it again.
---
Not sure if I'm agreeing with you, just chiming in, haha.
---
There no lore breaking bugs in the game, we were over this 100 times, please don't spread fake news. Do you realize F4 code is very small procentage of whole code? Majoroti is netcode which is new. So your whole post is 50% not knowing facts and 50% buliding "theories" out of the previous 50%.
---
This kind of shitty post is worth /r/fallout not here.
---
I got to agree a little, plus its not restricted to height distance. I'm doing a lot of "breach and clear" events where moleminers spawn. The amount of times they are able to reach me with their fists, where my fireaxe can't reach them, is incredible. 
---
I chalk it up to server lag, but it's still frustrating. Even more frustrating when the enemy takes 4-5 hits to actually register that they are being hit. 
---
I go to chem plant in the Mire, start in sewers, there are 2 generators down there and a power armor station on your way up and sometimes theres a sentry and theres 2 more generators on the surface.
---
Then I go to White springs and do mu buying and selling and kill 1 sentry bot on my way to the side entrance for Enclace. You might get 1 core there, but it might take a minute after kill to spawn because the robots have to aggro you.
---
Then from Inside the enclave, I do my buy and trade and then fast travel to Welsh in the Ashheap and make my way north east to the train yard and hope to spawn the battleboys events to kill a sentry and then theres 2 generators on the way. 
---
I usually get about 6 this way and thats good enough for me. I cant even find enoigh things to do to burn 6 cores now. 
---
It's easier to believe it's true rather than it's false.
---
It annoys me to have to swap cards but the daily reposts of this question are starting to annoy me more.
---
&gt;Do you have evidence?
---
Stop spamming your demands for "evidence." This isn't some made-up conspiracy theory.
---
Oh I misunderstood. Yes I really want to be able to stock a vendor with the decent legendaries and chems I have excess of.
---
It’s a bit boring after I spend hours and hours COMPLETING THE GAME.  Consider yourself done with it and move on.  
---
I love the game but they really need to add new content soon.
---
No because I love this game I just asked where to go to find quests 
---
 No clue then , make a ticket with support or smtn 
---
Totally agree. Have a quad laser rifle with a beam splitter running gunsmith 5 and weapon artisan 3 and im lucky if i can make it through a 99 round reload. The CND on laser weapons is straight ass.
---
Ok cool.  I'm happy to know that the plan is actually available.
---
I had a great lvl 50 piece of life saving arm armor that I wore for quite a while. I sneak a lot and the shrouded mod stacked well with chameleon armor. 
---
Yes. That was my thinking. We still can swap cards but need a bit of strategy. I don't know if would be the solution but it is an idea.
---
Issue was it wasnt scheduled to release for another year or 2 but woth all the othet games coming out it would have been in direct competition with its own games 
---
Not only that, but it's an EA game. It's going to be another cash grab. If pwoplwdont think they'll pull some shit, they're out of their mind. 
---
Which sucks, cause it'll sink Bioware 
---
Why would they ban innocent players, that seems counterproductive.
---
This title made me burst out laughing
---
Is the pacifism option for PC only?
---
I’m on PS4,lvl 80, and I don’t have this Pacifist menu option.
---
And that proves nothing besides it doesn't work for you which is why when it works for me I assume it's client side to some degree
---
I raged quit due to server instability and losing 3 queen loots in a row.
---
Im level 150 with 5 TSE heavy guns (So I donyt have to run gunsmith perk) and I even have a tse prime reciver 50 cal for the queen.
---
It doesnt matter what you got. The game is so shit that you'll always find something new to complain about.
---
Workshops arent worth defending against scorch beast if you cant gun them down fast. Id always server hop or run away rather than scorch defense because boolets.
---
The super mutant gangbang spawn is bullshit tho. 
---
Welcome...my name is....CAPTAAAAAIN KID!  Are...yeeee here to.......plunder me gooooods?
---
Yep. 
---
Hopefully they'll undo whatever they did. 
---
My guess is they were trying to fix something PvP related. 
---
Search!
---
Yeah I don’t see this Pacifist option either on PS4, lvl 80.
---
I am sure these are the supermutant suiciders which are not new to fallout. 
---
I don't think the current development team can make any significant changes. I think the code is a Frankenstein's monster at this point.
---
I find what you say to be true, but a lot of the perks haloed me get here.  Now I am gaining more useful perks I can swap in and out.
---
Is it down by the river?
---
Mist dosent effect npc vision from what I can tell, also I'm being down voted because I had the gall to suggest it may be on thier end and they should reinstall and see if it fixes it.
---
Good, we can all move on from this shitshow of a game then, cause let’s be real here...this ain’t getting fixed.
---
I was really ashamed of our communities reaction when they announced multiplayer. It’s like we’re afraid of trying something new.
---
For marsupial, are you over-encumbered? I think that fucks up the mutation, for some weird reason. 
---
I JUST WANT SPURS THAT JINGLE JANGLE!!!
---
For you, but not for me or anyone I regularly play with which is why I recommend you reinstall and see if it fixes it as it's clearly not just server side
---
Don’t flame me for asking, but do you happen to have a Targeting HUD equipped on your PA or are you running Berry Mentats? I was having similar issues on PS4 until I got rid of the HUD mod. Maybe seen 2 disconnects since.
---
Possible. Or since most of them are void of any real creativity they feel the need to play "journalist" and sensationalize this topic for clicks in hopes of growing their shit channel.
---
Also to BONGO BONGO BONGO I DON'T WANNA LEAVE THE JUNGLE
---
I have
---
I was thinking that there was something going on with that, but couldn't figure it out. 
---
Always happen.
---
The mutations are reprogrammed 'spells' so rad worms intensifies the spells and then end the spells when the dosease is cured. You get the spells back on loginbecause mutations are part of your character spawn on login. 
---
Unfortunately it seems that with their attitude towards players having fun, they would rather use nerfs to defend their bad design decisions. 
---
Ugh that line bothers me every time. Combat armor is way better. Unless there is some hidden stat I'm not seeing or there is some sort of set bonus. 
---
Being level 315 doesn't mean endgame enemies aren't going to hurt you since your health doesn't scale with your level like other Fallout games. Those level 81 or 92 or whatever Deathclaw will still hurt.
---
Not to be a dick, but if you mean level 50, there's no possible way you saw and did everything by level 50.
---
Exactly. A team of 3 hand picked modders could fix this game in a month. They've done it before.
---
The next Fallout game isn't coming for many years. You're making crap up to be upset for no reason. Scorchbeasts are also, if you bothered to investigate their coding, very different from Skyrim Dragons and this is obvious when you see them moving... 
---
With no npcs or random encounters. I need little things like that to make the game not feel so souless
---
I wouldn't say that's really true, sure they help but I think it's just about balancing the base weapons as my heavy gunner has never had an issue with damage due to how perfect the base gatling gun is, I feel like once all ballistic weapons are on par with weapons like it, legendaries will be seen as a bonus not a necessity like they should be, but pre patch they definitely felt like a necessity.
---
If you samaged the scorchbeast, you should get loot too. 
---
She didn't necessarily do anything wrong. 
---
The .45 pipe gun is the pipe revolver.  You can learn how to add a stock by scrapping them and it becomes the rifle version.  
---
Not seen it sold, but I’ll keep an eye out for it.
---
I just throw my extra stuff in a container.  Usually the locker or lunchbox at a vendor or an Overseer's cache or the trash can in a Red Rocket.  That way people can still have the fun of finding it on their own and they can take what they like.
---
Its hard on steel, theres farming required, but its not terrible. With perks and all i cab make like 8k anmo per farm run. Usually about 15-20min farm
---
Wait on picking up the game too.
---
Badumtss
---
Don't flood the river.  My van is parked there and I'm probably midway through rolling doobies.
---
What system do you use?
---
Supermutant buttplugs they are.
---
gatling gun/50 cal literally buries the minigun in a pile of its own bullets. gatling uses same ammo but is more accurate and has better dmg, 50 cal use more expensive ammo but can lay a room out quickly, doubly so if you have a legendary
---
I'm on PC
---
Hey, what containers are you referring to? I'm usually feeling super antisocial so I don't use a headset on fallout, but I don't want gear to go to waste because newbies don't understand I'm dropping them paper bags. Not that I've played in weeks... But I will return!
---
It's called "short western revolver" 
---
Heard it all before
---
I did some research to track down the owner, and it turns out to be your mom.
---
I have my t-60 parts in inventory. Using only one PA frame.
---
If i need or want the excavator, i craft it and hook it to the frame. Otherwise while wearing my t-60, i scrap the excavator. Need the space for weapons. Already have to dump enough rare or modded weapons :/
---
If you would only carry up to two or tree weapons, why else do they make the quick wheel having so many indexes?
---
The plan?  It's not just called Plan:Western Revolver?
---
I thought they stopped spawning at generators I haven't seen one at a generator since the last patch. Apparently they thought it was too reliable of a source for fusion cores and we might have cut back on the grind a bit we can't have that
---
I started playing in the BETA and went into hibernation sometime mid-December waiting for a patch that would fix the servers so they don't crash every 30 minutes of play and I lose all my quest/item progress from that session.
---
None of the patches since have satisfied this need.
---
I’ve had it happen to at Watoga fissure site I’ve had 4 spawn they just appear 
---
No the level doesn’t affect learning mods...I haven’t seen an automatic at the vendors 
---
I always scrap the highest I can make. If you are scrapping a bunch and have super duper in luck definitely make sure to rotate that card in. It will save you a tone of junk. I'm not sure if it helps but I usually pop some mentats for the boost in intelligence when I'm crafting weapons. 
---
me and a friend started new characters since the end game contents up in the air having a ton of fun playing characters so different then our originals and in a team also its a nice break from running in a circle farming legends with the hopes of getting something nice
---
I use a non-legendary plasma gatling on all my tough enemies. It completely shreds faster than anything else I have. Does it break too fast? Absolutely. It still does a ridiculous amount of damage in that time. However, I do have 3 heavy gunner perks, gunsmith, luck of the draw, stabilized, and one gun army.
---
&gt; There no lore breaking things in the game, we were over this 100 times.
---
Sorry, you're gonna have to go over that again.
---
Only enemy that is a t sponge is SBQ, weapons aren’t supposed to be balanced
---
A server of 24 people. If only a few thousand play you will likely get a full server. It's dropped to the 25th most played xbox game. Games that came out 2 years ago are beating it. At this rate skyrim will pass it sometime this month.
---
No, you have to mod it to make it longer
---
Did you figured it out? 
---
Explosive I don't think went far enough. Its primary advantage is that its AOE. Itd be a much more interesting choice if it didn't actually increase weapon damage and just did that. The fact it increases damage AND makes a weapon AOE makes it an uninteresting and obvious choice.
---
Two-Shot... Is a victim of its synergy with explosive. If explosive didn't increase damage, it'd be much less OP and could have slipped by unnerfed. Or nerfed less at least.
---
Nerfing two-shot and explosive legendary effects the way they did just made legendary loot drops even more depressing. You can hardly reliably get anything remotely good ever, and now two of the things that have you that rewarding feeling may as well be auto-stim wood legs. The fucking devs haven't been playing their own game or even paying attention to gameplay and it shows.
---
In fallout 1 and 2 they were ridiculously powerful except for finding ammo. Those games were turn based, however and the minigun fired a burst.
---
Shame on you for just trolling.  How in the world do I provide proof of a bug that freezes my console?  Can’t screen grab that.
---
That’s what she said!
---
Being?
---
No but I've brought the Manta Man suit and walk up to other players saying "Hello citizen! It is I, Manta Man! In a pretty cringe worthy try of a hero voice haha. Doing things like that is what redeems the game for me.
---
I uninstalled not because of the TSE nerf but because it's a boring game. Lot's of grind with no reward. With new bugs being introduced after the patch I didn't want to waste my free time on this game anymore
---
Thank you. Now I will go to craft/scrap a bunch of low level handmades.
---
Fallout 76 is one of those games where you really have to make your own fun, the only problem is that Bethesda neglected the tools to do these things.
---
It’s not their job to contain drama.
---
Still playing. Just not on the Reddit very much, because attitudes have gotten toxic and the signal to noise ratio is terrible.  I skim through every couple of days because it's the quickest place to find announcements still
---
Yes this! 
---
Sometimes nothing happens when I hit the weapon bash button. I have to fire the weapon before it will let me bash again with it. I see this primarily when using my bayoneted hunting rifle.
---
Mods?
---
He is super charismatic. Plus, from what I gather he was friends with the chick who organized the bos in appalachia.
---
A while ago it was mentioned that it is a planned feature, but with the current state of the game i wouldnt be surprised if it gets shut down before they even start coding
---
How would you know it's the same server? They're not named AFAIK at least not on ps4. I've had to server-hop multiple times before to get my camp to spawn. Apparently I'm in a popular spot and I have thought about moving it.
---
Really? Interesting. I guess I'm just getting lucky then, I've eaten a lot of spoiled meat at this point and been fine.
---
Yes, better inventory, perk loadout manager and save my stuff
---
Bethesda should have made a statement regardless of what mods did or did not do.
---
Use an updated version post patch 5.
---
Nothing like what he's describing on the ps4, either, at least that I'm aware of..
---
Yeah, but it's relatively cheap to mod it to a decent condition. Plus it's not too much to repair.
---
Considering I ONLY use it against Scortchbeasts I've only had one break twice for me in my 120 hours of playtime.
---
Zoinks! Only roll with 10% my friend the world can’t take it!
---
So screw the console players? Nice.
---
Sad that the difference in cost isn’t bigger between levels lol
---
Sorry.   
---
This is how buggy messes die. By developer neglect and mismanagement. 
---
Yep. People always talk about Bethesda ignoring buds and letting the mod community food their games. I mean, I see where that comes from, because previous games do have lots of mods and unofficial patches to fix bugs. But also, a lot of those mods introduce their own bugs, or game instability. Like how I found vanilla fo4 to be incredibly stable, with very few of any actual game breaking bugs, while I would read posts from people talking about their 200+ load order, and complaining about what a buggy game it was, like maybe those things are related? Mod authors don't have the accountability. They can find a bug, and come up with some hacky work around, and not worry at all if it affects anything else. Actual bug fixing can be complicated and take time, and rushing through it generally just causes new problems.
---
If you see a bug, and think you know what causes it or a possible solution, submit a ticket. Maybe your solution works. Maybe it doesn't. Maybe it leads them to discover a deeper problem. Maybe they don't get around to looking at it for awhile, because they are working on bigger issues.
---
Rad worms bug multiplies all effects on you by 1.5, including mutations.
---
Stopping mid air while falling is from bird bones 
---
I agree with you on the deathclaws. I accept the huntersville explanation, even though it's kind of stretched. I almost wish they had just removed ghouls all together and made scorched variants. Would have made a lot more sense.
---
I thought they were a great idea... they were overpowered.
---
Yesterday I finally had the opportunity to really try out the tse lever. I had a level 50 gun that would one shot level 68’s.. now I have a level 50 gun that take two shots to kill a level 22 super mutant and breaks faster...
---
Just another post buy an op that did absolutely no research and is now looking like a fool lol 
---
Congrats 
---
Only thing they are good for is using up ammo or getting someone's attention.
---
Lead paint in children's blocks. Asbestos in cigarettes. Everything about Nuka World. There were clearly not enough plaintiff's attorneys in this timeline. 
---
How about the visual mods for PC that can be found? How is bannig against those people? Asking for  friend, since I'm on PS4...
---
Starfield is being made by Maryland not Austin, no need to  worry 
---
That wasn’t an I Quit mega thread.  It was a mod attacking all the quitters with a rude ass “k, cya”.  That’s why it got down voted and the mods deleted their rude ass comment.
---
And zeolots for the queen
---
Absolute unit
---
Seeings how the camp geometry loads after you spawn in sometimes, it may have been removed from camps because of that. Workshops have world geometry, which would be loaded before you spawn because it exists as local data. Your camp info has to be retrieved from a server, then the assets loaded from your HDD. They probably didn't want people falling thru invisible camps, have the geometry load, and get stuck. There's always a way to make it work though, just needs to be the right priority on a to do list. 😉
---
Let's not act like we know they're proud of what they're making. It's obvious that passionate people worked on the team, but as someone that's worked for three different Fortune 500 companies, 1 former F500, and 2 local businesses I can tell you that the corporate overhead is the most suffocating factor.  
---
I used to work for Sears as management, and when customers complained about Sears I understood they were angry about the company. I actually AGREED with the shoddy direction the company was going. I have to imagine that the developers also disagree with the out of touch orders from corporate and the stupid executive decisions. I'd guarantee you that they WANT to make a better game but they're just not given the tools or time.  
---
I would put money down that they're very aware that the attempt to nerf TSE weapons by reducing explosive damage of other weapons, but the decision to override that is far above their head. And, in that regard, they MIGHT be laughing at all the complaints. But their laughter would be "HAHA, I TOLD YOU. I TOLD YOU WE NEEDED MORE TIME." When you have your hands tied, you don't quite have the same feeling of responsibility toward the failure of the product. Anyone with a flicker of passion probably had their own vision of 76, but kept seeing it mishandled by the bungling of corporate.  
---
That's my 2 cents at least.
---
/cosigned
---
But it is better for your stash to store PA pieces on a frame, you know that right? 
---
I'd rather stick to a shotgun or melee so I can deal good damage and not have to stop what I'm doing every 10 mins because my main weapon broke and I have to find a weapon bench now.
---
Their forums suck.  Imagine if Bethesda wanted to run a community instead of a game.  That’s their forums.
---
Well hell, the rest of us should just reinstall since your experiences have clearly solved everything for us! 
---
You don’t get more quests other then what’s available.
---
If you’ve done main and side, you got still daily quests
---
And when or If you’ve done everything possible in the game you literally have 3 options;
---
Do them all over with a new character 
---
Or
---
If you don’t want to create a new character, Wait till new content is available via DLC 
---
Or.
---
If you don’t want to create a character or wait till new content, then Stop playing and find something else
---
I bought it from atom shop thinking that's what it did let's you pin point you spawn from fast Trav but no gotta be useless
---
They still spawn in generators, it's just not guaranteed. 
---
I can sell you the small letter set, half the vendor price, OK?
---
Being blindly skeptical is not the same as critical thinking, sweetie.
---
totally. Who in the world is looking forward to playing that mode? Maybe some griefers but who will they be griefing?
---
Fair. I stick primarily to melee when playing.
---
However, I swap to my laser rifle against Scortchbeasts because... Well, I've already explained.
---
But, I do see your point and agree with it. However, the durability of weapons I craft are usually fine anyway (thanks to max INT and LUCK)
---
Nice idea, boah.
---
Yep.   
---
The last buggy straw finally broke the resolve of the remaining fans.   
---
People have now realized that Bethesda Austin screwed up, don't know how to fix all the issues with the game, only care about selling $20 skins in the Atom Shop, and don't have the money/intent to actually put out any real expansions or DLC.   
---
Don't expect to see the career of Bethesda studio director Doug Mellencamp to go anywhere after screwing up Battlecry and then this one.   
---
Nor does the larger Bethesda company intend to fix this mess given how much it would cost. 
---
Ahh ok
---
Couldn't hurt could it? Instead your on the forums  being sarcastic with someone trying to help you. Who had the gall to use logic and reason to try and solve a problem a minority of the player base seems to be having.
---
Feisty one, aren't yah?
---
Yeah, metagaming does break immersion. Always will.
---
I have a sneak/sniper build and mine works just fine. I also don’t use power armors cause they actually aren’t stealthy at all. Also Explosive weapons are stealthy either so when you shoot something even with a suppressor the whole golf club knows you are there 
---
Little note here for ya.  Your position seems kinda let's-pile-on-the-people-having-different-experiences-from-me.  So people saying "it's client-side, you need to reinstall" proves nothing and just solidifies my point those who are not experiencing this issue shouldn't suddenly think they're software engineers and problem solvers. 
---
I saw the .50 hunting receiver last night but I can't remember exactly where I was. I think it was watoga train station or the Phoenix bot vendor at the shopping center. Maybe the Charleston train station or Harper's Ferry if none of those are right 
---
This is satire right? No way you’re this upset about fake guns that fake people used in a fake battle that isn’t even and actual event taking place in a fake world
---
I don't have any explosive weapons (never seen one). What's your build and what armor/weps do you use?
---
This is my experience.
---
LOL, it's always fun to DC down near Fissure Prime or in Glassed Cavern, log back in and get popped into a server with a nuke happening as a stealth player with standard armor.  Even if I DCed at full health and minimal rads, I'm lucky if I can mash the 9 key and equip my favorited hazmat suit before I die.
---
I was able to complete this by just going to the cavern. Seems that when the transponder is active, it crashes. 
---
Anyway, just bypass everything and go to the cave. Worked like a charm. 
---
I wonder if you even have to have the quest, now. I was able to jump straight to the abandoned dump site and get the bunker access without the chain completion, too. 
---
Makes me want to run a new character to test it. 
---
I much prefer using subforums for relevant information. Reddit's "tags" are too annoying. But yeah, Bethesda's forums are dire and underused.
---
What are people's favorite non-legendary weapons? I typically stick to my sword, hunting rifle, and combat shotgun, but I've noticed that some enemies just absorb all of the damage, despite being a relatively low level.
---
Being able to do that now, in a hazmat suit (never used power armor), with the horrible fps of my PS4 in a goddamned nuke zone, has taken hundreds of hours of careful tweaking of my melee build. And it's 2-3 shots, not one, and I can't take many hits,  and I constantly eat and drink for buffs. 
---
And I NEVER find good weapons. Used a Bladed Mole Miner Gauntlet until I finally found an extra claw mod for a basic deathclaw gauntlet, which I've used ever since. Have a Furious Deathclaw gauntlet stashed, waiting for another extra claw mod. 
---
I'm melee because carry weight was stupid early on, now I'm nearly fully mutated, level 100+ and it takes way too long to level up and try out different builds that will be comparably weak for a long time. It's not all sunshine and roses for melee is what I'm saying, it seems to suck for everyone, and we do what we have to do to get by! Imagine how much fun I have waiting for SBs to land. And they fucking nerfed White Knight? My new favorite perk... It made life against SBs bearable. Who cares about Whitespring bloated ones?! Hope my rant was coherent!
---
Players don't know the value of items. This is why I often check for explosive weapons and legendarys sold at sutton station vendor. I do get lucky there.
---
I just do it for the glowing meat and all the sweet steel scraps.
---
Pick up and move your C.A.M.P. unit to another part of your settlement. Your fast travel spot is relative to this object, so with a little trial and error you can get it closer to where you want to appear.
---
They take 22 hours to 'reset' and then it's 50% chance respawn after that, so if you hit 6 a day you'll average out 3 a day. 
---
Bravo!
---
Whitesprings has all the coat hangers for steel, just look in the shops
---
I am unique and uniquely modest and that's a fact :D
---
You just captured what I've been thinking for a few days now.
---
I used to run Harper's Ferry with a TSE Lever Action and it was a little too easy. Now I'm getting my ass kicked with the same gun because it's weaker than my AA Handmade. I'm literally shooting 2 bullets that explode, but everything takes an entire clip to kill unless I crit everything.
---
Wow, it just hit me.
---
That was my initial reaction, that there's a weird (and probably unintentional) meta here.  Because when you look at the interactions between the Free States and the BoS trying to recruit them, you can see the tension between the Free States' scavenged resourcefulness and the BoS's orderly discipline.  Dealing with ambiguity is not a strong suit of the BoS.  They value familiarity.

Fantastic idea

Get a headset. It's a much better experience being able to talk.
---
Lol, once you beat the SBQ it should give you a direct link to market subs...becuse **the endgamw of FO76 is Reddit.**
---
Yeah, I did the same. When you pick a new perk card, I've found the number of cards reported below the card is often times inaccurate especially if you're using more than 1 level up in succession. It used to bother me for a bit, but I'm over lvl 100 now so it's more just an annoyance as I have to scroll more to find the right card. I would like to destroy them (refund or no) just to get rid of them.
---
well you can craft a Legendary Gatling Laser into a Ultracite one so. No Never seen a looted one. But cab craft them on Legendarys 
---
It’s crazy living in a world where people like stuff that you don’t isn’t it?
---
I think the problem with stealth is the berry mentats/targeting HUD issue - even if you dont have it on you or your PA, someone in the area might and blammo, stealth broken.

---
Starting to think they're level locked, as my level 15 alt can't find them anywhere.
---
My level 40 main sees them in Watoga though.
---
I also have a carry limit issue with power armor but mine is slightly different.
---
My carry limit is 430 when I log in with my excavator armor.
---
When I get out my limit goes to my normal armor limit of 240.
---
When I climb back in my excavator armor my limit is down to 330.
---
Also I've tried to test Zoobie's issue, if I equip say a clown hat while in power armor it will drop my limit to 230 but will go back up to 430 or 330 (depending on if I've left the armor since log in) after reequipping excavator helmet.
---
Wow it's way easier to power up a fusion core generator at the power plants or craft them with flux. I take over 2 powerplant workshops within 30-45 minutes I have enough cores to last a few days. If I keep them longer great someone else wants them after that I feel the exchange of materials was worth it. No need to pvp (though I ocasionally will)
---
They nerfed the spawn rates.
---
&gt;This kind of shitty post is worth /r/fallout not here.
---
This sub is beginning to backbone r/fallout as of late.
---
I think you may have read that wrong, or maybe I'm reading it wrong.  It doesn't seem to me that OP is saying screw console players.  Seems like they're saying mods aren't an option for console players.  And they're right.  It sucks for console players that they can't use mods for QOL improvements.
---
I'm just speculating, but maybe they're leg only mods?
---
Turn all the super sledges into commie whackers. My TSEs now do about 1/4 of their pre-nerf damage. For some that’s understandable. For one like the minigun?  It’s almost useless now. 
---
Looooooool :Dddd
---
There were quite a few of these posts right after release.  If I remember the responses right there were some people in beta that would get past doors by placing the fast travel mat on the other side through windows, so they took it out.

---
His second paragraph doesn't even make fucking sense. 
---
I believe mod unlocks are specific to the piece not the set so you'd have to learn them for the arms by scrapping like you did for the legs

Fallout: 76 Disconnects
---
First of all, Taggerty was a known duper.  And this was way before the nerf, so they really have no excuse.
---
The BOS died because they refused to get on ventrillo. No one knew who was supposed to get the queen to land, and half of them were lowbies that hid in the shed.
---
I did. I played with Laser/Plasma Rifle and I can tell you how bad and useless the damage was, also they used to break too damn fast. I didn't play 76 since couple of months or so, so I hope they are fixed by now. 
---
We used to be able to set the RGB values of the pipboy hud in Fallout 4. That's actually one of the things I looked for when I started playing Fo76. I think (don't quote me on this) the RGB HUD values also translated into different color hue for the pipboy flashlight feature.
---
It worked, thank you.
---
The pipboy light is the screen being very bright so they you would technically have to make the screen brighter
---
Been there, running as male in female swimsuit. Ridiculous. But im more into wood armor.
---
Asking this sub to stop asking for flaming unicorns is going to be about as effective as asking Bethesda for said flaming unicorns.
---
As funny as that is, we aren't the BOS, they didn't have legendaries, and they left their broken ones all over the place, and repaired others. Did they use parts from other things?  Probably? Did they maybe have some machining technology they horde to themselves, also probably.
---
Ps4 you can go into settings and pull up your error log.
---
I'll be doing just that in a minute to show OP that complaints about crashes aren't bullshit rhetoric
---
They’re grandfathered. No new ones can be found as Bethesda took the explosive effect off plasma guns, laser guns, the flamer, and the cryolator. 
---
I'm not sure i understand what you mean by "weapons arent supposed to be balanced" ? Like they are in the game but they voluntarily force us to use only some of them because they have better stats, durability ?
---
Too bad PvP mode doesn't bring any new content to the game. We haven't heard anything yet about Bethesda's plans to create new content. Those who are already bored to the end game won't get anything new from PvP mode.
---
LMAO how many of you found those from drops you most likely got them from a friend who duped or bought them from a duper thanks for fucking up our game and forcing nerfs hope it was worth it.
---
Your shotgun is the same weight as my 50 cal Dragon Claw (without any attachments). Honestly after handling my &lt;cough&gt; pellet rifle, I am having a hard time thinking of any gun as heavy as 20 pounds that isn't a heavy gun designed for use with a bipod. The CZ 750 Sniper is an "elephant gun"/precision shooting rifle that is just a hair shy of 12 pounds. And that is the weight range you will find most rifle stocked weapons that can put down mammals larger than say... 180 pounds, is going to be in that range. 
---
           
---
They start off the base weapon with no stock and no attachments with too much weight and then every attachment is another couple pounds. My rifle is 8 pounds alone. My bayonet, night vision advanced optics, and all the associated attachments brings the weight to 13 pounds. That is really pushing my personal limit on what is comfortable to shoot from a standing position. So yes, I could see attachments weighing 2 pounds, but only for select cases. I also have a hard time thinking of a rifle I have ever come across (rural Midwesterners have a lot of rifles_ that weighs 20 pounds. Nope, don't remember ever seeing one. 
---
          
---
If anyone reading this has a 20 pounds gun, please post pics!
---
I have a modded hunting sniper rifle, a Two Shot Combat rifle and a TSE handmade. My armor is always changing but I keep my legs with the muffled mod and 1 piece of Chameleon armor. I have all 3 rifle sets maxed, max sneak, max concentrated fire, max tank killer and max covert op. 
---
I thought they handled it pretty gracefully like this.  They found a way to make it somewhat tangential while still exploring the origins of the BoS.
---
Plus, the fact that they were kind of left high-and-dry makes Maxson a bit sinister, like his ambitions were far larger than what he could actually pull off, and he refused to admit it... which is something passed down to 
---
I think heavy treated leather is even better then the best combat armor too, except maybe for the chest, in which case you have so much energy resist the best final piece is heavy metal.
---
It's such a shame because they're fun to play around with 
---
Exactly how it has felt. They have made the games with evil corporations so much they slipped into the mold they created
---
I run a sneaky sniper build and I do just fine. I can kill most enemies in one to two shots and remain hidden 90% of the time and if I am spotted all I have to do is change positions and I go back to caution for that lovely sneak damage bonus 
---
What's your build? What kind of weps and armor?
---
I'm still iffy about buying, is it a fun game to play solo or do you think it requires a few friends to play? Also is the story big enough to keep you wanting to go back and keep playing? Just completing a few missions and then pointless walking around gets a bit boring for me.
---
PS: Have a Gold for your excellent post ;)

Where are you from ?

Friendly reminder that we're all just here to play FO76 and coming off as an asshole on the internet is a waste of time for every involved. Just because someone likes a digital object you don't doesn't mean you gotta be keyboard warrior.

Ok, I know this is going to be unpopular, but I'm gonna just suck up the down votes like a big boy.
---
The only time I have seen Bethesda knowledge mods and mod authors, is when they see a way to make money off of them either directly (Creation club, steam paid mods, atom shop) or Indirectly (Mod library on [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net))
---
Just like with Skyrim and Fallout4, Fallout3, etc.  Bethesda has blatantly ignored the community patches and steadfastly refused to fold them into the games. 
---
/u/Aten_Ra as much as I respect you for trying to get Bethesdas attention, to help the community, I fear you are barking up the wrong tree.  Their history says you will get no traction, and the best option is to do what the community has done before, roll up community patches and publish them via the Nexus.
---
It's depressing, and a pain in the ass having to maintain something like that considering the patches rolling out breaking things more than fixing things. But, at this point, and I fear, in the future, it's going to be the only way to get your fixes into the hands of the users.
---
Martial Artist applies to miniguns btw. I still use 50 cals as my main guns but mainly cuz 5mm basically costs the same as 50 cal ammo to make so why craft it?
---
Wife and I took one of the power plants and powered up the fusion core generator thingy. That thing cranked out a bunch over two hours.   We set up purifiers and extractors and had a pretty good time of it. 
---
Unfortunately that's exactly how we got here. How much of Fallout 76's bugs were in the game engine and left over from Fallout 4.  How many of those issues were fixed by the modding community.  Now Bethesda has made an online game that can't use any mods on the back end, where they have the most issues.  They released a game they thought was finished that if it was single player modders would have had mostly fixed by now an at least on the PC no one would be as upset.  Problem is it's online multiplayer and modders can't fix anything on the back end.  Even if they could that leaves console players with sadly a lesser experience due to the lack of mod support.  
---
In other words Bethesda has half assed games and relied on modders to fix them in the past.  Now they can't and it really shows.
---
I think maybe the problem isn't quite so much with the weaponry. I wanna say that at their highest levels the weaponry does about the same amount of damage as they did in FO4.
---
Problem is, these assholes made the enemies damn near invulnerable and brought back weapon durability, so it fucked up the balance.
---
But that's fine, nerfing every weapon and crafting perk some more will surely help the problem.
---
The rapid thirst is getting ridiculous and you don't even need a disease or mutation. 
---
OK that would make sense, so it is scrap what I find or craft a shed load of low level pieces and scrap them in the find-a-mod-lottery. Thanks very much I'll go make and break some s\*\*t :)
---
If you enjoy the post then check out my other posts, my /u is always open. I do yet need to cross post my suggestion for mod greenlight so we can help get the ui and action Bar customize streamlining finished up ( / creation club , possibilities are endless if beth could make the right choice here) though
---
Yeah, and the shorts of examples you have, were customer support responded, not responded from the dev team. Is your whole complaint that each ticket submitted should get a generic "we've passed it on to the team" reply?
---
Well let's see it's not server side or EVERYONE on the server would be having the same issue and that's clearly not happening, that leaves only one other possible cause, some sort of iether file mismatch or overwrite failure causing issues which is why people are saying to take an hour and reinstall the game as it may very well fix it.
---
 Instead people(those coming here and saying "your wrong I'm right because I say so") like you are trying to avoid doing anything that could fix the issue accusing anyone who suggests a reinstall could fix it of blaming the victim ( which is assinine as saying it could be a client side code issue would still be Bethesdas fault) then you sit on your haunches and hope Bethesda can fix it for you instead of taking an hour to try yourself.
---
Maybe this is just me but back when I first started gaming everyone tried everything they could to fix the issue before going to the devs because chances say they could at the least learn more about what's causing the issue then if they couldn't fix it they went to the devs.
---
Could not said it better myself 
---
Save your caps get chemist and lvl 3 super duper.
---
Craft diluted stims requires 1 stim and 2 pur water. (You'll get 4 diluted stims with chemist)
---
And evertime super duper kicks in you'll get 8 you will have more stimpacks than you know what to do with 10 stimpacks and 20 purified water can potentially get you 80 duluted which isn't uncommon
---
Don't seem to be, others mention alloyed metal arms in posts, *fatboyonsofa* below says to scrap similar items to unlock mods so that's what I'll try.
---
I traded for mine.. Caps. Duped? Probably. The reason folks like us wanted one was because we like one-shotting trash. It is what we did in 4 at the end and it saves on grinding mats/ammo. It was the only option for an end-game rifle build. That speaks even more to how much thought they put into end game.  
---
The TSE rifles were an item in game that dropped, just like the melee weapons. It was just more rare. Without them Bethsoft is driving everyone to Melee. Not everyone likes melee.
---
Yes, but it is a mod, and the mod needs to be installed on both parties to be used. If the player is new, he/she most likely will not have the mod installed and wont see the text.
---
Thanks. Thats what i'm saying. A lot on people on this sub forget that we represent nothing compared to the player base. Lot of people play on console and do not have a single clue about mods, and thats sad that they cant have what we have, like the perk manager or chat.  
---
Also, when i talk about SBQ being a bullet sponge, i think about the same majority of players which never had the chance to beat her. ( I play hardcore and killer her dozens of times, but, again, most of the players did not). 
---
Thanks for clearing radworms up. Was loosing my temper not knowing why mutations are fucked
---
Yeah I know sucks more repetative tasks. I'm doing the same with a radium rifle very time consuming good luck.
---
The sound makes me smile every time :)
---
I think Bethesda might be getting an inkling into how valuable modders and their QoL foxes were to their previous titles.  Imagine playing New Vegas or 4 bone stock after Bethesda dropped the mic and peaced out on the game with a variety of issues still existing.  I think those games are dated but still good largely due to a dedicated mod community that fixed broken quests, instability issues, general QoL optimization, and mods that tweaked balance and gameplay to individual preferences.
---
The problem is that 76 is just as good a game as 4, but in multiplayer with no mods allowed, Bethesda is forced to plod forward on their first committed relationship without their fanbase fixing everything for them.  In many ways, I think they're learning as they go.  I'd have no problem with that from an indie developer with an ambitious vision, but this is an AAA company with spectacular past successes and a nearly iconic property to maintain.  The original Fallout was a big, big deal in the late 90's.  It basically revitalized PC RPGs.
---
I would not be mad at Bethesda hiring modders as freelance consultants and private contractors to get the game into a proper state sooner rather than later so that they can focus on the future of the game, rather than endlessly stitching up old wounds.  Clearly they don't have enough hands on deck.
---
But being an asshat that doesn't like this one means you should just gtfo.
---
Mine is still working fine. I use a Night-Vision Hardened Lever Action Rifle (.45) with suppressor that does 149 damage per shot. With my perks, I get 3.50x boost in damage when I'm hidden.
---
Perks:
---
* 3x Rifleman
---
* 3x Tank Killer
---
* 3x Expert Rifleman
---
* 3x Master Rifleman
---
* 3x Covert Operative
---
* 2x Mister Sandman
---
When I'm fighting SBQ, I like to use my Recon Prime Hunting Rifle (.308) with suppressor that does 139 damage per shot. It uses Ultracite ammo.
---
My armor is all light leather armor.
---
* Chamelmeon Boiled Leather Left Leg
---
* Lightweight Studded Leather Left Arm
---
* Unyielding Studded Leather Chest Piece
---
* Weightless Girded Leather Right Leg
---
* Weightless Studded Leather Right Arm
---
* Treated Road Leathers
---
* Urban Scout Armor Mask
---
I have 182 melee defense and 340 energy weapon defense. There's probably better stuff out there, but I've been really lazy about upgrading my armor. Defense hasn't really been an issue for me as I have my Ultracite Power Armor on hand any time I need it.
---

---
Dropping paper bags is great but often with the way my character looks most think it's a con someway. So now I just drop them at flatwood first aid containers, the till and the dead bodies at the trader.
---
I have seen riverbank and rural Indiana, Missouri, and Ohio. I can only imagine West Virginia. US 52 gives a good sample of rural America from the coast to Canada. You can see small towns that have been abandoned for years, but one family seems to still stay. You will see side roads that are indiscernible from a farmer's easement for getting back to a field. It is a beautiful lonely road trip.
---
I really wanted scout armor to be better because it looked cooler
---
Public multiplayer in a nutshell. You can't stop it with public shaming, and blocking tools there will always be another asshole. A friends only mode is the only real solution to these encounters.
---
Nice. I'm also in mostly leather but with some combat armor mixed in. Is there a real benefit to going with light leather over higher DR/ER pieces that you notice?
---
I use a lever action a handmade and will pull out a guass rifle when needed and run a full sentinel assassin set and carry a chameleon arm to swap in and out when I'm sniping.  I also run a bunch of mutations with marsupial and bird bones for mobility and eagal eye for the boost to crit. I have healing factor to save on stims. As for perk card all rifle card are a must along with tank killer and one level of consintrated fire for those awesome vats head shots. Rank 2 of the sniper perk makes aiming easy no need to max it. In agility I have sneak and covert op at rank 2 and have escape artists along with white knight to keep my armor cond up or I swap in action girl/boy to get more AP refresh in luck you need bloody mess to up damage and if you run mutations then starched gens and class freak if you dont use mutations then anything that helps with crit damage.  Hope this helps if you want I can try and give you my exact build when I get home.
---
What's the baggage thing. I know one thing that annoys me are reposts about perk card decks atm.
---
I think fusion core generators are broken to producing .8 per hour instead of 8 per hour?
---
Flux crafting is def an option, I just prefer killing and I make rounds around the map for selling/trading for caps, also, you might run into legendaries. 
---
Why are you talking to yourself?
---
I built around using 4x4 floor pieces leaving a fairly large gap, then filled in as much as I could with the 1x2 or 1x1 pieces. My main floor didn’t line up well, which is why I used walls on that level, and I also wanted a pass-up for wiring. On the second and third floor, I got pretty lucky with getting floor pretty close. I filled in the gaps using rugs, they actually act as solid floor and by careful positioning you can get really close to fully sealing around the tree. 
---
Fallout 4 with the sim settlements mods is more fun so I've been spending time in that. 1200 caps a day limit and constant xp/spawn nerfs pales in comparison.
---
Ok so keep asking for nerfs because your butthurt over your precious TSE makes sense go ahead and screw everyone over for your mistakes
---
Thanks much, I appreciate the detailed rundown! I'm just looking for ideas on what people consider essential, and to get a sense of what armor and guns folks are using. I think you covered it.
---
I need to get an Instigating sniper rifle and see if the first shot stacks with my build. (Would be 5x damage at full health if it actually doubles) I am also looking into an Anti Armor and a Furious later on 
---
You could have 1 shot then with a combat knife though. Makes total sense to me. I stopped playing for the same reason.
---
I mean specifically, how? What Perks, what equipment?
---
BETHESDA!!! MAKE THE MAP RANDOMLY GENERATED ON EACH SERVER SO ITS ALWAYS INTERESTING TO EXPLORE!!1!11!

I did it last night in 15 minutes away from the workshops I had 3 cores each if anything they're making more than 8/hr probably closer to 12 but they'll only store 3 at a time so check them frequently
---
In lieu of a hat Bethesda will be sending you a plastic grocery bag to wear on your head instead, with a handy zip tie to secure it in place!
---
wish in one hand, crap in another, see which fills up first. This game is still a train wreak with all the stupid bugs out there. My latest is jumping into the game and being beat on by invisible baddies that kill you before the server can fully load. I play on Xbox and just love the 2 logon screen we are now getting, when you do finally get on you are no where near where you left off when you last played. Fun Fun!!!!
---
There was already an official answer that there would be no private servers. I will be servers hosted on Bethesda cloud with mods from Creation Club.

I got in the habit of adding Fallout 76 players I would see often in the world to my friends list. I had to go through that list the other day and delete almost all of them because no one is playing anymore. Makes me sad.
---
I forgot to add in gun fu.  I can go to whitesprings and agro the ghouls there and just pull up vats and head shot them all one after the other until my ap runs out
---
For early game healing i use healing salves which you can craft with soot flower and bloodleaves 
---
Because 50+ “I quit here’s why” posts are a slog to get through when you’re using this sub for actual useful information.
---
I get people gotta rant, but I overshadows discovery posts or helpful posts with minor gameplay hints. At this point we could use a new player question sticky but it would probably get bombed with trolls and complaints about bugs.
---
Bethesda really showed their true colors admist all this and honestly I don’t know if they can recover from this. A part of me hopes they learned their lesson and moving forward will make the right decisions, but after all this, idk anymore. 
---
It's my opinion that if I'm a sniper long range build, then I'm usually not in a position where I have to worry about melee damage. With that said, I do understand that close quarter combat is unavoidable at times. That is why I carry my Ultracite Power Armor with me. This is also the reason why I favor Weightless pieces since I have the added weight of the Power Armor to worry about. If I were melee, it would be a different story.
---
So given my game play style for this particular build, I can safely say there is no additional benefit to mixing in heavier but far more defensive pieces. Unless of course they are legendary and they provide a boost to damage somehow.
---
They are two separate weapons. What you are talking about prime gatling laser receiver. 
---
I agree. It is ridiculous. However, it is necessary to make the claim. Another solution would be to create an alternate account, transfer over the materials required for crafting, and do everything there, recording the entire process.
---
Again, I know it's absurd, but one can't claim that he's "never duped," or is "fully legit" without proving it. It would be *way* too easy to have duped in the past, off camera, and receive a ban at a future time on camera.

Who is going to run around with wasted points in Hacker or Lockpick full time?

Having to dedicate 5 points to not having your guns break before you even get to wherever you are headed is bad enough.

okay neo, you know how many players it's losing?  Must be hacking their servers.
---
You at least knew enough to know he was French. That episode of Dexter’s Laboratory must have come in handy after all.
---
Can we stop reposting about bitching about people wanting to improve the game.
---
If you’re talking about the fusion generator in your camp, you can’t get fusion cores from that. Fusions generators in the world have a chance of spawning a core in them.
---
Also if you arent into pvp then your armor is more flexible.  A full set of light weight with the chameleon mutation is really helpful for staying hidden. 
---
oh yes it did break stealth big time!
---
what ive noticed so far
---
-caution and danger sometimes stuck for no reason, fast travel will not fix it
---
-equiping my sniper rifle immediately gets met with danger and shots fired no matter how much stealth i got in cards, what lvl the enemy is, what chamaleon i got on, or even if they are in a line of sight, as long as i am in their vicinity.
---
-sometimes unequip a weapon will make it go back to hidden
---
also marsupial is acting up a bit too. It will be gone and i check my status and my mutations are not supressed?!?! ....leaving world and joining again fixes this for me.
---
Railway rifle does the same thing. I showed some friends on the back side of Whitesprings clubhouse and they all told me the real challenge would be the Monorail.. without power armor..
---
BOS used TSE Miniguns though pre nerf. They could do some damage.
---
and yet, there are various reports they are doing just that.
---
everything Bethesda has done thus far in regards to Fo76 was counterproductive. so no surprises there.
---
LOL, I was going to get it, and both the treasure map #3 and the swarm of suitors doen't work! 
---
No biggie, but bummer; anyway, the whole Toxic Valley is a useless area, except for the workshop with the 3 acid resources.
---
Nice I have 1 chameleon piece but haven't worked on mutations yet. I think I'm a long way from starched genes
---
PvP sucks it’s not worth getting in battles with other people just to have to do 2 hours worth of chores to fix your equipment and get your ammo back
---
I wasted points in both of those before I fully grasped how the leveling system actually worked. Now I have to wait till level 50 before I can start correcting that mistake...
---
Let us know how it goes!
---
Crazy varies by person.
---
For example, I'm wrapping up Anthem beta weekend right now, and it got me thinking. Could FO76 benefit from ammo NOT being craftable? That is, ammo would work the way it does in Anthem, The Division, etc. Only a handful of ammo types, and enemies drop them a lot, and sprinkled around the world are containers and ammo boxes, and you interact with them and all your ammo resets to max.
---
Is this crazy? To some, probably. But hear me out:
---
For one thing, imagine how much more FUN it would be, if you can shoot your gun without having to worry that it fires custom tooled $200 cartridges at 10,000 rounds per minute, and that it costs $400,000 to fire this weapon for 12 seconds. Imagine being able to use any gun, be that the Minigun or the SMG, and NOT worry about where you're going to find all the lead, plastic, etc., to get more ammo. Yes, this is not an arcade game, it's a survival game, so crafting and survival should be a thing. But there's nothing stopping us from running around in Ironman suits, shooting any gun like it's going out of style, after hours of server-hopping and farming, which is NOT fun. All my proposal would do is eliminate this specific grind for mats to make ammo. 
---
Another benefit of this would be - less trash for servers to keep track of. Each char would just have an ammo count for all ammo types, and that's it. No need for them to be inventory items. Much simpler. 
---
Currently, a lot of weapons are 100% useless because they break instantly, and their ammo is prohibitively expensive, or at the very least inefficient. Which kills variety. 
---
Crazy idea? Maybe. But the more I think about it, the more I like it. I try to picture Anthem or The Division forcing you to farm for and craft every bullet you fire, and it would be beyond obscene. In FO76, it's somehow the norm. And then everyone acts surprised at how ubiquitous the melee builds became. Well, durr, it's damage without worry about ammo or weapon condition (very cheap to repair). OF COURSE it's going to be popular.
---
And when it comes to survival, they can just shift the burden towards gameplay, away from the grind. See The Division's Survival mode. It's set in a storm, and if you get too far from the fires, you quickly freeze to death. You need gas masks of various quality to go into infected places. And so on. That sort of thing. Environment can be a hazard. In FO76, the "survival elements" boil down to GRIND, GRIND, GRIND. There's nothing interesting or exciting constantly looting food to keep your gluttonous character alive. It's not challenging, it's just busy-work, something for us to do, because otherwise character gets unplayable. It's boring, repetitive, unfun. Same with keeping gear and weapon repaired. Everything breaks so damn fast, and then it's grind baby grind, just to keep it working. 
---
Easier way would be to reduce the bonuses low-condition gear and weapon have, BUT KEEP THEM OPERATIONAL at all times, that alone would be such a massive QoL improvement. Where for important things, you'd rep everything up, but for day-to-day stuff you could let your gear deteriorate but still keep it playable. Again, crazy idea? Yeah, maybe. But QoL improvement would be great. 
---
That's the thing right now. A lot of crazy ideas are aimed at reducing the **tedium** of THE GRIND. And Bethesda is working their hardest to make this game as tedious as possible. As if that will stop the players from figuring out there's no endgame. Yeah, we know there's no endgame, Bethesda. It's been a quarter of a year since release. We've all reached endgame. We know there's nothing there. Making the game more grindy by neutering White Knight is not going to make us any happier about the lack of endgame.
---
What level are you currently? 
---
....and the cycle repeats.
---
60. My build was a disaster so Ive been spending a lot of points fixing it. I might actually have the first rank of SG but lots of other stuff to fix first
---
There are plenty of places that will start quests by visiting. The house near Monongah Power Plant, the Mistress of Mystery questline (if you haven't done it already), etc. There are always nice bits lore and story to pick up by collecting holotapes. Collect and scrap rare weapons to unlock mods. Build the world's coolest camp. Team up with lower level players and help them out on their quests. You get the idea.
---
Thanks! Got one. You can get on the roof and drop into that room through a hole if you don’t have enough lockpicking
---
well, This post was mostly in jest... It is pretty clear they are more interested in nerfing things than buffing them.
---
These cold winter evenings must be flying by!
---
personally i run a fully mutated sneak-glass cannon crit support build
---
unyielding on each armor piece grant's me over 30 Perception, agility and luck
---
granting me near unlimited vats headshot criticals with extremely high damage because of the adrenal reaction mutation and nerd rage (even when not getting sneak bonus because that's hella buggy atm)
---
if you're interested i could boot up my game to look at my perk cards. 
---
Don't they all have player specific loads so everyone get the overseer stuff? As in. I take my share you still have yours... so if I put stuff in there doesn't it just disappear to the ether?
---
Use the diagonals for the bow and aft section and it will be a masterpiece. 
---
My first character was level 80 befor I decided my build was crap. So rather then jump through hoops trying to move one point at a time I made a new one because they didn't add the update that let us move special points until I was well past 50. My new character is now lv 140 but at level 30 my damage output far surpassed my level 80
---
Sucks even more when your damage perks are also tied to the Strength stat considering its the "go to" weight stat in the game for some reason. (Bear-Arms, Traveling Pharma, Bandoleer, Pack Rat, Strong Back, Sturdy Frame, ect..)  
---
We as a whole stopped submitting tickets when we received emails telling us to post the problems on Social Media to get the attention of the Dev's.   
---
It wasn't a leap to infer the best way to process bugs was Reddit...
---
Same lvl 19 guy and his house in the exact same spot every time I logged in
---
It did 
---
Yeah let's see the perks!
---
I wish there was legendary underwear in the game, "grandma's panties" and "grandpa's long johns".
---
Thank God someone's mentioned the fluctuations in carry weight, for some reason I go from /535 to /335 just from switching to a different server. 
---
You filthy mutants deserve this.  
---
Jokes aside, it is annoying how much range they have. If they swing and I move out of their range while they're swinging at me they still get the hit even though I'm visually out of the weapon's range. It's pretty annoying.
---
It really did. Lol he had some broken English sadly help was the only word could comprehend 
---
I run sniper. My go to weapon at the moment is a tricked out but not legendary lever action. It does a little more damage than my .308 with the same mods. The perks are self explanatory. All 3 rifleman maxed out etc. 
---
I keep a pump shotgun on hand in case I can't wipe out an entire group before one gets to melee range. Also make judicious use of mines for large groups. Get to about medium range, set a few mines, drop back a ways and start shooting. But that is only for big groups of scorched/ghouls. 
---
The only time I hop into power armor is when going into nuke zones. I spent quite a bit of time just wearing the full "Garb Of Mysteries" set while using the chameleon mutation. But the visual going in and out of invisibility got on my nerves. 
---
Rust did it.
---
...but YOOO! You got that Golf Skirt, though! Shit, son! Why didn't you say that! 26c for that. I been looking for the ULTRA RARE Golf Skirt!
---
Well, look how their attempt turned out. Its clear they should've stayed in their lane. The fears that the playerbase had were all but confirmed with this steaming mess of a game, which retailers csnt even give away for free at this point.
---
I cannot wait for FO5 though.
---
if you create a custom INI and put the correct edits in it, it should save and maintain the setting you're aiming for.

That's a bit of an overkill..
---
My new desktop.
---
I havent played the game since just prior to the patch release. Im skeptical to come back due to all the posts Ive read. Luckily KH3 is out, so Ive been playing that. Ill wait until the next patch, if it gets any better, I may come back. 
---
No rush I am about to head out for a bit.
---
This just happend to me found server and then bam disconnected from server.  When I was able to play I spawned under my camp
---
One of the Ranger Stations in the Mire, behind a level 3 lock
---
I get pistol-whipped 5 feet away from them and Scorch-Melee Users can somehow *slide* across the ground if they swing and miss (they should be standing still if they swing and miss like the Super Mutants)
---
I never read that, dang its depressing. Here's to hoping some ambitious modders set out to make s Take of the Two Wastelands like mod that puts Fallout 76 inside Fallout 4 and you can travel between them in Fallout 4's offline world.
---
Everyone who has been melee or switched to melee get to feel the same way we did when nerfs were announced. Is it coming next week? Will they nerf it too much? Buckle up because game balance isn't something this team understands yet.
---
What's your name &amp; I'll add you. I gave a random person with a huge fortress camp 1000 .45 to make room last night. 
---
Play fallout 4
---
The story was really simple. I mean sure, it was mostly a pre sequel, to explain what happened to jack and all the other characters before Borderlands 2. But it didn't have any of those memorable moments or chatacters borderlands 2 had. And the dlc's where a bit of a joke. The claptrap one was good but that's it. Now look at the borderlands 2 dlc. Full fledged new areas with tons of hours into each area. So yeah, it wasn't completely bad, but it was lack luster. Very very very lack luster.
---
Knew it wouldn't be long till that sub got shit on and their opinions down played. Don't really expect any less from the fallout community now.
---
-I've added many, many disclaimers in many posts this is not about thinking we are better, but trying to help.  
---
-'76 was not from scratch, but bootstrapped from the Fallout 4 engine.  
---
-Never claimed I could make a game or had that level of knowledge, I am sure there are those in the community, but I have said more than a couple times I am an enthusiast / hobbyist.
---
Thank you for the opportunity to discuss beyond a simple phrase .  
---
As i said in the first phrase of my post, i would like so much for some ideas to be implemented ( and yours too, it would really benefit the game)
---
But my point was beyond that. The CMs report all these ideas to people struggling with really basic tasks. Asking them to change hthousands of lines of code, or reworking thinks they do not understand ( because it's a young studio remodelling an old game) cant be, as i see it, beneficial.  
---
My point was that it could maybe be more beneficial to store these ideas for "later", when the foundation of the game is in a better state. Yeah i know what you're going to say. I've been telling my self for the last few weeks "ok, next patch, they will fix things, this i gonna be different" over and over. I gave up. They either can't do it or are under too much pressure, idk. Anyway, i hope in some future your idea, or others, will be in game, in a game that won't be such a mess, where every source of potential fun is being nerfed.
---
ps : are you hyped for Division 2, too ?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/al68cc/health_boosts_for_8/efb4at6?utm_source=reddit-android
---
I agree fully. I said something very similar in this post linked. I'm on Android, so not sure if the link works well.
---
Even though we're not directly paying for the buff itself, we're still having to spend to receive the buff. It's a shitty precedent, and I think they're testing player reactions to this kind of stuff. Based on feedback, it looks like they'll get away with it because the "it's only 60 life," "you get free atoms constantly," and "they're obtainable in game other ways" crowds drown out the rest of us pretty severely. They don't realize that these types of marginal buffs are still advantages and will only get stronger over time if allowed, free atoms vastly drop off and are nowhere near sustainable after one-time challenges are complete, and even though one item is in game, you need 3 more unique ones to get full bonus.
---
It's actually clever of them to get around their promise, but the players should be a lot more worried than they are, I believe.
---
I added you, Im Cateos
---
Well i'll be waiting here for you to do so sweet cheeks
---
you dont need end game content. you just need a good, fun PvP experience. the best way to do that is to join a Raider clan. I operate one, and we have a blast just fucking shit up. We havent even selected a Chief yet - we'll be doing that come March with the new rules and we're gonna have a melee or fist only Royal Rumble among all members willing to participate. Last man standing earns the right to lead the faction. So if you join now, you can be a part of that and potentially be a Chief to your very own raider clan.
---
There's an initiation process, though. Not everyone can join. In order to truly be inducted as a raider with us you need to come out with us one day or night and accumulate a bounty of no less than 200 caps. You just have to do that once. Once you've done that on a night of raiding, you can really be as ruthless or as chill as you want in Appalachia. but you better be ready to ride for the squad when there's beef about to go down.
---
anyway being a Raider isnt as shitty as it sounds, and it adds an element to the game that it sorely needs. there's a vacuum of power in Appalachia with all the do gooder factions and all we're doing is filling it. join the discord and read the about us and mission statement and come find us on XBOX if its something you might be interested in

I drop my shit on the dead corpse outside of vault 76
---
To be fair F76 could’ve been the best game in the series and a big chunk of Fallout fans would still shit on it - too much of this community has a very specific image on what a Fallout game is allowed to look like. 
---
Yeah, most of them seem to be lining Anthem up in their crosshairs next
---
Well yeah I guess.  I said that I said it before.  When I did, karma bomb.  Now it is in the positive numbers.  Yeah it is the tone now.
---
Well if I were him I might not understand what you were doing either. I've tried to give people stuff, but I def wouldn't follow them just because of this very thing.
---
Yeah, these are brick walls.  I wish they'd give us a "blank sign" that we could stick on the wall, and then attach the letters to that.
---
Well yesterday was the first sbq I've seen since the patch,I was excited for some xp.
---
Then my game crashed and they lost another player.
---
Cute how i seem to have triggered you so much that you're going out of your way to comment on every post i make.
---
Oh yeah.  I could ignore the past and move forward on this.  Next patch?
---
Makes sense also blows not to get a new server
---
It's an mediocre single player game but a terrible MMO / online / experiment / whatever it is.
---
Fair counter point, but not entirely the care in many cases.  
---
Fixing a broken leveled list, or a Mod or Legendary effect that is using a "Set" in the place of an "Add" has known effects.  
---
Testing and Vetting most of these changes would take an afternoon, more less, and that's it.  
---
Don't debate the liability issue, or the concerns other's have brought up about long term blowback or concerns about someone coming later and demanding compensation, but most of those things can be mitigated.  
---
I'd feel more comfortable sitting silently in the background (My reddit post history, on a 2 year old account more or less started w/ '76) if we didn't keep getting flawed patches and rebalances that show they don't understand the core mechanics and meta of the game. 
---
Why does this keep being reposted on every Fallout sub? This is probably the 60th time I've seen it here
---
Any proof?
---
The community fears turned out to be 100% right
---
I didn't see it here hence the post... Happy to remove if you would prefer....
---
Jest or not they're dumb enough to listen at least you can't clear a room with melee in 2 shots like some tse
---
Wait, are existing ones affected?
---
Hell I'll send you a friend request here shortly. I'm only level 32.
---
All that has happened to me too. And I'm on x box.
---
Feel the coffee being required for functionality in the morning...  
---
Few debate the (e) portion of the TS(e) needed a rebalance, but it's how it was done, completely wrecking so much more than it fixed, and showing a lack of understanding on the core meta/balance issues in the game.
---
If Bethesda never tried anything new then people would just get upset because everything's the same
---
Play on PC? If so:

 A zealot ultracite x (insert any other gun) would kill it faster. Laser Gatling has very low base dps.
---
Don't disagree, and the Yao Guai are scarier than deathclaws!
---

---
They didn’t want to nerf TSE’s they were supposed to be very rare overpowered weapons that you came across once every 300 hours. You bought a duplicate for what? 2000 caps? You didn’t earn it so why are you complaining? 
---
I've managed to be part of a group that has killed her twice since beta started on the PC.  The first time I was disconnected from the server before I could get loot.  The 2nd time I was able to get the loot and spend maybe  a half hour going around killing the scorch beasts then the sever disconnected. As for her being a bullet sponge isn't she supposed to be?  She's an end game boss that takes a group to kill.  Biggest issue with her that I've seen is melee is useless till she lands and then you have to deal with slap damage from other players too, and the disconnects when fighting her.  You can't reconnect to the same server unless you have a friend still on it.
---
But that's not what you started out with.  You started out with the skin was broken and not applying to the Western Revolver properly.  That Bethesda needed to 'fix' something that was broken and not working as designed.
---
But that was completely not the case.  Works as intended.
---
You will get 1 piece of 1 star Legendary Heavy Combat from Monster Mash every so often. &gt;!You will also get some pieces or BoS combat armor in Glassed Cavern from the body of a story character.!&lt; As for the plans I have no idea.
---
"let's up the cost of plans 20x and then make a mode where you lose twice as many caps and anyone can kill you whenever!"
---
SO I searched and there is 1 other post on this reddit that is just the link without a word of explanation. I think you're seeing things... Radworms worn off again?
---
We would be publishing patches, but currently any changes to the ESM (Game files) renders the game unplayable, it's a great "Check" to avoid people exploiting and hurting the balance in a MMO  
---
No.
---
We just get tired of justifying the enjoyment we get from the game, so we sit back with popcorn watching Bethesda seemingly ruin people's lives.
---
Yea it's so 8mmersion breaking that as oblivious as this may sound it didn't even dawn on me that the BoS killed all of them. I 100% sincerely thought that the scorchbeasts killed them and brought them back to eat, or there was some kind of massive creature battle I lucked out on missing, or some groups of players came through before me and fucked up some shit. I sincerely just thought the BoS died to a couple scorchbeasts and Bethesdha wouldn't have bothered to leave those corpses in game permanently like that. 
---
Except it's not necessary. OP is trying to disprove that normal crafting won't get you banned. If OP is not banned, then the point is proven. If OP IS banned, then regardless of the reason for the ban, they have not proven their point.
---
No those were buried so there evil would not be known for millions of years.
---
Wow. So another thing that Pete literally lied about when selling this game.   
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/9asleu/pete\_hines\_confirms\_that\_fallout\_76\_private/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/9asleu/pete_hines_confirms_that_fallout_76_private/)  
---
That officially blows.   
---
So much for this one having any real life long-term then. 
---
Thanks!  I did pick up a chest in the Glassed Cavern, but I’m looking to make them when I hit level 50.  Seems cheaper than repairing them all the time.
---
I use one now that I have a TSE one fully upgraded. If I didn't have that one, I wouldn't use one. All the legendary modifiers make it feel like it should normally with my perks.
---
Yeah that's where I'm at as well. Anthem looks interesting but fuck EA, their games only exist to sell microtransactions. 
---
**Heavy Weapons currently put out the  lowest dps, overall.** Yes, pistol builds do more dps because they can better take advantage of the over powered sneak+crit modifiers. Rifles are just better pistols. Shotguns have bugged pellets.  Two handed melee, one handed melee, unarmed do I even have to mention those?
---
Well I applaud the attempt but its clear there was no motivation to release an actual functional game, otherwise it wouldnt have been rushed out in this state, they wouldve had an actual beta, they wouldve actually stress tested the servers, they wouldve actually corrected bugs that I and many other have been reporting since the pre-beta which are still currently live, etc.
---
At least one of the patches so far for a typical game should have been on with actual new content, not just fixing their millionth mistake that never should have been in the final product in the first place.
---
I like to spend some time at the power plant. Boot it up, get the fusion core generator going. 
---
In those other MMOs, abilities, damage, hit points, etc., all scales with level. The end result is power scales exponentially with level, and enemies, in order to balance challenge, do too. Level 70 attacking a level 5 mob in a game like FFXIV or wow, yeah, your going to do enough damage to kill it 10 times over with even your weakest ability.
---
Fallout doesn't work like that. Hit points don't scale with level at all. Damage scales a bit, since higher level weapons have slightly higher base damage, and access to perks which increase damage unlocks as you level up, but all that stops at 50. A level 50 character has access to the same gear, perks, the same total special points to distribute, essentially the same total "power" as a level 100, or 200, or whatever. So saying you are 170 levels is completely meaningless.
---
The mirelurk queen, in particular, is meant to be a tough foe, regardless of level. It's big, heavily armoured, and had an attack which applies a strong damage over time poison, which ignores pretty much all defenses. Since a level 190 doesn't necessarily have any more hit points than a level 20, that makes it a threat at all levels.
---
They will be put in a vault full of gamers and that will be the only game in the vault
---
Nope, ultracite has very little mods compared to other power armors. Sucks.
---
But...they were found...and dug up....oh God is that how we ended up here? The cycle repeats?
---
I found it's not easier to claim a workshop at one of the nuclear sites as long as you're going to be on long enough to make it worth it.  Doesn't take long to claim them and you don't have to get the plant running, you just need to power them.  And in my experience on PC I haven't had anyone coming around taking them or trying to take it from me.  Then if I find some while I'm out I take them too, but I really haven't had the need to do so.
---
No bobble head or chems and no explosive bloodied vats crit not not bloodied explosive. And you running  bloodied mess nerd rage all rifle men adrenaline and adrenal reaction.

That's dumb. You *should* be able to one-shot things "100s of levels below you."

You abso-fucking-lutely ***should***. Don't like it cause it's boring? Kill higher level stuff. 
---
And lets face it: unless you're a cancerous preteen it's impossible to have fun on Rust
---
There's another subreddit that a bunch of 76rs went off and made. They left this one because they felt everyone was too critical on the game and toxic
---
It could be the BoS plans are still at Grafton but still a rare spawn. But it could be a waste of time trying to server hop for them if they're not.
---
You're right, asking bethesda to make a competent game not filled with bugs or not commiting kinda illegal acts such false advertising is too crazy to be realistic
---
I only play solo. I do run into players that are super cool and hook you up with things. I also run into players that are corny as fuck. Overall besides all the bugs i thoroughly enjoy the game.
---
Same thing happened to me, sat there scrapping about 300 walls. I haven’t been banned but I’m also on PS4 and I FEEL like most bans are coming from PC. 
---
However, Bethesda banning people for false reasons has been an issue lately. 
---
Hooray, yet another asshole cashing on on the drama for that sweet, sweet karma
---
I don't use any of those perks, and I've made it to level 103 just fine. 
---
Why not? Because no affix should double your damage.

Weird, my servers have all been full today. Aussie PC user.

Workshops are weird since the hot fix for me as well on Xbox

same as my name here

Phoenix bot always has them. If they didn’t spawn try to server hop although this shouldn’t be needed after the last patch I imagine it could solve your issue.
---
Makes no sense.
---
Amen 
---
Same here, Aussie on PC. Plenty of players in world, and people still nuking both Prime Fissure and Whiteprings. 
---
So no way to bundle the patches as ba2 files?
---
Someone suggested using the baggage claim in White springs as an inventory transfer between your characters. I liked it but personally I would still rather have a player hub like Destiny's, if you've played before?
---
Whoooosh....

I'm certain most FO76 forums have fallen into despair/ anger however seems as of late the dust has settled and we are back to mostly positive post here

Errrrm, don't most of us download games nowadays? The physical copies probably cost 0.10p to make.

now if only they could make my gear stop disappearing for absolutely no reason at all.

IMO all weapon damage bonus cards should have a secondary effect of weight reduction for that weapon type.

Yep. Welcome to the end.
---
no one on my friends list has been online since the last patch.
---
it wasn't the TSE nerf (non of us pvp), it's the constant crashing.

i also notice very few nuke launches, which is a combo of less players, and players not wanting to do the quest to just get DC'd somewhere along the process.

I'd be perfectly happy for you to use real proof to prove me wrong. At least you're not just screaming in my face and expecting me to believe you. That's the difference. I'm happy for people to challenge or outright change my view, but "lol because i said so" will *never* do that.
---
So by all means, please CMV
---
I'm also searching for the elusive Heavy Metal Armor Plans, I'm not even convinced they ever released them, there is some mention of the plan in other r/fo76 posts but I'm not sure they were talking about the Heavy Metal plans. Will just keeps searching and scrapping.
---
I had something similar and had to hide some side quests to finish that one.
---
I just keep running across the same posts over and over again. So I've kinda just been checking it like once a day or two, instead of being on it for most of my free time like I used to.
---
Eep. Hope they sort that.
---
And thank you for being in the minority that actually bothers to post some kind of proof.
---
What incentive does BSG have to make the game free to play?
---
There is no monthly subscription, and the Atom Store is of little interest to most people.
---
I wish they would, but this game isn't designed to allow you to modify the world outside of your CAMP, or for anything you've done to persist outside of the server after you log out.
---
How long until it broke?
---
Asking a legit question lol. I've seen the photos of all those discs that will never be bought.
---
Definitely should be upvoting this post. The OP is apparently the YouTuber  wannabe of Reddit 
---
"Asking" in a way that is clearly meant to provoke a negative reaction. Get the fuck outta here
---
Don't poop in your hand, duh!
---
They didn't give this to us in December when it was a huge issue. I have no faith that they'll give it to us now.
---
[Second character is running on hopes BGS will fix the legendary loot tables. Pipe Revolver still not dropping as legendary.]
---
I’m traveling the path of a Gunslinger/Sneak/VATS/Crit with only these:
---
1. .45 Suppressed Pipe Revolver|s
---
2. Molotov cocktails
---
3. Raider Underarmor
---
4. (Possibly) Weightless + Ultra-Light armor that best helps stealth/VATS/Crit, etc.
---
5. Appropriate mutations
---
Note: *No PA*

---
That really sucks, why BGS would not even bother to fix this given the number of patches now beggars belief, are they really so so busy or just lazy. They do themselves no favours, armor is an intrinsic part of this game, but I keep getting the feeling that they want everyone to run around in suits of powered armor??
---
Worse than before for me.
---
I don’t think thats how woooosh works but your close 
---
Unfortunately those "content creators" have the hive mind eating right out of the palm of their hand
---
Nope. My camp is right next to Camp McClintock. But you believe whatever makes you feel better.
---
That frame rate loss was fixed I presume because I have the OG Xbox One and I don't have any issues except what everyone else is dealing with.
---
Chemistry bench?
---
the vast majority of people will have no idea that it's a bad item.
---
if I had not seen this post, I would not know either.
---
Yeah I'll be miles away crouched and stealthed in a corner and somehow they always manage to fly all the way over to me and attack me, I just run when I see them now.
---
Thats... exactly what i said. Fix bugs first.
---
When I first started, I was going for a mad scientist build, energy weapons and grenades, robot armor, and plasma weapons. After a week I realized that wasn't going to work.
---
I have all the side quests hidden for now. I did try cycling some of those on and off.
---
It’s just too bad they couldn’t put it to good use and run for office lol. They couldn’t do worse then the idiots in charge over here now
---
Yeah it's long! I love these sort of things though - I just listen while doing other things. I really should find a new medium other than YouTube!
---
No, you see Bethesda nerfed heavy weapons and energy weapons after seeing how easily the BOS was able to kill those top tier enemies. 
---
The exploit would be placing 100 turrets or other stuff you couldn’t normally do.  Not just having them duped in storage outside of your control.
---
Just like you shouldn’t pick up and keep 10k ultracite from a duper.  You do have control over that.
---
&gt;fat ghouls
---
Conjures up so many images NSFW O\_o
---
Bye then lol
---
There's a recipe for the chemistry station that lets you make your own disease cures. Each region has its own, based on ingredients common in that area. For example "Disease Cure (Forest) uses firecaps, bloodleaf, snaptail, and boiled water. You can farm pretty much all of these around the overseer's camp/Flatwoods area. If you equip the Greenthumb perk, you'll also collect double the amount. There's even a chemistry workbench in the Flatwood responder's church and a cooking station close by if you need to boil water. Only thing is I can't remember if I had to learn the recipe or if it was just something that was automatically available. Anyhow, craft a bunch of these and you should be good to go.  
---
I see. Well but is there a different between the Ultracite and the Prime one? Or is it just a differents in Name?
---
Queen still isn’t great, disconnects still occur, the server sometimes lags terribly when trying to loot corpses.  Still have to give the game a minute to load once it’s “loaded in”
---
Just have all, weapons deal 1 dmg AOE and give all enemies 1 hp, problem solved!
---
I have had zero issues from day 1 other then nuke zone lag on Og XB1 
---
Banning people for false reasons?  You mean people lying about their name and you believing them?
---
Thanks, Thats good to know it’s not a problem anymore, I’ll probably snatch it in a little bit because it is below $40 on amazon at the moment
---
&gt;That was a very useful post, will use you suggestions as I work on my melee build. Saved for reference. Thanks!
---
What system? I will sell you small letters for half what the vendor does if you’re on xbox
---
Fought one last night... Multiple 100+ guys two or three 60+ a total of probably 9 to 10 guys going to work on it and it got to 3/4 health and stayed there. Took down the 80 scorched beast in the first time it landed.
---
Other than factions, this sounds like survival mode being launched in March
---
This is what you signed up for
---
r/fo76FilthyCasuals
---
Sadly I am not
---
Ty will check again, and server hop if not there. Def called “signs and letters” or something close to that yeah?
---
If I had a magic stat machine I would look up the amount of TSE weapons that dropped legitimately.  It would have to be as low as 0.00001% of what are currently in the game (probably even less.)
---
Because everyone would whine about being stuck in their floors as your character loads in before your camp geometry
---
60 days and 6563 karma definitely someone clearly craving attention. 
---
I've read here that something broke after beta and the Heavy and Sturdy Metal Armor plans no longer spawn and Bethesda don't seem inclined to fix it :(
---
"How can you be that rude to a random person you don't even know that just joined you in a group quest? The toxicity of some people in this game just baffles me."
---
Ain't it the truth, but it's important to remember that there are good people, I've met some of the worst people in this game but also some of the best that have helped me out and gave me amazing discounts on items and have became good friends of mine to this day
---
Something that stuck out to me was the other day, I was heading to a world event when I saw a guy's cabin in the woods, I knocked on the front door and asked if he wanted some purified water because I had an ungodly amount and the guy was only level 15 or so and he said "What the fuck do you want? Go the fuck away" and then started calling me the "N" word, it made me think...
---
How sad and miserable of a person must you be to act like that to strangers? Even if it's online, how could you talk to a stranger like that who was offering you free water and just being nice?
---
So I blew up his house and walked away lol
---
Go on the Bethesda forums, they delete all negative comments. You can keep your blissful ignorance intact there.
---
Just don't let the internet ruin your game experience. Fallout 76 is actually good, and the nerf made people play the game as intended. Have fun! 
---
Awesome. Now if I could just pacify the SBQ and take her back to my camp to protect it from the molerats...
---
And a quick glance at his post history suggests he's a fairly unpleasant person
---
I can only please one person per day, today I choose me.
---
That happens to alot of people especially since bethesda dropped the legendary spawn rate
---
How bout a crisp high five?
---
I hope they nerf drills. Drills do way too much damage.
---
Thanks for your opinion, I'll be sure not to factor it into any decision making 
---
I was so excited looting a two-shot gauss rifle. I was over the effing moon. I could 1v1 Scorchbeasts and truly felt I was end-game. Then they nerfed it and made me feel like I regressed exponentially so that really made me sad. Also KHIII came out and as someone who has been waiting the 14 years, I have dedicated a lot of free time to it (when I actually have it)
---
Vic died one to many times to the burst
---
I'm kinda torn between The Division 2 and Anthem right now. They're reeeeeeeeally similar. Though I think TD2 will be the better of the two - Anthem currently has very skimpy endgame, and no PvP at all. By comparison, TD2 has a much more robust endgame, plus Dark Zone, plus Battlegrounds. If the battlegrounds feel at all like old Ghost Recon multiplayer did, that would be amazing. Overall, a much more promising game than Anthem, I think. Which is a little sad, because Anthem was so promising.
---
In a way though, FO76 and Anthem have a lot in common. There's a lot of systems in the game that looked good in theory, but are just poorly done, with bad UI. For example, in FO76, the way leveling up is handled, how you pick a SPECIAL, and then use Z and C to pick a perk you want, from a different category. A lot of people struggle with this one still, even after we had a ton of PSAs telling people about it. It's just poorly designed, unclear system. Nothing the devs can do to fix it, short of tearing it down and rebuilding it properly. And while they're at it, they would also have to work into it a proper respec system, not the crap we have now, and rethink the whole random perk card thing. Again, it's pretty clear they were planning to sell card packs, Hearthstone-style, there's no other reason for the RNG card packs, it doesn't add anything good to the game, and the inability to scrap unwanted cards to craft good ones is an obviously missing feature. 
---
Bottom line, I don't think this game needs to fix its foundations. That's the game's biggest problem - it has no solid foundation yet. Devs are trying to fix things, built over an uneven, mismatched, broken foundation. And it's not holding. 
---
At this point, I honestly think they need to decide what they want to do, and do it. Three paths are open. The first is Mass Effect Andromeda - just write off the game as a loss, do a little PR, and walk away from the franchise and let it cool off for half a decade. Gamers have the memory of a goldfish, so in half a decade they can try again. Second approach is No Man's Sky - where they work on massive changes to the very core of the game itself, adding gigantic new systems to the game, while reworking the core game concepts at the same time. Many No Man's Sky updates added humongous improvements, like an entire settlement building system, the freighters, the underwater content, the drivable ground vehicles, etc. And No Man's Sky: NEXT completely overhauled the game's basic elements too (think FO76 lead and gunpowder changed to something else entirely). But sadly this approach is unlikely, because Hello Games is a small but super-dedicated team that know their game intimately, whereas FO76 dev teams can't seem to get things done on basic level. Final, and perhaps best, approach would be to pull a Final Fantasy XIV. Shut down the game, go back to the drawing board, and re-release a proper, finished, well-thought-out version in a couple of years.
---
I'm realy quite pessimistic about the future of this game now, based on the devs' performance so far. I don't know if they are understaffed, overworked, poorly managed, or all of the above. But something has to change with their approach to this game, because they hardly did anything in a quarter of a year the game's been out.  And their current plan, the PvP mode, which they currently plan to waste at least the next 2 months on, is not going to do anything for the game either, even IF it works, which is far from certain. 
---
Yes the OP needs to leave this echo chamber hugbox immediately and go somewhere else with the rest of the critical thinkers and actual fans of the franchise! The nerve of that guy!
---
Thanks. I’ve been looking for shielded for quite some time. I’ll keep checking. 
---
I buy nothing instead.
---
I *really* want a legendary pipe revolver! It's such a good solid weapon, having an AA or bloodied or VATS enhanced one would be awesome. 
---
lol when fo76 first came out i watched reviews and gameplay for it that was entirely negative and jumped on the hate train probably due to some psychological phenomena but then realized that as an online game they will update it and then i started watching gameplay by ppl who actually are playing the game and it really changed my mind as i loved fo4 and skyrim and would love to give Bethesda a chance rather than following along with the criticisms of the game
---
Buttressed for marine cost me about 40-50k to unlock 
---
I use the Start menu to log off when this happens
---
Ya i think you are miss reading what im getting at. I realize the issues, Im not trying to keep ignorant. I just want some where thats not mostly complaining like here and not an Orwellian shit show like the beth ones.
---
So what do you planning to do with your Atoms?

How many stimpaks do you want?

Here you go!

Complete rundown of my build and what the effects are.

Sorry about that! I keep tripping over the extension cord which goes across the entrance to the Men's room. Too much coffee this morning so I had to make 3 'trips'
---
Nothing.
---
Amusement parks 
---
Yep
---
Union Uniform + Prospectors Hat (and dark skin/hair)
---
yes, there is a  **target hud plan** , but no stealthboy, jetpack or vats plans....
---
You just wish the "hive mind" shared your opinion. [But it doesn't](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCsGTP3-Jlw).
---
Played all day yesterday. No disconnects. Wonder if it's regional ?
---
SHUT UP, DAD!
---
Waiting for a year in game. Seriously.
---
The weapons are unbalanced for pvp and pve. So they cant even blame it on a multiplayer option imo. It's abundantly clear the devs never tried to actually play through the game. Did they test play areas for glitches? Sure. Did they play through from lvl 0 to 75 or 100. Not a chance in hell. Certainly not without dev godmode cheats on.
---
Idk why they didnt set a target end game dps and adjust endgame weapons to hit that target number w mods and perks. Make reasonable differences in max dmg/durability/ammo/fire rate/range etc so make different builds have slight advantages and disadvantages, but ultimately the max dps should fall within a reasonable ball park.
---
Instead you have melee. And 50cal/manual gatling.
---
Shotgun is a support weapon. Plasma weapons break in 2 seconds. Tesla is cool, but weak. Maybe a sniper gauss build is feasible, but its slow and dangerous and not great for inside (so no real benefits over heavy gun and heavy melee). Vats pistol sucks. All combat rifles/lmgs suck.
---
Soo 2 viable builds and 1 support build. So dissapointing.
---
I've really been wanting to see the statistics of people online and playing since launch. I didn't quit, just kinda turned it off a few weeks ago and didn't turn it back on. Been on Shadow of Tomb Raider and FO4. Its been dying for a while, and I knew it would. Said it, but the die hards downvoted the shit out of it. Not even 4 months and the game dies, with nothing from Bathesda for +2 years. To be honest, during the beta (which I was in) I gave the game 6 months, because I foolishly thought Bathesda would actually care.
---
The hate train is very real, and with an impact like that, it's very dangerous. The game is enjoyable but the internet thinks it's the worst thing ever. Most of the people being vocal about it are doing to because everyone around them are saying bad things, so they quit playing because it makes them feel bad for playing it.
---
Wait, you didn’t order that stuff but you are mad because it’s not what you didn’t order? Companies do this all the time. What you get isn’t exactly what’s in the demo photo. Is it kinda shitty, yes, but Bethesda is learning a very expensive lesson about that canvas bag right now.
---
There is a hotdog eating contest ? Sweet
---
Why would anyone take the opinion of a raider? 
---
heavy weapons can't stealth, can't vats, poor durability, consume large amount of bullets, spindling delay, and very heavy weight. 
---
I suppose you'll always find people that are a mix of both, might have to look into it a bit more before I think about buying it.
---
Cus why not?
---
i agree with all of that about the Pre-Sequel, but what bothered me *most* about it and why i just couldn't play through it more than once (but was probably a minor issue for almost everyone else) was how all the sound effects became muffled when you were outside in space and outside of an atmosphere bubble... it was really neat and realistic when i first ran across the "muffled sounds in space" thing in Dead Space, but that was only a handful of very short areas, this game had you spending a large majority of your time playing outside, so it felt like i was playing 60-70% of the game with ear plugs in and it really bothered me, and tbh i just didn't really like the whole O2 system in general, it added only very little to the game and was really annoying

---
I don't find enemies bullet spongy when I'm running a decent build, I could put out ALOT more damage but one shot or twoshot most opponents is more than enough damage.
---
Yup, can confirm this, same problems on my 2700 setup, but have heard it's all cpu's with 8 cores....
---
Setting the pc to only use 2 cores for fallout 76 is suppose to help, also read that the same thing happens in fallout 4, so probably not going to be fixed :/
---
Can we get any floors that aren’t shitty wood that I don’t have to pay for first?
---
The job of model and texture artists is just that, to make models and textures. Then they have to give the assets to people who can actually code all the item's stats and effects. Which again is not part of a job of asset makers.
---
Second they need programmers to add the items and not only that, but to make other stuff related to the items. For example, this new temporary special bonus of having the Unstoppables costumes that add bonuses depending on how many friends are with you wearing costumes too. This would have required programmers to write the code for it.
---
Then we have this image released recently:
---
https://i.imgur.com/r64Fy2S.png
---
The headlights for the power armor, being made as an Atom Shop item. It required someone to write that code you see there. This shows that they have programmers in the Atom Store Team. Programmers that are there to code stuff for the Shop while bugs are still plentiful in the game.
---
So even if by any (unlikely) chance they have asset makers that can also program, they still should put them fixing the base game. Unless the Atom shop takes priority over the base game. 
---
What a coincidence. I also been modding Bethesda games since Morrowind, and I'm part of the TTW team (play FO3 in FNV) for 7 years now. I work on Bethesda games pretty much everyday.
---
You are most welcome! See you there! ;)
---
It's almost certainly due to monetization. They want to introduce new paid emotes when there's reason to use them.
---
Had similar problem last night. Noticed the overencumbered icon after clearing a small location of scorched. Weight was 299/325 in PA. Tried to fast travel and couldn’t because of weight. Got out of PA and no change to weight. Hopped back in, still no change. 
---
Server hopped, and weight went up to 347/325. Server hopped again and same 347/325. 
---
So for some reason the first time it didn’t show all the items in my inventory so the displayed weight was wrong but server knew I was overweight. 
---
Wishful thinking, the reason I shit on it is cause its crap, no wiggle room there buddy
---
It's easy to bash Bethesda but what game company never did one or more of those listed things? I'm pretty sure every game had most of those listed things happen. IMO Activision is much worse at those compared to Bethesda when it comes to nerfs, things that nobody wanted and overpriced cash shop items. At least Bethesda is listening to the community.
---
2nd this. There's also a reoccurrence of load screen-short black screen-second load screen. 
---
I tried to launch 3 times. First try at level 35, failed at repairing leaking pipes. Second try at level 56, failed at repairing core. It won't let me repair, glitched out. This time at level 141, success but got nothing. 
---
When their system bans people who craft or uncraft a ton of items in a short period of time it’s not impossible to think that someone who grinded for all the junk and then made 30 combat shotguns to dismantle for mods got banned.
---
Pretty normal.
---
Coming from your toxicity lol.
---
I gave up and uninstalled the game.  It's the only message I can send to Bethesda
---
Same happened to me. Download fucked up somehow and had to redownload the entire 50gb. Lost all pics.
---
Am I missing something?  What stealth bug. I haven't had any problems and I run a stealth sniper build.
---
For sure. I often use leather limbs and combat, robot, or trapper chest
---
There's heavy combat armor too. 
---
Are we still in the bargaining phase?
---
I believe the game is failing to load in the effects of armors including legendary weight reduction effects if you disconnect or join another server. i had it happen several times and the only fix i know of is to restart the application.
---
I have a full set, no bonuses. Looks cool but it needs a helmet. 
---
Literally doing the same thing now. Hope this game gets fixed and becomes everything it could be, but for now im uninstalling
---
Next patch will fix something like, players will no longer become 'Wanted' if they accidentally damage another player's CAMP. Instead, upon accidental CAMP damage, their character gets corrupted/deleted so it can never trigger a 'Wanted' status flag.
---
If some insider told us that don't actually have a patch/fix programming team, but used a Monkey Paw to wish all their bugs away... many would completely believe it.
---
I made a fighting pit last week. Rules, betting, sometimes crazy weapons or fighting conditions (commie whackers while avoiding flamethrower traps, anyone?) once I get a better feel for hosting fights, I plan on making it a regular thing with a schedule and everything.
---
Xbox by the way ;)
---
They will disappear.
---
&gt; Energy weapons as a whole are pretty meh in Fallout 4 and 76 in comparison to where they should be, likewise with the Minigun.
---
Man, I remember getting my first laser rifle in Fallout 1. Bad. Ass.
---
People flocked to them also because they are the only viable rifle to use. Everything else is shit end game. 
---
It currently takes 20 special points for a rifleman build.. and they still stuck compared to melee.
---
Pvp sucks because of its restrictions, and the new mode has higher risk n reward and a few other changes and yes many ppl want it as this game is too soft right now
---
Stealthing is a lot more difficult for me. I also have the bird bones mutation and I heard that mutations are bugged, so maybe the reason is that I'm not really getting +4 agility
---
Yes signs and letters are what it’s called. I’ve also seen the raider vendor up in pleasant valley ski resort.
---
Laser weapons are a way for me to "drop" fusion cells without feeling like I'm wasting them.
---
Narrator Voice: "He was still wasting them."
---
Is this affected by internet or any other factors?
---
I dreaded running into mini guns in fallout 1. I often played a stealthy character with no charisma. Died so many times to miniguns.
---
Any container you make in your CAMP is your stash. Lockers, suitcases, everything links to the same stash as your actual stash box. 
---
Well you were being an utter crybaby and saying some ridiculously insulting things m8...
---
After about 6 hours of playing on my xbox, the screen freezes and makes a buzzing sound then crashes back to the main lobby. The top of the xbox is very warm from overheating. This has happened with several games I've played but if you do an internet search you'll see it's a common problem and even affects the new xbox one x. I usually have a fan running next to my xbox and that helps but it will still get hot. You can get a fan that attaches to it. Mine isn't in an enclosed area. It sits on my subwoofer outside of my open tv stand. I thought about getting a PS4 instead but I guess they have a similar problem. 
---
thanks bro
---
Yes because max level enemies were never meant to be a one-shot unless you got lucky and found an explosive weapon. All basic guns are supposed to be a few good shots to kill something. 
---
The game never drops legendary pieces too. The only one I've found with a legendary effect is a quest reward. Spent 1000 caps at the bunker on pieces to scrap only to find out you can't learn the mods either, can only buy them. 
---
I'm not your 'cus'.
---
Wild guess here, maybe Hillfolk Hotdogs 
---
You could always give it a try with folks at r/FO76roleplay ! 😉
---
Use any chameleon gear? What's your agility sitting at right now?
---
I fear no man. But you, you scare me. 
---
Uninstall and cut all ties
---
The fact that melee weapons does more damage than mini nukes now is stupid. Stabbing does more damage to them instead of using an instigating Fat Man because Bethesda things.
---
Same as ultracite laser gun and regular laser gun, a bit better in stats and extra scorched damage.
---
And green lasers. 
---
I wish I could say it would work, but it won't. I had a post on here and another reddit a while back and several others with me, we had signs all over the forest and Mire regions about an event and means of roleplaying a bit. 2 people even saw that was even a thing. The issue isn't how to set it up, its how to get people to see it to begin with.
---
I'll agree that a lot of people seem to THINK that's what toxic is nowadays but like a lot of other words it's completely off the mark. If your definition here is correct then I for one am grateful for all those toxic people in history that were responsible for things like America's independence, the American civil war, and things like civil rights. By your definition in their time, those people were all toxic.
---
I suggest not using a Laser Rifle bc they break after a few clips 😬
---
BuT pEopLe AbUsEd ThIs FeaTuRe.
---
Honestly all the excuses I hear for this being removed are beyond stupid. 
---
I've heard that people were trapping their friends in their bases with it... Yeah so? Like fast travel dude lol. The only people that are being affected by this are your fiends. It's not game breaking...
---
People were using it to get into inaccessible areas???? You can't build anywhere important, what were people getting into? 
---
Give 👏 us 👏 our 👏 mat
---
That is what I am saying. now the very best rifle in the game takes 5-10 shots to kill one mob. basic rifles still take 15-20. 
---
I think the stealth issues were there before the latest patch, there was times where there was no enemies nearby but I was constently in "Danger" with the music being normal. There was other times where I went from "Hidden" to instant "Danger", the game never put me in "Caution" despite the fact I wasen't moving.
---
Google Skyrim Together and realize what a failure Bethesda is compared to this “trash pickup simulator”.
---
Varies heavily which difficulty you play though. 
---
This would be awesome. You could have Enclave, BOS, Responders, Raiders, Scorched and Super Mutants. If you played as Scorched you'd be able to summon the SBQ. If you were a Super Mutant you could summon a behemoth. Enclave has the orbital strike, BOS has vertibirds. Raiders don't have anything because they suck. Responders would have pissed off vendor bots.
---
Dont be so sensitive . Just because you are a fanboy and cant accept people being negative 
---
Out of 4 of us in our gaming group 3 have deleted  our characters and uninstalled. Playing The Division and waiting for TD2 to pop in March.
---
What they have done to the Fallout franchise is criminal.
---
I still want to play it but it’s unplayable in its current state. I’ll circle back in a year to see if they got their shit together but they probably will have shut down the servers by then. 
---
Maybe 😁
---
Indeed. All they needed was to send one BoS soldier with a board or sledge hammer and he would solo all. Garbage balance, melee is king in this game.
---
Yus
---
No it does not, my friend has a decent rifle and a good build and he 3 shots glowing ghouls. If you are going to make an argument don’t give false information to support your claim. Even at level 5 it did not take 15 shots to kill a scorched with a hunting rifle. 
---
I still don't get why they blame dupers for everything. Or if you have problems with the game you must be a duper. I do think it's really funny the people talking about going "duper hunting" then took the dupers' items then get banned for taking those items lol. Good luck.
---
Poor wording on my park, maybe not an actual side quest, but another one involving Rosie or top of the world... Closing it, whichever it was, is what worked for me.
---
What??? That's crazy! Thank you! I have wasted 3 years on Reddit when I could have been learning useful life skills instead! Woo! Thanks cakeday bot
---
There's no separate pve / PvP servers. What do you mean?
---
This is just 76 being 76.  The server lag could be dupers hammering away with huge inventories being generated.  This is a popular excuse.  It could very well just be the server hardware or code.  I think this is most likely.
---
I play on an xbox1s.  It’s not the console or internet bottlenecking performance.  Battlefield 1 runs like a dream.

If on PC, I'll trade you small letters for the signs.

can you go into more detail how the lore is off or share a link to where i can read more about the lore?
---
Best episode of dextors lab. I remember after the episode airred on tv that's all everyone during recess would say. Our teachers were well annoyed by us after awhile
---
Ammo caps would save space and make it easier manage inventory, but imagine this would be hard to implement in way where all would be happy. Although perks like demo or assault could increase specific carry amounts for different player builds.
---
So the game being rushed out isn't your main concern? This fucking sub
---
I would love the return of this I'm tired of spawning inside water purifiers and on top of mountains when my camp is at the bottom. 
---
As much as I know Creation Engine is not able to operate with an ingame transport.
---
sorry if I'm wrong
---
You literally personally attacked me and my intelligence for posting about the TSE nerf last week lmao. I come here for discussion and yet I get verbally abused by you on my post. 
---
I don’t think I’m being negative, but your comment history points towards someone seemingly unhappy with life
---
Last time i checked people can express them selves how they want. Seeing that people paid money for this game. Not my fault either if you buy a coffee maker and accept if its not working properly. 
---
Server hopped a couple times there and found none

The one that's a part of the wetsuit is safe. It's the one that looks like a gas mask that isn't safe.

It gets stuck in the elevator shaft (to which there is no entrance).
---
It's gr8.
---
I get where you're coming from, but I still think modders should mod, not fix the base game. There are people who get paid to do that.
---
That said, you know what, you don't deserve the run-around Bethesda is giving you. They should have had the courtesy to respond directly to you to say "Yeah, you have some really good pointers. We'll take a look at these, though no promises on whether they'll actually end up in the next patch. Regardless, it's a lot of effort, and thanks for your support." Something like that would have been courteous, at the very least.
---
You deserve better for the amount of time you've spent doing this stuff. 
---
I think you’ve seriously forgotten the past week of you crying at literally every opportunity on this sub 😂 Every post I see you constantly whining, it’s actually unreal 
---
where u get that information from?
---
The Atom store hasn't worked for me for a few days. Only shows what I already own.
---
I waited until yesterday to login after the patch because of the posts discussing the patches. I prepared myself for not being able to kill anything without reloading 6 times and using multiple stimpaks and maybe even two weapons because one breaks.
---
I didn't notice a difference. I don't use TSE so maybe thats why I'm not crying.
---
TLDR: game is fine if you didn't require an OP TSE doing 800+ damage to survive
---
Really? I felt like the mini gun in Fo4 is shit. I scrap it immediately 
---
That may be. Good if you are ok with all glitches and nerfs ! Im happy for you 
---
It's all the containers (even dead bodies) around the trading posts. Easier than dropping gear (the time it takes) and the person gets bored or doesn't understand what you are doing and disappears
---
It'd be so cool if they ran community polls for what the player base wanted - say having the 2nd floor of Top of the World to be an in game hub - and then running a community event where the players could regain a part of Appalachia and have a neutral/safe zone.

First two levels have to be purchased and learned.

Third level can be obtained from random events in the forest region such as Mr. Messenger (where I got mine) or Distinguished Guests.

Fourth level has the BEST chance from Uranium Fever, but a small chance from random events as well.

I have all 3 Xbox’s at home in different connections and different TVs set up.
---
The game suffer from a low frame rate on Xbox s
---
Seems to run better on the OG with some washed out graphics still low frame rate nothing game changing if you don’t have nothing to compare against ( pc or Xbox one x) as for the other problems the game suffer that’s just 76 being 76.
---
I do assure you that every patch seem to improve stability and performance on all but brings another array of problems that you will encounter along the game but that with all honesty, we all go trough lol
---
Try it out it’s fun , could be frustrating at times but shit.
---
Patience is a virtue and either I stop playing and move on or soon one day this game will be great for everyone to enjoy with no problem no matter their console 🤘🏼
---
Everyone should up vote this so  **Bethesda** actually fixes it...
---
You can express yourself in whatever matter you please, but don’t call people crybabies for wanting to have a discussion while you yourself are posting hate all over the forums. 
---
If you get as close as you can to the queen and mash the pick up button it works for me at least if you see here inventory your good normally being first to see her stuff gets you the ability to take it ive gotten two 3 stars out of her cause its kind of a bug 
---
But they made their stand in version -2.009, which was before the huge nerf on heavy/energy guns
---
This is why we mod. Mods for guns in Fo4 to make them bloody well usable 
---
Dang server hopped a few times and no luck at Phoenix or the train station. Thanks anyway. Will check again tomorrow
---
Out all the weapons nerfed in the previous patch I’ve noticed a who took it the best was this weapons.
---
 Rip Gauss TSE
---
I suggest not using lasers until they buff them to do damage. 
---
Yeah, when I actually played this game I would have liked this a lot. My camp was set up on the cliff near site Alpha I think. Beautiful spot, only problem was, fast travelling literally put me in the terrain below. Like I was in the cliff wall.
---
I just noped out of the experiment after the last patch’s hotfix caused all kinds of client freezes and other issues(in addition to the many pre-existing issues).    They found my limit.  Until this I was playing the heck out of the game despite the rough edges.  I love the Fallout universe, base building, resource gathering, light survival elements, exploration, and shooter elements.  
---
The dev team is obviously not up to the task and management doesn’t realize this and keeps asking them to do things they can’t.  Shit just keeps getting worse.  
---
When a minimally viable product gets worse it become less than minimally viable.
---

Trade complete
---
It’s worth every bit of the $40 I spent on it.  I’m at about 200 hours and still have a few achievements to complete.  I bet there is about another 50-100 hours before I’ve done everything I want to do with what currently exists.
---
If you like the Fallout series you will likely find your moneys worth.  If you are forgiving of flaws and defects, you’ll be fine. 
---
Go take a look at the [SkooledZone](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnS5rfxjQND2-Kkfc34SFgA) you tube channel, you'll be an expert builder in just a few videos. Hope this helps.

Can you guys stop shit posting so much? Quit the game if you aren't having fun.
---
kitchen at the ski lodge place that is north of Summerville 
---
When a game requires me to give it more love than it gives me, then I'm done. 
---
I've been playing every day since beta up until recently. I shouldn't have to be putting the effort to make this fun. It just has to be fun. That's it basically. 
---
True. But then they'd have to care about doing anything more then the minimum bug fixing required to not get sued by their customers. 
---
Oh, or selling overpriced crap on the Atom Store.
---
I’m really guessing the value went from 0.1 to 0.001 where’s there’s only room to display certain numbers, therefore 0.0

Glowing one has 1625 HP. 
---
one of the best hunting rifles I have (non legendary) is 160. That is 11 shots from a hunting rifle (way slowe than Melee) and assuming you don't miss at all.
---
I usually use a combat rifle that is down closer to 100. that is 16 shots no misses.
---
Thank you mate :)
---
Not sure if this works but, you can try? There should be a setting in account settings on your Bethesda launcher to make it private or “hide”
---
This is the only answer
---
Hit box issue. I’m willing to guess that the hit boxes stretch out a bit when you move due to the server instability.
---
The bad servers are the one huge limitation of the game right now.
---
I played the game with my wife for a couple weeks and we were shocked of how many recycled pieces were used. I mean holy crap Call of Duty uses them but at least they mask them by coloring the same crane or at least attach something to a water tower. Reskin it!
---
But no. Literally if I was Bethesda before this game launched, I would have known that this game was a cash grab. Everyone in this company KNEW! There is no possible way you can convince me that multiple teams at Bethesda didn’t know that this was going to be a shit show. Nobody in a meeting spoke up and went,  “this is bad, we shouldn’t release it.” It blows my fucking mind. It’s almost like they knew they had the name “Bethesda” and said “Our fans will buy anything!” And we all fell for the Marketing. 
---
And coming back to this Reddit and realizing that there still is no in game chat proves this.
---
I recently got into Atlas and the game of only 13 developers were able to fix this game with more frequent updates within the month it’s been release than ALL the teams at Bethesda. We had text chat day one. 
---
If you want to ensure Bethesda doesn’t feel invincible anymore and really want them to respect our time, money, and wishes - then don’t buy the next one. No matter how fucking “GOOD” it looks in commercials. Stop Pre-Ordering. Stop buying their games! If we continue to enable this, you can kiss any future projects goodbye as they might mimic what FO76 is. 
---
Stop enabling Bethesda or all their future games will be shit. Vote with your wallet.

Ooh! I’ll see if my friend can see me during that. If that’s the case then good but I wish it was a bit easier to access. Thanks!
---
There is a limited space in non-stash containers. It is about 7 or so I believe, but I never used it after looking into it because of how negligible it is
---
I also got 2 legendarys on a whitespring ghoul yesterday 
---
Keep scrapping I guess.
---
If you were at the Whitespring already why didnt you just go inside and craft them there?
---
I also cant stress enough to make sure your pipboy light is off. More times then I would like to admit I have had all the ghouls in whitesprings up my ass because I forgot my light was on. Not saying that's your problem just passing this info along lol
---
Yes, it can happen. Sometimes the server drops lots, other times, you'll get very few.
---
Me and him are best friends , you could actually make him your companion.

( In your belly as dog stew that is )
---
Played from about midnight last night until close to 5am with 2 other buddies on their week internet and we never got disconnected nor had any problems.
---
If this was why you thought they quit, theres a laundry list of other reasons that make us insain for being ok with this game.
---
Hey Tactics was pretty good back in the day!
---
they could then let us loot suitcases and luggage tags(even add some to atom store) to make it easier to find the luggage
---
If not only other thing to do is go down the list and block every player you see in the session.
---
Lmao
---
I have a two star ghoul slayers gatling gun. It's explosive. I love that thing so much. Had a two shot gatling but it got eaten by the game. Gatling guns are so good 
---
Thanks again!
---
Weapons groups that have minimal value IMO
---
Pistols have terrible DPS, at least ammo is cheap and plentifulish
---
Shotguns can't hit SBs, there are better rifles for DPS, only plus is less aiming/better CQ VATS
---
SMG type guns are super fun but you arent doing anything but emptying ammo supplies.
---
Heavy Weapons/Explosives - grenades are great, but a black powder rifle will do more damage than a missile or nuke. I love my Gatling gun, but ammo weight vs DPS again make this a worse choice that most standard rifles. You also have to factor in that the Heavy Weapons Armor piercing perk uses intelligence, which you need for durability and probably power armor. Heavy builds draw too much on two different stats IMO.
---
Going to set up a dedicated rifleman after the Bethesda shit show settles.
---
Smart about stuff like this , Molotov cocktail , pull out some mole rat chunks and cranberry juice and wait for the victor to show up and vanquish him from WV
---
Yes because when you are a high level you are supposed to be using better weapons than a basic hunting rifle. 
---
Guess what I’m a shotgun build and when I used a non legendary pump it takes me a good 10 shots to kill a glowing one too. 
---
I wonder if the Mr Fuzzy hot dog contest applies to this. You eat the hot dogs, so you're not actually collecting them though.
---
You know, I hadn't thought of it myself but it would make a lot of sense
---
I got a guy kill me with 2 hits , he was almost inmune to anything but a mini nuke lol 
---
I need to find this person. I admire their dedication to the game’s new meta 
---
Just crashed so figured it was good a time as any to go screenshot my log.

I don't think anyone is spending real money for Atoms and if they are they should be ashamed. I'm not against the Atomic Store and I love the idea of it. . But the garbage they sell are so bland, unoriginal, uncreative, or they're just fo4 items.....
---
I had one for a while, but even when I did it wasn't really worth using. It's a shame because energy weapons have always been my go-to in the past.
---
You know what. You’re right. I messed up on that. I’m sorry, I just looked again for you. 
---
Oh no, it totally was, you couldn’t do any other mods, but it could be repaired to 200% and get a little boost in damage
---
What are those walls? 
---
Factional warfare with tactical nukes does sound fun!
---
Nobody cares if you don’t like it stop playing it.
---
Instigating hunting rifles stack with the sneak bonus 
---
I'll keep on that, but everything I received from scrapping Arms went to Legs. I switched to the other Arm, with no different results. I tried scrapping Legs for a while, and that didn't seem to yield anything...possibly because I unlocked all of the Legs plans?
---
A very lucky bug shhhhhh don't let them know about it I need another 3* drill
---
I beat my first scorch beast and couldn’t get anything because of this. I thought it was just my connection, it has been happening so often and especially to the stuff that’s hardest for me to kill!
---
Yeah I have a camp next to that cliff and see him a lot. But sometimes he will glitch and his neck will get super long and start floating over the cliff. You can see this from a good distance and it's pretty funny.
---
I hit a wall in the game. Then my goal was to get the platinum trophy. Then it was trying to make my house look nice. Now... I'm lost 
---
Totally agree with you!
---
I have a lazer ultracite explosive ( legacy now as well)
---
But I do have it and it rips trough enemies holds 85 cells single shot hair trigger the whole kebab 
---
Yeah, that happens. Don’t hit your Pipboy after loading in. Just walking a few steps seems to work
---
Just eat glowing steaks I munch on those all day.
---
...But not just at night
---
Good morning Julia!
---
They will show up in vendor just saying the name of the mod , tricky to catch sometimes.
---
Pay attention to the components on the purchase tab ( price as well lol )
---
They weren't named it when I checked and they were shooting at me not running at me with a nuke
---
yes, and i like it

---
Yeah I know they break after a few clips and the damage isn’t so good but this is for an alt character not my main. I don’t see many people using them that’s why I want to do it.
---
you have proof of this?
---
Ditto 
---
Theres are some really good stories. For not having npcs the story telling is really good
---
Broken to the point I was flying unable to hit ground at once 
---
I quit just before the last patch. I am still a Bethesda fanboy and had fun with the game. But because how they handled the patches and now little depth this game ultimately had, I don't think I'll ever pick it up again. Just got AC: Odyssey and am pleasantly surprised
---
on xbox i have my xbox set to appear offline (main xbox setting)  but the game will show me online in the social tab
---
most games that have their own separate buddy system will show you online when you are playing if they do not have their own offline system (does not mater what console is set to)
---
Full heavy build uses a lot of points and PA so a vats crit build on top of seems like you will be missing stuff all over the place. 
---
I just paid 25 caps to pay 12 caps to pay 33 caps to pay 11 caps to pay another 42 caps to finally find the horde
---
What I don't understand is .50 Cal is beast in Vegas y the Nerf in 76?????
---
No fast travel mats is far worse than that scenario though. I've had to just move my camp multiple times because the spawning where I built was so bad. I had one where it would spawn me 10 feet deep inside a cliff face every time I traveled there. 
---
Hell yeah! I have a lot of fun playing it.
---
No offense, but if that's what you bought a multiplayer pvp shooter for you fucked up.
---
Not saying the game delivers on that front currently, but that was the premise from the get go.
---
Fo76 is not the Fallout MMO you and many others have been waiting for.
---
yeah i was kinda thinking "what physical copies?  They're pretty much just cases with codes inside.  They can just slide the sleeve out &amp; put ES/FO/DOOM/Etc x.xx case sleeve in &amp; change the code"
---
There's a grill with some at the Morgantown Airport in the Quarantine Zone, right next to that part of airplane wreckage.
---
You can store items in public containers and they will appear to other players, and if you "search" containers with a perk that loot also appears for other players as well.
---
Best thing to do with the Marine Armor Helmet is to make sure no one finds it, don't scrap it, because you will get the plan, don't sell it, because other players will be able to buy it, don't store it in a suitcase, because someone like you will find it. Drop it somewhere where it won't be picked up.
---
No guarantee that Bethesda Game Studios will ban people for this but just to be on the safe side delete it somehow as its a Dev Room item.
---
Hmm, ironic.
---
no, because generally they are ESM edits, had to be done by bethesda
---
Because when this game launched one of the quickest ways to accumulate legendary items was to server hop for these events, they never used to require tracking them down, you’d join, have the target marked and go kill it.
---
I've done that a lot too ("why are these dudes after me? *Shining light into their faces like I'm a 12 year old hacker in a highly modified jeep with a previously extinct, apex predator right outside the window*")
---
But I think it really might be borked otherwise.
---
That’s the wrong ‘true’ for this community, prepare for downvotes. I’ll give you one upvote quick, for luck. 
---
I agree btw. Sick of reading all the negativity. Every time Bethesda post anything the first hundred responses are all copy and paste sarcastic digs. 
---
I loved the game but I played it for like 3 months, 90+ hours.  Thats way more than most games.  I guess I'm waiting for either my brain to erase itself, or a major patch that introduces something new.
---
It's not like its a bad game though.  90+ hours is crazy good and I can't play a single game forever.
---
Have you done a pistol build?
---
Junkie build?
---
I tried to get one together and it seems impossible to have enough drugs to do a junkie build. Pistols don't do enough damage for a pistol build.
---
Pistols should definitely have it as I am a level 59 gunslinger build and really relied on two shot (non explosive) to be able to handle higher levels. This nerf has screwed me over. As someone else in this thread mentioned there are no armor piercing perks for pistol builds. 
---
Energy weapons work great when used against you. And where in the hell is the Glassed Mine?
---
Well, I was making an assumption that every hyped $60 game has been rushed in recent memory, which probably isn't true, now that I think about it. For example, what destiny promised versus what we got at launch was unacceptable. I felt wronged by Bungie and stopped buying their games after dumping 150+ hours into destiny in the first month or so. I had bought Bungie games as far back as Myth 2.
---
 Given Fallout and Bethesda's track record and my extensive experience with them, I can't say I expected much better than that we have, but I love wandering around Bethesda's games and always will. I already paid for it, it can sit until it gets the No Man's Sky treatment and I'm okay with that, as long as it actually happens. FF14 sucked until it was revamped, as was Diablo 3, and others. These games went from disappointing to encouraging for me, personally. I like games that are platforms for constant improvement and expansion.
---
Sorry if my attitude doesn't help you.
---
The problem with creation hub is bethesda wanted a cut for work they didnt do.
---
Yeah but don't you have a sense of pride and accomplishment?
---
I use a stealth sniper/melee build it works pretty well the only perks I'd say are must have are escape artist, sneak, and damage perks. I will say if you're gonna try switching to stealth get used to stealth crits just straight up not working for some reason in fights. I did a silo run yesterday and for the last bit I couldn't crit shot anything. But for the majority of the game it's really fun (not against sbq). Good luck and let me know if you have any questions
---
Yeah there is one perk but it adds up to like 8% armor penetration, It’s ridiculous. Pistols would be so much more fun
---
Oh yes, all the little snowflakes don’t like hearing the truth so they downvote anything against the complaints. 
---
I wish we had a community where we could actually discuss the game without every 1/3 post being a complaint or an essay about why someone is quitting. 
---
Yeah that pretty much sums up my game day. Still enjoying it. 
---
Haven't you heard? Only positive comments are allowed in this sub. 
---
Cute how you're resorting to another personal attack rather than addressing the guy's point that you're being hypocritical. 
---
umm a level 15 gamma gun that does 30 more damage to scorched lmao and a level 50 nocturnal hunting rifle....I am level 33 lmfao
---
That’s not really true though. Super Mutants never make me search areas. Bloodbugs never have to search areas. I’ve only encountered this with Scorched and Ghouls
---
The luggage would need to be available on any server you join
---
Piss off duper. Nobody cares if you are enjoying the game with your duped bloodied super sledge and duped armor.
---
I'm such a moron! Just drop it anywhere I would personally check... Thanks so much! 
---
They're looking for hundreds and hundreds of crafts. Not those 40 guns.
---
The guy starts the video by saying it’s not just another FO76 hate video, then spends five+ minutes bitching and moaning about the game, hitting every talking point and rumor all those other videos have droned in about for 3 months. 
---
It may have gone on for the entire hour, but I lost my patience after five minutes. All of this has been said before, some of it is valid, most of it is ragebait. 
---
If there’s something interesting in the video to discuss, just discuss it. Summarize it, tell us where it is in the video, but don’t expect people to sit through an hour of unoriginal, self-important garbage to get there. 
---
I’ve posted proofs before and honest unbiased opinion of love and hate for the game and always when I have something negative (yet truthful) I get the thumbed down.
---
Heard of constructive criticism and shit? Perhaps not right sometimes outlining expectations and realities would be nice from dev team , was the game constructed in 6 months or so ? ( including launch date time )
---
Me ! Preordered on day 1 and I'm still enjoyed playing it.
---
I remember when I was level 50.
---
Actually I’m a shotgun build, don’t use melee. 
---
Whole lot of assumptions. 
---
Ugh, I hate when people are deliberately obtuse.
---
The vender down in Watoga sells if for a hefty price. 
---
Turn off the game, play others for a few months then come back to this. They'll have released new content then. Maybe. 
---
If you read that's exactly what I did lol. Such low budget replies. 
---
This is 100% the right answer. You can drain your own resources very quickly if you're not careful. 
---
You traded for duped gear.
---
You wait until the “I hate these hypocritical posts complaining about posts complaining... you don’t have to read them!” replies. 
---
The great circle jerk of the internet continues. 
---
I want a two shot chicken cannon. Flying poultry of Doom....
---
Lol you sound like this guy I’ve joined a legion on 76. , role plays as a general and commends people and missions and shit.. kinda like Preston Garvey lol but US General
---
The 5th
---
The. Game. Is. Broken. 
---
To bad INT doesnt help legendary weapons which is what u should be using.  The reality us laser weapons suck.....I know cause I constantly try to use the legendary ones I find
---
It's insane that these aren't already a thing.
---
I had literally every ghoul in the golf club spot me through a wall because of that dam light. I can usually stand in front of them and not be seen lol
---
They have random maps as interesting and packed with events and cool locations as FO76?  They must, or why would you say that?
---
Hi it’s Sanjay!
---
The uninstaller still works at least. Used mine last night.
---
I‘d recommend a T-60 or X-01 Power Amor. I know, it’s Not easy to get them, but they‘re simply the best power armors. (I know it‘s obvious, but i wanted to say it) 
---
Lol considering how valuable and rare it is on PS4 to find someone trading sentinel assassins armor I doubt it’s duped. Unlike the TSE you bought I didn’t get my armor for 2000 caps. 
---
When you scrap armor, you can learn a mod of any part, not just the part you scrapped. Keep scrapping. Good luck.
---
The merge went bad.  We know.  That doesn’t mean they’re incompetent.  It happens.
---
Why are you making assumptions? I got No mans Sky, I like what they doing.
---
Hello games will never see my cash again, I will never get another from their studio, Im not a half brain dead moron, they what they did.
---
Idgaf about your attitude, its your opinion that even if its shit itll be improved, its like you see games as an investment for the future.
---
That kind of opinion is why 76 was trash in small part.
---
I myself can list over a hundred games that were amazing from the start and didnt need months and years to actually deliver what they wanted.
---
Im not trying to be inflammatory or an asshole so sorry if you feel that coming from me, im just annoyed cause rushed games are forever bad
---
Then. Stop. Playing. It.
---
Nobody cares that you still think this pile of dog shit of a game is good. We all bought it, we have the right to point out it's flaws. If you don't like it, then stop coming to this sub.
---
I'll give it a try today then. That's what I was originally thinking. 
---
Nice , with marsupial and a jet pack and some other goodies the possibilities are limitless lol
---
Ohhh.. I'm an idiot. I'm level 34 and did not know this. However this was the second time I changed location, the first time I moved it I don't remember having to rebuild or do anything. Either way thanks for the info internet person 
---
Are they explosive weapons? LOL.
---
There should be enough room. Some of my ammo weighs .001. 
---
I think it's just random. I don't know though. I think you can get all the mods from just doing arms. That's what I would do at least just to save some resources.
---
Tl dr before 
---
I have played since BETA and just hit 107lvl yesterday
---
You’re right you absolutely have the right to point out it’s flaws but come on, typing an essay on why you are quitting really? Pathetic. 
---
I enjoy the game that’s why I still talk on the sub, if you want to quit then quit and get off the sub.
---
I learned all the mods for metal armor, but have yet to see plans for sturdy or heavy meal arms/legs/chest. Can anyone confirm if they have ever gotten the plans for sturdy or heavy metal armor pieces? I also have never seen heavy robot arms/legs/chest. 500 hours and I'll keep playing and hoping.
---
Called it.
---
You did.
---
Why the 44 though? They should have it for the handmade. Nothing like a gold plated warlord ak47.
---
Pretty sick spot.  Used to have my camp at the adjacent peak.
---
You scrapped 40 thousand armour?!
---
Armor pieces I have 2 pieces that each reduce 20% ( each ) of all weapons 
---
That's the SaveMyStuff mod causing that. Remove it and you'll be able to trade again.
---
I would assume that the team involved had an intimate understanding of the engine. Developers and programmers tend to work on engines and projects that fits their sphere of knowledge with a few exceptions in the mix. FO76 was promoted as AAA and promising new features and  world building so it lends to my belief that at the very least 25% of the core team has worked with the engine to be able to know its limitations. Bethesda while I  give credit for is trying I think the launch failure and subsequent issues need to be addressed through an evaluation of the Quality Assurance Process and Pipline. As well as looking at simplifying the Development pipeline to key milestone models and addressing how to make cross platform development easier on the staff so that code gets better combing pre release of patches and content and before QA.
---
r/lostredditors BUT maybe Bethesda will see this and get to win another lawsuit
---
Do mayor for a day at wotoga and you can get 8 stimpacks from the safe repeatedly by server hopping
---
Add to the list a completely empty emotes wheel. 
---
That doesn't make any sense.
---
If it was valuable and rare you and hundreds of other players wouldn't have 5 pieces of it. You're a duper.
---
No mate, my time is to precious. Play the game and you‘ll see yourself.
---
I've killed a scorchbeast with a minigun.
---
Lolol, I have 5 instigating grognaks axes.
---
I refuse to get skins for gear that sucks 😗
---
Bought. 
---
What weapons? 
---
You're just now discovering the map?
---
What did you do? Farm Whitesprings for 100 levels?
---
the only good energy weapon is a tesla rifle the rest are pure shit , and the gatling plasma is bugged when you switch weapons the ammo in the core is the same as the core number , and the gatling breaks after using just 2 fucking plasma cores 2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, and it breaks faster in the nuke zones.
---
They wanted a cut for the work they *did* do*
---
Didn’t you miss the memo? This sub is only for complaining
---
I’ll delete this and post it on r/fallout, sorry.
---
You're post is just as bad as the I'm quitting ones.
---
40k caps i spent on non lege marine armor&amp;  materials to craft marine armor
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ag37qe/fallout_76_all_plans_recipes_weapons_weapon_mods/
---
Here here!!! What this guy said!! I CONCUR, SIR!
---
I can tell. Haha.
---
They forgot too inculde some of their hotfixes on the main branch... It' s such a noobish mistake it makes me cringe.
---
Atleast i got all mods lol
---
No point to logging in honestly...the endgame boss was made damn near impossible to kill and the loot off of it is crap anyway if you can even loot before the body disappears. . The menial tasks of the daily grind just aren’t rewarding enough to make the game worth playing. Had fun straight out of beta, but Bethesda is taking this game in the compete wrong direction. Looking towards other games at this point.
---
They don't exist as an object you can have at your CAMP.  People can place plants on top of campfires.  I left a hole in the middle of my 3x3 basement to grow corn.
---
I did but I’m not gonna make a karma farming post about it, I’m just waiting until BethSoft can figure out exactly where they want to take this ship before it sinks, then I’ll hop back on
---
Ok that makes more sense haha thanks :)
---
I have the advantage of being too busy to play all the time so when I do I make the most of it. Can't experience bugs if u don't play enough to experience them😃
---
i tested the plasma gatling and it's 2 cores in normal areas and a core and about a half in the nuke zones and it breaks.
---
Wouldnt the sentry helmet look good with it? The marine "helmet" is kind of lame
---
I still love playing that game. Tbh I don't see alot of bugs, sometimes I can see an enemy glitch, not a big deal. But I don't have problems with quests or the crafting system.
---
The only time I face a big bug, it was at whitespring, there was more and more robots spawning without stopping. And only angry robots.
---
And what is your build?
---
It's fun when you get all the duped gear. All the best items. PWNing all teh noobs. So much fun.
---
The fact that you assume I use melee because I don't use TSEs proves my point.
---
Just sent friend request
---
There is an unresolved glitch that adds the extra carry capacity when logging in while wearing Excavator PA.
---
The 330 is what it should be, and you can get an additional 100 from Calibrated Shocks 
---
Cause this game sucks 
---
Are you an idiot? I’ve only come across 2 other people wearing a full set and I’m level 120. LOL. Call me a duper all you want, it’s a false accusation with no proof.
---
I’ve never duped anything and I’m against duping. That’s why I was so happy when they nerfed all your duplicated TSE’s. 
---
Those are Excavator mod plans. Ultracite mods mainly drop from the SBQ, but you'll get a lot of Explosive Vents and Rusty Knuckles plans while looking for Calibrated Shocks or Targeting HUDs.
---
I'd say there is about 5 that gives better dr for each armor and around 10 mods 
---
How bad it is? Yea, it’s awful. Just pick up a board and one shot people. Gun users of any type get steamrolled.
---
Don’t even start with explosives. Awful.
---
Bloodied melee was king before and after the patch, nothing has changed. Now Bloodied Explosive guns are hitting 500/1000 damage per shot, and one shooting players. Now it’s just whoever duped the most rare shit before the patches. I don’t call that awesome.
---
But my advice is collect all non lege armor and scrap scrap scrap. 
---
I just complete all quests i have found, complete storyline, spend some hours to build my CAMP. And yes now i just walking on map and discovering some cool places, taking screenshots, collecting junk, do events, etc. Few days ago just launched my first nuke (dropped it on Harpers Feery, not WS or FP). Maybe im TOO casual, but i play only 1-2 hours each day.
---
You're the only one here who is an idiot if you think that not a single one of your 5 pieces of armor are duped.
---
You're a cheater bro......pay 2 win.
---
I can't disagree with anything you said. Being as honest as I can, I'm extremely disappointed with the game and myself for perpetuating a problem. But I also have had a lot of fun and it's been a much-needed outlet for me. 
---
It's just shitty, and I have possibly empty hope that there are people on the team that can fix it, because I don't know of a better alternative. Hard to ask for a refund after 180 hours. I felt bad enough getting my money back for D3 when I was younger and pretty pissed because I played hard that first month.
---
Speaking of hours, I tend to buy these games only if they look like they're gonna last a long time. Preferably indefinitely. So yes, they are absolutely investments, for me. Anyway, hope I don't sound condescending. Genuinely don't have the right answers or the time/ability to find them all. 
---
Learning its quite costly to unlock all

Sorry, should have shown this pic. This is my first post using  reddit app and I'm not quite familiar with it yet.
---
There's only one viable build now. Melee in Power Armor. If you were a non Power Armor (already at a disadvantage) user, you had white Knight and rifles or explosives. That was all nerfed to the ground so you have one viable build. What a shame.
---
They nerfed Two shot to +25%.
---
They nerfed explosive bullets to +20% I think 
---
They nerfed Demolitions Expert to +60%
---
Any one of those could drop a weapon by about 40%.  If you had all 3 it’s a 70% reduction in power.
---
I think that your interpretation of Rule 7 is in error. 
---
\&gt; Do not post rumors or leaks without actual evidence. 
---
How does making a post about encountering a bug constitute a rumor or a leak?
---
\&gt;  Second-hand information or word of mouth does not constitute as evidence.
---
A report of a personal experience isn't second-hand information or word-of-mouth. 
---
Happy cake day! 
---
Post made my day 
---
Wounding and explosive minguns were monsters in FO4. Otherwise yeah they were kind of crappy.
---
Meanwhile melee...
---
I dropped a shotgun for a guy and he thought I’d accidentally dropped it so he grabbed it and logged out lol. 
---
It did make me feel a little bitter though because I helped out some jerk that would’ve done that to a random player. Oh well.
---
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.eurogamer.net/amp/2018-10-11-fallout-fans-think-bethesda-retconned-the-brotherhood-of-steel-into-fallout-76
---
Yeah.
---
I don't here the PvP guys complaining about duped assassin's sentinel/cavalier armor.
---
Yup. Wander around, explore, chop up ghouls with my axe. 
---
It's a huge map. There's always something to find. Been playing since launch. Even at 113 there's still stuff I haven't seen.
---
I'll take Black diamond and the metal diner doors
---
I enjoy the game quite a lot.  Yes, I get frustrated with certain aspects of the game, but not so much that I don't want to play the game.  I for sure don't feel the need to complain about it here.  Every bug I have come across I have reported via BGS feedback form. Every suggestion I have made I have made through the BGS feedback form.  Seems smart to direct the feedback to those that make the game.
---
Also had to go up and down the elevator to reload the room, good luck!
---
Well now I want to know the stats
---
That's false advertising. I've seen this crappy company stealing different stuff from multiple different games and put them together as their "advertisement"...In fact It's just another poorly made p2w cash grab mobile game.
---
Mine aren’t. Also, pay 2 win? I thought you were accusing me of duping? You must have forgot to take your medication man you seem delirious. 
---
Saying hundreds of people have full sets of sentinel, that sentinel is all duped.
---
People should care if players leave...not enough players = game gets shutdown. Would not be the first online game
---
I think that the one, thank you. I thought it had a spreadsheet like the weapons but at least the info is there.
---
So with a rifle with maxed perk build, it still took you 5 shots *to the head*  to kill a super mutant. With minimal perks and a sledge I can take down a mutant in 2 swings easy. Sounds weak to me.
---
Useless gun. No thanks. Western revolver would have been cool.
---
There are so many players honestly, we don’t need people who are gonna cry after every patch. 
---
I rocked the ritual outfit for 90% of my playthrough. Constantly had people look at me twice and generally krep their distance.
---
oh... i was about starting a post like yours. today i had the same problem. lost about 100 units of plastic. 🤬
---
but i'll guess we have to "sent a ticket"
---
Been using that spreadsheet for a while now. I sorted everything alphabetically to compare my stash to the page easily. Might change some though because I rarely use them. Guess it depends on your build. 
---
No where in the post did i say it was broken. I'm only expressing my disappointment that it doesn't work for the western revolver
---
I use X-01 when I want to but most of the time I roll with a full set of heavy combat armor
---
I only sub here to see when the game will be fun again, if ever. 
---
Awesome I’ll keep them for you :) 
---
Theyve already said its coming
---
If you want to balance everything around how well melee works how about for a first step we reduce all gun ranges to zero. 
---
...but it is ironic. 
---
I agree I come to this sub to find post other then the same negative stuff repeatedly posted. Maybe the people who dont like the game can go make there own subreddit. 
---
Challenge accepted ;-)
---
BoS must've been using the bobblehead damage glitch.
---
You paid to get the best gear in the game and I can guarantee you 4 out of 5 pieces are duped.
---
Now you think you're good at PvP with duped gear. I hope the new PvE servers don't let you dupers bring your game genie gear.
---
It is. I tend to buy most marine armour I see in vendors at about 100 caps each. Then scrap it back home.
---
Cool thanks, I'll be on pretty soon. Will add you when I am. Mines ManLikeJay93
---
Yeah all in all a vats build for Heavy seems completely unfeasible. Which hits the issue of not being able to match the DPS of other guns. Two shot and Overdrive helped ease this gap. Sadly, both were substantially nerfed.
---
Next patch they said they are buffing heavy guns. It either has to be a pretty large base dmg increase or as I suggested, the ability to crit outside of vats.
---
He downvoted u for this so I upvoted u lol cause true.
---
Well thats great you know that :) cause im pretty sure beteshda cares pretty much about income from this game
---
The essay that someone is quitting is OK. 
---
It's the repeated follow-up essays from people who say they have quit that get tiresome. They need to move on. Go troll Red Dead Redemption. 
---
It’s everywhere. If you see somebody sitting still or constantly running in a right, don’t engage, you will surely die, now that guns are so bad to the point that they can’t even take a sliver off a sentinel health set.
---
This is what really pissed me off. BGS says they have laid down the ban hammer on dupers and still people are running around accusing each other of being dupers like it's the fucking red scare.
---
I'm 500+ hours in and still finding things. As an example I just found Margie McClintock's body with her final note and I got hit with some feels.
---
While I understand that you are being sarcastic I want to point out that modders have developed their own games (DayZ ring a bell). But lets ignore that a moment and look at it in black and white. Modders don't have large budgets for developing an engine. Added any development time takes away fromincome generation so that rules full time work out. So Bethesda and Gaming studios in general in contrast have large budgets, massive talent pools and third party contractors to help them develop engines and tools. Not doing this to bash Bethesda or be a dick to you even if you are being rude. But you cant fairly ask a modder to risk what little they have to give you a strong game without any financial support and the same options. And nobody in the modding community is saying they are better. Just that some of these fixes are trivial, others shouldn't exist because its poor coding and ar other times we feel the engine needs an overhaul cause the limitation is causing the issue. So peace to you and have a nice day.
---
Im not quitting yet. But got to be realistic also
---
I genuinely wish there were more flattering underarmor or underwear options though.
---
Most of them will be back first free dlc. Then the complaints will start all over again.
---
Yes, that was it. Thank you. I forgot the name of it.
---
Well, considering nothing could kill him I would say that's a problem. I'm killable. It happens sometimes if a wanted person is wary enough. I have seen some incredibly inventive tactics, and been out-smarted. Sometimes people have good enough armor to survive that first hit, and back before the explosive nerf if I didn't quite kill one of these people in one shot, or they saw me coming, I was probably dead (Still am with explosive shotguns, even after the nerf. They still get the job done for PvP.). You hard-countered them with stealth. If there is a counter for what this guy had, that's legitimate. If not, it's not good for the game. 
---
Haha not every piece of good gear is duped. Good sentinel pieces go for 10-20k caps on the market. You know much duped weapons go for? 2k. So if they are duped why do so little people have them and people are willing to pay so much for a single piece? 
---
Dude..  shut up or they will nerf it. We'll only see glowing squirrels there if they find out.
---
Just a hunch that it's a contrived gimmick to encourage players to actually wander around and explore, rather than fast traveling everywhere. 
---
If you want all its cheaper to craft. Asbestos i bought, rubber &amp; plastic you can farm fast &amp; easy. Steel also
---
what if this is a "winner writes history" moment?
---
BOS sent a large caravan to the east to establish a stronghold, it failed and nobody up top wants a record of it?
---
Shotguns + pistols VATS crit build with no power armor. 
---
Or if you not searching for this bug  intentionally 
---
I want to be like Skyrim. Can we ride a Scorchbeast Queen?
---
That basically describes my play. 
---
I fucking lost that piece during mama dolce’s event quest because I spammed action button and it went in as “canned meat” 😭
---
I love the holotape in the uranium fever mine, the somber ness of the npc as she describes what life is like as a raider and having to do the things she doesn’t want to do. It’s long too, maybe 3 or 5 minutes and it’s just amazing. 
---
I have to agree with this. Have to. Can't possibly do anything else because I've personally witnessed nearly every single one of these issues since the recent "patches". I now do LESS damage to ANYTHING with ANY weapon. I die five times trying to kill one supermutant because he regenerates 90% of anything I do to him before he kills me.  Then there's the magic respawn of enemies in any given area (after you clear a place out) that jacks all the enemies to over triple what their level was in the first place. If they weren't so obviously a revenge function, I could handle them, but they are damn near bullet proof and they generate as a full MOB. What the hell is that anyway?
---
I crunched some numbers the other day and my conclusion was that there mathematically shouldn't bae any more than 3 or 4 full sets of _____sentinel/cavalier armor on each gaming system after 80 days.
---
PvP is pay 2 win. A bunch of people running around with game genie gear. A lot of them think their armor is legit because they traded for it, but it's not and they are cheaters.
---
It's a cryptography.
---
Either the code can be solved by an algorithm running on a website, or it can't be solved in a reasonable amount of time. That's how cryptography works.
---
There is a slow spot between levels 20-50.   Afterl 50 it gets much easier and more fun, IMO.  
---
I get that, I've played games like merc 2 on ps2, they fucked everything up but I still enjoyed it because its was mercs. If I wanted to refund it, i'd have lost half its value from day 1.
---
Also if we look into HOW long we spend in a game, the first question is content, the second is game play and the third is how it all balances since it all ties into your enjoyment of it. 
---
I have over 1000 hours in total wars, I have 600 hours on KH series, Dont even ask about FF or Resident evil, I couldn't say.
---
I have those many hours not because they were treated as investments but because the games were solid on release and instead gameplay tweaks, balance changes and bug fixes, they were able to add on with more content because they at least had a fully functional game!
---
Don't worry about coming off snarky or condescending, your not. 
---
Still brings into question, how they got there? Thats quite a haul for a failed mission that they wont even record.
---
I don't think it makes sense to compare "the best" with "the best."
---
Yes, melee has the potential to do immense damage, but it also requires a specific build and perks to do so.  The *average* melee user does need to smash or stab things multiple times.  Not to mention they also have to get right next to the enemy to do it, tanking whatever shots are coming their way, while TSE users got to sit back and sip drinks from a rooftop.
---
Yeah but there is no counter for someone one shotting you from slap damage. Is that good for the game?
---
This is brigading...
---
North of Vault 76 should be good with all of the farms
---
\* cries in bloodied build \*
---
Nexusmods has a [fallout76custom.ini](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/32) that you can download from the better inventory mod page. Explains where to put it and how to add stuff to it as well. 
---
That's why I always carry a secondary weapon and shoot people again the second they go down. What that was is "Life Saving" armor. It gives you a pretty decent chance to auto-stim when you get downed and bring you back. But if you down someone and then quickly put another shot in their head, that puts a stop to any shenanigans. haha
---
Just TSE weapons?
---
Go to school kid. Don't skip math for a liberal arts degree. Learn probability and statistics.
---
no chameleon, 15 agi at the moment
---
All of them and I know about the nerfs to TSE weapons. I'm a stealth rifle build. I use to have a non-legendary hunting rifle that did something like 150 damage. It was not much but with sneak bonus it would at least do decent chunks of damage. Now that same sniper only does 96 damage. 
---
Also, I posted a pic in comments of base damage for lvl 50 hunting rifle being 42. From my understanding that should be 70. Am I missing something here? 
---
Not thay I don't get irritated at times by the bugs. Server drops when I'm a fet feet from picking up my scrap after dying or near the end of a "defend the workshop" are my pet peeves. 
---
But I do appreciate that bethesda is making a real effort to improve things. (Latest patch not withstanding.)
---
Why would you make such an obvious lie? If in your c.a.m.p. they all tie to your own stash.. don't lie to people here. Noob.
---
I've had non-stash boxes before. Granted it was a while ago, so I don't know exactly where they were, but I have had them
---
They are rolling out in March.. will have the option to play regular or survivor where PVE rules are different...
---
I actually had more fun when I was lower levels because it felt more like survival.  I didnt have legendaries, I had to watch my food and water, and I was busy exploring.  Quality of life perks were priority over all the damage stuff for me. 
---
But in answer to your question I think it was around 50, because I knew where to go to get things, I had decent perk setup, and had fair equipment.  
---
lol I would pay to watch a griefer try to melee you and kill themselves. That sounds hysterical and very satisfying (for you, not for them).
---
I dunno about the mutations since I don't use them, but I haven't lost any of my gear.
---
"Should"      
---
Yup,   
---
Fifty? Daaaaamn.
---
We have been swallowing all of the buggy shit and dcing hoping we will hit that point soon where at least we are strong and established enough to not end up in the weeds if an encounter goes sideways. I know we aren't high level or anything and we still new, but between the bugs and how underwhelming talents feel, we have ended up eyeballing the level 100's kinda in awe. 
---
It's because this subreddit is a hate filled circle jerk, that has done more bad then good. It gets popular during patches because people have a better chance of getting internet points. I'm not trying to shit on the people who have constructive criticism, but the " why I finally left buzzfeed" style posts on here are cancer.
---
I remember when talking about end game meant "You rushed the game idiot!". I'm genuinely happy people at least recognize it as a real issue now, but it's pretty annoying how many people were leaping to defend all the awful choices so ardently. 
---
Yep that was it! And I have since found out that he was most likely talking about the Camden Park mascot outfit which looks completely fucking different. But dude was just positive about it.
---
Generic stuff, maybe a stimpak, ammo, nothing special.  And next time you log on it comes back....
---
So I guess Today would not be the day to ask for Clean Versions of wallpaper for my CAMP? 
---
I hunker down into a crouch right when I load. 
---
I've had the pipboy freeze too. Almost always it'll unfreeze. 
---
The delay is the program loading everything on you, along with all of the world around you onto your system. 
---
I don't mind the delay, unless I happen to have logged in right beneath a scorchbeast and it's attacking me whiie I can't move. 
---
When they buff heavy and energy weapons the streets will flow red with the blood of newbs.
---
Another day another glitch, I had such high hopes 
---
Still loving the game, exploring and derping casually, but I can’t handle the salt here anymore. So yes I quit, but not the game.
---
Surprised no one has posted this possible correlation... We asked bethesda to get rid of the doopers, and they did, and now the reddit is empty and the market is dead. 
---
Yeah I'm kind of hoping he sees this thread. The two outfits, after being informed about the Camden Park outfit, look completely fucking different.
---
Level 1 or level 2 starched genes? 
---
Yer so annoying 
---
For me the anti virus was the problem. It blocked it from making changes to its folder so I had manually allow fallout 76 permission. If you re using bitdefender this might be your problem as well,just sayin'
---
rank 1 or two? rank 1 still has a chance to cure, rank 2 will never cure.
---
That was the same response anyone got during the first few weeks if they had managed to kill the scorch queen and realized that there was no end game. 
---
It was basically "You rushed the game idiot" or "You didn't even play the game!". Instead of people realizing how massive the issue would be when everyone effectively hits end game. 
---
No that 70 definetly sounds right. I'm not sure about them nerfing anything else when I get on today ill check it out because yesterday all I used was my TSE 50 Cal, power fist, and ghoul slay grog axe and everything seemed mostly normal. Definetly going to check it out. 
---
I can't see how you have seen some by 80.  My 86 character has seen dozens.  Are you not paying attention to the number of dots or inspecting them?
---
You're right. I have been flamed onlinr over the years plenty of times, but for some reason this one got me. I don't know why, maybe because I had just got done helping them. Maybe because this guy was just so sure I was cheating. I don't know. But you're right.
---
Think the way Bloody Mess works was also stealth nerfed?
---
Make sure you dont have strange in numbers on, if your not in a team, taking it off and putting it back on if you are in a team can fix it sonetimes
---
20% per mod for a one time investment. Some of the mods took more effort than their DLCs.
---
I'm in the White Springs, and when I crouch it says "CAUTION" and healing factor isn't healing me, and I'm just expecting a player to come and easily kill me 😑 I'm wondering if I'm hostile, and why I would be hostile. 
---
Zealot perk does not apply to scorchbeasts. I crafted an Ultracite Laser Gatling gun with a prime receiver and it sucked. With all 3 heavy weapon perks at level 3 plus the "Stabilized" perk from Intelligence at level 3 the base damage of the weapon is 22. The same level (45) minigun has a base damage of 33 and that's considered awful. Unless the person was stacking bobbleheads and magazines they were not responsible for the damage you claim to see. You saw what you saw but I know what the weapon is (in)capable of doing. Mostly nothing.

Tbh plastic is my problem because I bulk everything and it goes very quickly. I'll need to look up some ways of getting lots. Probably the golf course I imagine.
---
Strangely accurate 
---
He needs to learn facts firstl, than he can post where ever he wants to. Right now, the quality of the post is low so I pointed it out. Your try at sarcasm is cute :)
---
You know there's nothing to do in the actual game, WHEN... 😆😆
---
Thanks! It's a 3-star. Quad ammo, instigating, and +1 perception! I was so psyched when I got it. 
---
Jfc I didn’t make the connection that she was the one in the airport closet. Wow.
---
Rank one
---
Bullshit. It's impossible for a Super Mutant (or any enemy in particular) to kill you in 2 hits unless you're underleveled
---
I see people say it tramples existing story, but I've yet to see any concrete examples of it.
---
Yeah but we're talking about Charleston, WV.
---
Happens to me too.  It's been reported and there was a Bethesda post saying it was on their list.  Right now the only thing I know to do is walk around a bit before opening the Pipboy.
---
If i am inspired to Pick a Lock or Open a Terminal i will take the time to equip the appropriate card(s) but otherwise i skip most of that "Locked" content. it's just not worth the meager rewards. 
---
Yeah probably players who dropped their items by mistake. But reading stuff like this makes you worry... and to be honest I haven’t logged in again yet because of that.
---
That would be actually really funny and interesting. 
---
Only way I have found to avoid it consistently is to make sure I can switch and reload weapons before opening the Pip boy.
---
Less annoying than having to take your armor off each log off I guess but looking forward to it being fixed for sure.
---
I love those rifles. So satisfying to fire and reload! I only actually discovered it in 76 a few weeks ago. Don't think I've ever found one in 4 (after more than 250 hours of playtime), let alone in earlier games.
---
Watoga high school...80-150 plastic / run 
---
That's why, it only reduces the chance of losing mutation with level 1. Level 2 will secure it. 
---
Well I wish it were BS. Honestly. I guess I'll get a capture of it next time. But I appreciate your skepticism and critical thinking. 
---
I wish they had gone the route of making each rifleman perk also do weight reduction by the same percent as the damage percent. So maxing rifle perks would reduce weight by 60%. Doing only 1 in each rifleman perk (normal, expert, master) would get you 30%.
---
That started happening with update #4. It's a bug that I have never seen Bethesda mention. You just gotta avoid opening the Pipboy until the world loads. Who knows if it will ever get fixed.
---
Agreed.  Hoping someone on here knows for sure.
---
You do know that powerful melee weapons were also duped and sold, right?
---
If you cant make a masterpiece, then make the biggest fuck up theyve ever seen.
---
commercial  airliner?
---
military cargo plane?
---
Do we know how many were in WV? Maybe 20 BOS "rebels" flew with weapons, ammo, and building materials. Once they landed they recruited in WV? It seems like they weren't ready for whats in WV, so coming ill-prepared is possible.
---
Rubber 70-100/ run at grafton high school. A few carts with basketballs &amp; kickballs

Activision to its poor credit and reputation at least provides a title that works as intended. Yes, it has had a few of it's own launch issues but the patches in general worked. And yes, they need and fo things the base doesn't appreciate. While Bethesda is trying  they are also adopting the bad habits of the big boy companies. And currently, FO76 isn't in a stable condition so it's like giving someone a bad sandwich and asking for double the price. Fanbase is taking it on the chin but the outcry is getting more vocal because the decisions cut into the trust we have give developers to give us quality games without gouging, cash grabs or generally alienating us.
---
Doesn't sound plausible to me either 
---
I hate that there are so many cool things in the game and they are all classified as junk.  I had several robot models and lots of stuffed animals but there is nothing to do with them.  They just take up valuable weight in the box so I ended up scrapping them all.
---
I'd still get my 5 shots off before you got your 2 swings in :)
---
Fighting an armoured mob, to me it's as it should be. Scorched/ghouls go down far easier. 
---
Is this on different servers, different worlds can give you completely different results this is a fact, so make sure you break up the team and try. Also try different weapons even if you believe your weapon is good.
---
So many glowing steaks withe super duper at full. I drop them for people all the time.
---
I know. I'm kinda hoping he sees this post. Also he was insistent that I was a cheater or had no life (which basically both imply the game is my life) and he sounded like he hadn't been out of the basement in days. I think it was projection.
---
It's being in a \[Caution\] or potentially \[Danger\] state when there doesn't seem to be an enemy for miles, and the state doesn't go away if you continue to sit there (and likewise, nothing attacks you either).
---
I’m down, you wanna DM for an add?
---
I run with a normal lever action and its fine.   
---
No, this is for non-legendary weapons.  Here is link to the hunting rifle example (no perks attached when I did this):  [http://imgur.com/gallery/tPlz40T](http://imgur.com/gallery/tPlz40T) 
---
I'm getting downvoted so maybe I'm an idiot and totally off base but isn't the base damage of a lvl 50 hunting rifle suppose to be 70? (This is happening to all my weapons)
---
Is that a thing? Friends only mode?
---
Annoy her until she speaks to you. Sometime you just have to A)interact over and over until she acknowledges you
---
&gt;Power gives a huge advantage to non-stealth players
---
you mean PA? because Power Armor sucks compared to regular armor.
---
You can just collect them and refuse the quest 
---
And super duper perk and armorer when crafting 
---
How many caps per hour does it produce?
---
There are usually a couple behind the hotel in Flatwoods.  Easiest thing for that challenge is dog meat steak.  Mongrel dog meat and mutfruits.  I equipped my perk cards that lets you get double plants and chance for more meat and got it done pretty quickly.
---
&gt; EDIT: Downvoting already? What the reason? This? https://imgur.com/a/mo2tib1
---
This is 100% accurate, and has been since release.
---
Well that's exactly why I am here. Because it's not right. Something is way off. Maybe I just ran into a glitch? But after the Mayor for a Day fiasco, it got me wondering if this has happened to anyone else, and find a solution. 
---
I just found Margie McClintock the leader of one of the other Raider groups and her final note was a punch in the feels
---
Nice post! 
---
Jesus Christ man, that's fuckin awful. Good on you for blowing up his house.
---
I think that's what got to me, being talked to like that after trying to be nice. WTF is wrong with people, they wouldn't talk to you like that in person. And if they did they would be sociopaths.
---
Why would you have to take your armor off? I've never heard of this. What happens if you don't?
---
Or you could just stop being an asshole,  that would work too.
---
No clue why this is getting downvoted but okay
---
You got it, random stranger on the internet.  :)
---
The problem is that screwing up is the only thing they do.
---
what do you mean my power gives 514 energy and ballistic resistance not to mention 333 rad resist. explain to me how normal armor of any kind even compares with this.
---
Part of that is also the kill unruly golfers miscellaneous quest.  Before those fuckers would never spawn if you were above a certain level making the mission damn near impossible to complete.
---
We did server hop to try redoing Mayor for a Day. I took my axe, grenades, and a Gauss rifle. We decided to come back with even more people later. As far as the Super Mutant goes, I tried to get him with my axe. He got me with his Sledge. :/
---
It was a previous glitch with weight reduction armor like the excavator where you didn't get the weight reduction if you logged on wearing it. Had to log in without wearing then put on anything you wanted weight perks from.
---
I haven't lost any gear however the mutations can be weird. You don't really loose them though they just get bugged. Swap to another server problem solved. The game currently has a bunch of weird little issues but they are all manageable really. But I didn't know it was a rad worms but if that's the case wouldn't a simple disease cure fix the issue? No disease no bug but idk I didn't know the bugs were based off the diseases. 
---
Also making sure you can reload weapons is a great idea. This is exactly what I was looking for, some kind of indicator that its ok to open my pipboy. Now I just got to train myself to do that each time. Thank you!
---
Everyone isn’t desperate for help and loot hungry. I play these games to work for my rewards, not be handed things as soon as I start. That ruins it for me from jump. 
---
It's not always this bad. Promise. Alot of people here still enjoy the game. 
---
Is this a new patch today? 
---
Login Suggestion
---
There's about a 1 minute period immediately after you log on in which you're incapacitated as a player, because the world is loading and your gear is loading. 
---
During this time, it seems that you're immobile, but can be attacked or absorb rads. 
---
To futher complicate things, often upon login, power armor helmets aren't equipped and secondary weapons are forgotten by the system. 
---
It would be helpful if you'd give players about 30 seconds of extra damage resistance, just in case they have dropped into a blast zone or landed in the middle of a group of angry yao guai. 
---
Just long enough to put the power armor helmet back on, and so on. 
---
I like how you see all these posts about low levels thanking 100+ players for serums, but when I call someone out for taking those serums meant to go to a low level I get downvoted to hell. This sub really has identity issues don't it?
---
Nope just a normal hunting rifle base damage without perks decreased from 70 to 42
---
I mean, scavenging is a pretty big part of being sub-Lv. 50.  Sometimes you have to make do with sub-par weapons and armor, and I think that was a very intentional design choice.
---
Wish we could use it on the Western Revolver. :(
---
Prime sucks for flux. Do white spring or tops of the wormd
---
Well they’ve completely lost my interest in anything they make so great experiment. 
---
Ahh, that makes sense. Thanks!
---
I saw that this has to do with rad worms. Once you lose that, your mutations quit til you log on again.
---
that's ok. just nerf melee and bloodied to the ground and we're even.
---
Also, stealthboy mod is for power armor and also very effective at PvP.
---
legendary prefixes.
---
I'm just tired of playing games that, instead of buffing everything to the state of it being fun, nerfs everything to keep their game requiring you to log in everyday and treat it like a job.
---
It happens with eyebot hordes and radrat hordes also. Thought it would be fun to find a legendary eyebot 100 caps later and I'm disappointed it's a low lvl boss enemy. 
---
huh?
---
What?! Looks like I'm going back to school then.
---
Pvp sucks because it always seems to be a team of raiders vs a single player (at least for this bloodied lone wondered)... However I think that group v group (or faction v faction) could be fun as it would be more balanced numbers wise
---
&gt;grow up and get a life.
---
People here creating thread with false information about bans for crafting guns. I think people like that never will grow up
---
like i actually carry a gatling with me, since mine has furious its a big boi shredder.
---
#bethesdabuffheavyweps
---
This post made me feel sorry for you almost enough to not downvote it. 
---
Almost.
---
Bless Online failed quicker than FO76.
---
Same. 
---
Yeah both schools are awesone for those mats 
---
You nailed it. Thanks
---
Yea eyebot hordes will only ever be level 1. The eyebot doesn’t have any level other than 1. It’s a good way to find level one legendary starter items though
---
two shot weapons are stupid and should have never been put in this game, period
---
&gt;LOL, your points are valid and I most definitely want them reworked.
---
Doesn't armourer just add durability to it? Or am I missing something useful?
---
Was not overweight. The Save My Stuff mod was doing it.
---
They also spread false bug reports and make stupid stories up that make no sense when questioned. 
---
It’s not really “pay” to win. It’s more of “dupe” to win. You could’ve easily duped a shit ton of TSE Handmades, sold them for cheap, and ran off to buy sentinel armor, or buy yourself a worthy trade for it. Mutation serums for caps were certainly a more legit way, until people duped the plans.
---
I know it's a great gun, very satisfying. And the reload animation is also satisfying but slow when you have to reload 20 rounds lol. Wasn't the lever rifle in the Far Harbor DLC? 
---
Melee hit detection over all is broken. It's not fun if you're fighting a Yao Guai, ramming your flaming pitchfork up its ass and still getting staggered because it clawed at the air in front of it.
---
The stagger of hermit crabs also sometimes does weird things, like staggering you on top of a two storey building (sometimes the crab even teleports...). Ghouls have to be the worst offenders though. I've been punched through walls, from 10m away, on top of vehicles and even buildings.
---
That’s what that is?? I thought it was an envelope lmao 
---
😂 😂😂 Maybe in a survival game but Fo76 is far from that. 
---
Somebody mentioned it requires less mats. Never checked though lol
---
I got mine off a robo brain during awol event
---
maybe i am a little behind here. yes certain legendary mods are good for boosting stats but none of them can boost your damage resist up to 500.
---
&gt;"Fix something like, players will no longer become 'Wanted' if they accidentally damage another player's CAMP."
---
*one finger curls closed*
---
I saw the shitstorm on this sub the day of patch 5 (while I was at work) and didnt bother even downloading it.
---
I still come to this sub to see if anything new has come up, but im like everyone else, got nothing left to do, and I dont want to get annoyed by the new bugs.
---
I was enjoying this sub (answering questions, helping newbies) more than I was playing the game in the week leading up to patch 5.
---
Just feels really thin lore wise, of the "rebels" they had enough that wouldve been high enough ranked to make a dent in them leaving. Idk maybe they did make a 12 hour flight to wv before or after the nukes, if before then why WV in particular? If after the great war, it makes the 12 hour flight way longer. Even with vertibirds id imagine they need refueling quite a bit and looking at the inside of em holds maybe 5 people without luggage...
---
Southwest of watoga
---
U/ladydevann any news or info at where we'll be able to get plans for mods like the BoS combat armor mod plans. I'm still missing the legs but grafton vendor (which is where I got the chest and arms) doesn't seem to have any now
---
Have heard of that weight changing bug. But mine was the Save My Stuff mod. It was doing too good of a job saving me stuff.
---
Yeah that's weird if it is true.  Haven't experienced anything like that myself.  
---
Prepare for fanboy attack saying its your own fault
---
you mean like I already do without them if the camp I am spawning into is on uneven ground/not sitting at ground level?
---
You cna only use one terminal its to prevent duping 
---
Check your perks? Unequipped and re equip
---
Killed her last night and got legendary crappy wood chest piece and a plan fur Gauss rifle night vision scope. 
---
Yes. But they didn't have the answer. Another reddit user did. Save My Stuff mod was causing it.
---
I hope all of them really kids 12-14 years old. Because if not... well... 
---
Do you ever stop whining? xD
---
I can get my bolstering set to 600 with the right perk cards.
---
[Wow, impressive.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSSADfZ01eU)
---
Yes and it was the problem. Thanks.
---
I’m not trying to use multiple terminals. That also doesn’t make any sense. You can’t use two terminals. I’m saying it won’t let you use ANY terminal because the vendor is always busy for some reason. The multiple terminals I’m referring to are the ones for the various areas like science bay and production
---
That's a good point. I didn't think about that. They must have had better perk trees. 
---
Thank you for your feedback. I hope you don't. Seems like it may have been a glitch. 
---
Yeah, I just looked it up and it was in FH. Still, no memory of finding it there... And the reloading speed is, as nicely I can address it, somewhat of an inconvenience, especially when dealing with a lot of enemies at the same time.
---
Evil corporations? Excuse me:
---
Niiiice idea!
---
I feel this way about most Bethesda franchises. There are a lot of things I would personally like to see added to various games, but almost none of the stupid shit people ask for.
---
This happens to me all the time.  I get super laggy, screen freezes, server craahes, queen has no loot, corpse disappears, it's horrid.  I avoid the only end game contest because it's not worth all the ammo I lose.  
---
The duping thing is one person stands at one terminal and guy at the other they can see the same items in stock and buy yhe same thing at the same time they would sell a outfit or gun exit re enter and both buy its dumb but it worked 
---
Since this patch my gunslinger build is worthless, Im lvl 180 and today I went to Wes tek with a 3* handmade and a 2 shot explosive 3* 10mm, both wepons broke, expended around 1500 rounds, died multiple times. I don't want to one shot everything but also I don't want to tickle the supermutents. 
---
Even before finding a two shot anything I could do more damage then now kinds gets me thinking if there was a raise in health for enemies. 
---
What level are you?
---
DR means squat in pvp. you want damage reduction, which you can only get enough of through legendary armor.
---
PA has emergency protocols but it's not enough.
---
As the other person said, I don't want to wade through a river of tears to find anything substantial here. The first one or two posts might be justified because they give some insight, but then the next 50 all say the exact same fucking thing. If I want to check the front page to see what's the biggest issue at the moment or whether bethesda has made any announcements, guess what, I can't because there are 5 gilded "fuck this game I'm quitting and I need everybody to validate my decision" posts wasting space on the front page
---
I couldn't even begin to compare Fallout 76 and Minecraft.  Their design objectives are wildly different.  76 is more-or-less Fallout 4 with other players and no conversation system.  It is more structured, despite being open-ended.  Minecraft is, in most respects, digital Legos.
---
I'm at level 88
---
Imo the slow spot was 20-30/35. 35 I started flying through levelups, but then again, I did that in the first month of the games release. I cant speak to the rate of leveling up now
---
Good point, didn't even think of that :)
---
Compared to FO76? It's a lot more fun
---
You weren't affected by other factors like high radiation, right?  Like you didn't notice your health pool was already low?  
---
I don't think it's the TSE folks making the noise. It's the large percentage of players who owned either a TS or an explosive who are pissed off.
---
Don't be ignorant not every gun with TS or explosive is a TSE.
---
It is a quest item you build. Miner miracles is the quest name. Find the quest at garrahan mining HQ in the ash heap or find a poster with the suit on it and activate it. You need lots of black titanium and springs,among other things. Black titanium can be found in mole miner suit scrap, it is found on mole miners you have killed. The ore itself looks reddish, some can be found in the belching betty mine.
---
The quest requires you to be at level 25, once completed you get a plan for a power armor station.  I think this is the only place to get that plan. 
---
The Enclave offered a very fair duping service. Both parties had to rebuy the item back from MODUS.
---
Only one of the terminals in each area works now.  You need to try each one, and give it time if on a laggy server.  Last time I was in production it was the one on the left, for example.
---
Ah, glad to see that went off. I personally never really bothered but if it's more peaceful than this place, I might at least consider it
---
Yeah 1k caps for that nice armor kinda dumb 
---
Dunno what you mean, there are 3.8k people on the reddit right now. That's exactly the type of numbers it's had for awhile now.
---
Also, if people do leave, my guess would be because this reddit is becoming as toxic and shitty as the Fallout sub. Too many big claims posts with zero evidence, too much whining as opposed to constructive criticism, and too many stupid threads getting lots of thumbs up from non-players.
---
I was stoked for it. I have trouble believing that multiplayer was their central focus for the beginning of this game’s development. 
---
“We always start with the world” 
---
Not “we always start with the player and what they can do, then we give them a world” 
---
That's probably the result of years of bad programming habits and trying to work with spaghetti code.
---
I'm hopeful for a changeling if we meet.  
---
If you have the Grognak outfit the "gimp mask" appearance looks disturbingly appropriate.
---
I got it low level on my first character, like most legendaries. I made a new character and am finishing all the quests again to get the rewards as end game items. 
---
Agreed. This legendary effect needs to be de-nerfed. The explosive effect was the only part that needed nerfing, and in a way that ensured that it remains unaffected by perks/bobbleheads. My thoughts anyway.
---
Or. They. Can. Get. Off. Their. Asses. And. Fucking. Fix. It. 
---
You sound like an idiot. xD
---
Speaking of stealth, do we all agree that Stealth Boys don't work except the regular ones? I regularly throw away the mark III :( 
---
I am not super thrilled about the Queen. Nothing to do with nerfs or drops, but the five low levels cowering in the back of the shed while the high levels try and defeat her. First, you make her impossible, second, get into the fight. The worse that is going to happen is you lose some junk. If you aren’t there to fight, leave. Rant over. 
---
Probably. But I've worked in game development on networked permeated in-game data across multiple clients and multiple distributed databases. This is not good enough. This is basic, obvious bugs. The quality control is lacking in this rushed product. 
---
Haha I love using idiot savant as a perk as I get experience when I do/say something stupid it's funny
---
No, it was full. I was on a bridge in the Mire with no rads. My friend was in my base, it was just one Super Mutant, so I told him I'd take care of it while he rearranged his inventory. He came running when I got taken down. I respawned and we both took him down. 
---
I'm surprised Call of Duty never did 1 v 4 mode.
---
It works, but not like the combat helmet with combat armor or the metal helmet and armor. 
---
Some times I log in and enemies are WAY harder to kill then normal... Maybe a glitch (mutations acting up?)? But these harder to kill enemies drop better legendaries, so I usually just go with it.
---
Yea, I've unequipped all perks, logged out and back in to re-equip perks multiple times. Unfortunately ever time I log in I still see base damage of lvl 50 hunting rifle - 42, lvl 45 handmade-27, lvl 50 combat rifle-24, etc. (No perks attached values)
---
All of these problems are rooted in Bethesda's lack of communication.
---
Like 3-4 weeks after ban reports start coming in, they just address it yesterday?
---
They've easily been able to make sure people know what is going on with shit but they've chosen to do nothing until its too late.
---
I use one but then again, I’m still only a lvl 18 so I have a ways to go before I get anything good lol.
---
I normally find a ton of violet @ the prime site. 
---
So what's the point of searching the map for a workshop owner if they didn't bother to come fight for their workshop?! Husband and I were minding out own business no where near the workshop getting ready to log only to be attacked by someone that took a workshop we owned. I didn't understand why it seemed they were able to attack and kill us with just a few shots when we never attacked back. Personally, I'm not big into the whole PVP aspect.. I will usually just leave the server. Other than farming for camps PVP'ing why keep attempting to kill someone 70 levels lower than you after you've taken the resource they owned?! 
---
Did you not read the last paragraph? I have a TS Gatling. Pre-nerf it was op, seconds to kill a SB. And it wasn’t even explosive. After the nerf it’s still strong. It just isn’t a win button. There’s your first hand experience.
---
thanks, but im on PS4
---
😂😂 I'm melee build but I bring nice guns so I'm not sitting around while she spams everyone. 
---
Yeah, that is bizarre.  
---
Almost like another player was dressed up as a super mutant, haha 
---
it makes perfect sense examining the code. But its asinine that it got coded in such a way that this could happen.
---
Yes obviously you get a 50% „buff“ to both positive and negative effects of your mutations when getting the rad worm disease. I heard stories that curing the disease can leave you with only the negative effects of the mutation. But I also heard stories that server hopping fixes the problem. Man...at the moment, you hear all kinds of stuff, a lot of it contradictory. 
---
This does seems do be one of those subjects in the game that never gets a definitive answer.
---
I'm going to have to resort to asking:
---
# The Mistress of Mystery
---
Except I think she may indisposed :/
---
I do use traveling pharmacy, but not the other 2. I usually carry a bunch of stimpaks on me to revive friends or people i find in the nuke zones, so they do add up. Once i finally found 2 calibrated shocks for my x01 the weight reducing perks don't really matter much anymore. Although, after this last patch, none of the perk cards matter much anymore as I have very little ambition to play right now, haha.
---
Dotto, unless it is a legendary with static damage boost to offset the low per shot damage.  At that point the become crazy good for me.
---
I've run into him a few times
---
You have more agility then I do and I dont have sneak maxed out and am usually never spotted until I start shooting. 
---
The option to place them at your camp would be a nice touch. 
---
Thank you 
---
I'm in. When are you dropping?
---
I think you are completely missing the point on why people are upset.
---
But rifles weigh 15+ lbs ok. I mean my AR is like 27lbs lol 
---
Seen it several places, but it is called "Plan:Revolver."  When crafted it becomes the short western revolver, and has the most damage of the three revolvers.
---
It needs taken offline 
---
Yeah... I would like to better at this type of pvp, but I rarely encounter it so am unprepared (perk/armor wise) and unpracticed.
---
I’m open to ideas. Why are people actually upset?
---
Pissing everyone sounds painful
---
In most games where hacking or greifing is an inevitability there exists done way to control who you play with. Be it private servers, offline/solo, friends only sessions, etc.
---
To be honest, people would only start using the flamer if crafting yielded 100 fuel not 9.
---
Ok added you, Im Cateos
---
Another genius who doesn't understand why blanket nerfs are bad.
---
TSE Shotgun = Still Powerful
---
TSE Minigun, Pipe Pistol, Laser Gatling, etc.  = Useless Crap
---
We will wait man. We will wait
---
Lol! That would be crazy. But that does have me thinking. Maybe the game registered a different enemy? Or him being a higher level than it showed? 🤔
---
Since the OP is so gung ho about "proof" where is your proof that it was all done by the Austin studio when most interviews prior to release of F76 stated that many studios under Zenimax were involved in the creation of F76. And believe it or not but whether it's done by the Maryland studio or the Austin one the end result will still be a buggy game. Oh and as for Rage 2 and Wolfenstein...well sure they're only the "publisher" but that alone leads to those games being exclusive to the crappy Bethesda launcher.
---
Same
---
Gonna start on the silo now ❤️
---
Pretty release server load testing if memory serves.
---
You still have it?
---
I only have 4 mutation and marsupial is one of them. It's the only one I ever have a issue with or that I notice anyways. Sometime I loose the effects all together other time they are enhanced for no real reason. I also end up with the effects from the strange in numbers perk card every once in awhile when I don't have the card equipped. 
---
Kelvin. 
---
Took my picture there too!

Whats wierd is I think that is the tallest point in the game, but if you go to spruce knob theres a billboard that says thats the tallest point. The only way I think thats possible is if you climb on top of the observation tower (marsupial). If you get your crosshairs perfectly parallel with the earth, it lines up with the top of that peak.
---
(To get xhairs parallel, I lined an antenna up with the edge of the screen)
---
If I had to guess its probably because some idiot in upper management was insistent that voice only is a superior experience. While not entirely wrong, but no other game really mandates users use voice for comms because it's inconvenient and tiring.
---
My other theory is that they knew the abysmal state of the game and ditched text chat as the screenshots coming out of the game would've been far worse.
---
Happens a lot.
---
I just mark the map and run away then run back, about 50% of the time she magically has loot.
---
Or forget to wear armor, broken armor, etc?
---
It's funny.....I just had a conversation with a kid hating on the TSE kids for being 'dupers'. Then I find out that this kid has a full set of of Assassin's Sentinel armor that of course he traded for legit and doesn't believe any of it's duped gear.
---
What a shit show!!!! It reminds me of the 'game genie' back in the days.
---
Put on the BOS suits and tone character model down and it looks hella nice. This guy just put his character model on the maximum of LARGE, so it looks a bit goofy
---
The joke went over your head, hence the whoooosh sound.  You obviously didn't get his sarcasm in the op
---
Just so you know with Lockpick and hacker 3 you can pick a door and back a terminal to skip fixing the reactor, and just open the bulkhead doors. 
---
Saves a good ten minutes :)
---
YES PLEEEEASE
---
There is'a French youtube apostik who has demonstrate that Tse still best weapon full health
---
I don't think we would mind it as much if it didn't already feel like a struggle to play the game. We have had a number of crippling disconnects, crashes, slow loots, and weird bugs. We have gone invisible to each other, carry weight and over encumbered gets fucky, and audio had cut out. Feels like we are barely surviving as it is with that junk without piling on the actual survival elements. Everything takes forever to get through. 
---
Agree to disagree, I mostly refrain from base destruction. However when I do destroy ones base, it's always a one of the aforementioned floating bases, so all they need to repair is the stair to restore there entire base, costing only a little steel. Plus I drop some steel and other goodies near bases where I do this. 
---
ohh and let us craft skeletons too. for the skeleton wars in the mire
---
I keep asking them to fix their game. That's all.
---
Rust takes dedication and hard work to start having fun, in other words you have to be good.
---
Your right I guess. Those weapons are always trash tho. I can blame Beth that those weapons aren’t balanced, but it’s not the TSE needs fault. They were always bad.
---
There’s no reason to ever use a Minigun over a Gatling Gun. Or a pipe pistol in an situation outside of level 10. And the Gatling Laser is underpowered as well.
---
None of that is the TSE nerf’s fault.
---
Problems:
---
* Bethesda doesn't read support tickets
---
* Bethesda doesn't communicate rapidly when issues come up (like players being banned)
---
All of this is purely caused by Bethesda and no one else.
---
Found that Snaptail reed that had been Violet Flux in that pond yesterday at Whitespring but it wouldn't harvest or it had been taken and the model had not updated :(
---
Same thing happened to me on the Queen at least 4-5 times. Such a bummer... Hopefully they can figure this one out. Back when I played Destiny loot you didn't pick up but were entitled to went to your mailbox... I know we don't have the but maybe a similar mechanic could be thought up...
---
Happy envelope day!!!!
---
It’s gone, sorry
---
I cant wait for this beta to be over. Theres no way the game can launch in this state.
---
I guess I never payed attention that it was cause of diseases. But I usually ignore diseases cause in this game if you look at a enemy wrong you get a disease it's stupid as hell and I think needs to be worked on. 
---
I'm just trying to get a handle on how severe a nerf it was.
---
You indicate that before the nerf your weapon would kill a scorchbeast in "seconds."  Now, you don't specify how many seconds but let's say you meant five.  You go on to say that it now takes a minute.  That's 60s or 12x as long as previous.  This suggests the weapon now does somewhere in the vicinity of 8.5% of it's previous damage for a total of 91.5% reduction in effectiveness.
---
That seems a lot to me.
---
Guess it’s just a bit messed up at the moment. I think I‘ll just jump in and see what happens...
---
Some people want to achieve things on their own and not be handed any freebies.
---
Great. I'll join you in a sec.
---
This adds to the excitement of the game though!... every time i fast travel it is a surprise as to if i will spawn in the river, on the opposite bank from my camp, or (rarely) right near my front door. Then a friend will travel to my camp and they are already inside at a table before i make it out of the water, haha
---
Im in hiberantion until survival mode is implemented. Then ill get bored again and go back into hibernation until they add more new stuff
---
I have never been able to destroy stairs or floors for that matter.
---
I mean if you take the silo+SBQ as a "raid" the game has just about as much vanilla content as any other online game at launch.  Destiny 2 received it's first expansion at 4 months.  This is kind of how online games work.
---
Sorry if I wasn’t clear on “seconds”. It went from about 30 seconds to just over a minute.
---
I swear they balanced around folks having max appropriate perks and mods when they worked out balancing durability/repair.
---
There is NO. FUCKING. WAY. They play their own game. None. Zero.
---
They may piddle around with it for a few minutes at a time, but it is painfully obvious that the people in charge of the direction and making decisions have no real time or love spent playing this game the way the mods do.
---
So its one of those games where you have to learn the right way to have fun? 
---
5340 here, I have no inclination to buy anything in that store, it all looks to sappy plastic, possibly the Power Armor Camo, but again it looks to... New.
---
\+1 for wasteland appropriate items. All these people running around in freshly painted perfectly clean bling look absurd.
---
Me too. Granted, I came in with low expectations and only paid $40 for the game, but I am really liking it a lot. I have maybe 150 hours into the game and I am still having fun.
---
 Bethesda! Please make the game playable again! (Craziest request ever I know)
---
So you're only an asshole a little bit.
---
Yeah unfortunately, as I am sure you know, that is Bethesda's games -- they tend to be incredibly buggy and the fan community has always provided resolutions for it.  Would you mind giving me your perk set up?  Maybe it can provide some insight on your difficulties surviving.
---
I played up until The lastest patch! Now my friend with 21:9 res can't play and there are so many bugs. I'll probably start playing when they have fixed more bugs! I really like the game and i want to play it even more, i have two lvl 70 chsracters and thank god they haven't made my melee unplayabe, The explosive lever action I used to use  on my ranged is useless now :( 
---
I hope to play this game in The future but now is not the time! I'll check in from time to time though! 
---
Well i am gonna shut up now since i have been schooled. lol
---
Lmao, I can literally imagine the vault boy meme
---
You have a minigun that does 125% damage. It's on par with the other junk legendaries.
---
You may not realize it but this game is a slot machine. You've got to have a jackpot if you want people to sit behind the slots all day (Whitesprings).
---
Right now bloodied is the new Jackpot. But the jackpot keeps getting smaller with every nerf to the game.
---
I agree TSE was OP and Bethesda needed to do something about it. Nerfing TS and Explosive individually was the wrong way to do it, it was lazy.
---
It is honestly dumb that they fixed it like that. Remove the other 2 terminals instead of having all 3 but only one works.. what is the point of the other 2 anymore then?
---
My TS handmade and combat rifle went from 130-140 to 80-90. I'm sorry but as a level 100+ character, I don't want to waste even more ammo taking out the same charred feral ghouls and warlords in every location. I never one shot a scorchbeast, or any bigger harder enemies. The game was still fun, I felt like I was in danger of scorchbeasts and mirelurk queens but I was the danger to level 60 ghouls and mutants. I had a position in the food chain, now it has been nerfed, and I have to take time and waste ammo on the same pointless hoardes of ghouls and mutants. They didn't even do any damages to me because of my armor level, it just made it less fun!
---
what you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.
---
I made a similar post the other day about PC. It’s like the game is slowly imploding. 
---
Yeah lots of weird bugs but you shouldn't loose anything or at least I haven't as of yet and play way too much
---
Then what’s the alternative?
---
Much like irl, it rewards you if you put in the work ;) No silly communist type systems.
---
They needed a nerd but I feel they got nurfed to much I should not be able to one shot an enemy with my pump from rifle range but I feel like it was a bit excessive.  Either way I'm glad people arent one shotting me from got knows where with a shotgun that was effectively a sniper rifle. 
---
Oh! That was another weird thing. Our armor, all of our armor was at full health, even after retreating from Mayor for a Day. My friend noticed and ask the rest of us to check. Sure enough, our armor was all at full health. Then a little later, my two friends when invisible 😂 no name, nothing. It's like they were ghosts. I do have a capture of my friend opening and closing the door like a poltergeist. 
---
It's not rare at all to find but not many People use it! :) i'm currently on a Hunt for all outfits in The game and this was one of The easier ones! 
---
And this is why my doors are always unlocked.  Come in, use my stuff, I don't care.  It's difficult to "Raider-proof" a CAMP while still having it be aesthetically pleasing.
---
Perhaps, for that same reason, I will approve of any good-natured jabs against those goofy floating houses.
---
Bethesda would sue their butts off :(
---
Not have TS and E together, ever. TS should of taken precedence and the E should have been taken off those guns and made it's own prefix for future drops. Would have created a whole new class of weapons to chase!
---
Unfortunately alot of them are probably 18-25 and trying to be edgy. Anyone older has more self respect. 
---
That is the single worst thing I have heard about this game from the beginning, and friends, that is saying something :(
---
I think they don't care, this Atom Store seems aimed at kids who have their parent credit card to use on this type of rubbish. Cash grap at its finest, make hay why the nuke shines.
---
Should have eliminated the possibility to roll both.
---
Take the existing TSE guns and allow the users to keep one and have a one time re-roll on the other.
---
This would have required work though.
---
I find that setting rather annoying, I played with a bunch of people who are always shown offline by default, it made it a pain in the ass to join their game (I was in an xbox party with them, they werent actively trying to avoid me).
---
Keep in mind, being "offline" on xbox doesnt exactly work in fo76. One of them I was friends with, and even though I couldnt join their game from the xbox menus, if I checked the fo76 social tab, I could join his game that way.  
---
What confused me is he was constantly posting "looking for group” posts trying to buy stuff, so I dont really get why he was always showing offline, making it harder to get to him to sell him stuff...
---
I had all mine do the same. 62% drop. I server hopped many many times and it didn't do a thing. I unequipped Adrenaline and re-equipped and it seemed to normalize. Can't say this is what fixed it or if it sorted itself out otherwise. 
---
Reports with no proof.  There have been a lot of false claims.
---
Electric Mr handy blade, does obscene damage at 130-200 % and a good job at stun lock.
---
&gt;When we all lived in the vault we were all living harmoniously with each other
---
One of the terminals in Vault 76 says otherwise.
---
K bye.
---
TS as it was was still op mate. Double dmg on guns was crazy. It may have worked in Fallout 4 where you were the only player so you could be as op as you want. But in a multiplayer game, you can’t jut have a weapon out there that deals double dmg. It’s a bad mechanic and there isn’t anything like that in other multiplayer games. Destiny doesn’t have guns that randomly deal double dmg. Wow doesn’t have random drops with double stats. It’s just not a thing in online games and that’s for a reason.
---
Maybe that's what happened, because our armor was glitching out! 
---
Personally, I only ended up taking the first rank of Dromedary and Slow Metabolizer and I haven't gone starving or thirsty in any unreasonable way.  I felt I needed to prioritize Endurance in the early stages too, but it's the one I eventually moved points out of when I realized it wasn't that big a deal.
---
While I do agree with you, there are issue with balancing that do need to be addressed. The mini-gun vs the gatling... the same bullets vastly different damage. Near 300 years apart in technology yet the gatling gun is vastly better for most uses.
---
ALL engery weapons! 6 perk points aside... still horrible to use.
---
I usually run adrenaline as well so I'll play around with that and see if it fixes itself. Thanks
---
Damage would help, but durability also has to be looked at. The biggest issue right now with heavy weapons is insane ammo usage (except gatling/hwrpoon/broadsider) and very bad durability. 
---
Don't worry, I picked up your Ultracite Rusty Knuckles for you.  You can have them when I sign on later...I've got about 15.
---
This I'd like the underwhelming ME3 ending and the indoctrination theory that popped up as a response. I don't care what reality is, this is my headcannon now
---
Having rad worms is what is making you jump higher, curing them is what makes them sick. So basically if you get rad worms in the play session, either keep them and reap the benefits, or cure them and relog the session.
---
I lost my 2* black powder rifle recently due to the same glitch too..it was my second main weapon and the legendary effects were perfect for my build.  
---
Well, at least now I’m a few lbs lighter x’D (but still hoping it’ll somehow glitch its way back =p)
---
Aww he deleted I missed it
---
In that case we need to Nerf the sentinel and cavalier armor perks also.
---
Weight reduction for pistols seems like overkill, are they not already light weight?
---
Sentinel armor is OP. Bloodied Melee is OP. I like how the common argument against TS weapons is that it ruins others gameplay when nerfing TS ruins others gameplay. There's no reason to use that argument as there is an argument against it for the very same reason.
---
Reasonable response...downvoted. Oh Reddit, never change. 
---
Small letters are not the neon one btw
---
&gt;god fearing christians who are okay with murder
---
what a sentence, describes some countries perfectly
---
I want a picture of this outfit!!!
---
Ive learned:  
---
all light metal,  
---
No sturdy metal.  
---
heavy metal chest and heavy metal legs (missing heavy arms)
---
I dont remember how I got those two, unfortunately. I want to say it was a random event reward, highly doubt it as at a vendor.
---
Bethesda sure taught those dupers a lesson.
---
Meanwhile everyone else who didn't roll a TSE now have terrible guns.
---
I‘ll try. Thanks for your responses mate!
---
Two Shot should fucking equal double damage..
---
mah.  guns just fall apart from being used.  thats why there a no antique funs in our worl.....wait a fucking second!    
---
thats not how guns work!   
---
did they just put this mechanic in to make a 20 hour a game a 60 hour game?
---
could that be why they nerfed white knight too?
---
fuxors.  
---
Got mine from a robobrain in a silo
---
I enjoy having visitors and I'm happy for people to be able to stop in and use my base.
---
Can't do damage as melee in sentinel if you're not moving. Unless you're playing against an idiot that stays in melee range of you. 
---
Can't do damage to groups of mobs as bloody melee unless you get yourself  in melee range. W such low health you'll be spamming stimpacks. Or die. 
---
Bam your argument is trash. You can stand far away and blast everything w TSE and be safe. You can stand back and wait for Sentinel armor guy to move.
---
Sentinel armor and guns are a different thing but you are talking melee. 
---
Heavy weapons are simply, and only one thing, HEAVY. I've never bothered to pick one up. Mini gun should be called the "Tickle Beast". 
---
I tried using a mark III and it wouldn't activate.
---
Aye, that makes a sizable difference.  Means it was only a 505 nerf.
---
They honestly fucked up, Using all there resources to focus on bug/exploit fixing and performance improvements. They should have had a separate team working on additional content that should have been released in January. Now people are going to leave and stop playing the game. Some will return when they add new content when ever the hell that will be but most won't. They seriously fucked up you can't sit on your empty shell of a game forever thinking people will just string along with you. People will only wait so long, So disappointed with Bethesda at this point.
---
Been here since beta and last night something insane happened after server dump. Spawned back into what I would say were 50+ legendary rats, wendigo or whatever. Looked like an acid trip... My player was literally miniature compared to everything...i was all slow motion...enemies were insanely powerful and all I could equip was the blade of bastet. Saw crashed UFO with aliens shooting me  while I was falling halfway through the map.  I kept trying to server jump to see if that helped but each time I spawned it was like I was in God mode.  Now I have like 600 pounds of legendary armor and weapons from the piles of bodies. I found out that it was a sons of Dane complex where I spawned but never even was anywhere near that point on the map....strangest day yet in the wasteland
---
Or just downvotes... :-)
---
It won’t make things harder, just spongier
---
TSE still bet legendary effect for full life, BE for low life to precise
---
You need a artillery for a cannon
---
Cavalier is OP also.
---
He’s just a single hemorrhoid, not the whole asshole.
---
Oh yeah I’m not here to help others improve , so no need to be constructive imo
---
Assasin’s Tesla rifle. Very fun to use.
---
All robot light and sturdy, and heavy robot chest and legs.
---
I dont remember how I got them, unfortunately. I want to say it was a random event reward, highly doubt it as at a vendor.
---
I also dont know what RNGesus has against me getting heavy arm plans for those two.
---
I feel like loot tables should force all legendary mobs to drop no less than one, 1\* item.
---
They're OP in their different ways, not combined. You misunderstood.
---
Besides your weapon condition fix I think your ideas are horrible. If I want to play the division i will play the division. I like fallout for it's inventory management and slower gameplay.
---
That is a weapon that seems to fundamentally change depending on how you have it kitted out. How do you have it configured?
---
No. I do not approve.
---
What is build you are using? A breakdown of perks and gear would help
---
The way they went about nerfing it. Not only did they go about and nerf two shot and explosive, but they took it one more step and nerfed demolition expert. It’s the combination of two shot and explosive along with demolition expert that really made TSE so overpowerly dominating. Each one by itself is hardly gamebreaking and by no ways OP by itself. I agree that maybe two shot and explosive should be toned down just a bit, and they shouldn’t be able to be able to be combined. The way they went about it made certain builds completely worthless and a lot of guns are no longer usable.
---
 Explosives(missle, nade, fatman) is no longer a viable build, LMG, Minigun, laser weapons were only usable due to these prefixes, they are now completely useless. They basically said fuck you to these players, and didnt compensate with a respec or anything.
---
 I can one shot enemies with my super sledge with no perks, and the same enemy dies in not even 4 missiles with full perks. Do you not see something wrong with this? There are a million examples like this. They really are moving two steps backwards for every step they take forward.
---
If you see nerf after nerf after nerf, it’s hard to stay strong. I’m not saying all, but many people that are complaining and quitting have extensive knowledge of what is being affected, and are rightfully so.
---
i like my 90% reduced weight shishkabob for use with friendly fire, next to no weight and heals on demand
---
That's what i feel as well. But I'm putting it out there in case others have a dream too...
---
what mutations do you have? and do you also have radworms?
---
Anything with a silencer
---
Wait... where is this?
---
My favourite part was getting the refund
---
And half the time the power armor spawns aren't there either.... I spent the last two days playing checking the power armor spawns for fusion cores and I only have 2 more than I started with after logging off today... its fucking bullshit
---
Hell yeah! That was similar to what the dude last night did. Pretty awesome. 
---
He didn't mention that one.
---
Since you did that's the one melee should be using. Ya know since melee actually need to sprint to get into melee range.
---
I don't think people know as much about the game as they think. Or the original guy I responded to would have inuded Cavalier in his post. 
---
Yep, best way to stay out of the nerfs is not to use anything OP in the first place. Steer clear of bloodied weapons too. 
---
I've been noticing after the last patch that either the enemies are doing more damage/or the armor I'm wearing is barely giving me some decent protection -  I've been going through Stimpaks lot faster now compared to previous times pre-patch 😥
---
I've seen so many players one shot by Melee builds. Clown Daddy is a great example on YouTube. Watch those videos and tell me Melee isn't overpowered.
---
PS4 - EERIEEYE
---
Carry weight fluctuations near constantly. One minute I'm underweight and the next I'm overweight. No buffs, no mutations, no bobble heads are applied. My carry amount changs all the time, despite carrying the same exact things, no matter what. 
---
I get that I’m trying to find logic where there probably isn’t any. I’d still like to know if it exists what it is
---
Charging barrel, standard sights.
---
😏
---
Plus he uses fireproof and dense mods to negate two shot explosive damage to almost nothing BEFORE the nerf.
---
Is pretty easy to cheese it also. If you draw aggro you can lead the ghouls to gatehouses and have the WS bots look after them for you. Saves ammo and if you score a hit on the ghouls, you still get credited with the xp.
---
What if they wanted to land somewhere else but WV was the only runway least wrecked?
---
But TSE isn't a legendary effect. It's a combination of 2 legendary effects.
---
If you have 12 legendary effects in each category you have a (12 * 12= 144, 1 out of 144 rolls) .06% probability of rolling the 2 together.
---
These guns should've been extremely rare.
---
Still playing with some friends. Plenty of people on Xbox. 
---
Damn, I like that! 
---
I'd say that is going to be a great weapon to run around with. AA is better than two shot now. 
---
The faster reload ups dps vs the queen and helps when you don't get the instant kill on pvp. Movement speed while aiming isn't bad, but it's usually better on mini or other heavy weapons due to the fact you have to lay on the trigger forever. 
---
Overall you could get a nice price for it. 
---
Have you gotten to use it yet?
---
Neither did you in your rebuttal.
---
I dont give a shit about some asshat youtuber.
---
They all doctor their video for click bait. Phoney ass people. I have never and will never rely of shitty YouTube people. 
---
Learn to play in your own. 
---
I quit the experiment until it improves. So looking for a new game.
---
Literally unplayable
---
Nah, build acid was always 15. It was just bugged and only used 10 to make it, but bulk acid scrapped for 15, so you could get free acid by bulking and scrapping. Now it takes 15 to bulk, like it should.
---
Lead and aluminum are the only things that save weight.
---
I have a croquette mallet that is actually a sledgehammer. I like it more than my TSE double barrel
---
I had my 3* Furious Grognak's Axe, 15 strength, all 3 slugger perks at full, Barbarian full, and Gladiator full. If you give me just a minute, I'll get a picture of my full perk set up and link it. 
---
Agree. Enemies that are bullet sponges are usually too high of a level and should be engaged with at an higher level. It would be nice if enemies at an higher level would be a bit more than just bullet sponges.
---
Probably the Bloody explosive Gatling I found pre patch. Currently running around with a boxing glove one bunching everything, trying my best to e Mike Tyson.
---
It happened to me with my ultracite. It sucks
---
Uhh. Alright. Ignoring evidence to keep your point of view.
---
Got my plans off a robobrain at Dyer Chemical plant twice so far but I guess you can say I got lucky. But yeah, both vendors at Watoga should have the Tesla rifle plans.
---
 It's fun when you get all the duped gear. All the best items. PWNing all teh noobs. So much fun. 
---
Right. Because it wasn't necessary. I didn't bring up how if you tame an animal it might distract the person you are PVP against. Ya know, since the original post i responded to didn't bring that up either. 
---
Thanks captain obvious though. 
---
If you’re on Xbox I’ll give you 2k for it.
---
I forgot cavalier I'm so so sorry!!!
---
I've seen (not seen?) that kind of thing too.  It's very creepy when it happens.  I don't recall if Bethesda tried and failed to fix it, or if this was a pending fix, but they had mentioned it had to do with players going through a load transition at the same time.
---
Which doesn't explain at all where I've seen it (middle of the Bog, person not on my team, I see their arrow jumping all around me but I don't see them... until I suddenly did).
---
Or just general being-a-dick to everyone. Someone’s sitting in a corner in a rad suit waiting for their recycler to finish? Craft up 2 spears and put them into the dirt.
---
Alternatively, luck. You cannot fucking find cloth consistently. But once you have that bow, you can get the drop on people and end it very quickly.
---
Haha I bet. Would be fun to design a character around being a meatshield and looking like a gimp
---
Mutations-Rad-X now suppresses mutations. Good luck in the nuke zones.
---
Okay. Gonna look for that.
---
I'm pretty sure his point was that there is other OP gear in the game.
---
You are being disingenuous.
---
Looks awesome, what platform is it on?
---
Rifleman perks are bugged  and not working after the  hot patch.  At least for me.
---
if you are not yelling into your headset pretending you have a lisp i will be very disappointed
---
Still there. I noticed since my wife has an Xbox as well when I play my character on hers her photos pop up on my loading screen. So I’m thinking it the pics are on the hard drive. 
---
Nope got it from the queen and thought it was cool
---
No wooosh is ironically not understanding an extremely obvious joke. The very first thing I said was “is this satire?” then I made a joke about why I thought it had to be satire. If anyone got wooooshed its you guys
---
Containers that other players can take things from need to be a thing so that you don’t have to just drop a shitty paper bag for this 
---
Dude this sick! I wish I didn’t have damn work. 
---
That's true if you start with enough distance.
---
Yes, the "E".... You can tell me of any other perks that offered 100% damage increase for 5 points invested?
---
And just out of curiosity, how any points would I have to invest in riflemen perks to get 60% damage increase?
---
ha. Totally agree. 
---

It's a bethesda game, making sense isnt one of its strong suits
---
Or just not bulk all your junk unless you are about to sell it.
---
The main purpose of bulking is selling to vendors.  The items you can't bulk are more valuable and can be sold on their own.
---
I have been having this issue for a while myself. 
---
I've had the following mutations for while now: Eagle Eyes, Empath, Healing Factor, Herd Mentality, Marsupial, Scaly Skin, and Speed Demon.

Anything in hands of a good marksman it’s deadly 
---
Yes it's harsh, that's the fun of it. You don't win every battle, but when you do make a play as a naked, running away with a ak, it makes those moment so sweat. Combat farming is where it's at.
---
Checked it just now for you.  It wasn't at either Watoga vendor or Harpers, but it was at Pleasant Valley, so check Raider vendors.  Again, the plan is just called Revolver.  
---
Oh! Thank you! That does make sense. Yeah, we were all loading in several times together. 
---
Suppressed .45 Pipe Revolver FTW :-)

---
I’m assuming that’s why bulked items originally didn’t weigh less than normal items
---
I use a TSE 10mm. Since patch, I can still take a level 50 plain scorch beast with 9-15 shots.  (One clip).  This is using all the luck perks and critical striking consistently to the face, but very doable.  The “nerf” did not even slow me down, though I do use more ammunition.  
---
To be more clear, we’ll built with well planned perks (71 dmg a shot).  (Pre-nerf was 183 a shot).  
---
Anyone with complaints about viability of pipe/hand guns needs to look into build options.  Anyone complaining of non-viable builds post nerf, needs to do more homework on building.  
---
The writing has me bummed in this fallout. Normally in fallout you have the humor to offset the devastation. Kind of like hitchhikers guide to the galaxy. But with fallout 76, it's more like On the Beach. 
---
How am I supposed to know you know about it?
---
And I forgive you I guess. 
---
Thanks I was under aware of this but.
---
I can’t tell if ur using incorrect numbers to troll or if u actually don’t know the situation.
---
Explosive got nerfed from +100% dmg to +20%
---
Two Shot got nerfed from +100% dmg to +25%
---
So yes the difference is huge. Buuuut, a weapon with 300% of its normal dmg was wildly op and game breaking (wether the people using them want to admit it or not). A weapon with 145% dmg is still very very strong. It’s just not broken.
---
Same, but why does it do this?  Usually you can alt-tab, ctrl-alt-del and task manager out of most any situation
---
I don't think you know what that word means. 
---
Unfortunately yeah. I had my completely empty base satchel raided twice in three days. 
---
I’ve since learned to just use a raided base as a front and put my wb’s in there. Slap a codelock on and put down some furnaces, boom done.
---
Just feels so unrewarding when you’ve grinded for everything for like 2h and get killed by someone with a bolt action 200m away, sitting in their base.
---
News to me. I havent heard that they wanted you to link accounts. Where did you hear that?
---
Lol. Man o man is it ever! 
---
Looks good
---
Pretty much.  Do they actually weigh less now?
---
Shit i just realized i said faster reload i think its faster fire rate 
---
Also you know what still OP?
---
TSE!!! 
---
Furious Tesla Rifle.  I love this weapon.  No, it's not the most powerful thing, but you feel so smart when you zap an unseen enemy around a corner, or take out a pesky turret by bouncing a shot off the wall.
---
I've definitely quit. Waiting until a new content director steps up and undoes some of these pointless nerfs.
---
But... I think it looks better than the in game game armours. 
---
Its almost like how something looks is subjective. 
---
They cut weight by 50% in the stash but a few weigh more when running pack rat level 3
---
There's a setting to make task manager always on top. Idr how to find it though.
---
* Stealth is broken...
---
* They nerf'd the crit builds...
---
* Since the patch i always get 3 or 4 diseases as soon as a mob hits me and for some reason i ALWAYS have at least 1 disease. Curing a disease sometime null mutations.
---
* My thirst is off the chart, i drink 5-10 purified waters and hr now.
---
* I often hit enemies and do no damage.
---
*  I can hear enemies like they are next to me but there are none anywhere around me at all.
---
* Cannot do any event that takes longer than 10 mins as i freeze or disconnect.
---
* Logining and hitting the pipboy too soon will freeze your game.
---
* Random character 3rd person view freezes. You get stuck in 3rd person cannot move your character or use the pipboy but you can call up the map. Have to exit game to get control back.
---
* People are reporting a lot of accidental duping of items when simply moving items around in stash and inventory.
---
all but the last one i have personally seen. I am sure there are many more.
---
That was a very good read, I hope your positive ending comes true,  that all is good and the game will survive, some people will learn some will leave but FO76 will mature. I'd hate for Bethesda to pull the servers too soon.
---
Yes please!!!
---
Because they think it’s fun to pk or because they want to see if you have any good junk. Or your pick. 
---
Yeah if you log out your bag disappears along with you, but will stay if its in a container. Another one is the ice cooler outside the golf club. A lot of people stuff it with unwanted legendaries! 
---
*pays 500 atomic points for a ticket*
---
I abused stealth mechanics and four leaf clover with my pistol build, so it's really just a lighter rifle with lower damage but a higher rate of fire. Ammo is easy to craft and come by. Able to combine gun runner with speed demon for insane run speeds. It's lackluster compared to what my auto demo panned out to be but it was fun to play.
---
Weight issues were certainly never a problem with the build, but the lack of variety in pistols left me wanting more. Western revolver for big bois and rapid 10mm for squishies was pretty stale.
---
Can't say I've ever touched off on a junkie build. I've seen some builds hit like a truck but it's reliant on finding good junkie legendaries and dosing up all the time. I never drew interest in it but i know it's absolutely badass when everything lines up.
---
It means you're being dishonest by selectively choosing to ignore cavalier armor. 
---
Everyone here knows cavalier is the 'mobile' version of sentinel. It's a chat board and one should not have to spell that out for you.
---
You'd never even be able to get into my Camp, not without being on my team. Hell, if I removed the huge red Rocket Sign from the roof, you'd never even be able to find my camp.
---
It's so well hidden that it has no defenses and is in one of the higher traffic areas in WV but it never get's attacked by mobs, even though I am basically surrounded by them.
---
Shit that was her?! Completely failed to connect the dots -_-
---
Ah man... And this is the one thing in the game outside of crafting that has extra recall logic. With timers and all! And yhen *poof* Talk about ghost in the shell. Or rather, ghosted shells. Wonder where all the armor goes... Somewhere Bethesda has a storage unit with a lot of paper bags. 
---
There are no PvP players.  Bethesda devs are so far up their own ass, they don't realize it.  
---
Nah it's ok, I got a big bag of popcorn
---
The more suggestions the better, *im sure* they are trying there hardest 3 months after release to being the game up to *our* standards
---
Will be nice if Bethesda works out the bugs in some things so we can have more freedom.
---
If you're speaking about "your AR" in real life, then I have two comments:
---
1 - You should not have an AR.
---
2 - No, it doesn't weigh that.
---
I've heard other people talk about this, do you fast travel or just run to Watoga?
---
It was an option on installation and I linked it because why not?
---
Now, I'm just wondering if it just for marketing purposes.  If so, I am going to un-link them but if they were giving something in exchange for linking, like a couple percent off future titles/DLC/expansions or a cosmetic item or something, maybe I'd keep them together.
---
Maybe play without mods....
---
I installed a SSD in my ps4 pro and it really helped the load times. I wear power armor so i don't really have the issue of dying, but i can move around now much quicker and start defending myself when i log in. I play with friends with regular ps4's and pro's and they will fast travel somewhere, i can then travel on them and be walking around while they are still sitting on loading screens. This problem probably doesn't affect the pc players nearly as much as they are much faster at loading than the consoles.
---
Another anti TSE troll.
---
I already figured that out.
---
Let me guess.......you bought a full set of duped assassin's cavalier armor but we're still getting owned by TSE. Now post nerf you are the best pay2win PvP player.
---
you can collect weapon weight reduction set if you want
---
Agility doesn't improve your sneak. My agility if 4 default with 3 points of sneak and 1 point of escapist. Whatever it is, it is not the mutations.
---
I'd be fine if the player vending was inside Vault 76 :)
---
They might not be able to have it customized, but at least all the player vending would be in ONE spot.
---
Plus it's a free fast travel point :)
---
I agree like 99% except super mutants do explode like robots there called Super mutant suiciders. 
---
I pretty much haven't used heavy weapons or energy weapons other than the Gauss rifle since fallout 3. Fallout 4 the only minigun I utilized was an explosive and I used it only to devastate BOS vertibirds attacking the castle. 
---
I agree
---
If everyone knows the the guy I replied to should have mentioned it. Then I would have addressed it.
---
Or are you saying I should have mentioned every single piece of gear, drugs, food, armor etc?
---
Listen go away. I don't have time to argue w some immature nerd piece of shit like you on Reddit.
---
Have a good one. 
---
Oh well, shit.
---
I'm guessing this particular crash wouldn't care.
---
I'm so glad I'm not the only one who made a brothel. Mine is a bar with a stage full of instruments though, because class matters. 
---
I look at it as, hey those guys have what I want, im going to go try to make a play. Alot of the times you can walk away with a bolty if you play it right. Roof campers I wont bother.
---
If solo best tactic is to find a older decaying server and find explosives that way, usually ends up being a bit of a chain reaction, looting decaying bases. Anyways I like Rust, I get it's not the game for everyone.
---
Yeah I must be doing something wrong then. I have a tse rifle. Pre-match it took 3 shots to take down a bloated glowing one. Post patch it's about 18 to 20 shots. Even with perks invested into demo expert and glow shot. 
---
I dont really mind however. I tried to never use the gun in areas with other people pre patch. Ut was great to have on solo adventures though. Now I can use it all the time and I'm not stealing kills. 
---
But it absolutely takes a shit ton more ammo than before. 
---
I rock a melee build and lock onto it with VATS and can usually hit it with some luck.  Just wait for VATS to tell you 95% and swing.
---
Lol you're pretty fucking stupid. 
---
Do you even find the tagging system to be of much use?  A little icon next to a word means I already need to be looking at that area anyway, it hardly makes any difference to me at all.
---
It's an internet chat board.
---
Of course when you trolls have a weak argument online your go to is always how the OP didn't write out a full description.
---
People are typing on mobile phones bro. There shouldn't be need to write an essay. 
---
"Have you tried out new superhero costumes. They give you 15 extra health?" - Todd Howard
---
In some ways this sub is worse because we only talk about 76, whereas they have plenty of posts that little to do with it.
---
I assume this means I won this argument.
---
how exactly do you prove you've been banned? because I've seen people posting screenshots of the email.
---
alternatively, how do you prove you're not duping?
---
Just about every gun in 4 kills deathclaws better. 4's minigun suffers from the exact same problems in that its accuracy is shit and its damage per bullet is so low that even a tiny bit of armor fucks its paper DPS over bigtime.
---
It's near mandatory I install stuff like Skibadaa's weapon pack so I have some actual viable heavy dakka weapons.
---
Haha, you take this stuff way too serious. I demand you go relax or something. 
---
I understand how annoying that is, but it's just for a more balanced game. Ive been dying over and over. My body armor seems to barely work, but i always make plenty of healing salves before i go out on a mission. Lol. Just hope you find your niche. I totally understand though. I flip a shit whenever i die over and over.
---
Not my main weapon but I have a bloodied pitchfork with the flame mod. When you use it from stealth you basically jab it up your target's bum like a cartoon devil.
---
Hey now - chainsaw is NOT trash when you over repair it for the damage increase.  It is my go to weapon when I bait people in the 50-90 range into PVP.  They attack back and suddenly their HP is draining at a rapid pace they did not expect.  Also use it for RP killing newer players with cannibal for the execute option.  Naturally I do not take their stuff and even add a bit extra to their bag after :P.    
---
There are so many tragic tales...stuff that punches you right in the feels. I feel like the stories are more profound because they have to make up for the lack of NPC interaction. While I do occasionally miss the NPCs, the holotapes and notes make up for it. 
---
Or at the bottom of a cliff!
---
Side note: a shotgun build also requires players to put points into strength (at least 9 to max all three shotgun damage cards), which increases carry weight by 5 each point (9*5=+45 carry weight). Not sure if Psyker_girl accounted for that.
---
yes it does. Every point in agility is +5 sneak points
---
Correct
---
Also, I have a full set of lvl 50 BoS Combat armor. All except the right arm are legendary. 
---
Hahah that sounds delightful 
---
YES BUT YOU CANT SPAWN INSIDE THIGS IF YOU ARENT ABLE TO FAST TRAVEL ANYWHERE SINCE BETA DAY 3 DUE TO BEING PERMANENTLY ENCUMBERED

---
What are some of your favourite things to do while playing? Just to give me a better idea of what there is. I'd watch gameplay videos but they aren't always a truthful opinion on the game are they.
---
Source?
---
I personally would not. Online game can something wildly swing the ban hammer to players. There have been MMOs that have banned people for some very questionable reasons and I have noticed that a new thread is they ban the account not ban the account from the game. This mean the account loses all access to play any game form that company.
---
People have reported being banned from Bethesda meant they cannot access any game in their library.  Same with other companies like EA.  A ban often mean the account is dead. 
---
I simply do not know how that will work with linked accounts. Will a Beth ban carry over to your STEAM account? I would hope not and while I do not think it would I just would not take the chance.
---
maybe i am paranoid but there really is not many game companies I would trust too much.
---
Rubbish! I have a single shot explosive handmade with better stats than that. You're not using the right perks.
---
Oh really now? Skyrim was done by the Maryland studio and that was just as buggy as every other game they've released. There is every reason for concern if Bethesda doesn't fix their sloppy programming. 
---
What a bummer there are no high level or legendaries for this because it is my number one most wanted build. Also they really do need to fox the damage on all auto melee.
---
No he didn't go down the health bar went to zero and then went half way full as he was walking around shooting us lol he killed everyone and walked away Scott free
---
The ash heap should absolutely have this.
---
Nope - I have seen no difference.  I am definitely at more risk though since I had to switch to bloodied weapons to get the same bang for my buck after the explosive nerf.  
---
Go to big bend and west tek. Haul all the guns back to a station and scrap.
---
Well, OK, but which part of the balance patch is killing me? This has not been an issue for 136 levels.
---
I've even been able to effectively play bloodied for quite a while, but now I am getting mauled.
---
What has changed?
---
Wait a minute, it’s not in be...  Nothing, forget it.
---
We also wanted things to require more materials to fix like the Blade of Bastet, so using a melee stealth build like the Mistress of Mysteries wouldn't be so OP, AND it would create a "balanced in game economy" We are so very happy, happy it costs the same Mats to repair 10% of a broken blade as it doesn't to build a new one. 
---
It's good to be grateful.
---
Here I thought it was going to be an interesting post until I saw minecraft.  
---
Miss me w/ that weak shit
---
The way I see it, this is like ESO’s early days. 
---
Regarding mutations, apparently having Strange In Numbers equipped can seriously fuck with your mutations. My teammate and I both took ours off, and neither of us has had any issues since.
---
So by that logic, barely any game is dead???
---
You could still get a full server on CoD World at War.
---
So that game isn’t dead?
---
Or farm the mutants at grafton steel since there is a workbench on site to scrap in case you go over weight.  
---
Cows, small letters, and neon letters take up a stupid amount of space also. Be aware.
---
Im glad I got my platinum trophy early. I feel it would be much harder now after so many xp and weapon nerfs. Got my worth out of it I guess, got the collectors edition even. Uninstalled a few weeks ago and it would need some major overhauls for me to consider coming back.
---
I had been playing bloodied a fair bit, then noticed in the last day or so that I could no longer survive. I put it down to me being clumsy, but even playing at full health with my TS Handmade, I am getting creased regularly. Died more today than I have in months combined.
---
Honestly, maybe it just is me :)
---
Oh boy a gun debate this should be fun. 
---
Its Bethesda issue if people are dropping Hugh amounts of stuff  and others randomly find it. It not the player who picks it up.They need to fix it so no one can pick up large amount of items. Because if you going along and find stuff, you shouldn’t be band for just picking stuff up. That’s horse shit and I’m been playing since beta. I know if that happen to me I would be pissed. This game has been nerf so bad it hurts and I never had a gun that did more than 250damage. BTY add some NPC and enough of the stupid robots and scorched.
---
It won't be a debate, tbh. I don't argue with idiots :)
---
Agreed ive wasted so much plastic re-bulking.
---
Probably not a priority for them given the over repair work around.  Adding the overly generous perk is also akin to having a legendary effect with how many rads you can shove onto someone.  
---
Watoga, kill as many robots as steel you need 
---
Yes he has a lisp. He was on Joe Rogans channel a while back, very sensible dude.
---
Lol yes my right to defend myself makes me stupid lol, especially since I fought to defend these rights. Cool story bro. 
---
I'm more of a cheek than a ass.
---
Quad tesla rifle I was lucky enough to find. I slapped an automatic barrel on it and now it's a hell of a lot of fun
---
Also, a vampire's gatling laser. It is impossible to die while shooting that thing
---
Welcome to the end game content
---
I has nooo idea. I have been messing with my perk cards, and seeing what helps my builds, but yeah no idea. I kinda have a feeling some enemies have been slighty nerfed, while others have been made a little stronger(dont quote me on this)
---
But honestly it just makes the game more challenging. And for someone who watched a low level person(my husband) get one shotted over ans over my bored higher levels, this is a good thing. Now the higher levels can now go attack actual enemies and have a challenge instead of being bored and take it out on other players. Not saying you are one of those. But it is a slippery slope my friend.
---
1 cap in all cap stashes. Do you test things when you change them?
---
Some cap stashes not showing up (if you're going to make them containers with only 1 cap in them you might as well spawn them all.)
---
Xbox one. Using cap collector rank 1. 
---
I'm not sure I am clear on what you mean by this? Could you explain a little more?
---
Glad im not the only one lol. It would be nice to have those crazy stuff but really some of them are not that necessary.
---
Glad to know I'm not the only one experiencing this also. 
---
My power armor barely provides a bit more protection against Scorchbeast attacks, causing me to run through my stimpaks a lot more (ex. Pre patch, I'd use about 6 stimpaks on average to fight a lvl 50 scorchbeast, now it takes me 13 or so to fight one at the same level). 
---
Against ze germanz?
---
Wiz your gun made out of ze pig iron?
---
I'm a level 50 stealth sniper and just picked one of these up as I was curious. I went into Morgantown and just ran around 1 hitting scorched and I've put zero perks into melee.
---
If I had the time I'd totally start a new character and just base it around that ridiculous tambourine as my stealth sniper build is awful at the moment.
---
Well couple years ago they actually released their games on steam. But from the looks of things they're now going Bethesda launcher exclusive so there really isn't any point to linking your steam account.
---
Ive had friends where I wanted them to suceed full heartedly and rooted for them. However, i knew their talents and knew when to say "eh...you probably shouldnt do that".
---
What's in it for me?
---
I find it useful. It tags stuff that contains the material I'm looking for. Saves me from having to memorize what breaks down to what. Less I have to memorize the better. I can quickly sweep a room and only pick up what I need.
---
My Polished Metal Armors are stronger than anything else ive picked up.
---
my chest piece alone has 120 Dr and is a Hunters so 10% less from animals which helps a lot against Yao Guais
---
I can't imagine I do anything that would warrant a ban, I don't think, but, being said, a compromised account can be banned just as easily as a legit one, so maybe I will adopt your stance from a damage control perspective, just in case.
---
Also the many trashcan fires set alight across the game world burning on in perpetuity like the flame of the unknown gamer. Still, I'd love for auto melee to get a little love, and more specifically start seeing legendary chainsaws. I've got a Pain Train build I'm itching to try on.
---
My TSE minigun us pretty op not that powerful after the patch but it shreds things pretty quick... especially scortched beasts
---
Heavy Guns can't use vats very efficiently, the nerfed hurt them very badly.
---
I hear shotguns also especially benefit from this.
---
Fort Defiance is a pretty good place as well to farm for steel! I think I got around 400 scraps or so my first time going through there. Scrapping pump action shotguns, 10mm weapons, middle launchers and mini guns helps out a lot, especially with the scrapper perk.
---
Don't post your email here.
---
40-50+ was fun until I ran outta contentm 
---
i noticed a difference, a level 5 mutant at wv. lumber chunks out my hp now, i thoight it was just me  (lvl 140 char, over 100% armor, 12 endurance)
---
*shoots OP*
---
source: it works like that in every fallout game AND it is stated in the fo76 wiki. I could sneak attack scorch beasts before too, as i'm saying, it looks like it's bugged
---
Yesterday I found a Fat Man and decided to use up the 20 or so mini nukes I've been hoarding to clear up my stash some(I can't help but pick them up whenever I see one, even though I don't run an explosive build and know they weigh a metric ton. It was an absolute blast(no pun intended) and makes me wish a Fat Man build was actually viable(in the carry weight and ammo availability department more than anything) so I could create a new character to spec for a Fat Man build.
---
Not too bad but some, this must be the same texture/lighting effect, maybe volumetric overload I get while inside the Whitespring Enclave Bunker, makes be feel slightly nauseous to be honest, but I'm mostly inside workshop menus so no an issue really.
---
Good to know. Thank you!
---
Ventrillo...
---
I remember this, the aluminum was what I needed. 
---
That's mostly due to how the armor mechanics here work. A TSE pipe gun or SMG would still do 200-300 damage per shot before the nerf with all the related perks. Shotguns could do over 2000 per hit with a decent setup. If a scorchbeast landed with full health, you could pretty much one-shot it by shooting its head with a tse shotgun. Now the guns deal 1/3 or 1/4 of that damage (because TSE was a bunch of overpowered multipliers stacking together), and in reality it comes out to even less because with lower damage per shot the weapons are far more affected by armor
---
Have you checked to see that your settings have changed? For me I have to mess around with the ini file to get my settings to save.
---
No problem. Unfortunately it's just another bug for them to fix, but not game breaking
---
wierd then. i figured you had twisted muscles with rad worms bug. you def are bugged though.
---
In a nutshell if vendors have all plans why not all mods ?!
---
How were you able to place it so close to Flatwood? Game doesn't let me build where you did :(. Did they change it or something? 
---
&gt;understand my limits, took care of the motherfucker at the end of the cave, just as I did at Emmett Mountain Disposal S
---
I made friends, it died and I took a photo :))
---
My Q35 Plasma Rifle and GRA Plasma Defender were my go to weapons in NV. 
---
Now i pick up 3* legendary plasmas an drop em. 
---
Same with calibrated shocks
---
Equip Pharma Farma and rake in the drugs too. 
---
Can you link your source? I'm not asking for your experience.
---
That's probably not the game my friend O\_o
---
I’ve found one and only one In this entire search I had one before but it was “scrap” by accident 
---
Lol, well let's see according to Democrats when Romney was running Russia wasn't a threat. But now Russia is a big deal and we should blame them for tanking Bernie's and then Hillary's chances. We should also keep tip toeing the line of war with them by keeping soldiers in Syria who are now fighting Russian Mercenaries. 
---
And according to your Lord and savior Rachel Maddow Russia is going to cripple our power grid lol. 
---
If that happened how are you going to protect yourself and family with a super sledge LMFAO. 
---
Or I could have it for a tyrannical government and police force that is out of control, at least accorfjng to some libs but somehow is the solution to all our problems and should be the only ones who have guns.
---
Hmm being a liberal is hard, how do you guys argue yourselves into these circles. 
---
yep, stealth is pretty inconsistent post patch.
---
It’s only one person is allowed to trade at all anywhere in the bunker with modus, I’ve been in the room alone and it won’t let me use the vendor, I assume someone is in one of the other rooms using him.
---
Effectively it made him into a single vendor with a whole bunch of places to contact him.
---
Why not just make it like every other vendor in the game and each terminal has its own inventory but shared cap pool? 
---
The Order of Mysteries storyline is rather depressing as well.
---
Holy shit, using NPC unironically. This is full blown cringe.
---
What is it you are having problems with? You can always use stealth boy to get to glassed caverns. If you can't handle the combat there then something is wrong with your perk loadout.
---
Try using a good knife, all the killing less noise and light pollution.
---
I am just leaving this here(it helps me a lot)
---
Healing Salve(forest)
---
Start at overseers camp, go to the creek, pick all the bloodleaf, then travel up the creek towards flatwoods looking out for all the bloodleaves. (Using that perkcard where you pick double the vegetation is handy dandy) travel the creek all the way past the vault tec agriculture building, there will be some more in that dry patch.
---
Travel back up in the wooded area to collect soot flowers (i always gather em saying 'blue flowers, red thorns'...) get a good even amount for your bloodleaf. Then collect the amount of dirty water you need from across the overseers camp, head to the cooking station, boil da watah, go to healing items, and make your healing salve! This will help you save your stimpacks as they clump in with your healing button.
---
Is anyone having a problem with items in their inventory that they can't sell/drop or use?
---
I've got 4 Boiled Waters, a Stealth Boy and a Disease Cure that I can't do anything with. I think it has something to do with when you die and retrieve your loot as all of those items were in a paper bag on the ground.
---
Also, I'm not entirely convinced that the Luck of the Draw is working for rifles. I'm a stealth sniper and played for about 2 hours earlier today - it didn't trigger at all so for the first time in about 3 weeks of playing my main weapon is now broken.
---
Beth fucked up the game with the last patch, which was supposed to fix the fuck ups introduced with the patch before that, which was supposed to fix some fuck ups. I wish I was joking.
---
The game randomly doesn’t recognize items in your stash, or items either on you or in your stash that have been bulked. Make sure what you need is physically on you, and not bulked. 
---
That’s been working for me, but people are reported individual new bugs.
---
I like to look as ridiculous and creepy as possible. I have worn a straitjacket with a beer helmet and blinking prisoner collar, a ritual outfit with faschnacht mask, etc. It's just my thing. So when I found this outfit it was right up my alley lol. That and the +1 damage resistance on the mask!
---
There are actually three power plant workshops that generate fusion cores, but only Poseidon is for low/mid levels. The 100 energy isn't as bad as it looks, because workshops provide you with free scrap (shows green when you construct). Also repairing the power plant is supposed to give you power now. 
---
Annoying when the server disconnects though, and it does open you up for potential PvP griefing.
---
&gt;1 mutation per server
---
Completely agree
---
TBH it’s possibly my weapons too, nothing fancy, just a modded shotgun. And I need to boost my armor. I think I got to high level too fast, without learning many mods, etc. I haven’t tried with a stealth boy handy, I’ll try that today. 
---
Compared to the unrest in other vaults, disputes over sugar bombs and nuka cola are relatively mild in comparison. I don't recall any instances of violent crime or bodily harm documented in the security terminal.
---
Don't speak for me, I play just fine with a regular weapon.
---
Yeah! Cause the friend list totally doesn't say people are offline/online when they're not! 
---
Let's focus on fixing that first.
---
Ouch this didnt age well. 
---
Surely the devs wouldn’t change anything without putting it in the patch notes! They promised!
---
I've wished for these since Fallout 4! Yes please!
---
how do you tame animals?
---
Ouch, how well did this comment age? I'm basically from the future. 
---
Plus the plans are 7500 caps when the mod is only 500
---
Their in the TnT bunker things you need a key to get into gotta kill them for alien blaster ammo. Sorry to bust yoyr bubble. 
---
20 mins in and so spot on so far.
---
Wish you the best in all your future endeavours.
---
You know what's full blown cringe? Your entire existence.
---
What?  D2 had/has strikes, nightfall and crucible to tide you over at launch, never mind the leviathan raid that launched shortly thereafter.  And that still ran dry fast, we have nothing close to that comparable instanced-team content.
---
rifleman perks and gunsmith iirc affect it
---
1) What platform are you playing on?
---
PS4
---
2) Gamertag/PSN/Bethesda.net account
---
Benend91
---
4) Description of the issue (what happened, where did it occur, what did it affect, quest name etc.)
---
I've got 4 Boiled Waters, a Stealth Boy and a Disease Cure that I can't do anything with. I've tried using them, dropping them, moving them to stash and trading them but clicking on any of the actions doesn't do anything.
---
I think it has something to do with when you die and retrieve your loot as all of those items were in a paper bag on the ground that I went and retrieved. I also tried logging out and back in but the items are still there.
---
I'm also not entirely convinced that Luck of the Draw is working (or it's been nerfed). For the first time in 3 weeks I had a weapon break today and I'm max rank in the perk.
---
You can untag from the pip boy as long as you have some of the resource in your inventory. On PS4 when you’re on the junk tab of your pip boy you tap R1 for “component view” and you can tag and untag from there
---
I wouldn't recommend trying to fight the scorchbeasts in the bog unless you like wasting ammo, just run straight to the caverns.  Put scorched receivers on your guns if you're having problems there or team up with somebody.  If your on PS4 I can help you. 
---
Remember. No preorders.
---
The Servers are the real end boss of this game. 
---
My favorite holotape in 76 is 'I'm stuck here', found in the glassed cavern. Gut wrenching
---
That's more the legendary carrying it. A bleeding full auto anything was a big ol I Win button.
---
I agree.  A lot of the stories, especially the holotapes, really convey a moving narrative of just how hopeless some of these people eventually felt and as they realized they were slowly becoming the only humans left.  So many of them died alone while trying to help others.
---
You’re gonna need a bigger bait.
---
I don't read german. I was merely making a joke. Lol
---
Thanks, I’m XB, but appreciate the offer! I’ll try some changes today and do it again!
---
What use is free dlc if you can't play the game? Bethesda should postpone the dlc until the game is fixed.
---
Powerful automatic receiver, with two maxed commando perk cards and one bloody mess perk card. Are using the hardened?
---
So your logic seems to suggest that killing one of the toughest enemies in game in a few seconds should be okay? Sorry if I misread that
---
I was in an empty room full of meat piles that same trip, and a reaver spawned in directly behind me. Just one. Glitchy as hell. And the enemies wouldn't all aggro. They just kind of milled around aimlessly, I'd engage one, a few would attack. Rinse and repeat. Part of them just stayed frozen in place. 
---
I literally realised about a week ago the the Death Tambo was actually a weaponised tambourine 🤣
---
You need a roooaaad triiiip, if ya can't read a dumb joke as mine was. 
---
That's my chief complaint is that the game systems are not quite fun enough, not even the equivalent of the radiant quests from previous games. 
---
............did you re-equip it?
---
Lucky hole mine.  Plenty of steel and lead around.  Kill mole miners and scrap all their stuff also.
---
I didn’t even read that but I can see my initial thought was right...
---
You shouldn’t have an AR :)
---
You want to think FO76 is dead?  You may think so, I do not want to try to convince you. I just play the game with pleasure and constantly see many other players there. 
---
The max DR of marine armor with buttressed mods goes pretty high, and with extra radiation resist and (correct me if I’m wrong) the marine armor being lighter than combat armor, it’s pretty useful. The only problem is that high tier Marine mods are ridiculously hard to get. I scrapped dozens of pieces and only have buttressed leg pieces. Everything else is the low level mods
---
Also, if you’re interested but don’t want to bother with a set if you don’t have the marine helmet(not the mask, the whole helmet), Bethesda won’t get on you for having it. It was a quest reward in the beta, so some people have it. When you scrap the helmet you get the plan for it as well. I met someone who gave me one, and so far, account is intact. It functions as a gas mask and has 5-10 DR depending on the condition it’s in. 
---
This. People are arguing for being able to take down end game mobs like their trash? Obviously they dont care about balance for the rest of us non TSE owning players lol 
---
i know right? ad victoriam!
---
I agree, waaaaaay too many useless cards once you hit the 100s. Lol
---
I'm a level 35 west tek is a bit too hard for me any ways around it?
---
The same two tapes are missing for me. Seems like the quest is bugged.
---
F
---
Try the ritual mask with the clown outfit! Then run around and chase some peeps! Scary as hell 😂
---
Dont be ignorant it makes sense for people with both effects to be pissed off. Their getting double the nerf.
---
I'd recommend going to big bend from Watoga to Ash Heap since the station is right there
---
I've yet to lose my mutations, or any of my gear.  Before or after the most recent update.
---
I've had additional issues today. Got disconnected whilst over an hour into my first run through trying to launch a nuke from Silo Bravo, reconnected into a server where an oil seep wouldn't let me collect any oil, reconnected into a server in which mineral deposits hadn't spawned, reconnected into a server that wouldn't place my CAMP despite the location being free, reconnected but got disconnected whilst reconnecting, then a second time. I've given up for the day. Ridiculous.
---
I know. Wrote the exact same thing a while ago before the patch. Bethesda succeeded at nerfing finally the fun out of this game. I stopped playing since then. And the group I played with as well.  Let’s see where this leads...
---
In this list Warframe lower than FO76. Do you really think Warframe less popular? I think not.
---
Palace of the Winding Path/Sunnytop Ski Lanes
---
I'm gonna need like 10 more accounts to fight off the shilling and fanbois on this subreddit.
---
Mini nuke to the face !!! I don’t let any melee character get close because of situations like this lol 
---
Seems like the dupers have found a way to dupe downvotes now. Or their just salty about the nerf lmao
---
lol The only person I play with has gone on a 10 day vacation. Maybe they will have another update in that time that fixes some of the mess.
---
Princess bed?
---
Princess bed.
---
Can agree , was more fun early in game.  Game is too easy once PA is on.  When I get diseases now, I don’t even attempt to cure them.
---
yep. This is the only way to make the managers listen. 
---
This right here. Truth!
---
I’m still waiting on the combat helmet to have a functional light.
---
The coding is also cursed....
---
My friends are bored.  There's nothing new.
---
More and more "offline, offline, offline".
---
I literally had some friends who launched nukes every night without fail.  I haven't seen any of them on in about a week.  I've seen less nukes in servers as well.
---
FO76 in a nutshell
---
Lol as usual a person scared of rational thought, and facts. Good luck with your prospects in 2020 lol 
---
That’s why this is a suggestion and not a bug report 
---
You can find in world lol nice cheater you found I before them...
---
I don't know about that extreme but I've been grinding for screws and springs for the past 4 days to build and scrap handmades to get more mods for it and I noticed when I went to my usual areas again, it was a bit more nail biting.  I thought, "What the hell is my guy getting worse the more I level up?".  So maybe a Nerf to dammage or the enemie got harder, not sure 
---
Low damage high attack rate weapons suck because of the armor system.
---
I didnt even know what cavalier was until I searched it seeing as Ive never gotten it as a drop, seems like it would make sense for a melee build vs bloodied/sentinel as stated above. Your just arguing to be petty
---
Server hopped Watoga and got em. Didn't take long, maybe 3 or 4 hops?
---
Cannot repair armor or weapons even with required resources.

Been almost a week without the ability to repair.
---
If you're short on weapon mods then you can go weapon farming. Camden Park has a good variety and easy enemies. If you specifically want shotguns then Ash Heap locations usually have plenty of mole miners.
---
Yeah, I enjoy the game whilst acknowledging that it isn’t perfect.
---
yeah the problem is that there are no alternative good ranged weapons. Firing like 100 shots into a scorched beast just is to expensive in that game. And also doesn’t feel appropriate being level 100+.
---
yeah I liked that but at same time I could see how people randomly picking colors in a mmo game could be a issue since it would have to blend colors and such why I figured a simple starting point then expand on it as time goes on
---
Before the nerf? No sorry I played with people doing 4k+ dmg i dont think thats true ecspecially before the fireproof buff
---
Oh man! I didn't know! Thanks!
---
No doubt.
---
But obviously the ones whose guns weren't doing 300% damage should be a little more upset.
---
I cannot upvote this enough.
---
I bluescreen still quiet a lot in whitesprings when its nuked. 
---
Thanks for the nuke. Hard fight. Lost a lot of brave bullets. 
---
For real. Rose’s story Arc was insane! Could you imagine if Bethesda went the same route they did with the nukes with the Charleston Dam!  I personally would love to be the group of Raiders that storms this Responder outpost  and blows up the dam. 
---
I know how to mod it I want in game versions that others can see
---
and rightfully so. Bethesda is killing the game with each patch more and more 
---
Yeah would be cool not to spawn under the map falling until i pop back on land. 
---
 Where did you see plans?
---
I kind of wish there was a simple wearable light like on the shoulder or a small one on the chest to simplify the upgrades 
---
Only lead and aluminum weigh less as bulk. Personally, I'm pretty sure that's just an oversight. Saving weight is not, not was it ever, the intended purpose of bulk. The only reason for it is to be able to sell things that would otherwise sell for less than 1 cap per piece.
---
But we got her!! I'm so lucky I looted asap. I crashed about 1 min after 😂😂
---
Andddddddd 38% upvoted lol
---
Xbox is still pretty active
---
Yeah, got a robot model yesterday and thought it would be cool to keep at the base.
---
You can go in a Stat, and pick cards from different categories. This lets you advance Luck, but pick gunsmith, for example. You must have done it by accident?
---
now slowly most of the people get why there was a huge outcry before the nerf killing the fun in the game. You can only pray that Bethesda will revert it. But honestly I seriously doubt that.
---
Whoa there, I'll have you know my two-shot Fatman kills stuff in 2 shots and that's without Demoltion Expert equipped. Very much viable indeed.
---
Camden Park's even easier if you can't handle Big Bend tunnel. Also has a lot of those hanging tin cans.
---
You can pick a perk card that’s different from the special point you chose. That may be what happened to you. 
---
50+?! How about 100+. Thanks. 
---
if you are very lucky you get a rolling pin
---
im level 11
---
I'm arguing that the original post  was correct.
---
Sentinel armor is OP. Cavalier and sentinel are the exact same effect except one is moving while the other is standing still.
---
Cavalier and Sentinel armor should both be nerfed because they were duped just like TSE. At the very least they should not allow this duped gear to carry over to the PvP servers.
---
But still so good.
---
I WANT A CAR TO DRIVE &gt;:( and give us heists, and V bucks!
---
Would be nice to drop stuff while in stash as well 
---
If youre in power armor emergency protocols helps alot 
---
So, because YOU don't have the same experience, nobody else could possibly have that experience? 
---
This is an official list from Microsoft. Are you saying they would lie?
---
Is that a perk or mod
---
Im on the edge of the build zone. I actually placed somewhere between the building on the right and the stream
---
hmm this might explain why i have 4 unused strength points
---
how do you do this pick a card thats different does it increase that special but give you the card from another special?
---
Mod torso when health us below 20 percent you hey faster movement speed 50%less damage taked and 25% action point refresh speed
---
Remember when that "hand picked group of modders" from nexus tried to  create their own game and it ended up being a miserable failure no one bought?
---
Do you know how much it sells for I have 8k caps and want to buy two now
---
LOL. I did a level 50 a days go in my BOS Heavy Combat Armor. One stimpack for damage from melee. Did not really need it, could have killed her without it.
---
 Took basically no damage from her, but then she did very little poison strafe and I dodged that. The noise does zip to BOS Heavy Combat with Dense on the Chest.
---
Better loot than I get half the time. Least you got a spring out of it?
---
Pretty sure Bethesda is trying to get away from steam.
---
Might just be that you're killing stuff slower with the TS. Either that or fighting a lot of Gutsies.
---
Well watoag bot sells t60 quiet often for mabey 500 caps i think and t51 sometimes 
---
Or go to the safe in the Toxic valley for an easy one 
---
wont happen. You have seen what happened in the first three months. Never saw devs so disconnected with the community. 
---
So why should they change? It’s like an experiment to see how quickly you can kill a community.
---
And with every patch they get closer to this goal 
---
&gt;Hmm I like the idea of open RPing the Inspector. **He** could use/say anything.
---
Well, judging by the posters and images on the unstoppables stash box and bed and stuff, the canonical Inspector is female, but no reason not to gender bend it, like Nora playing the Shroud.
---
DUDES! I was in the middle of a daily event far from where it started. I went to pick a lock on a safe and got booted from the server! When I logged back the daily event was gone! It's one thing if I jumped severs and lost the event but to get booted for no reason and then lose my progress is Soo annoying.  
---
I get booted at least once every time I play. And then I just stop playing. Its so frustrating!  I've started just playing something else every time I get booted. 
---
Please fix these stability issues!

ffs
---
For me, I spent my first 15 perk cards on lowering the weight of chems, food, drinks, armor and ammo and then spent 4 on making food and drinks effects last longer and then it made survival and weight management a lot less of a chore.  I'm level 45 and inly have 4 perk cards spent on making my weapons do note damage so I suppose my character build is hoarder.  Should be able to start burning cards on more fun stuff around 25 or so.
---
Did you spawn up there? Or does it take you at the bottom?
---
I am very much enjoying the game.  A large group of us PC players have begun to band together via a discord server and are doing very well.  
---
If your interested in joining out “like minded” group, just reply.  The rules of reddit prevent discord sharing etc, so it’s all direct replies for that sort of stuff.
---
We have only a few rules in “An imperfect circle”.  No PvP, no cheating, clean, no teams required, no microphones required.  
---
Workshop Grafton Steele
---
The worst thing for me is it didn’t have to be like this. They could have had a note that says “we went east” or something, rather than everyone dying. Even if there are no human NPCs, this is just excessive.
---
Nothing like the unique Sticky Tar the Grafton Monster drops?
---
You first choose the Special you want to increase and then you pick the card. Use the options at the bottom of the screen to help choose the category of card
---
Cant say for this community but if I look at all the guys I played with they had enough with the lovely last nerf patch.  
---
As I said along with hundreds of others before the patch: it will kill the game and the motivation for most to play it. 
---
I don’t think x01 plans exist ? If so where take my caps lol 
---
**There's a fountain at the Whitesprings that cures your diseases for free.**
---
Fast travel to the Golf Club.
---
Immediately turn right.
---
Go through the tennis court.
---
Stay pointed in the direction of the Whitesprings Fire Department.
---
Walk about 50 feet.
---
You'll see a round gazebo with stone columns.
---
There's a sulphur drinking fountain that when you drink from it, it only gives you 1 rad, and cures 1 disease.  Repeat if you have multiple diseases.
---
I literally have seen no videos or anything about this?
---
Silver shroud works fine. All other armor still equipped...
---
I think I have figured out what has been causing it for me. 
---
Everytime I invite someone to play while I'm in a server only the negative aspects work. It stops when either the invite is accepted or declined. 
---
Also I seem to have come across a helpful tip when trading to make the 25000 caps bug less tedious. Use LB/L1 to move the slider. It moves in a larger amount. It works perfect from 25k to 0 just click RB like 9 times and it will land on 0 caps. Just don't hold it down.
---
People one shot everything with melee since beta. If people desliked TSE all they needed was not using them.
---
Flechette Harpoon.  So low tech.  So satisfying.
---
Dont really agree with the racism but it looks like he had you pegged. Some people just dont want to be bothered even if you feel that they NEED your help or assistance. 
---
My TSE gauss went from 1800 to 383. That's not a bad thing. My friends or other people can get hits in and I can still two shot almost anything if I'm by myself. If I really want to be a jerk I can strip naked and punch everything to death with my power fist. 
---
Power Armor is a must, don't listen to anyone that says it isn't.  I've tried every possible non- power armor set available, sentinel, unyielding, Bolstering with every perk card that should make this possible but it just isn't.  Biggest drawback is radiation, you can't stack it high enough to be viable map wide.  2nd drawback is power armor has an inherit ability to absorb bullets, regular armor doesn't.  I've had on a full set of Bolstering armor with Armor def at 700 and it will not absorb damage as good as my Excavator set.  After countless hours of trying to make it work I'm now wearing fully repaired (200%) T51 with emergency protocol torso and it is manageable.  This is broken, it shouldn't be this away but with all the current game breaking fixes yet to come I don't see it getting fixed anytime soon.  
---
I want this with Quad. I'll bet Vampire's is disgusting as well.
---
Saw it in Abbie's Bunker twice, but not constant.
---
ok this makes sense and i never knew this was a thing
---
Yet the mirlurk queen can be one hit by melee even with crappy legendary bonuses. Them nerf melee on the ground too, make It take 20 hits to kill one.
---
Doesn't help for me when there are other enemies in the area which is what screws me over lol. But on a side note,  I didn't realize the dense armor mod worked well against scorchbeast lol, gonna have to put it on mine to try it out.
---
There’s being critical and then there’s bitching, moaning, posting self righteous rants about how you’re quitting the game forever and how everyone there should be fired etc. Shit happens. If I was gonna stop using every company that fucked up I’d just never do business with anyone. This also applies to any company that has accidentally leaked customer data. At least in Bethesda’s case no majorly private data was released. They did what companies do when that shit happens, took their PR hit, and we can all move on. What good does it do to piss and moan about it now? 
---
I don’t see you being super critical of “evidence” from those being “unjustly” banned. Like I’m gonna believe the overly excitable and dramatic  twats in this sub over a company that has openly admitted their mistakes previously. So many bullshit rumors have caused completely hysteria here. How you can take anyone in this subs word is beyond me. 
---
I took my mini gun out, repaired it to 200%...  loaded up with stabilized III...  got a scorched to land, opened up.  About 3/4 through its health bar, my mini gun broke.  
---
I did specify pipe guns and hand guns.  I have never thought, nor do I think the heavy spectrum are balanced.  Energy guns fall in the same bracket.  
---
Lots ofpeople have the .44. Us more sophisticated Revolver users are rare. ;)
---
I had a legendary explosive .45 pipe revolver drop yesterday - in Fallout 4. :P
---
Happens to me also.  So I don’t open the pipboy until my camp completely loads.  If you do open it, it seems to work after I wait for a little bit.
---
Haven't touched it in weeks. Based on what I read on Reddit everyday, it's gonna take alot for me to come back. 
---
Yep, I'm a 40 year old who has 4 kids and works for my self as a contractor and I'll tell you what, my sweet sweet reward is sitting in the kitchen at night, playing my fallout, looting and crafting and leveling up my guy.  Been going around last 4 days just hoarding screws and springs to build more handmade rifles to scrap them for more mods. I like it nice and boring and repetitive.
---
I have had all grenades vanish and all of my favorited guns keep being unfavorited.
---
I shouldn't post while dabbing. 
---
Just did a loop about an hour ago. Nobody was there, but the last batch of glowing was there minus the clubhouse. Clubhouse only had eyebots.   When all was said and done I had 12 legendary items.  7 armor, 5 weapons. Granted all were terrible usual suspects like wood armor, zealots, mutant slaying... except I lucked out with an Instigating The Dragon.  Jumped into the resort and hit up Artisan's Corner and the vendor was absolutely stocked of mediocre legendary weapons and armor.
---
Where did you get the5+ sneak for higher agility. Please I am completely clueless.
---
&gt;Agility is the primary movement stat, affecting movement speed, Action Point or AP generation (Which consumes V.A.T.S). ***Any player running a sneak, small guns or unarmed build would have a top priority to level this stat.***
---
The reason why agility is chosen by sneak characters is because all **sneak perks come from agility.**
---
*"For fucks sake"* that's obvious, but ***there's absolutely 0proouof written that higher agility increases your sneak.*** It's the perks being referenced.
---
"I think the RGB HUD values also translated into different color hue for the pipboy flashlight feature."- rajgavrom
---
Only when crafting.
---
Agreed. I can drop these in Workshops but not my C.A.M.P.
---
For me I completed both when killing a flatwoods monster so it does count as an alien 
---
Ok wasnt just me then. 
---
Put all your junk in your stash and try again
---
can you pay attention to something because I'm tired of discussing with you when you could just have gone to the fallout 76 wiki and looked for it. If you look under what you cited in the page, you will see a really big table with the stealth/agility bonus per level.
---
known problem.
---
put all mats in your stash or your inventory. it has issues pulling mats from both.
---
also can cause issues if you have the exact amount needed. get a bit more.
---
relog if doing either/both doesnt work right off.
---
If only they had some walking canes.
---
There's a weight reduction perk for almost everything...
---
If nearly everything in the game needs a weight reduction perk associated with it, maybe carry weights are a problem, right now, as opposed to a mechanic?
---
Remember when progression tress unlocked exciting new abilities and stuff to do or use? When they did interesting things? How about we just rebalance carry weights and repair costs and then let perks be FUN as opposed to mandatory.
---
Wonderful. 
---
I know how ys feel. I had 3 mutatuins dissapear from mine.
---
I wouldn't mind as much, but they were crafted MIRVs.  Meaning I lost grenades and mats.
---
Can you link it? I cannot find it. I am asking for you help, I'm not very smart as you can understand already.
---
Well it's not good so that hypothetical doesn't matter. Fallout 4 on survival mode with no mods is one of my top ten games of all time. I loathe fallout 76. It broke my heart.
---
Mods adding pounds of weight is so stupid its hard to understand how it even made it into FO4...more less continued here.
---
You need to get those numbers up 
---
alcohol brings your INT down 1 did you drink
---
Ja creating a game with assets and fixing existing issues via minor game code edits is the same thing, obviously. What an irrelevant comment to make. 
---
I think playing in a team sounds like fun, that way, could give each other some support.
---
It does. Crit x too stack if you go for a crit build. Source : I have a stealth crit build :) 
---
Ghd the same happen to my quadruple ammo hand made about a month ago pissed me off so much 
---
My PS4 keeps blue screening what do I do?

Sorry, it's just a bug on your end

Mine is checked off [here](https://imgur.com/xVepADb) and [here](https://imgur.com/Dpo4f5t)
---
I'm level 130 so there is no level restriction
---
I cant say Ive looked for them since the Plan availability updates since I already had them for awhile...
---
But Im pretty sure Watoga and Harper's Ferry are your best bets for these plans.
---
 You always get her crew when you fight her, Take out the Leader and they stop spawning.

Ha! I actually watched the loot disappear and got nothing.

I ment pland for other power armors

https://imgur.com/a/BcFQ1sm
---
Alright dope!
---
What platform do you use?
---
On the map, near the butterfly, there is a safe under water that has the alien blaster.
---
Near Black Mountain Ordnance, there is a bunker with alien blaster ammo and an alien blaster mag plan.
---
Yeah sure lol , you could always buy plans and charge played for mods.
---
That says luck.
---
Ya if your on pc im always down to pvp. And heres proof http://imgur.com/gallery/zQA61qE technically i could get a bit more out of it with a hardened receiver one more point in rifle men and a team so my strange in number makes adrenal reaction stronger but hey 1000 isnt so bad
---
You cant reason with religious zealots. And make no mistake, Liberalism is a religion now. Reason went out the window in 2008 - and its plain to see, it aint coming back any time soon. 
---
I mean, this is a party that, for the past 2+ years, has not even had a political platform beyond "Hate Trump, Russia Bad, Open Borders." They're poster children for projection, cannot be bothered with reason or logic and arent worth your time, to be honest.
---
Me, a week ago. 
---
Yeah... last time I fought the Queen I had that. She had 38lbs or something... of what, I’ll never know.
---
because whoever edited it wrote it wrong
---
I'm losing my patience cause of the bugginess of the game and the repairing bug. Rn I took out my Fallout 76 to play GEARS OF WAR 4. Like I'm really losing my patience with f76.

You can craft 9 fuel at a time with Ammosmith 2 at a cost of 10 acid and some steel and oil. Super duper can give you 60% more over time so you are creating a whopping ~14.4 fuel per 10 acid. I would say you are a bad person for abusing an exploit, but that is the only viable way to use this weapon for more than 10 seconds at a time. *cries in unused furious flamer*
---
Oooo quad sounds nice.  I have not invested in the perk to speed up reload.  It is maddening, even with speeddemon.  Part of the 19th c. Charm!
---
#modderstrong
---
A couple of super mutant primus's with minigun sure chew me up...
---
Then stop posting wrong sources, please.
---
I know that, I’m talking about aliens at TNT bunker. 
---
If you are still playing the game and still on this subreddit there is a sense of loyal to the Fallout game, people have invest money and time as such it is hard to face the game shortcomings. People dont like admitting the fact that this game should never have been released in 2018 and needed another 6 months to a year of development. So they down-vote anything that makes them face that reality.  It does not matter how well thought out your review is and how many 100% valid points you raise, if people think it is critical of the game it will be downvoted.
---
I will say that the community here seems to be slowly changing as people become impatient and frustrated with the "fixes" and blunders Beth have been making recently.
---
No. 
---
What is your agility? I think I might have also noticed this but not sure. I'm at AGI 13 and seem to getting noticed more.
---
Oh, sorry.
---
Yeah, that guy is full of shit.
---
There are no aliens at the bunker, ever.  I go there once a day for the ammo.
---
Yeah, an then if you're guy is geared for sniper rifles or a heavy guns or full-auto guns, you could serve a purpose on the team and use some tactics, instead of every man for himself.
---
Tf? Why?
---
Why?
---
I can believe it
---
I haven't played since 2 weeks after release because they're going through everything and nerfing the fun out of it.  I'm not a fan of being given awesome abilities and then the devs being like "Oh? You're having fun? FUN DETECTED!" and then bashing it with a nerf bat. Probably why a ton of people are displeased with the current state of WoW.
---
Yeees.
---
Theres no idea here, no explanation or substance just a lack of thought.
---
This is not satire.  It really pulls me out of the game when the devs expect me to believe the same minigun that struggles to kill a small group of ghouls is the same minigun that the BOS used to commit Scorchbeast genocide.
---
Yup, lost an Executioner’s Handmade this way.  Frustrating, it’s the only legendary handmade I’ve come across. 
---
I’m just saying that gunslinger builds, even with a pipe pistol, are incredibly deadly still.  My pipe gun out damages my 10mm.  It’s a one-way devotion to the perks to get there, but they are still viable, after the patch.  
---
Rifles of just about any kind will outperform hand guns, but I’m all about that cowboy feel!  
---
A side note is that pipe guns don’t seem to be included in the legend spectrum.  The 45 pipe revolver hardened, with all the slinger and crit perks, will one shot a 68 super mutant if your going all in with your build.  (Took me to lvl 56 to unlock the whole build, so a little past 50 for those last few dmg perks).
---
So you dropped it instead of selling/ giving away?
---
Get anthem it's a better game and its only in beta
---
Nice try, Dr. Evil. 
---
I just like walking around in it. Same as 4. Kind of nervously excited for survival mode so random players can be actual threats to me, hope it makes he game feel more real
---
Where she just wanted to go quietly w/some chems? Yeah.
---
Amen, 
---
I've seen you post this before.  You're absolutely right.  The whole damage calculation in this game is fucky.  Enemies are bullet sponges, players are glass cannons, and any weapon with high rof and low dps does nothing but tickle.  It's terrible.
---
I did this all the time in fallout 4, was super fun.
---
Ya mine only hold 2 as well 
---
Currently durability is determined on hit, at least on a lot of weapons so every "pellet" of your beam splitter laser rifle is killing its durability. They need to either rethink that or increase durability to compensate.
---
Probably furious 
---
They got 99 covers but Spank's aint one.
---
Enemies are bullet sponges yet players are glass cannons.  The whole combat/damage system is all out of whack.
---
There are usually a few behind the house at the Gourge Junkyard as well
---
Furious only stacks to 45% as far as I've been able to find do you know if this is correct?
---
Pretty much this. I quit playing over a month ago. Lost interest for multiple reasons. But in general, it’s just kind of a shitty game. Why waste time playing when there are better games to play, and why waste time playing when half the time you encounter severe bugs that haven’t been fixed yet? It’s like adding insult to injury. 
---
Yes.  Expensive af.  
---
This is more of a blessing IMO. By not having that perk, it means we can't start relying on it and having it take up precious slots.
---
You want some feed back thread give everyone their money back every update turns into another disaster 
---
&gt;Why not release paint job packages that cover a variety of guns instead of a single random weapon?
---
Because it forces you to spend more Atoms, which will hopefully lead to you buying some. 
---
Ur game has great potential but fucking sucks
---
Maybe there's a reason the BoS lost the overall battle. Maybe, just maybe, the creatures developed a natural immunity over time to the sheer amount of 5mm flying through the air and the fancy light show that was being put on, thus rendering BoS' weapons ineffective.
---
I server hopped for 5 days to get it. I also got the target hud. Bunker vendor.
---
A lead/steel run takes all of about 6 minutes to make hundreds upon hundreds of rounds. Even ultracite ammo is easy enough to come by as long as you keep a steady flow of Flux coming in.
---
Prime receivers absolutely SLAP scorchbeasts as well, don't know what they changed but my prime bloodied Lever action hits scorched harder than my pre-nerf TSE did, despite doing about 1800 damage less. 
---
Been playing since November and I keep learning new things still.
---
 It may not be possible. You can put a CAMP almost anywhere and implementing precise travel to it may be harder than you think. ;)
---
Oh i know that reference! 
---
Happy Cake Day Broman_907! Today is your day. Dance with fairies, ride a unicorn, swim with mermaids, and chase rainbows.
---
We are in beta.  They would have been so much more successful labeling this as Early Access, which would have been completely acceptable.
---
I was so confused earlier at how super mutants were just walking up to me and shooting me while I was in stealth field...
---
Apparently they broke the rifleman perk too in the hotfix, how does this even happen lol
---
max i have had so far is 5, but wierd thing is they all seem to working at different speeds. I will empty them all and come back later.
---
One will have 5, 2 will have 3, 2 will have 1 and 1 will be empty. yet they all have power and where emptied at the same time.  Very inconsistent production.
---
ahh dammit! how much are we talking?
---
Didn’t data mining reveal a Western revolver skin as well?   
---
Also the farm ladys tape you find inside glassed cavern and other areas of sbq activity. Man i felt so bad for her.. 
---
I don’t think so, it requires waaaaayyyyyy more investment/skill/management than two shot and explosive modifiers.  
---
Also, not saying they weren’t duped, but bloodied weapons weren’t nearly duped in the numbers that TSE was.
---
It's not explained well but if you pick a tree (like Strength) and then tab over to another one to pick a card it will put your point in whatever stat you chose first. 
---
So if you want to level Intelligence you need to pick Intelligence first. Do not tab over to it from. the card menu.
---
Where’s the body again? Heard it has a chance to spawn a outfit 
---
I am "young" but I am older than 18. I also will not attack and insult people for being critical of a video game I like. It's how people over 18 should act.
---
Yeah, some people managed to glitch into them a while back. It's rather disappointing...two of them are the accessible ones we know of, one has some random junk lying around, the other 5 are completely empty
---
IMO, the beauty and genius of F76 is that the story is effectively told by ghosts; using the knowledge and experience of our "forefathers" to find a solution and begin the rebuilding of America.
---
I found the holotapes and notes from the young boy known as "Colonel" and his yearning for his dad to "come back home" very, very sad. I thought for a long time Colonel and the other survivors buried in Flatwoods died alone, uncertain, and afraid... UNTIL I found a most wholesome twist to their stories on a second playthrough.
---
There is a small room in Flatwoods that was used for wakes before burying the dead behind the church; there is a podium with a speech/talking points for living and dealing with survivor's guilt. On a nearby bulletin board there are notes from almost all the individuals with "survivor stories" holotapes.
---
The contents of these notes are a beautiful expression of the human condition and our ability to endure and accept even the most difficult of hardships. Nearly shed a goddamn tear when I read Colonel's note.
---
Thousands.  I forget if it where it landed because it was expensive enough for me to say fuck that.  I hover around 2-3k caps, so if you are a 25k end game guy it won’t be a big deal.
---
2. oliverperssono
---
3. I have a 1 gb video? 
---
4. When shooting a vertibot close to another players turrents they attack you, even when you dont have a wanted level. When i shoot them back I gain a wanted level. What is this? Can you reset mine please? now when caps are 10 times more valuble I cant afford to loose 72 caps for because of this bug.
---
5. ...
---
Really good as usual. 
---
I love that you often have a detailed solution for the devs. However, a minor nitpick. Don't frontload your thread with things you don't know or that are just speculation. E.g.: 
---
&gt;Unknown, but seems related to the Full PA De-Equip that happens when logging out or Switching Servers.
---
Don't start with that. You did that in one of your [older posts]() too. A discussion of seeded vs true rng just distracts from the actual solutions you have.
---
You’re forgetting heavy Robot and leather. Nice af.
---
It does. IMO if you are a young teenager and falling for console wars shit and getting irrationally mad that someone might be critical of a video game you like, it's fine because we expect this thinking from teenagers. If you are older than 18 and still act this way you are pathetic though no questions asked.
---
There are three each of rifle and shotgun perk cards. They each have three levels. The first level of each gives you 10% damage and the next two levels give you 5% damage each. So it makes sense to put just one point in each card for the 10% damage, and skip the last two levels because they give you half as much damage for your point.
---
There’s a note in Grafton (I think) saying that the sentient ghouls all made their way east and for any other ghouls to follow them
---
Put in daily rewards for karma, bad players get coal so it's still useful. If they had their bounties collected on they get salt
---
With what Beth did to explosive weapons, he might as well.
---
How do posts like this still get the front page despite all the stupid shit Bethesda has done? Stockholm Syndrome is legit a thing in the video game industry in subreddits.
---
Ahh I'm not...I'm level 25 lol maybe have to go down the warehouse route lol
---
I think this could save the pvp since being a good boi will be more rewarding 
---
Maybe i have just been fortunate but i also have not experienced the stealth bug i am also a stealth sniper it seems stealth snipers dont get the bug cause of the distance so unfortunately up close and personal stealth builds suffer 
---
Just wait until you can see enemies or players, don’t touch a button until then.
---
Palace of the Winding Path
---
Thank you!!
---
Im usually exploring for new places to find new weapons armor Power armor and recipes and plans. Lots of things to do to be honest
---
Atleast you're figuring it out early. I didn't learn till I was almost level 30.
---
Probably nerf melee itself
---
Why do you play this game?
---
Dont support Bethesda! 
---
I mean, the issue is that your helmet would break after about ten shots
---
I’ve see quite few hud so far I’m still hoping 
---
I got them from Vendorbot Phoenix before they stabilized the vendor plans.
---
It cost me about 500 caps.
---
No idea where they are now.
---
they can only hold 2. the large one that goes in water can hold 5.
---
white springs has been the legendary grind spot since the game first released, two shots, TSE, explosives, they all drop there, everytime someone joins the server/loads into that area it will respawn the mob
---
so if you got a friend you can relog joining him over and over again to farm the mob over and over again, or you can just do it solo since itll reload you outside of it anyways, with no crashes and a few hours with a nuke or two you could grind a new account up to 50, unless you crash a lot or theres a bunch of people farming the xp away from you getting all the kills, maxed attributes in a single play session
---
once you get the end game content you want from drops it will become boring, and that boring will spread to the rest of the game because itll remove any challenge from the events/quests and the story is already bland and boring background noise unless you feel like reading a book and not playing the game
---
Ya thats a good point it just seems like they are the next big thing that can one shot must stuff and it seem like what ever effect hold that title aren't long for this waste land. And ya i don't think near any none explosive bloodied were duped it so hard to find a 3* non explosive gun thats any good
---
Really good idea. And the charisma thing aswell. I miss the karma system.
---
What I did around that level and partly because I was looking for excavator mods was server hopping at Welch and grabbing the cans that hang outside. It's a good like 30 steel and 20 lead every time.
---
Same problem here, and I don’t have Escape Artist. 7 points in Agi.
---
i get that too, i’m holding a meat hook but it doesn’t do anything, when i attack it does the damage that my rusty knuckles do 
---
Yes but the damage is crap so it just carries over the attack speed. so crap damage at fast speed.
---
I don’t get that, I have never owned an AR, but I carried a rifle in the military of course and that thing was maybe 10lbs, loaded, with an ACOG and broomstick. Of course after 15-20 mile humps it sure felt like 25-50lbs. Hell, I feel like a loaded M240 wasn’t even 30lbs. 
---
Im also disappointed it doesn't affect any of the scopes/sights and only affects a few of the grips. 
---
 One if my favorite skins so far and for a weapon I use (I have two westerns and a .44) i just wish it did a tiny bit more.
---
I have actually tested this extensively. Here is what I have found:
---
- Adrenal Reaction and Bloodied are both multiplicative, and they multiply your existing Gun Damage just like all the other perk cards do.
---
- In the case of Explosive weapons and if you are also taking the Demolition Expert perk, all multiplicative effects are applied AFTER the bonus with Demolition Expert is calculated.
---
- Bloodied legendary effect has a multiplicative bonus that is directly inverse to your current percentage (%) health, rounded up to near 5%. So for example if you're at 67%, then Bloodied should add a 30% bonus.
---
- Adrenaline Reaction caps at 50% bonus damage increase when below 20%, meaning that going lower shouldn't add any extra bonus.  
---
Hope this helps!
---
I would hope so but they have been so op for so long and people barely notice or care. I have 6 strength and no melee damage card but i have a bloodied super sledge that hit 1k+ damage and im not even a melee build tse didnt do that. You be at like 500 if you weren't optimized never 1k+ unless it was a shot gun
---
Level 58 or so and feel kinda burned and taken advantage of. The game itself is fun, just can’t shake the feeling of being swindled. Taking a break and trying some other games on my list. 
---
Thanks..  
---
Fair point, one counter (not to be a nay-sayer but to explain my thought process)
---
Speculation is often a great source of a "thread" to pull when running things down, like the HUD issue.   
---
In this case, I've heard (sometimes) that odd "UnEquip" sound you get when logging off the server a fraction of a second after getting in PA (I'm not sure if I'm hearing things).    
---
Might be a clue, might be nothing at all, but as long as you don't place all your chips on something it atleast is a direction to start.
---
As an annoying follow up to the above, I went back started the daily event again: the one where you go from Fort Reliance to Vault-Tec U and I get to Vault-Tec, pop inyo my menu to grab a photo by the Fallout Boy Statue and the thing freezes on me. Not playing anymore today. Too frustrating! 
---
the source is wrong, it's just a typo, it's not my fault if you are that dense
---
No. There is a achievement for griefing other players. It’s an encouraged aspect built into the game. Learn to live with it. 
---
Thanks so much! Was stuck on this for a bit wandering around at 7/10. 
---
Same thing happened to me yesterday on pc
---
I try to log out at my camp but you don't always have the luxury of time, and there are always server disconnects
---
Hopefully not. Bloodied has the tradeoff of you have to be at low health, ultimate glass cannon, and it only really gets ridiculous stacking bloodied, nerd rage, and adrenal reaction. 
---
I think even those get murdered or go feral.  There's a tape of a Free Stater murdering them and quite a few of them end up going feral and wandering the Galleria in the Mire.
---
I'm using way more.
---
Fusion cores too
---
I've killed multiple scorchbeasts with miniguns. Meta or no, maybe you're just bad?
---
Oh idk I just figured it was next. I haven't been able to find a decent one yet
---
They have vaults ready, like you can literally glitch thru &amp; experience the un-released version.
---
Idk why they’re so slow with content release.
---
Maybe I’m just being impatient &amp; have no life
---
I don't use the launcher, except to patch. I'd rather face the login screen everytime instead of having beth.net sitting in the background.
---
there is an achievement for killing 1, collecting a bounty, and killing 20, nowhere does it give you one for griefing.  all of my 20 i killed was on wanted people.
---
deserve a refund, game is not released as advertised
---
I just gave you a few examples of how I got countered sometimes. If you are wanted, here's my advice how NOT to get killed by me. May not be to my advantage giving this information out, but since you seem to think there is no defense against stealth people with rifles and therefore being completely invulnerable is ok:
---
1. Close quarters. You're wanted and suspect someone is after you? Draw them into a building or sit in your C.A.M.P. (In a building with a load screen I can't see where you are on the map, only that you are in the building. That makes me as blind as you. ) Sit somewhere tight with a shotgun. I can't shoot you for a stealth damage bonus if you are in my face when I find you. And a powerful melee weapon or shotgun at close range is bad news bears for long-range builds.  
---
2. High ground. Sit on a rooftop in the middle of a large field with some chameleon armor equipped. You WILL see me coming before I see you. And probably shoot me first.  
---
3. Listen. Even crouch walking, your footsteps make a lot of noise. I have found people hiding from me that way, and have been found in return other times.  
---
4. Be a pain in the ass just to get to. Build your base in a difficult place and move around a lot. I once had to climb all the way up Seneca Rocks to get to this guy's base, pick the lock on his door, and hide in his house by his stash box just to get a shot at him, because he ran and fast traveled all over the map and watched the fast travel spawn points to see if I would materialize behind him. Then would just travel away again while I was spawning in. When I figured that out, I spawned at nearby points and went to him, but he just fast traveled every few minutes anyway so I could never make it to where he was in time. I may have got him in the end because I set an ambush and he made a mistake, but he probably could have killed me if he had ambushed me while I was originally chasing him.   
---
5. Server hop. I can't follow someone to a different server. You think someone good is after you who has a chance to kill you? Leave the server.  
---
6. Play with a friend, use them as your eyes and kill you to take the bounty off. I have seen this dirty tactic too often. Two people take turns killing low-level players for caps, and have the teammate currently without a bounty watch the  world map. He will relay the positions of people coming to get the guy with the big bounty so they can't surprise him, and when the jerks get done racking up caps the team mate without a bounty kills the teammate who has one. The team keeps all the caps, and they take turns doing it for a huge net profit. You can't take caps from someone who just rinses their bounty through a teammate.
---
\^There you go, a griefer's guide to fucking over the bounty system and not get stealth-blasted by me. I'm sure someone who thinks being completely invulnerable is OK can put it to good use. 
---
I saw a thread about this earlier, basically your camp will produce x water every 5 minutes (typically 5) and it'll find places to put it inside your purifiers. So essentially having more purifiers let's you stay away from your camp before having to collect but doesn't increase the speed at all.
---
Things that work on fallout 76:
---
1) The Atom Store is working fine and dandy!
---
2)....
---
I wish I could include using doors, walking on the ground, and rendering buildings that are 5 feet away in that list but sadly those things are broken too,
---
Yes please!
---
&gt;IMO all weapon damage bonus cards should have a secondary effect of weight reduction for that weapon type.
---
YES THIS THIS IS A GREAT IDEA THIS NEEDS ITS OWN SUGGESTION.
---
Good luck. See ya again in 6 months :)
---
Thanks a lot. Of course now I know all this stuff but it may help a new player. BTW the best place with a rad removal chamber is Blackwater Mine near Whitesprings
---
For some reason super mutant miniguns actually do damage when yielded by super mutants. 
---
This, this is why people say nerf Melee. This is why TSE weapons were in such high demand.  And by taking away people's ability to compete with this type of play style is why my friends who love Fallout do not love this game.
---
5 caps isnt worth the risk.
---
also if you want this sub to find you you should say which platform you are on.
---
I was more being sarcastic, I have always felt that the guns weight was ridiculous. 
---
I blame cybermons English teacher.
---
can you fast travel?
---
rolled. I'm keeping it as a reminder of how many hours I wasted in this mess of a game.
---
Was this one Xbox Live last night? With the nuke directly over the fissure Prime?
---
Do you mean you have no mutations at all or none that would cause this? Speed demon has an (I think unmentioned) effect of increasing food and water consumption while running, and that would be increased further by the rad worms bug happening right now. Could be a separate issue though, wouldn't be surprised
---
How's 20 caps? If not, guess Ill just have to up the ante a bit 
---
Build how you want. Honestly, yours looks brilliant
---
Around 2500 caps now
---
there are enemies around. You can get out through one of the walls
---
God I hope they get TD2 right.
---
Shit got distracted with yard work it's actually nice out 60 degrees but friend request soon
---
I've ran across some random ones out in cranberry and in whitesprings before but have not heard of them giving wanted status 
---
Theres no point to two of those 'end game' examples you gave either, once your perks are maxed leveling is made irrelevant, once you got the specific drops you were after farming legendaries becomes irrelevant 
---
you just got the SBQ and that's boring even the first time
---
Ya true theres a bug trade off but between block dodgy and sental/caviar you pretty much stop taking damage at least in pvp. Its only the anti armor people you have to look out for
---
Rare offers would need recalculated 
---
My Atom Store was bugged for a couple days... many outfits were not showing up.. sigh..
---
They changed something about this in patch 4 I think? Made them no longer instanced too. A bit annoying I must say.
---
No idea. I suppose you could write a batch file or PowerShell script  to query the process id for fallout76.exe then kill it. Assign that to a Win+(anykey) shortcut for use when it happens. I usually just get disconnected though.
---
Like an actual game? 
---
I think we had something like this in Fallout 4. They just didnt snap to shit!
---
what platform are you on? If it is pc I can hop on to put you out of your misery and leave your junk in the bag.
---
Ya idk havent test myself for the same reason i know there worth the big bucks now though i saw a furious fire rate assault rifle sell for 13k earlier 
---
I have one ill look at it but I know it was a sbq drop. 
---
Happens to me a lot in the silo with my unarmed character when cats turrets. I can usually get myself down by running around, using vats on an enemy, or being reset to the beginning by the game.
---
Sounds like unintended thing. I can't see container drops having any PvP meaning. It would be funny to set up a CAMP near the supply drop after requesting it, and wait for mainly low level players to get Bountied.
---
 I have a silenced 10mm I have used on sleeping Ghouls, but stabbing them in their sleep is far more satisfying.
---
I'll come kill ya what's your GT
---
Something similar happened to me, requested a supply drop. Got to it and it said steal and I picked it. It then said the owner has turned hostile. I didn't seem to be wanted, I could still see people on the map, but this guys camp started shooting at me as soon as I picked the lock .. No one came after me, it was weird .. 
---
Yeah. Just don't look back. Ever.
---
The high level spawns are game mechanics...not bugs. A game mechanic that I appreciate. I have not had the same experiences as you. There has been an occasional disconnect or a stuck loading screen but it has been infrequent. 
---
It does suck about your gun. 
---
&gt;And probably shoot me first. 
---
Yeah.... no. Doesn't work that way. Doesn't matter if the bounty shoots first when you the bounty hunter is in a state of virtual invulnerability with slap damage mode. You get first shot. You get to decide when too initiate. Etc.
---
Server hopping, friend taking the bounty etc. are not counters. The system is flawed. Sure I can watch the fast travel spawn point. I can fast travel when they arrive. I can make them spend hundreds of caps chasing for a 10 cap bounty lol. Doesn't change the fact they can still one shot most people from that position of invulnerability.
---
They try to consolidate players into fewer servers as the population declines (every night basically, rebounding in the day) so it always feels full.
---
Is there a certian thing you have to do in game to trigger the moth man stalking you? 
---
Yeah he is almost as bad as the scorch beast has this rings of whatever, he is not too hard to kill though ..
---
 Someone downvoted Word Crimes. Good lord. ;)
---
It's 10, but I run Sneak and Escape artist. But getting spotted isn't the problem. The "Caution" and "Danger" stealth indicators get stuck on. Even when I'm not in combat or have fast-traveled to a different location. And it isn't just cosmetic. Enemies may not actually see me when it's stuck on "Danger", but I don't get sneak attack crits either, so the came is still counting me in a "detected" state, even if an enemy hasn't seen me yet.
---
No idea if exact number is ever shown. 
---
I have zero mutations at all. 
---
I did almost the same thing. I, too, finished the game, and now stalk players in my clown costume and Skeleton mask, jumping out at them with a chainsaw when they least expect it and sawing them into chunks, cackling maniacally. You should see the fear in their eyes!
---
Well, I guess that's not the same thing.
---
We make our own fun, though! That's the point!
---
hey, don't kill em all, leave some for me :D
---
I didnt even lose my power armor while I was crafting and got DCed due to a power outage...how did you lose a weapon while crafting when it doesnt even remove it from your inventory? are you sure you didnt press G?
---
its not a solo game and never was going to be, the fact people harp on about this just screams so much about what a failure this release has been
---
Where is the best spot to find Snallygasters?
---
Gatling gun seems to have nonsensical fire rate. 
---
Oh! Didn't know that. Thanks for the info. Only been playing a few weeks and still under level 20. Was the first time I'd seen it.
---
Good tip! However don't be in a hurry to finish the quests.. There aren't many and when you're done with them the end game is quite boring..
---
Me and several friends killed the flatwoods monster together we all have only that one box checked off , probably another bug of the millions but still to have its own catagory kinda questions it for me

At least you’re honest. ;) but honestly who didn’t cheat, I abused the hell out of that fusion core bug on login, and the +100 bonus carry weight if you log in while wearing excavator armor and don’t leave it.
---
relog if you cant fast travel.
---
I've run into him twice. He's not too fond of Gauss Rifles, fyi.
---
If your question is the value, it isn't shown. If your question is what it is, it's the melee attack of your gun or stock or whatever
---
just out of curiosity, does anyone use the .44s?  I never used it so always dump my .44 ammo
---
Oh I’m positive. I was in the weapons work bench looking to see what type of mods the gun has and out of no where I got disconnected. Went back in right away. Ran back to where I was and nothing. 
---
Bought the Brick Plans last night from the Watoga vender.  Cost was around 1300 caps.  And that is with 1 point in Hard Bargain Perk.
---
The Brotherhood Vender is near Watoga Station.  I'm guessing the plans would be more than 1300 caps.  I'm going to save 2000 caps and head back to the Brotherhood Vender.
---
Says you are offline. Invite me GT is statesidellama 
---
Same, been going through water like... well, water
---
Good luck.
---
I haven’t even followed the main quests yet cause for some reason everything is high 60s level and I’m in the 30s. 
---
Rocking the garb and similar setup. Except I don’t use mines as much as I should have. Lolz
---
I’m a solo player who finally finished ‘Belly of the Beast’ last night as a lvl 59.
---
My advice:
---
- Load up on health items and ammo before you go
---
- There is nowhere in the Glassed Caverns to repair weapons, so make sure you take and use a few different ones.
---
- Don’t worry about fighting SBs in the bog on the way to the caverns...just run. As stealthily as possible, of course
---
- I don’t want to spoil anything, so I’ll just say that the scorched are MOSTLY the only thing you’ll encounter before you get to the main cavern, but that you shouldn’t be too worried.
---
- I chose to use Stealth Boys at the end of the cavern, so I could pick up the quest target without the need for fighting. I recommend 4 at minimum, because it’s easy to miss what you’re looking for and you may have to double back.
---
Good luck!
---
I think the fusion core drain is just VATS excessively drain the core every time you use it (someone said like 1% per VATS attack, which is probably a bit excessive).
---
(Unrelated to Power Armor, but) I also noticed VATS tends to burn through weapon durability faster now too (my weapon that is exclusively for VATS criticals loses durability faster than weapons I use more frequently). This was a feature in Fallout 3/NV, but Idk if this was initially in 76, or whether it was added or made more aggressive recently.  
---
In both cases I like the idea, but I feel like the severity could be toned down a bit.
---
I sure as hell won't be back for a paying DLC that's for sure!
---
I've got like 5 extra ones from random event rewards
---
Air surface missles are not too fond of him either, fyi 
---
Go fuxk yourself
---
Raid 1 has increased read speed.
---
I'm not sure why you would respond with less information than it was already clear we both knew.  And considering he cares about hard drive space I'm going to argue his read speeds are why he's making an entire 1 TB SSD redundant.
---
FINALLY.
---
SSDs do not "run fast enough."  That's a ridiculous notion in computing.
---
Shows honestly how much you are paying attention.
---
Officially they have stated-
---
New content is done and are waiting till stability is increased, glitches are patched, and exploits plus exploiters are removed.
---
Right there on inside the vault.
---
Multiple dlcs are planned for the year.
---
It seems like everything is draining faster: food, water, fusion cores, item durability. Maybe it's in preparation for the pay-to-win buffs in lunchboxes. 
---
Green Thumb, in perception, is the perk that will let you harvest double from plants. 
---
Have you tried changing camp locations?
---
You on Xbox?
---
It could also be a case of overcompensation, but I don't know.
---
Yesm that's what it's called. I just forgotted, but figured most would know of it. It's not critical to this, but it certainly helps.
---
Brilliant, I love it.
---
Oh, so we're arguing based on "what ifs" now? It's cool that these opinions get upvoted on this subreddit.
---
I’ve heard it happens if you harvest Mothman eggs. I’ve actually never harvested any and have never seen anything but wise mothman. Been meaning to go harvest some to see if I can get him to appear. 
---
You do realize that posts can be seen after the weekend, right? This is the silliest PSA I've ever heard. you really don't think they are going to notice a post that was made on Saturday but got 2.8k upvotes? Lmao c'mon dude 
---
For sure. You gave good advice. I was just throwing the name out in case anyone didn't know. 
---
I thought that.  But when I asked my teammates who were with me they had different parts.  We didn’t share a stock of heavy or Sturdy Combat Armor plans. 
---
I don’t think I follow, I mean why not set the terminals up like the rest of the vendors, I can go to multiple raider vendors, each has its own inventory, and a linked caps. If I sell to one, that item isn’t available anywhere else, and since it’s one person per vendor, no duping 
---
They produce that much in an hour but the problem is the purifier's inventory space is limited so it'll max at 2. 
---
Stealth is working for tons of people.
---
 Crit nerf is not a problem, just a nerf.
---
Map bug only lasts about 10 seconds.
---
I haven't and neither have my friends crashed once since the last patch showing increased stability for us
---
You forgot the fall through the world bug and random spawn death bug.
---
Dupers are making stuff up to save their skins, have not seen a single instance of accidental multiple item duping in the way you describe
---
I was so fucking scared when I saw the first dead scorched mirelurk queen. I thought it was going to pop up and rape me. Hate those things
---
They released a limited time camo paint for the hunting rifle 2 days after legendary variants were finally patched in, didn't they? I have no doubt there's no thought process to this, it's a flawed idea. I don't want to have to login every day just to check the store on the off chance I miss the one in a hundred item I'd pay for.
---
It's sure a solo game for me. When I run out of solo content, I'll just stop playing. I'll get my $35 out of it. 
---
There are 2 tapes for Colonel.  One from when he was a kid up on the top of the FLatwoods church and a second found on his body on a porch on the East side of Flatwoods.  Can't remember about Miguel, sorry.
---
Welcome to fallout 76 population 100 and falling
---
Same here. Could be they set the other armors as actual armor (like the mistress of mystery dress) instead of cosmetic like the shroud's
---
With low charisma and no hard bargain periods they're 11k.
---
i got railway ammo today off a SBQ so that was nice
---
How many stars are next to the item? Each start represents an ability. Inspect the item to see all of its abilities. 
---
people on this sub are generally armchair developers that have no clue what they're talking about anyway.
---
Mine work just fine on pc.
---
There are two different stats at play here; one is production rate, the other is storage capacity. A small water purifier can indeed produce 12 purified water per hour, if you empty it regularly. 
---
Yup I get the same and 5 mins later marsupial will kick back in so that's nice.
---
thanks, I was scared to do that but it worked. Now I need to get more materials to start rebuilding.
---
I let them work on the game and pretend that I didn't buy it. Maybe in a few months I can log in with good feelings.
---
Didn't work. Spent an hour farming Assaultrons, finally got the head. Broke it down, got some useless scrap, no plan.
---
&gt; used a Monkey Paw to wish all their bugs away
---
this comment was a ride in the ROFLcopter
---
My ps4 is running flawlessly (for my clan and i, doubt this is true for everyone, especially on ps4pro because it seems to run worse). A few minor bugs but overall things feel good. Watch out for shit posts from banned players angrily flaming the game. 
---
I play most days, even if it’s just for a little while.  The game is very relaxing for me.  I take my time to read all the notes and terminals.  I’ve never understood people who blitz to the endgame.   
---
So I've resorted to clearing out every single location all over the map because, as you state, I'm out of quests.  I BELIEVE I have everything cleared but there's no explorer perk like ther was in Fallout 4.
---
One other annoying thing is the Overseer journey, not only have I been everywhere and done everything (including a nuke) I also have 18 holotapes but the quest won't complete.  I'm guessing there must be something in a DLC for the other vaults when they open.
---
Are you running 3rd party mods?
---
Yes. 
---
I got the Summerset special in my second character and bought the bullet. I feel like the Man with the Golden Gun, my childhood playing Goldeneye feels deep nostalgia
---
Great just let me know the effects and we can discuss a price 
---
Thanks.
---
This happened to me with my lever action rifle
---
Thank you.
---
Stupid question,  but you read the plan in your notes section correct. Sorry to ask,  but figured start simple 
---
1900 looking at it right now at white springs 
---
What, so you can also equip the StealthBoy torso mod and live out your Predator fantasies?
---
Thank ya, kindly! I always forget names of perks, and such. I appreciate it 
---
You go play anthem and hop off the sub. 
---
Honestly the first time I went to point pleasant I harvested all the mothman eggs I could find in hopes I could eat them or hatch little mothman. Turns out you can't hatch them!! 
---
Ill try it again though thank you for the help :) 
---
Uninstalled yesterday. 
---
Now you're talking!
---
Have you seen the Atomic shop? Flaming unicorns are confirmed next patch :)
---
Good info, thanks!  
---
 If/When I next log on I'll play around with VATS and see, if that's the case it would explain allot. 
---
But I've seen it in game with Running as well, with the Strength based PA perk cards equipped (which is supposed to negate the addition FC drain for sprinting).  
---
Always seems to clear up by using one of the two listed methods.
---
Did you do "Feed the World" or "The Path to Enlightenment" by any chance?
---
I only whip out mines when I've got a lot of big enemies coming at me. Like if I know there is going to be a crowd of high level super mutants or mole miners who like to get into melee range. 
---
Very Literally!
---
When you have to download 48Gb each time you want to play the game though the launcher. 
---
I think im done with the game now. 
---
No unfortunately not, it locks up hard. But thank you for the hint though.
---
It does sound like something you could just get lost in for hours. 
---
You are a trooper for continuing to post bug reports. Let me add one.
---
If you have two of the same legendary weapons, for example “Two shot gatling gun” and have both favorited, one will be unfavorited when you leave the server and rejoin. This happens even if they aren’t exactly the same (one is explosive one isn’t etc).This has only been happening since the last patch.
---
Also the underarmor effecting power armors value. This doesn’t seem to happen with all underarmors. It never seems to happen with the enclave underarmor but always happens with the BoS or Marine ones, unsure about others.
---
I ll play both thank you but since you know bethesda hasn't gotten a single patch right some people might want to try anthem demo while it's out.
---
***S W A T T A***
---
If I'm not mistaken, you can actually buy one right on Bethesda's page and also on Amazon.
---
I did the challenge a few days ago. Like most of the challenges, if you did progress in Beta, that may not have carried over to live game, yet you can't re-do them to tick that part of the progress. Bethesda said that they'll fix cooking recipes discovered in Challenges. So, possibly we'll retroactively get progress marks in future game builds.
---
It's relatively cheap now, and the DLC is free into the future. Don't be cheap, support the game for $20 or whatever it is. 
---
You won't regret it, and if you, no refunds!!!
---
In the same pool as every other legendary. 
---
Just the well-known Whitesping tricks.
---
Worthless. 
---
I recommend Fireproof. Since equipping it I take minimal damage from SB sonic attacks. Armor still degrades on hit but damage is greatly mitigated.
---
Given all the negativity from some of the fan base. I figured someone would be giving it away. Yeah I’ll search the web &amp; buy/ support.
---
That's the spirit
---
Let the world fully load in before using the pipboy. If you do get stuck you can hop servers through the social tab to fix it. 
---
ROFL!!!! Just spat out my drink reading that!!! 😂
---
One dropped for me at WhiteSpring during a nuke ..
---
That would be a final blow to the game. You can't just KEEP blanket nerfing when most of the guns blow. Ranged is already behind, and Bloody is the only thing keeping heavy guns afloat. **Instead of nerfing Bloody,**
---
* Bloody: Reduced to 70% max.
---
* Two Shot: Increase to 40%
---
* Mutants: Increase to 30%
---
* Executioner: Increase to 70% below 50% hp
---
* Enemy Type Dmg: increase to 60%
---
* Furious: Increase to 70%, 7% per shot. Lasts 3 seconds.
---
* Berserker: Up to 70%  (Like Bloody).
---
I bet this is some kinda leakage from the new pvp mode code, because it seems like you get that warning for every supply drop, even ones you have requested, however I haven’t gotten the wanted flag yet
---
I’ve also done both requested and Unrequested nuke card drops, and they now always say your stealing from them, but never flag for wanted. 
---
Agreed.  As was the case for me.  Still, the fact that it's there, and based on internal code (so it plays very nice with the game) is better than nothing.  I don't mean that in an "excuse" kind of way, but in a "make lemonade out of lemons" kind of way.
---
Yeah I didnt mind Tactics. It was no Fallout 1 or 2 but I played it a lot when it looked like we'd never get a Fallout 3.
---
[ok](https://imgur.com/a/95wkDcP)
---
I totally agree 100%. But Bethesda should give us the Well Tuned buff for swinging a guitar sword for 30 seconds.
---
It's all based off RNG. So, everywhere?
---
Serendipity and nerd rage are both necessities. 
---
Legit criticism: the motivation for the villain was weak. 
---
I use a 44 western bc it’s a two shot... this paint would of made it that much more enjoyable 
---
I’m still having fun. I ignore most of the negativity here because it usually seems to be exaggerated or nitpicky.  Sure there’s problems, but a lot of people here act like some of the smaller issues are the end of the world.
---
I play it like a regular fallout game, ignore the hate, and have fun. Sue me
---
I'm just here for your soooothing voice.
---
Pretty sure if I did last shot on the scorchbeast queen and she fell into a geyser she'd just end up at vault 94 
---
I know this is old, but I’m considering buying a NZ key for $10. I am in North America. Could I use a VPN to redeem the NZ key in North America? Also would I create an account with the region as New Zealand?
---
Seeing as thats not what is happening, maybe it is just a bug that needs to be fixed
---
Right and 76 has two (used by players) Nuke zones, 3 silos, and a larger focus on player-created content.  I pretty much ran out of end game content in both in the same timeframe.  Although I did it on all three characters by this point for Destiny.
---
I would use incisor and blocker in the strength tree. It is really helpful in melee builds. In the luck tree, class freak will help reduce the negative effects of mutations a bit. Having nerd rage at even 1 point can help give you time to heal yourself if you get low on health. A bunch of the points in perception could be moved to help you out in other areas. The perks that are just related to crafting and repairs could be swapped with different ones too unless they are tied to weapon degradation. Maybe keep 3 in perception for the lockpick cards. 
---
My gun powder needs to be junk!
---
It breaks you weapon crazy fast. Use to use it for tagging mobs but repairs become a problem.
---
It’s basically a “mod” for the lever action rifle
---
Dumpster behind any GameStop?
---
Same publisher so same people that caused duffle kerfuffle, nuka dark rum conundrum, atom store furor and so on.
---
So yeah, still very worried.
---
I still liked it, but yes, very weak reasoning.
---
Thanks...   
---
 Will test and add to the weapons section (that grouping took a bit over 3.25 hours, so will be a bit before the next. Post).   
---
That said...    
---
I'm not sure if I'm doing this out of spite at this point, refusing to be out maneuvered by Bethesda and the Fan's who keep trolling  every non-positive comment or a legit desire to play a fixed game, but I'll let a shrink tell me if spite's unhealthy motivator. ;) 
---
A level 5 instigating multipurpose axe. I got my mule up to level 12 at Whitesprings yesterday and was about to move him to his future home. I decided to swing by the golf club for one last look before I left. 
---
The spawns were my level, so I decided to see what would drop. I got that axe and grinned. Once it was equipped, I had at least ten level 9-12s surrounding me, waiting to help me test it out. I started one-shotting them left and right, except for the level 22 with them. 
---
I guess melee really is OP. 
---
For my rifleman, my quad lever action was a blast. My 1* TS handmade I rolled is my workhorse. I definitely enjoy my TSE Gatling gun for SBQ and other large targets. 
---
SBQ dropped nothing for me 
---
Note: it’s along the side of the gazebo on the inside, not the middle or on display at all, it’s really easy to miss until you see it 
---
I’m not stating they will not see them I’m stating this will increase your chances of being seen. 
---
I only pop the WR perks for quick travel as a heavy gunner that hordes all loot, I accept that I will be always overweight and will enjoy the increased damage instead of weight reduction.
---
Try moving the MATs on to your person.
---
I had an issue last night when crafting Shielded BOS Officer Uniform that the game wouldnt allow me to craft the Mod with the MATs in my Stash.
---
I’ve had 2 drop, one assassins and one executioner. Sold the first and still have the later.
---
Worse on the Pro, huh? Yeah, mine sounds awful running most games, probably needs some maintenance. It's the first model and I expected to have to replace the thermal paste on the processor by now, but it has yet to die. I'm thankful for that so I don't complain about the FPS too much because it's only really bad in nuked areas and when there's a ton of people/action. Dying is not a big deal and I'm pretty tanky even in a hazmat suit nowadays so... Thanks for the info, though. Been taking a break from the game anyway, no reason to jump back on now
---
6 times now I've gotten into a world, but been disconnected from the server in less than 30 seconds if not immediately. Normally when you're booted you can rejoin no problem. If I do that it drops my char and attempts to reload as a lvl1 char. I have to quit the game entirely and relaunch it. 
---
One time it did load long enough for me to take a couple screen caps of the jacked up colors and my status screen. Somehow my character was dropped from lvl 107ish to 1 and my couple thousand caps were gone. Didn't get a chance to look at the perks before I got booted.
---
Always hit the inventory button. Sometimes works for me.
---
There's already enough "game by proxy" design in Bethesda's games. 
---
Why not at least replace the model with a cracked screen and remove the prompts?
---
Not too shabby, I really hope they don't nerf bloody.
---
Fixing the BUGS should be the ONLY priority now.
---
Same , what blew my mind is if I launch the .exe from admin mode it opens like 15 seconds faster (almost instantly).  You can probably fix it by killing the launcher in task manager, then restarting. 
---
Stop e-begging
---
Xbox One S
---
This is something my dad saw: Cyclophile 
---
At the Whitesprings golf club, twice have robots spawned instead of ghouls. We have never seen anything but ghouls at the golf club so this is very odd.
---
 These robots were not Whitesprings ones, they were enemies. First time, they were all legendary protections. Second time, low level eyebots that were legendary. Not all dropped legendary items but it is still strange. Reporting it in case there aren't supposed to be any robots like that spawning.
---
They worked fine in Fallout 4. Not to mention they are still available in the workshops. I have never had an issue.
---
It's happened to me twice, both times inside the Whitespring. It was even funnier the second time as a level 58 one-shotted himself by hitting me with a Supersledge lol His rant over the mic was freakin' hilarious, I would have recorded it but couldn't hit the right keyboard combo to do so as I was laughing so much :D
---
damn! white vendor? Never see them there
---
I think its more to the point that before the patch I did well being a lone wanderer in pve it was challenging but not impossible. Now post patch the same Wes tek run we have all done, will mean my primary and secondary weapons are broke all 1500 rounds depleted with 20 odd deaths. after playing everyday since launch I find the game now annoying not challenging 
---
I agree, that seemed like it would be an intuitive feature. But hey, it's methesda we're talking about. 
---
I think this would be a great idea, particularly if they implemented factions that players can actually align with.
---
I believe it calculates bases on how fast it would fire if you pressed the trigger button as fast as possible, but without factoring in the reload times.  That's why the Double-shot gun has a faster fire rate than the pump action.
---
I hear it too. The sound of your character unequiping all items when exiting to main menu.
---
It would be great to see it easily on the player too, so you know whether someone is likely to be friendly.
---
It's £7.79 on cdkeys...
---
Honestly another QoL thing that makes no sense not to increase the storage other than to artificially stretch the grind out to the MAX.
---
White springs.  It’s a very common vendor because of farming.  It’s middle of the map, to the right of that big ass lake thing.
---
This wouldnt be so much of a damn chore if the daily events were actually daily
---
With our luck it'll weigh 15lbs
---
Pretty sure that exists but it's like really expensive for what it does and single use, haven't actually used it myself but I can craft them in the chemistry station.
---
I guess it was like this. 
---
Developer to boss: there is a problem with the spawn mat we have found i the Fallout 4 code. The camp loads too slow when a player joins a server. 
---
Boss: so let him spawn somewhere arround. Don't care if he glitches out of the map and dies every time. He will soon move his base to a different location. 
---
Developer: but it's expensive to move the base frequently to just find a place without glitches.
---
Boss: then show a incorrect price in the pipboy. 
---
No, I play on xbox and don't even know how to mod haha
---
I went there, left with a bad case of mirelurks and had to shave capt. winky's beard and use a special shampoo...
---
I assume hunger and thirst are increasing at a rate inversely proportionate to the drain of players from the game.  Stop the Insanity!
---
Good point, wasn’t sure if the free states ones were a part of that group or not
---
Blue screens or "Disconnected from servers"?  
---
If blue screens, and you wear PA check this out, with help from some brothers and sisters on the console I was able to run down this issue and for some they've gone to non-stop BlueScreens to almost none.  
---
[[Bug Fix] Pretty sure I just figured out the cause of the PowerArmor Targeting HUD CTD's AND THE FIX.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ajk3tq/bug_fix_pretty_sure_i_just_figured_out_the_cause/) 
---
I do, good if you like to use VATS. With the right perks you'll be pulling off back to back headshot crits and just destroying most enemies. 
---
Though I've considered switching to using the lever action as my main, as it has even more damage and armor penetration. Plus the ammo is more common.
---
Can we also focus on fixing stealth? 
---
Good to know the fallout community is a bunch of autistics that hate human interaction...
---
I was so excited when I finally got two-shot mini guns and gatling plasma, but I can only kill about 10 standard high lvl mobs before they break or run out of ammo.  So much ammo resources, so little dmg. 
---
Nice!  
---
No glasses or headband slot item?
---
I still play every day, the bug that bothers me the most right now is not being able to finish some of the challenges. Don't put a challenge app for picking flowers if it's not going to count the flowers I pick.
---
can you stack melee bobbleheads?
---
If they read this melee will be dead soon. 
---
Only followed to try once more to give. Not like I was chasing him for more than 30 secs...
---
I didnt think of that, I'll try the bottle cap glasses with it next time!
---
Upvoted for truth. I love this thread.
---
Water filter plans exist. You get them after completing one of the first story missions in Flatwoods. This is dumb.
---
He could have said no and left it at that...
---
Yeah, they definitely work. You don't see it on the damage display in the pip boy but when I hit a friend I did more damage.
---
People have been reporting weapons and armor vanishing since the early Jan patch, I've personally had it happen to 2 PA pieces and a weapon.  
---
In all of the instances I did no buying / Selling / dropping during that period, just murder.
---
It just works
---
I gave up, my gf rage quitted, and I advised my brother and all my friends not to buy the game.
---
My sword does more damage than that 3/4 of my guns and i'm not a melee build.The game clearly is not balanced at this time.
---
I like it. It should moved to as a game feature.
---
Invisible man creepy!
---
Just like FO76... but at least red dead has an amazing single player mode. 76 is just a lazy broken cash grab.
---
Yeah happened to me also. Unintended bug I think
---
Did you take over a workshop?
---
Take over a sweet little workshop?
---
Right!!
---
Yes noticed this yesterday with super mutants right when I'm about to get their loot
---
Perhaps you don understand what anxiety is. When people do this it makes it difficult to approach others. I get people want to play solo, put some want teams... it's not all about you and your playstyle you know
---
It’s kinda lame to criticize artistic storytelling like this.  What you want would completely ruin the whole mood they are setting on purpose.  It’s supposed to be dark and sad, otherwise it’s meaningless.
---
I think that's the real problem, not Bloodied itself.  The whole idea of Bloodied is to be a high-risk-high-reward play style.  Take away the risk with Sentinel or Cavalier, and you defeat the intended trade-off.
---
&gt; Then they have to give the assets to people who can actually code all the item's stats and effects. Which again is not part of a job of asset makers.
---
You've never made a mod for a Bethesda game, have you? Adding items to the game requires no coding. So I don't believe you that you have been making mods since morrowind.
---
There's a note on top of an observation tower where the author says "they" (super mutants I think) took his dog and hes going to get him back but he doubts he or the dog will live through it.  That shit got me right in the feels.
---
More then likely there were afraid it could cause other glitch’s people would find and can re create easily if they built it in a certain way.
---
I've seen a lot of scorchbeasts that died like that.Nothing interesting.
---
How is that related to the topic of modders fixing Bethesda's bugs for them?
---
I don't think you understand the concept of "degrees". There is a difference between him being able to survive standing in the open and being shot in the face once, and being completely indestructible and immune to all damage. These things are not mutually exclusive concepts. And if you are dumb enough to run around in the open when you have a bounty and not use anti-sniper tactics, you frankly deserve to lose because of your poor gameplay. In every shooting game, EVER, getting sniped in the head is lethal. You have to fight snipers by getting close and using cover. Not just being invincible. And if you have a large bounty in the FIRST place, it's probably because you were being a jerk and either killing non-combatant players, stealing from them, or breaking their shit. That bounty is there to entice other players to put you down and discourage griefing. These are generally not sportsmanlike fair players who don't abuse the system as much as they can. Which is why I like killing them. You want PvP, then challenge someone to a duel or play this new arena thing and survival mode Bethesda are about to introduce. Trying to convince people that having complete damage immunity with the right items is ok just sounds like you don't want your un-fair advantage taken away.
---
Unannounced "feature" of the mid-Jan patch, sorry it caught you.
---
I can sell one for $60
---
I have 4 of them.
---
Well excuse us for having a little fun
---
It’s yet to happen to me with smaller sized enemies, but I can see how that would also be frustrating.
---
I love it, I can't believe I hadn't considered this for making larger/more fleshed out camps.
---
The worst part of it is this affects your teammates too. 
---
We were running around trying to use them up a few weeks ago after that update and if anyone else unlocked the government supply drop you called in they were wanted.
---
It also went from having different supplies for everybody that went to the box to having poor Community supplies. Now I've got about a hundred and thirty of these things that I can't or won't use.
---
That would be the sensible way to do it but swear you can shot more then 5 rounds per min with lever even with having to reload. Ill do some testing later to make sure. And i know the hunting rifle doesnt take 30 seconds per shot but its fire rate is 2.
---
That seems about right.  It's not an indefinite increase.  Certainly never gets to the point where it seems like I'm doing 200% damage, but 150%, I'd agree with that.
---
I believe it started after Tuesday's patch

---
Yeah I know them. I had played with them basically thier whole time of Fallout 76 until the day he got banned. He did turn on cheat engine on a differet game the day before but never turned it on for Fallout. He isn't a duper, in fact he hates that crap.
---
Its the main reason I stopped playing, got no one who wants to play now but someone that got wrongfully banned.
---
Well I didn't know if that would work seeing as I get disconnected regularly. Didnt want 10k worth of caps going to waste so thought I'd be a good samaritan. Not like it affects your gameplay since it's for build mode, aside from intense grinding for caps to purchase them. Even the dev's would go around gifting stuff to new players, but fk then right?
---
if you drop items very fast, such as junk for a friend, sometimes your gun may drop, dropped my explosive shotgun 3 times due to it
---
QoL cards can kind of be a trap. The trick is to figure out how to become self sustaining. Once you do that you can focus your perks choices on cards that will help you down enemies quicker, which in turn will help you level quicker. 
---
Here are some tips:
---
-Plant corn and razor grain at your camp. 1 corn/razor grain and 1 boiled water will make a soup that increases both food and water. Also, build water purifiers.
---
-If you are going to take some QoL cards I recommend Party Boy, Nuka Nut, and Good Doggey. Liquor, nuke-cola, and dog food are common. These perks will help you get the most out of them.
---
-Find a build planner online and see what cards are coming up so you can plan accordingly. It's tempting to spread point around as needed, but focusing on a specific weapon type will generally be more beneficial. 
---
Hope this helps you some. 
---
I feel sorry for anyone that thinks this game is fun.
---
nope
---
melee is just naturally op
---
Me to im a little afraid of it. My hope is that because this build is super popular Bethesda just won't notice  amidst all the other crap they have to deal with.
---
Maybe you aren't trying hard enough. They're BOS which automatically makes them better than your character.
---
Unfortunately it's only a matter of time.
---
BETH f\*ck up with the latest update.
---
All the Headlamps got tagged as Atom Shop items, but since they just replaced the Red Tactical w/ the Mothman Headlamp you can't equip it currently.
---
Keep it in your stash and wait for the next update to patch this out.
---
I'm no offended, more unnerved that he said he would disconnect. A simple no thanks would have been enough to get the point across, or even the emote for no...
---
Who cares about everyone when you can attempt to suck shareholders' dicks and fail miserably.
---
Honestly if they need to know about qol improvements like not needing certain perks to be active without equipping the cards (eg, locksmith, crafting, ammo, etc.) then me posting about it m-f won’t help.
---
The displayed stats are not to be trusted. Just take a stroll through the various mods and you'll find all sorts of wackiness. 
---
I killed the scorchbeast queen there is nothing left to do no endgame no content. I can only farm whitespring for so damn long
---
I enjoyed tactics alot
---
My story was similar. I got to use it for a few weeks before the nerf at least. Also have an explosive Dragon which was exceptionally fun but isn't at all worth the reload time now.
---
I did come across an explosive Cryolator once, but I trashed it immediately because it wasn't at all what I wanted, and after 100 garbage legendaries I figured I could wait a few more hundred... Weighed a bunch too but thinking about it the Handmade is absurdly heavy, on par with a Guass Rifle.
---
I'm still hoping for an explosive Handmade. I really couldn't care about the nerf, I wasn't planning on using it optimally anyway. I just want it because I main the Handmade and explosives are my secondary skill. 
---
We need more people like you around. 
---
yep whitespring
---
Yeah this one got to me. Broke my heart as you can hear her start to fade as the holotape goes on. 
---
Watoga and destroy the annoying robots 
---
Ouch - ok, I amended my list
---
Light metal arms as well. 
---
**Yes!** All of this!
---
I don't get why people are **so** focused on the negative, I'm having a ton of fun exploring and diving into the lore.
---
I mean, we get it... BethSoft is dropping the ball **hard**, but I've put 200 hours into this game with only being minorly inconvenience along the way. On top of that, they're improving and trying to fix their stuff(*I know, with screw-ups in between, but they'll get their shit together eventually*).
---
I mean, with everything that's going on, does no one remember BethSoft billing this as being an experiment?
---
Remember they were saying they are in new territory, but we're gonna get through this together, but they're approaching it in an "uncharted territory" sort of way?
---
IDK, they're out of their element and aware of it, but nothing shows me they've given up on us. In fact, I see the opposite.
---
With this game I got to legitimately play Fallout with Friends, not like Elder Scrolls Online was a different engine/game, but they **actually** used the Engine that makes Fallout feel like Fallout. On top of that I have new lore, weapons, and a playground 4x larger than Fallout 4. **AND** they are adding new content for... *Forever*?!
---
Man, I'm in Fallout heaven, and as long as they are dedicated to making the experience better for us, I'm having fun.
---
(*And before all the hate about me ignoring all there missteps, and not holding them to talsk, I don't agree with that at all. Hold them to task, yes, but please keep all of bitching and moaning to yourselves. They already said this is a big science project for them, and all their missteps show it, but just try to be constructive like an adult, and not crying like a toddler*)
---
Color me excited for the future...
---
Thank you for posting the core usage issue.  I spent about 20 minutes last night doing a power plant repair mission and lost about 60% of my last core.
---
I wasnt interrupting him... I stood some distance away gesturing at the bag. The damn things are blueprints, you BUY them for a shitton of caps. If you think grinding for days to get them is "finding them for yourself" then I pity the boredom that you find fun...
---
*sigh* I thought as much. Thank you for the reassurance! At least the mods don't take up a lot of stash space. 
---
I posted a very similar statement like a month ago, got downvoted to hell. 
---
I'm 100% sure I'm not imagining it. With my previous character I crept through Harper's Ferry within touching distance of Super Mutants twice my level and I didn't come out of [HIDDEN] status.
---
Now, with my new character with the same stats AND the addition of Shadowed Armour and Muffled legs, random fucking dogs, scorched, rats and level fucking three mobs just jump out of the goddamn bushes at me without me knowing because I'm permanently in FUCKING [CAUTION] state.
---
Sorry for the vent :(
---
It's also a single player game. This is now.
---
Cant you open the .exe of the game? I play the game without Bethesda launcher and it works everytime
---
No I just like turning the tables on people who think PvP is one shotting people from a position of virtual invulnerability. They probably do it a lot and then oooo this person was actually prepared. They actually have all the defense perks, all the -8% and -15% gear. They actually have Dodgy, and Serendipity, and Lone Wanderer, and Med-X. They actually aren't some pushover for easy caps, like the level 20s with 10 cap bounties they are used to one shotting, while never being at risk themselves. Server hopping or fast travelling away straight after one shotting their target so they can't even have any real pvp. Yeah.
---
I just picked up a max level 3* single action revolver 1) Two shot 2) +50% limb damage 3) -25% VATS cost. 
---
Yeah you need glowing fungus and bleach dogwood, it wouldn't be so bad if the fungus didn't expire and the dogwood didn't get scrapped into normal wood when you scrap all.
---
Not a problem!  
---
**Questions:**.  
---
Any perks to reduce core usage?  
---
Heavy VATS user, light, or no VATS usage?
---
I like this, bloodied is 80% right now as far as im aware and i dont think it needs to go lower. Mutants to 30% would be awesome. Also i think junkies should be like 2x 3x because of how tedious it is to manage addictions and all there down sides. But ya as it is most leg effect or crap compared to the few really good ones it would be cool to have any effect be something worth having
---
These aren't exactly game changing... building blueprints are basically aesthetic and expensive in caps. If you like farming caps for days to get these because your reward for all that boring grind is some aesthetics stuff you might not even have bothered with otherwise how does it ruin the game for you?
---
Power attack drains the core as well, feels like 1-2% per attack
---
The game is very much alive from what I can tell, the subreddit hit a turning point of frustration and shriveled up. A small fraction of the player base which congregate here are done until it's in a better state. 
---
I seriously thought that too or maybe they attempted to throw a grenade and I killed them before the throw and it landed at their feet
---
I don't recall where I got mine. It's not good for much except rolling through waves of enemies in the Forest and Toxic Valley.
---
I did exactly this. Melee was so incredibly better than stealth sniper.
---
I see, never realized. Thanks!
---
Jumping like a bunny, or server hopping? Server hopping, no I only do heavy hopping when I am trying to spawn a mod, which isn't too often. Jumping? Hmm...  I wouldn't say I jump excessively. I don't think I've ever froze while jumping around tbh.
---
Are you on xbox by chance 
---
It will ends with flying bike
---
My ing is ip00ppedmydicoff if you ever want to meet up and pvp or something im part of a pvp discord server and were always looking for more people to joint aswell
---
My weapon before the patch did 247 damage.  Now its at 127 with 9 points in rifleman and 5 in demolition.   Complete waste of fucking time and you have no fucking clue what you are talking about.  
---
Tactics was my first Fallout game and i really enjoyed it without playing the first 2 games.
---
Bethesda is in bed with the all too powerful Melee cartels. 
---
Welcome back to the new .... old meta. 
---
Wow I legit hope that is the case 
---
It has been happening to me too. I thought it's only my launcher but now i realize they suck from all perspectives.
---
Shotgun work the enforcer perk. I'm kneecapping like a mad capo
---
Especially for the whitesprings ball!! Hell yes!
---
Man, it's not even the worst Fallout game to date. That award goes decidedly to BoS. And then, arguably, Tactics. 
---
Its pretty handy for taking care of them if you have Glow Sight 3 (+60% damage) and use it on a group. TTK is 5 seconds per ghoul for me with an Anti-Armor or Furious.
---
I've never played a Fallout where I had to hide my toon in a corner to cry, this shit's dark af and I love it.
---
Too risky to play atm. Wait for next patch and follow im here the week after before playing.
---
Then you were the fucktard being caried through the fight.  What a clueless idiot.
---
the station or one of the robots inside?
---
Welcome to the club.
---
I don't mean to sound elitist but was there any other legendary prefex besides the Ghoul Slayers? 
---
I'm kinda hoping any endgame content they add next isn't ghoul related. I've had my fill at the Whitespring.
---
Its really more a matter of Bethesda's general issues finally coming to ahead because they tried treat this game the same way they do every game and never adjusted for the reality of it being online multiplayer. I honestly think the issues we have seen were for the most part always going to happened eventually because there are changes they need to make in how they approach development and post development in general. The support team for this, be it for fixing bugs or reading and answering reports about said bugs, is too small and inexperienced. This needed real QA/beta testing due to the sheer size alone yet they stuck to their in-house testing which is one of the reasons you likely always see a decent amount of bugs in Bethesda games in general. They move on to the next project games wise a bit too fast, seemingly not leaving enough people behind to support the current games in a efficient manner.
---
I like the game and haven't been bogged down by too many of the bugs yet, but I can understand players' frustrations and am unfortunately not really surprised by the issues we have seen so far.
---
I have a TSE LMG and it still sucks for anything but burning useless .308.
---
I found the mole outfit shirt a while ago. I gave it to a guy who had the hat. I had no idea it was rare at the time.
---
I just had the same experience, but I CAN equip it on my X-01. 
---
I think they accidentally overrode all of the red lamps for power armor with an atom shop version of an X-01 light. 
---
I hate to rub salt into the wound, but it's my favorite light so far. IT'S SO FRIGGING BRIGHT! 
---
fuckthesda deserves every bashing they can get, even if it means 100 threads like this each hour.
---
Not a stupid question. It’s most likely the issue here
---
Personally I wouldn't keep 3x lock picking or hacker on all the time. This 6 point can go towards way more useful things. 
---
Building for pve or pvp really isn't to different. The difference would really come down to armor selection. I recommend that you choose a weapon type and build from there.
---
For example, if you decide you like rifles then you may want to pick up sneak so it's easier to score crits. If you decide melee is for you then ironclad may be a good choice. 
---
It can't suck if you never use it 
---
But seriously bethesda why can't any gun with high ammo do any damage 
---
You looking to sell and for how much dm me if you want to sell
---
At the moment, bc of how Damage Resistance/ Armor works in the game, Low Damage/ High ROF weapons are garbage.
---
Hopefully this changes in the future, but optimizing your Armor Penetration will help for now.
---
That said, an Anti-Armor .50 Cal is the only real viable Machine gun in the current meta.
---
The problem is that their design goals are pretty muddy.  It’s hard to tell what kind of game it’s supposed to be.  I get that it’s experimental, but it’s rapidly moving towards a game nobody wants to play.
---
Im a fan of that old (civil war era?) minigun in the game, definitely killed a number of schorchbeasts with it.
---
Lmfao it's incredibly apparent from your comment history that you're a massive fanboy, did you forget that your comments are publicaly visible? Any criticism for this bottle of Todd Howard's vomit has you frothing at the mouth and ranting about "rage masturbation". It's funny you mention fragile egos, because being unable to accept criticisms is the perfect indicator of just that. If you still enjoy the game even though it's objectively a broken piece of shit, then that's fine. That doesn't mean everyone else is going to keep quiet about all the stupid shit Bethesda does. If you're so petulant and childish that you can't stand seeing criticism for something you like, then you should probably stay away from the internet. Have a good day, you better get to work on patching the game before Todd catches you on reddit again. 
---
You have my support!
---
Some stores are giving it away for free with a purchase
---
This. I was able to complete Waste Not twice a couple weeks ago and I haven't been able to get it to start again ever since, no matter how many times I visit the terminal. I've had other dailies that I couldn't even start once, let alone on multiple days.
---
No shit wonder boy.  Its like i never thought about wearing my x-01 pa having my weapons and armor repaired to 200 and 160 percent.  Putting 9 points into rifle man and 5 into demolition.  Let alone use the perks to keep my weapons and gear from breaking.  You're a fucking moron.
---
I just want the world to see this good ol' chap twistin' with the ladies on the dancefloor
---
It's really sad that navigating through the myriad of glitches requires absolutely random bizarre fixes like this. I really wish this game was playable on launch. I keep coming here to see if it's gotten better but it just seems like it's gotten worse. I feel so guilty that my friend bought this game for me.
---
Umm... I appreciate the effort and all but you know not factoring in charisma pretty much makes this useless to most people?
---
So what's the price for people with only 1 Charisma? What about 10 Charisma with a couple of legendary + charisma effects and have drunk some Ash Rose tea?
---
Every card that has a non-combat use needs a combat secondary.
---
Can you explain that to me?  How can you do that damage?  I have a bloodied Grognak and I think it maxed out at 346 or some shit.  I have maxed all 3 slugger.  No mutations.  It just boggles my mind that I'm playing as a melee, reading people say it should be nerfed and I'm at a 3rd of the damage of people that don't even use it.  Somebody told me about unyielding armor?  I haven't seen a single piece of it.  Man I suck
---
I wish I had an X-01 suit about now! I haven't done much of the main storyline. Still on Rose, but I'll get there!
---
Hopefully they get it fixed soon.
---
Ha! Oh man I'm so jealous. I want to test it out! 
---
If you like Fallout 4 you'll like 76
---
The neighborhood is pretty rough, but damn those amenities inside the hotel are nice. Plus their security is top notch. 
---
LOL!, it has made a comeback in a big big way.  BGS abused the trust and good will of its core fan base, and they will see the two headed ghoul chickens come home to roost.  
---
I thank Bethesda, EA, Activision and others for giving me a guide to live by when choosing games from now on.
---
I will never buy a game from ANY publisher that:
---
Incorporates MACRO transactions into a full price game.  They make/have too much money if they believe 1/3 of a games price is a micro transaction.
---
Uses predatory loot box gambling mechanics.
---
Releases half finished games and/or has a track record of not fixing bugs in their code they have had DECADES to correct.
---
PLEASE ADD ANYTHING YOU BELIEVE I MISSED THAT SHOULD BE ADDED
---
Ha why 5
---
Was more likely some dude sniping with crit/sneak gauss rifle from a mile away.
---
And hope they didn't reintroduce the mod scrapping when crafting bug. They were the good days... Well, not quite.
---
I miss the fun affixes from FO4 like ice/plasma/burning.  The FO76 affixes are mostly boring crap now.  30% damage to one enemy type is just pathetic.
---
It was the opposite for me before. I was melee specced, but my 2 shot explosive shotgun was my go to when the shit hit the fan.
---
Ya it would be cool if it went up to 80% or more  like bloodied
---
You guys need to stop downing on our meele builds. Pretty soon everything's gonna be nerfed to shit. 
---
A little more to this, if you liked FO4 survival mode it is mostly the same game, except you can fast travel here. 
---
Yeah weird.  Considering that was before the patch you fucking idiot.
---
Keep it up mate!  I'm sure there are plenty of people who appreciate it but don't take the time to type it out.
---
Didn’t know your base Charisma affected prices, for reference this is with a base of 4 charisma.
---
I'm pretty sure this person is a paid shill or straight up dumb, look at their post history.
---
That sucks OP, that's my biggest fear as well.
---
Sometimes when I get range-attack spammed by scorchbeasts while I'm inside a building I feel like shooting myself too
---
[Let's twist again!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eh8eb_ACLl8)
---
The loss of stabilised is a huge deal you will need it for queen at least!
---
Thanks for the offer. Probably just buy a digital download code. 
---
It just happened  to me.
---
As soon and I entered the nuke zone my health and rads healed. I even got out of my PA to get rads up. Soon as I got back in the PA rads healed. It did give me rads out of my PA though. 
---
Oh, that's really cool... where's that?
---
Didn't have bloody one so no idea how it will help, but stabilized is a noticeable damage increase against enemies. Of course for a gatling gun the difference will be 5 or 6 shots with or without the perk so if this is the only heavy you will use you should be good without it. 
---
I've seen this too, especially with turrets, they seem to have incendiary ammo now...
---
Hell yeah.
---
Currently farming the X01 suit. Built a new camp this weekend as well.
---
It tags a lot of enemies at once with the lightning arc
---
I felt underwhelmed by the black powder shop to be honest.
---
Ya honestly sential/cavalier will be the next nurf most likely. Its got a the same things going as tse manly game breakingly good and heavily dupe. I wouldnt be surprised it it got nurfed to 8% under the reasoning of thats what assassins is even to it have more condition required to makenit work.
---
If the topic is truly relevant enough, up or down votes will bring it to light.
---
Yeah but the bar is nice.
---
Delete post and crouch. If they can't see us they can't nerf us.
---
Almost like there were two problems and for now only one is fixed. 
---
That's what I got today.
---
 Unfortunately, that's all I got.
---
Let's see a pic of the outfit, I want to know what all the fuss is about
---
Why ?
---
Go eat a dick.  Then gag it back up then shove it back down your throat.
---
"  I fought the Claw and the Null won."
---
It is possible if you have a workshop or were grouped with someone.
---
I’ve never had one drop in a couple hundred hours, so that’s not really useful.
---
It is a very good game. Consider that only a minority is very vocal. There are players that raced towards leveling, end content and OP gear. They broke their game. 
---
There is months of exploring, questing, building, refining, and re-exploring content. The  bugs are not that bad. It is one of the best games in the Fallout series
---
Yes, I experience this.
---
No 
---
1 Fix bugs.
---
2 Add content.
---
3 Add mmo/fortnight bullshit like dance moves.
---
*if you only enjoyed FO4 assets then you'll like this.
---
Gameplay is entirely different.
---
I say, it depends on what you liked about 4.  If you like elaborate faction wars, making big choices, and arguing philosophy with NPCs, you're probably going to be disappointed in 76.
---
But if you enjoy the core gameplay of 4, the loot-and-shoot aimless exploration, you'll probably like it.
---
But the MoM dress has actual stats like armor and such doesn't it? Though good to hear it's not happening to all the outfits i suppose.
---
If you want a chance to get the 76 experience without purchasing the title simple head to the bathroom, mold your hand into the shape of a penis, and jam it up your own arse. 
---
Afterwards give yourself a stinky Sanchez and go throw 80 bucks at a crackhead on the corner...
---
Explosives were not the issue as much as duping was. 
---
If you're running heavy weapons and power armor and don't have stabilized, you're gonna have a bad time.
---
Coders aren't animators.
---
Can't agree with this enough.
---
I think most people feeling a lot of disappointment are playing this game a **LOT**! All the while expecting the game to be set up to take that much play time and that much end game grinding. That fact is, the game isn't all there yet... and we've been told this.
---
But they spent 20 hours **server hopping** for a plan, or 50 hours Scorchbeast Queen farming... They relied on broken mechanics to get the best in game content, and they're now mad all of that went to nothing with a couple of nerfs and an update on attaining plans.
---
I get it... I'd be mad if I spent all that time too... But Bethesda billed this as a learning process, if something feels ridiculous to attain, **don't** spend your time doing it because the economy/end game isn't even close to balanced yet.
---
I noticed ionised meat doesn't decay. Not as easy to acquire but it's always there when I need it!
---
Melee in FPS games is so boresome. They ruined the game when they made guns ticke enemies while melee can one shot everything.
---
Dammit, I've put alot of effort/caps into this build. I'll be pissed if I have to change it all up. 
---
How long do they get to do that for tho
---
Thanks for the heads-up. I think you are right; I saw it for sale once at the Production area vendor, but haven’t seen it on subsequent visits.
---
i did not own a workshop on that server, and wasn't on a group
---
I'll be happy to build one for you. You on xbl?
---
It does have some stats, the rest are supposed to be cosmetic and work like any other decorative clothing
---
Yup. Never saw it before this patch, happened twice while fighting legendaries yesterday. 
---
Same. I did a SBQ last night and it didn't happen so hopefully this isn't a constant thing. 
---
10/10 much bawk
---
Well that's just another thing they fucked up I guess yay
---
&gt; But. GUYS. They can't even figure out how to manage the basics of the game
---
That's hilarious tbh.
---
Ive done 2 today and was ok. 
---
Did you not read his first sentence?
---
Here's a power armour bug I discovered recently. Only the X-01 seems to have the "Recon Sensors" mod available for the helmet which feels like a bug in itself. It should provide a compass pip for any enemies spotted while aiming down sights regardless of the weapon. Unfortunately, it doesn't do that or the range is so small as to make the effect pointless. Why aim down sights for this effect if they're so close you could spit on them? You wouldn't. The point of having this effect is that recon scoped weapons lose the compass pip if you switch weapons. This helmet mod would keep them there although it's arguable how useful the compass is since it still hasn't been fixed 3 months later.
---
This is the new content. Bethesda is giving you a reason to grind. "Grind or you die!" Todd Howard was quoted as saying. "We've perfected our game design into the perfect loop."
---
 Rumours haven't that the next content drop will be a monthly subscription to NOT play the game. You'll not only have to pay to uninstall the game, you'll have to pay to stop the game from self-launching.
---
Lol don't ask questions like that some nerd will downvote you and say "it's called balance"
---
But an answer to that problem is probably the Gatling gun I find it does decent damage with a high ammo count
---
would be cool, but first they should fix the game
---
i have no idea how people are getting all these glitches and stuff my games been perfectly fine apart from a couple disconnects
---
Nerf Melee. . . .getting one shot is hardly fun for anyone other than the person chasing away the player base.
---
Only sharks get that ability
---
The number might not even be representative of shots/minute but just some crazy internal scale.
---
Because a high level person was recently there before you.  They spawned those enemies.
---
You can avoid this by sticking to areas where the upper limit is to your liking, or check your map for high level players near places you want to go, to avoid them.  Or server hop to roll the dice on better spawns.
---
I think i want to get back with my ex bf tbh
---
You can also do it at a chem station with dogwood and coal. I have a camp thats right by both, so i get my fill fairly often.
---
It’s not that bad as people say personally I was extremely disappointed with 4 and preferred this it isn’t comparable to 3/NV like you see many people say they wish it was that or those however you want to put it, the bugs did piss me off but it wasn’t enough to make me say fuck this game I wasted 60 dollars, it definitely gave me my money’s worth.
---
Lol no it was absolutely after I spent 20 min do I unloading the patch. I won't swear at you though. Anyways did it again last night and the night before too but whatever, have fun being an angry little elf buddy.
---
No shit. 
---
Bethesda shouldn't be adding junk to the Atom Store while the game is in such a shitty state. 
---
Grognak’s Axe FTW
---
There is a watoga state park and the county that it's in has a population of under 9000 people. It's not really a city
---
 this happened to me when I traded for a bloodied rifle.  Every time I had it on me it nerfed everything, including landmines.  Put I back in my stash and everything went back to normal.
---
Check your weapons to make sure you don’t have one that is causing the issue. 
---
Because every update theirs a new problem to deal with and it's not the actual game its self I like the concept of the game but craft weapons and freeze in the game or constantly be stuck in the work benches  or have to shut the game down 3 times consecutively because it freezes or glitches just so frustrating to play a game that you actually cant play because of the poor server it is running off of if that's what the problem is, no one does know what the actual problem is because the problem still persist or what about the duping that still happens in the game people are still doing it the market sucks and the only thing Bethesda is worried about is whether or not Bobby pins should be .010 or .001 like seriously so many bigger concerns then Bobby pins and junk/bulk scrapping try to spend some money on the actual software and how the game should be performing every other multiplayer game out their can handle it l but not fallout 76 everyone has to deal with spending more time in the loading screen then actually playing the game if it were my choice I'd ask for my money back and i played till lvl 172
---
There's not enough game in Fo76 and it's a buggy shitfest.
---
I'd rather see the weight reduction perks all removed and have all weapons' weight redone. When so much of the game revolves around what you can carry and store it feels an anti-fun mechanic.
---
If you wear power armour then there's no hope right now. However, if you are one of the rare people who don't use power armour there is a perk on some armour that reduces \*all\* weapon weights by 20%. I know it isn't great but it's all we have right now.
---
If you ignore the complaining and play to have fun with friends then it's no so bad
---
They delete abusive comments, constructive criticism is accepted
---
Bobble head stacking
---
I really like 76. Imagine Fallout 4 with almost no NPCs, and that will give you a decent idea of what 76 is. Most of the "bugs" that have everyone complaining either don't bother me at all, or only a little. The only real gripe I have with the game is that I occasionally getting kicked off the server when I am in the middle of a long quest. You can't just rejoin the same server you were on previously, either... Other than that, I have no big complaints. I am still having a good time after about 150 hours of gameplay.
---
As a side note- paid $40 for the game, and came in without extremely high expectations.
---
Not to excuse their behavior, but why the hell were you carrying 100 stable flux? 
---
Animators and coders can work on the game independently of each other.
---
It’s not that they rushed it, they are making actual mistakes and some poor decisions.  Nothing to do with when it was released.
---
Yes avoid it until you start hearing only positive news.  I have faith they will fix it in time. But for now, your time and money can be better spent on something other than this.
---
You're the one taking it too seriously if you think someone is going to pay for a second copy of the game they're not going to use just to prove something you're not willing to.
---
I love getting my weight reduction perks! The only thing that bothers me about them is they dont work for your characters stash. Definitely hope that gets addressed in the future 
---
I run a bloodied explosive Gatling. :)
---
You can go without Stabilized but that 15% armor penetration is really useful. The battle with heavy guns is trying to maximize that tiny per-shot damage to get over armored targets. It's pretty nice that you can just go buy Emergency Protocols plans from Phoenix now.
---
The Gatling has pretty beefy per-shot damage especially combined with bloody and explosive. Slap Martial Artist on there and you have a very usable heavy that can also work just fine without the armor penetration on most stuff (grounded SB, Gutsy, etc). Ammo is pretty free if you stick to Super Mutants at NAR and the Steakhouse - use the Gatling kind of like a semi auto rifle and that (at least) +100 x 5mm ammo drop from minigun mutants really starts to build up. If you feel like goofing off you can shoot the minigun out of their hand and the next mutant that picks it up will also have 100 x 5mm.
---
_I think_ that One Gun Army should actually be avoided. It doesn't work nearly as well as Enforcer or Tormentor for some reason (in my experience).
---
Wish they did this for x01 , currently looking for a jet pack so if anybody has one Xbox over here 
---
No clue why they threw so much of Fallout 4's weapon balance out the window with this game.
---
Even Explosive guns in Fallout 4 were fairly balanced.
---
Maybe make it so you can only use prewar money to play. 
---
Its not an actual city irl
---
Doesn't unequip, but getting the same glitch with the SS as with the hunters long coat - its tattering and showing my underarmor
---
Yep Aussie PS4 servers always seem full. Always seeing new faces and getting visitors to my camp.
---
They have them. They exist. If I ever find Birch Bark I’ll craft one
---
This is the most accurate assessment. People who say “if you liked FO4 then you’ll like FO76” are just dead wrong. The isn’t a single NPC in the entire game. The story is much less prevalent and is told in a much less dynamic way. If you like aimlessly looking exploring and the looter shooter aspects in FO4 then you might like 76.
---
Thank you very much for sharing. He's spot on and fully understands the issues.
---
Subbed and looking forward to his other stuff. :)
---
Real-life Lindy Hop dancer/teacher here:  Fallout is the whole reason I got into jazz and swing music, then by almost logical progression became obsessed with the dance styles of that era. I never quite know what timeline Fallout is specifically using as a backdrop as lot of the music spans the 20s-50s. There were lots of popular dances back then though, people still dance them today even. Many flavours of the original Charleston and a lot of solo jazz/tap derivations. People haven't seen a lot of this stuff in the mainstream for half a century: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BI9qWXRxr-E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BI9qWXRxr-E)
---
Have you tried turning it off and on again?
---
So armor pen seems to be the consensus. I can make up for it a bit with syringer, but it kinda sucks heavy class forces you to use pa though. Maybe ill do a mix of both for when I want to pvp.
---
Well, "need" is a strong word when you already have bloodied. I'd want Stabilized just for the accuracy though. 
---
Not sure why you'd do the non-PA version anyway unless you didn't like PA or had a pile of spare Sentinel pieces.
---
So unyielding is huge for melee because of all the strength with a full set and 15 base strength youll have 30 so that will give you 15% more assuming you have max strength already. Next thing is bloodied mess and nerd rage  which are both multiplicative out side of slugger, rifle men or whatever relavent damage card. What that mean is that the boost your all you other card as well as base damage so for example slugger 3 at 20% will become 22% with nerd rage right now nerd rage is better then demo expert even though demo expert is 60% and nerd rage 20% because of this. Also mutations is big adrenal reaction is a must have with a bloodied build not sure the max damage increase but its alot and for melee you should have twisted muscle another 25% and if your using a punching weapon then talons gets you another 25% not sure how the mutations are add into the equation but my hunch is that there like bloodied mess and nerd rage. Oh and i forgot adrenaline in agility is a great card for hord cause you can get another 60% from it defanitly a good card to run 60% for 5 points yes thank you.
---
I have yet to see either 2 shot or explosive
---
yeah, it is still broken for me.  I got all of the items to show up once immediately after the patch.  I am also suspicious of the items in the atom store being correlated to the floating player head and hands. 
---
Fallout 76 wasn’t rushed, there’s zero reason to think it would be in a better place now if they hadn’t released it.  They just made some poor design decisions and development mistakes.
---
They wouldn’t have magically become more capable if they didn’t release when they did.
---
Yeah that's pretty insane. I carry about 10 heavy guns and they weight about 1-2 pounds each.   It's pretty insane that you can't do that with rifles. 
---
Yes i have this also, 2x handmade and only displays one on the favorites wheel
---
Lots of times when I spawn in, I instantly die upon logging onto the server and have to go recover my junk 😭
---
That’s not how accounting works.
---
The largest purifier only holds 5. Honestly though even if you're only periodically checking it you will still end up swimming in more water than you will know what to do with.
---
What tone most of them think there better and every one else’s hates Bethesda any way and think the devs are stupid/incompetent we all know this but why waste time fixing fallout cut the middle Man and just get together and make there own open world game 
---
Sweet Rolls stack with Grape Mentats and charisma drinks. 
---
Where do you get that hat I need it
---
That's pretty amazing.
---
I think it's way better than 4
---
Put all of your non-essential Holotapes in your Stash and try again.
---
There is a bug where if you have too many Holotapes, you simply can't load them into a terminal.
---
I'll say...
---
Yeeaaah, I'm still hard core specced for rifles, and I pick up a super sledge and the game is EZ button compared to using the rifles.  Something ain't right.
---
Thank you for all this info shots per 10 secs would explain a lot of my confusion maybe the gatling is just bugged
---
Shit forgot key card 
---
I agree, I’m just glad the one they chose to withhold was the end-game suit, not the introductory. Just wouldn’t been fair to the new players. But if you’re looking try posting in r/fo76bazaar
---
They had technical reasons for it.  Presumably shared infrastructure that needed to be changed in some way.
---
I have found this problem when crafting, if you are holding some of the mats on you and some in your stash you cannot craft or repair, put everything in your stash and it will work!
---
From my experience that issue has always been a problem with anything at camp mclaron.  Sometimes I walk a low level character there and it starts recruitment blues with 90% of the quest stages completed even when they have never been to the BoS base. I also had similar issues with the military I’d portion of recruitment blues.
---
Ok so I either found it in the Pumpkin house in The Mire (North East on the map) or the watchtower that is nearest to it, its called Halloween Witches Hat
---
It's almost like all these big company's,bgs,ea,blizzard,Gillette,have money bet against themselves like they are throwing the fight. purposely sabotaging there own legacy for a quick buck
---
And they're usually not even worth the caps or scrap! 20-40lb miniguns and missle launchers often sell for less than one or two pieces of armor or a single rifle. In recent sessions I've found zero benefit to even picking up a heavy. How fun :) 
---
If you think FO4 was fun. You will think that this game is fun.
---
If you hated FO4, you will not like this game
---
I am aware. I'm not suggesting they cannot, I am suggesting that Bethesda needs to fix the foundations of their house before sending out party invites.
---
It’s s fun video game.
---
Not just the red, I have just the plain bright mod on my X-01 and its marked as an atom store exclusive 
---
Hmm...  
---
I've found my lack of stash storage is pretty much OP and game breaking.  I've been able to one-shot stuff all day long with Lack of Stash Storage.  Plus the other day I was minding my own business not PVP'ing and some guy runs up to me and 1 shots me with his Lack of Stash Storage.   Something has to be done.  Hope Beth doesn't see this and gives us more storage...
---
They said DLC would be free.
---
The game being playable isn't enough when there isn't content that is fun to repeat.
---
What the hell are you on where Fallout76 is a "very good game". I mean Jesus Christ you don't have any standards huh.
---
They have nothing in life.
---
Really?? Would you be able to paint mine? I can pay caps and supply mats. Are you on PC?
---
&gt; If you are still playing the game and still on this subreddit there is a sense of loyality to the Fallout franchise. 
---
Loyalty to Bethesda even though it wasn't even developed by the studio in Maryland.
---
The Fallout franchise already has bad apples and another one shouldn't surprise anyone.
---
Unlike what someone else said in this thread. It is not a very good game but it is enjoyable. The bugs are terrible and prepare to be disconnected, sometimes a lot. I didn't rush and enjoyed the game. probably put in 60 hours, launched my first nuke at level 87 and found no reason to play again because the end game is terrible. Worst of all is how Bethesda is handling updates and not fixing things.
---
I say wait. I got no mans sky after their first major update last year and couldn't understand the hate early buyers had. I say wait until 76 gets that update. You will probably enjoy it now but you will probably also be on this sub in a month or 2 typing a message similar to mine.
---
Well they are implemented as a opportunity cost to damage or resistance perks while levelling why would they change that?
---
Wait for at least a year this game is a broken mess.
---
We're you listening to Hunters/hunted radio? They just added that feature.
---
Np, I'm lazy but I do what I can.
---
PA.
---
1. Stabilzer is too good.
---
2. Emergency Protocol  + Power Armor's hidden resists + Rad Resist &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Normal Armor, even a full set of Bolstering/Sentinel.
---
I wouldn't be too quick to blame yourself. People have been reporting a lot about items mysteriously disappearing.
---
Cultist
---
I have adrenaline reaction a full unyielding bloodied mess nerd rage and adrenalin that every thing the affect my melee damage
---
Could you elaborate?  
---
Like do you not get the Pip when using iron sight?
---

---
Duping is. Not was.
---
They both good games for different reasons, FO76 seems to be getting worse and worse with each patch instead of better and better. Its still a fun game, but it is also frustrating at the same time, I would say 50% of the game is cool, has neat mechanics and fun to play. The other 50% is frustrating as heck, limited stash, nerfed weapons, poorly designed, bad decisions by people who don't play the game.
---
If you can get it at a reasonable price $20 or less, go for it, it is worth it, else wait a while, I am still hoping it gets better over time. 
---
You will be way less frustrated with FO4 which is an amazing game, but if you have played it, you might want to give Fo76 a try, it's a refreshing change from FO4.
---
I was looking into NMS as well! How is that? (Would be for the PS4 PRO)
---
How about the ol timey "put up yer dukes" emote lol
---
I had diconnects while crafting and repairing both weapons and power armor and never lost anything. I have been playing since launch.
---
I am sorry  but the amount of misinformation on this sub made me question any topic like this without proof.
---
Source? I can't see any info on that on Bethesda's website.
---
Thank you, it turned out quite well, although I had to fight the build system at every turn, lol
---
I'm convinced of this. I'm waiting for that day we all have a new 45gb download and the real game drops. 
---
Don’t forget to add booze and have the double alcohol effects card, bonus points for double luck while drunk for more crits 
---
Yeah, missed out on two SBQ loots from this. Not the only ones, just the most aggravating. 
---
Cause they keep dropping and dont weigh to much.  Easier to go fix them all at once then 1 at a time 
---
Yeah my stealth char is broke but that's OK, It was the bobby pin weight that made me quit. /s
---
I haven't quit I'm taking a break although I did uninstall to let them know.
---
That has nothing to do with Fallout76 being a broken lazy cash grab. Hard to believe anyone defending this turd isn't a paid shill.
---
There's one as static loot in Berkeley Springs Northside of town on the roof. 
---
Where I the bos jumpsuit located? I don't see it stated anywhere.
---
Long story but I usually have that level, plus 14 bulk of most of the PA related materials..  
---
When I run into new players, I usually have a chat with them, and if they are legit new (or newbie, there is a different) I'll upgrade their PowerArmor with what I can (I can do 'Shocks for all but X-01, and most other desired mods) or Armor with the best I have available.  
---
Fun to do on the fly, and generally a pain to always have to run to a stash box to make it happen. 
---
For the last 200 levels I generally only die when I'm either not paying close enough attention or a glitch, more commonly the glitch
---
It sure pissed me off when it happened last week. I don't want anything to do with any bullshit PVP. I want PVE only.
---
Yes. There's a solon in Berkley Springs. Head up the fire escape around back and you'll find it up on the roof. Drops about 80% of the time. 
---
I just started using this.  It weighs nothing and wrecks everything.  Good combo.  My solo tambo is more powerful than an entire squad of minigun and laser weilding BOS soldiers.
---
I was gonna make a thread about this ..def seen a few threads ppl asking for the jumpsuit 
---
I like how everything was evil except for the porn computer
---
As for the PA portion, I'll have to explore that one, not noticed it before
---
It's 8€, just get it and treat it like yet another early access indie survival sandbox.
---
With that idea in mind and price tag it's quite enjoyable.
---
Dats pretty cute.
---
The problem is they released the game too early by following the After Implementation Design System (A.I.D.S).
---
Also, if you're between level 15-20 you can pick up the plans at Harper's Ferry. 
---
If they nerf anything else, we might as well just all walk around with pool noodles as weapons. I still think the better option would be to just make anyone and their camp completely immune to all PVP damage if they are in pacifist mode. 
---
I launched the nuke, but got disconnected from server when bomb hitted ground. You at least fought the Queen... not everyone are so lucky.
---
No one talking about the still sane ghouls who were killed by the other group of survivors?
---
Wow nice work! Love the details and thoughtfulness of the board meeting table, very important when your are evil
---
Naw, door gunner in a Vertibird.
---
They've updated this last patch, so it's different now. You can get the plan for it at any level since the last patch
---
Ok Melee boy. Lets nerf the furious perk along with melee. Then we are even, and no one has fun 
---
Play AS a Super Mutant?! . . . . . SIGN ME UP!
---
Get that. I haven't played it but it has far more time to be polished. This game needs a few years before it gets its poo together.
---
Ok cool
---
This. Also, Eagel Eyes serum will come in handy, cuz it's dark af in the mire
---
I'm surprised Sony let them publish this dumpster fire on Playstation to be honest. They tend to have stricter standards, and then you had Pete and Todd bashing Sony for not allowing cross-platform play.
---
As if this broken game could possibly support cross-platform play.
---
But can other people loot your stuff from the containers? If they go to stash box it will say "my stash", so do the containers carry on the same? 
---
Maybe it's because it became a player-owned container by landing in the area of a player camp? I'm not sure. 
---
I'll be damned. It's probaby super taxed though, yeah?
---
This is a ridiculous claim. No legendary effect should provide a 3x boost to damage. Explosive was clearly a problem, duping just made it Really obvious that it was a problem. 
---
I can. But I don't know if it will take in updates that way. 
---
There is enemy scaling, but remember that you basically cap out at level 50.  Doesn’t matter if you are 100 levels higher, you are technically never more than 49 levels higher from a power standpoint.
---
After level 50, you should be one-shotting most enemies 20 or below.  The Mirelurk Queen is a bad example since it’s a high-tide mob like a Behemoth, it’s always going to be more powerful than its level suggests.
---
Level is just a number.
---
I know a lot of people complain about the ability to replay this game like the other Fallout games but I started my second character and because there are no NPCs to spoon feed you info I missed a few things on character 1.
---
I also find knowing what happens later on in the game makes some of the holotapes and notes early on in the game make more sense.
---
Anyhow big fan of the story telling in FO76.
---
You should leave it, how these people think its good is beyond me. Liking fallout 4 has little bearing on liking 76.
---
Its still broken, even if everything worked its so lacking in interesting content there's no real reason to play. There are a handful of quests most tied to the main arc and then a ton of repeatable dull daily ones. Events can be OK I guess. 
---
 I like the Duster myself:
---
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eI2RZec5QDyzUU7v0mjtrkNt8x1k5dWP/view
---
I don’t disagree about the state of the game. I wish Bethesda would be more up front about the HUD glitch specifically, because I think there are a LOT of people who are getting it but don’t know why. A Redditor made a very detailed post on this glitch a while back, and reading it likely saved me from rage quitting a while back.
---
&gt;quite a bit
---
You mean 9 (or 30% chance for 14) per 10 acid, 5 oil, and 2 steel?
---
Yeah, no.
---
That is not "quite a bit" no matter how you cut it.
---
Doesn't help that with perfect rolls on legendary items you can run around with +21 strength, just from your gear. 
---
You find him and his dog at the Freak Show....
---
Killer. This keeps the hope alive!  Congrats, duder. 
---
If they go to the stash, it's their stash instead of yours. If you put stuff in your stash, other players can't access it, period. 
---
Hunter/Hunted has existed since the B.E.T.A.
---
They just added a new callout to encourage people to use it.
---
Yeah but the Rotating Refresh Sign is 1800 caps in the Atomic Shop, so...
---
Great Idea, helps with getting around the map.
---
However they need to sort out the rest of the shitshow first. I love the game, but it's bug city at the moment. Everything they change breaks 10 other things. Doesn't seem to be much done about these bugs either.
---
No perk (reduce core usage).  No vats, I’m melee fighting supermutants and can ohk.
---
What setup allows a standard melee weapon to one-shot a Mirelurk Queen?  You talk like any melee character will do it but that’s absolutely not true.
---
There is a white springs train station that has a vendor
---
Listed on the Spreadsheet.
---
It costs a couple grand, but not as much as the calibrated shocks plans.
---
Scrap the junk immediately after scrapping the head
---
You give me hope that someday I can get past level 22 if I only play a few hours all year long. 😀
---
That was not clear.
---
Unless BGS still hasn’t added items?

---
Supposedly if you stack rad x, radshield, and trapper armor plus the rad perk you're able to go in a nuke zone without a hazmat or PA
---
Thanks. I'll give that a try.
---
Because it’s a matter of dropping into the menu, equipping them, using them, then dropping back into menu, and requiring my regular works.  Quite a few perks do not impact anything other than themselves (eg lockpicking).  So it’s not like crafting and durability.
---
I have one in stock. I was just curious about the vendors price change.  Good to know I can still get a decent resale value for it. Thanks!
---
The game is 2 months of patch fixes away from being in a state where it can be released. I've been saying this since launch. 
---
Its 50$ here still tho bro. :/
---
&gt;It is a very good game.
---
You don't have to lie. Just tell OP what you're able to enjoy instead so he can judge for himself if that's enough reason to still buy the game.
---
There are 9 bunkers at black mountain ordinance, I assume with future content more will be added.
---
think i paid 1700 caps for it :)
---
Lol....cloak spell.
---
Nice one.
---
I enjoy stumbling across other player CAMPS where they incorporate objects from the world.
---
I always stop to take a selfie in their CAMP.
---
Couldn’t find any LATAM or Global version in there. Do you know  region works here? 
---
A high strength level what's furious are bloody melee weapon well do exceptional damage. My bloody ax plus adrenaline mutation with about 83 HP full rad will kill just about anybody with one swing that's not to say it needs to be nerfed that's utilizing the bonus skills
---
Lol, not a stupid question, but yes, of course 😆
---
Can only learn mods from plans
---
Gotta watch out for those explosive melee weapons, folks.
---
And slippers you tap together for free fast travel.
---
Good for you but you probably have low expectations or you only played for few hours. It's not about minor bugs, it's about a ton of bugs, servers instability, lack of content and overall, patches that don't go in the right direction.
---
My final words : you can't blame people for disliking the game but hey, I can't blame you for liking it, it does some things right.
---
No, I know it's a mod, but it doesn't show up as an available mod to craft in my lever action rifle upgrade menu. Do you think I just got a glitch?
---
Hey sorry I was speaking based off a youtube thumbnail that was talking about the blaster. I checked out the video and you are right no aliens just the ammo. Sorry I was mistaken
---
It's a bug. Happened to me last night after I had to pick the lock on a supply drop that landed in the New Appalachian Cen. Train Yard. Gave the me "You have been caught lockpicking etc etc" notice and I suddenly had a 10 cap bounty. Annoying. 
---
Exactly. My original ps4 runs well unless so many people fighting sbq make it explode. Ide wait till march. Should be new stuff by then
---
Imo Karma is how you make the PvP servers actually good (along with some other changes ofc, like no seeing players on the map).
---
I'll try this and report back, thanks!
---
Good point, thanks. Could be server shennanigans, but I've caught myself more than once almost scrapping something t wanted to keep. I learned to slow down, be careful, etc.,. but it still happens, and more often than not due to the menu's sometimes strange autosorting. Scrap an item and the menu goes up or goes down in an increment of 1 item. Until it decides to skip multiple items and land on something random.
---
Lol, I feel you :P
---
Can't it be both, because it looks like both... and also more.
---
So, all 3, all 4, all 5, etc.
---
Also dumb question,  but I am guessing you have the base lever plan as well.
---
I feel like the internet needs a compilation video of griefers one-shotting themselves on your power armor
---
I’ve been debating on moving my camp to do the same thing, attaching it to some building, or in your case a boat. Mostly just to save on budget. 
---
I do. I even tried crafting a new one and then modding it, but no such luck.
---
That's good because for the umpteenth time, its all free so people need to stop making it up they have said otherwise. The game will only ever be funded by the atom store, which is why its okay they keep adding to it separately because it funds the game.
---
Except u/LoneVaultWanderer (hope i spelled that right) - a Bethesda employee whose job is to read this subreddit - has indicated he/she is in Australia time. 
---
Does the direction of it also place a roll?
---
Isn’t that a repair cost?
---
Try putting material into your stash. If you have not done that and are carrying the items in had a glitch that would not allow me to craft unless I put into stash 1st
---
Take all your junk out of stash it should work it 
---
I'm convinced they got everyone to pay for this extended BETA while they wait to make it free to play.
---
Why pay for testing when people will pay **you** to test it!
---
You're imagining things...
---
... Hahaha Gary! 
---
They have no idea how to do that.
---
It's only showing you the components you need to make the lowest level of the her pack. I believe you'll need more of the flux.
---
Because that would be logical.
---
Drop it
---
Silly question here but you’ve read the plan right? If you did and it still isn’t showing I’d say it’s the Bethesda Special
---
That would be a HUGE nope....lol
---
Ok. Point is, I think that's what happened to him based on my experience. Source: I gave it a listen so I got killed easily in pacifist mode.
---
You took the words right out of my mouth.
---
Take my upvote
---
Stop laughing everyone, this is all cannon.

Consider there is a huge trend in gaming currently where they release half games only to fix and improve them later. Is it right? Nah but you can't blame Bethesda for following trends which get a pass by the gaming community. If you want a few examples, I can name some off the top of my head: The Division, No Man's Sky, Black Ops 4, and I hear Destiny 2 had this problem as well.  
---
And they will return the favor by keeping your money and not giving a shit
---
Furious sucks Ive tested it with a powerfist, after like 20+ consecutive hits I couldnt even see a noticable difference when I was wailing on a super mutant. Idk if melee perks scale with it but personally I think furious is over hyped
---
From what I found out this has been a bug since the beta of the laucher itself. Plauelged EOS too. 
---
Bethesda can't handle the power of the X apparently. My girlfriend always loaded in faster than me except on rare occasions. I have an X, she just has an S. Makes sense that the most powerful console on the market has worse load times. Perfect sense.
---
R/fallout seemed to have the negative/realistic view, and r/fo76 had the fanboyism and blind positivity... which makes sense if you know how much the tone here is controlled by bethesda/zenimax. This sub was created before the game was announced.
---
I see this Power Smith perk that I only have 1 rank of.  I wonder if I need more ranks of that.  But the UI says I have everything I need.  They need to fix this fricking game.
---
Nah she's kind of ugly well maybe after a few beers
---
ahh shame, didnt have it when u checked. thanks though all
---
What’s with rifleman?
---
If someone's house is too close in vicinity to yours when you try and load in, your house will not show up. You may well already know this but it's the only thing I can think of. Did you try hopping to another server?
---
Not if their not getting instakilled any more. Fair trade off imo
---
if you ever decide to rejoin keep in mind that sometimes your stash isn't loaded until you view the inventory of a container.
---
As for your base itself disappearing it's annoying Bethesda game bullshit and while I don't intend to leave, I respect your decision to get the fuck out before it gets worse.
---
We get it, buddy. It does. 
---
He’s not saying it’s broken. 
---
He’s challenging the design decision, saying extending it to cover both weapons (particularly as one is best of class and one isn’t) is high, whereas the cost of implementation is low. 
---
Furious works wonders for me. Can easily kill Super Mutants, Glowing Ghouls and sometimes Scorchbeasts with a furious Ski Sword
---
Shitty thing is that weapons who can't have a star still occupy the drop table, but hunting rifles can be rolled as a legendary. Had a mirelurk damage one, scorched damage one and some other non interesting roll. 
---
Birch bark is found up in the toxic valley. Grafton mayor goes on about it on the radio. There's an event to find fertilizer to keep the birch trees healthy.
---
Aw fuck, where can I get plans for excavator armour? Or can you craft stuff when you get different perk cards?
---
There’s really to much variation there to go through different charisma levels.  Prices should be pretty close to what he said.  This at least gives everyone a good starting point as to what they’re going for. 
---
This is what worked. Thanks!
---
If they knew what they were doing, they wouldn't be in this mess would they?
---
I don't know what a baseball bat is but I've definitely heard of a swatta
---
Glad to help
---
Yeah i tried server hopping and rebooting a few times but no luck unfortunately 
---
I don't fully understand pay to win in looters shooters though.
---
I mean the whole loop is around farming loot to get better at farming more loot to get better at killing more difficult enemies in PvE and also get better at surviving PvP.
---
When you pay to win what else is left to do? Outside of griefing of course. 
---
Hell I get going in one of my favourite looter shooters at morning just killing the same bosses over and over to get better loot and before I know it 6 hours past. If I had all the best gear there would be no reason to play the game anymore. 
---
Maybe killing people in PvP over and over without much of a challenge with OP gear? That would get boring quick for me.
---
Camden park bot has them all mods and plans 
---
I get that problem all the time while repairing items. I have to get more stuff before I can repair. It looks like you have a surplus though so I don't understand. Do you have the perk on that allows higher power armour mod crafting? (Power Smith Int lev 42). I had one star in it when I made my jet pack. I don't know if you don't need it.
---
Grafton and Camden vendors sell excavator plans but they expensive .. if you got the caps they got the plans
---
I've seen that guy as well. Still not for me.
---
I had this problem yesterday with my Shielded BOS officer suit, try taking all the Flux out of your Stash and carry it on you when youre crafting the Jetpack.
---
I have the suspicion that the game is bugged when trying to use Flux as a crafting object while the MATs are split between the Stash and your Inventory.
---
*"due to player feedback clothes no longer can be sold to vendors"*
---
Have you found out how much the dmg increase is? Or if that constantly stacks after every hit? Cause to me it seemed to barely increase and didnt build over time. Maybe your raw dmg output with perks is doing the trick but Im still trying find the numbers
---
I have had the rotating refresh and invisible attacker issue more since the patch and hotfix than I have ever before. I hate having to jump servers just to get away from some mob that I can't kill because nothing I do makes it visible. 
---
Explains why I haven’t found it. I thought it was in the forest
---
Good psa to some but this was fixed two updates ago
---
I think that it stacks after every hit
---
Dont know why you got downvoted for telling the truth.
---
That's cool! I used to live about 100m south of there, but it was too far from the vendors.
---
 Time lost is the worst. Sorry I couldn't help.
---
I missed it, maybe others did too, hence the PSA. 
---
Not if they don't play PvP. 
---
If duped TSE was ruining your PvP gaming experience you could have traded for an over powered duped set of sentinel/cavalier armor. 
---
The same asshole cheaters who were running around with duped TSE are still running around with bloodied melee builds in duped sentinel/cavalier armor. Nothing changed..... you'll still lose to cheaters who payed 2 win 
---
Thanks all the same! 
---
Insane. I’m done with the game until content is added. Lots of new games coming out soon anyway 
---
I'm surprised that is still effective. How long to get from zero to twenty, would you say?
---
Right in the feels
---
If you get anxiety, that's on you not the person you approached.
---
People don't play games the way you want them to (or me not saying that) just saying so what if they didn't want your blueprints. Its no big deal, it really isn't. 
---
I have found a few excavator mod plans scattered around ash wastes. One spawns at the red rocket filling station. Usually rusty knuckles or motion assisted servos. Ya will need the power armor mod crafting card for some. It doesn't list as a requirement but I figured it out. 
---
I had an explosive two shot, .50 cal machine gun. I was excited until i saw how much ammo it used. Lol
---
\&gt; The 76 economy though meagre at least had a chance before duplication debased the currency. 
---
No, it didn't. and if it did, the TSE weapons aka the one thing that would sell well got nerfed into the dirt so the economy doesn't matter. Plus I think the exploit to steal all of another players items in the trade screen that is STILL in the game has ruined the potental of ever trusting other players.
---
\&gt; Hold on. People who dupe aren’t cheaters because the developers are dealing with them poorly in your opinion? What? You’ve reduced “glitches” and “exploits” to problems. Players who duplicated items cheated and deserve to be banned because they cheated. Players who have duplicated items are not cheaters. 
---
\&gt; A developer’s poor responses don’t justify cheating. You can’t justify cheating just because you think the game is bad. That’s entirely subjective. And when cheating is tantamount to affecting and potentially ruining or negatively affecting another player’s experience then the cheaters obviously deserve a ban. 
---
You're not understanding. The game in it's current state has many brick walls that players must deal with that a large percentage resorted to cheating. In going on 3 months time, Bethesda has done NOTHING to address this and up until the latest patch, they added features that punished people that weren't cheating such as farming nerfs and xp reductions. They now have patched the duplication, made those dupers drop thier stuff (which saves your precious "economy"), and added the weight limit to prevent it happening again. All those things are necessary. The next step for them is to make quality of life improvements to give less of a reason to cheat in the first place. 
---
Instead they have chosen a path of mass banning to literally anyone that hits their criteria for cheating. There are completely legitimate players that are banned because that person they killed for that 10 cap bounty and they accidentally pressed A/X when they first looked at the bag they dropped and picked up 1 million 308 rounds. There are players that are crafting boards for xp and breaking them to do it again that are being banned. Wrap this all up with the new ticket system that gives only 72 hours to try to get unbanned that almost ALL of them are going unread and thats why they are dealing with another lawsuit. I imagine Bethesda is bleeding money in small claims court, even since release.
---
I like the game. A lot actually. So much so that I've put 181 hours in game time. Look at my post history and you will see me defending the game even from the heathens at r/fallout. I agree that these people were cheaters to begin with, but as the game has sat uncared for this long, cheating became normal game play. Those cheaters became normal players. This has been addressed in patches and even made the coveted TSE weapons less appealing bringing a balance. With that they made the "cheaters" suffer by wasting their time which is the best punishment, ask any other major game studio. They still are your customers though and it's much better across the board press wise to have people that stop playing cause of the time waste vs them violently leaving because of a ban for something a majority of the community has benefited in some way from. Then factor in the innocent casualties that are getting banned and requests going unheard and you have a fucked system. All they had to do was not instate the bans.   
---
On a side note, the biggest YouTuber for these exploits has NOT been banned from 76. How the hell is that ok?
---
Bethesda should work on the current status of the game....
---
Currently avoiding the paints because I know myself, once I start I won't stop until all may gear is custom. 
---
Armour, weapons, PA and even clothing. I can't stand only having some items custom and others standard.
---
Sometimes its a bug, sometimes its a feature
---
Can confirm. Just prepare for the scorched and turrets.
---
Cool thanks :)
---
That's really cool, I like building around objects in game too.
---
No problem. If you pick it back up and want help gathering resources to build a new camp, I'd be happy to help.
---
None of my bugs I submitted MONTHS AGO are listed in the known issues thread Bethesda posted. They are most definitely ignoring bug reports. That's clear evidence they are ignoring our reports.
---
We are too proud to lower ourselves to use the weapons of scavengars and raiders
---
yes and no. i'd rather not ask for anything new till this game is spiffed up.
---
I couldn't finish the holotape. It was to sad for me.
---
They should stop working on things nobody asked for....
---
*cough*  survival 
---
Nope, no legendary ultracite gatling lasers, ultracite lasers or enclave plasma rifles. Prime receivers do drop for them though.
---
The line about the tendons in her finger at the end is just heart wrenching.
---
His stuff is awesome. Glad you enjoyed it. 
---
People worked out a while back its tied to player levels 
---
Because whitesprings was a hotzone for nukes, all the high level players kept spawning in high level enemies.
---
Lol frothing at the mouth? Ok buddy. Whatever you need to tell yourself. Doesn't really matter what you think. I never said everyone has to keep quiet. If you actually read my previous comments, you'd notice a pretty obvious trend towards going after people being ridiculously dramatic or spreading bullshit. You're already lowering yourself to looking elsewhere to confirm your bias, and you can't even do that right. Poor guy. You tried. 
---
I want to earn my rewards myself. Not have them handed to me the second I step out and start the game. It’s truly as simple as that. 
---
Fun fact, there's an absolute "basement" that prices can reach.  For instance, no matter what you do, Serum Recipes will never cost less than 17500 (or something like that).  Don't believe me?  Toss on full Unyielding gear and Hard Bargain.  Look at the price.  Now, pop Grape Mentats.  The price will be exactly the same.  (Results may vary, I had in excess of 40+ Charisma when I tried this.)
---
What an absolute god damn tragedy the whole world is. I love it. 
---
Though I take a little issue with the overseer preaching cooperation and rebuilding together. There's no game mechanic for that, lady! Get off my back! Haha.  
---
Is her corpse even anywhere discoverable? or did she find her way into another vault before she bled out and died like every other hero, villain, and schmuck in the playable world?
---
That was f'd up.  Do we know if that's why there are all the missing person reports or was that something else?
---
&gt;if that's what you bought a multiplayer pvp shooter for you fucked up.
---
If you bought this game expecting a multiplayer PvP game ya fucked up even worse
---
There's a catch: you'll take 8-14 rads no matter what. I had 2200 RR and it didn't matter.
---
PA and Hazmat has some sort of hidden flag or multiplier. :\
---
Doesn’t work
---
High level players came before you. The spawned them
---
In the cage getting stabbed with a pitchfork while trying to protect his dog. That was the most heart wrenching to me
---
Ahh that makes sense, think I’ll have to do some server hopping tomorrow! 
---
The Free State ones were other members of the Free States (e.g. The scouting party). 
---
Yeah, had the same problem, same solution. Surprised this bug still hasn't been fixed.
---
It's ok to like the game and think it's fun. But that doesn't make it a very good game. The game bombed. Most people stopped playing it.
---
Ha ha ha. Yeah I have enough 'PvP excitement' in my day job at a corporate and I don't need more after work. Doing repetitive loot farming during the week is my favourite way to unwind.
---
Throw in CAMP building and my week is sorted.
---
Joke's on you, they were using ultracite rounds and Scorched Killer mods, plus they were only level 10 so the mobs were around the same level and got demolished. That's what I'm going to go with anyway. 
---
On a completely different note, a Two Shot Laser Rifle does about 30-35 more damage than my Ultracite Laser Rifle which is one of my favorite pieces in the game. The only downside is the durability - it shattered so quickly that I went back to the Ultracite. If I was ever lucky enough to find a TS Ultracite I'm confident you could push the damage past 120 or so. 
---
the engine is great
---
and modders made all other fallout games great too.
---
the issue is bethesda
---
Enemies spawn at the level of character entering area first and take a while todespawn.
---
White springs is a farming area (best currently), so that’s where high levels go and yeah, your going to have your ass handed to you.
---
I did it at 20ish by going around the left side of the building (from golf course area) and leading the spawns directly back out to the gate where protections would kill them- sometimes me too, so leave junk in stash.
---
Took about an hour since upstairs spawns 2-3 nasty dudes too. Best to just run past to get key card and letthose three kill you.  Sneak back under to get sword, die, then your on your way.
---
Legendary enemies that are at least 1\* always re heal if they fall under 50% health.
---
I have an anti armor ultracite laser. Holding it till future patches Incase it gets useful. Best part is the green laser beam.
---
My two explosive drops (150 lvks) were BOTH bolt-action pipe rifles!
---
Correct, it looks exactly like that and was hand cranked as well. It looks like the only heavy gun in the game that actually like, does damage. When I'm done fucking around with my desired build (probably level 150) I'm going to go full heavy weapons and try it out. 
---
Still having fun. Even bought a second copy for $10 to have an alt account for family and friends to coop with me if they feel like it without them having to invest money in the game.
---
Just server hop it should be there.
---
Fun isn’t allowed in this game. Did no one tell you? /s
---
Yes within minutes I got mines, beats server hoping cost a few caps but meh I make more in a day of game play so we good 
---
Sometimes people will get it first with their own key.  Just server hop and you’ll get it one time.
---
Sounds like a solid plan! I’ll deffo give that a try! Cheers dude
---
Well I get 1-10 in almost an instant..u can get a hazmat suit right away..then go to a few nuke zones u should be at 20 fairly quickly 
---
I have a very hard hitting rad build. 
---
The Handmade punches out at 250DPH tooltip number (bloodied/adrenal/nerd/bloodymess), regular ammo, 75 fire rate (which means about 5 rounds per second), tweaked receiver. 
---
No other automatic rifle seriously challenges that (the combat rifle and 10mm SMG come close.
---
**Except** 
---
For an **energy gun**. 
---
Yes, an energy gun blows its socks off. 
---
Take a 1* bloodied plasma **gun** (not gatling). Strap a flamer conversion mod on it. All the same perks. **Make sure you drop grounded.**
---
Make sure you use the right damage perk for it, it uses rifleman (this’ll prob get fixed). 
---
Don’t bother with the prime receiver. The one that adds extra fire damage **and range** works just fine. 
---
You’re looking at a 300DPH, 91 fire rate weapon with a 300-round magazine, and heaps more range than a flamer or a cryo. 330DPH if you went with the prime. 
---
And because it’s a cone AoE weapon, it’s darn near impossible to miss with it. 
---
This configuration was the single hardest hitting short/medium-range ranged weapon in F4, and is same in F76 except for condition wear. Now that they fixed double-conditioning weapons with weapon artisan (and with the help of the LCK repair perk and potentially carrying a second specimen) it’s the highest damage auto rifle in the game. 
---
Tell me more about underpowered energy weapons. 
---
Business as usual. Had this happen to me three times in a row now.
---
With no NPCs, there are no moral choices to make. The only crime is stealing from another player. 
---
That's just regular porn
---
They are but nothing wrong with tossing ideas out there for future development. 
---
What is the achievement called???? Go ahead and post it here
---
Its where I make my demands to the world leaders before I unlease my doomsday device.... again
---
For sure.
---
I could understand it happening if I retreated and came back minutes later, but healing in between reloading?
---
You call this protest? This is my typical game session. 😈🔪
---
Just sniping mobs other players are attacking? I guess I could do that. Alright cool, good to know!
---
Congratulations.
---
You took the douchiest thing in real life, the creepy clown thing.....
---
And brought it to a video game. 
---
Shittiest protest ever.
---
It's the devlopment cycle, they've talked about it before I don't have any links though for evidence. Basically they will all just focus on one game and ha e maybe a few people plan the Next one. They once that's out they make the next. It's why we don't get a skyrim and fallout at the same time. The point of 76 was to just tide fans over until the development cycle finally came back around to fallout which will be a while now. The same thing happened with fnv, they hired another company to make a filler game just using the same engine and models, only 76 defenitly did not turn out like fnv 
---
Can't join.  Says you're offline. 
---
Send inv to repsycholer 
---
Its because it was another players drop. What happens if you pick lock on a players water purifier? Wanted. So pick the lock on their supply drop and you're wanted. Its pretty simple, you even said yourself it was a drop you didnt request. 
---
I'd also suggest areas around watoga and harpers ferry
---
Always. I just feel the awesome ideas will get drowned out, atm. They should be taking baby steps atm, and fousing on better things..
---
&gt; Why not release paint job packages that cover a variety of guns instead of a single random weapon?   
---
Rhetorical question?
---
That's where you went wrong. BoS only has access to heavy weapons, PA and laser rifle perk trees. And there are no laser rifle perk trees in 76.
---
I'm usually down there off the rip farming stimpaks. Any good activities or areas for low level or just look out for nuke zones down there?
---
Just finished a three hour session. 
---
Also got to help a fresh face level 3, which was good fun. 
---
Dude.. you're literally doing their work for them. If they don't do at least 50% of these for the next patch it proves how fail they are.
---
I got this exact drop at level 50. This was absolutely ground breaking before the nerf. It's still a pretty solid weapon
---
Happened to me multiple times. Bethesda doesn't know anything about multiplayer. It really shows.
---
Glad you didn't get dced. Main reason I quit the game. Too many dcs in silos.
---
Yeah I'd been waiting the whole game to find the .50 cal mod and start Anti-Materialing all over Deathclaw faces. And then...disappointment. 
---
This is already done to some degree. Expanding on that would make the problem for some of us worse. I have a 100+ level character that doesn’t visit a majority of the map. Going to the forest region is pointless. The enemies offer no xp and are a waste of ammo, and that’s because they do not scale.
---
The humor that there is in there seems to be Pre-Bombs or has an edge.  The Syringer that allows you to hear what animals are saying is hilarious until you realize the invention led to the inventors death.  Several instances of automation running amok but then you realize their strict adherence to the rules led to the events at Whitesprings.
---
It can be finicky sometimes, but most of time at the top.
---
I'm working in this build currently but I've leveled to 55 so far using Unarmed. Can't wait to grind out all my perks and give this a spin!
---
Those surrounding areas are pretty tough..I usually server hop harpers for plans..while I do thAt I clear the enemies..decently challenging and pretty fun..also the vendor there has good stuff so while ur there make sure u check what he has each time u server hop 
---
On both my characters I just killed the ghouls I see and I complete the quest really easy
---
First time mentioning a bug, here it is. 
---
The Bohemeth is seriously glitched since the Jan updates. Everytime now, when it's dropped it immediately respots to its original location with no loot available about 75% if the time. Sometimes no XP as well.  On top of that, it is now extra spongy. I train my recruits there, we have all experienced this together, so it is not just my load in. I've reported it, but no response nor ticket issued.
---
Please help.
---
The only way melee one hits big stuff like mirelurk Queens is with a low health bloodied build, in which case the queen can one hit you right back, and has plenty of time to do so while you try to get close enough to attack.
---
Everybody's got a hate boner for melee right now, but it really *should* be stronger. There's a reason pretty much every shooter ever made makes a simple melee bash/punch/knife a one hit kill, where most guns take several hits. Being able to attack from a distance is a huge advantage, and pretty much the only way to balance it is for melee to hit harder.
---
&gt;\&gt; I think even those get murdered or go feral 
---
They're talking about founding the ghoul community in Fallout 3.  Heavily implies that some made it out "alive" to the Capital Wasteland.  
---
Outside nuke zones I just use rad-x diluted because full rad-x suppresses my mutations. I agree it doesn't do much (maybe only blocks 1/3 of what my armor doesn't) but it hasn't been a problem for me.
---
In nuke zones I put on a hazmat suit and hop on a rooftop or something. I get a lot less XP because I don't get to melee all the scored mobs but I still survive the queen fight.
---
If I could change something, it'd be that hazmat suits would only suppress my armor rather than removing it, same as power armor does. It's a pain to find all my good armor pieces again in inventory after a nuke/queen fight, especially if I've collected a lot of other legendaries.
---
"good grief" is a very common saying that can be applied to any situation.  it is not directly saying to go grief and be an asshat to other users. want a cookie for flying with one of the thousands of uses for the phrase?
---
i like how you make assumptions that i and others want to hold hands and sing kumbaya, after i specifically stated i bounty hunted mine...
---
Is wanting Scaly Skin to turn me into Reptile from Mortal Kombat really crazy though?
---
I used that on my attempted solo run, seemed to do very little damage to a lot of the robots, even with barbarian perk, melee power attacks, etc. Only thing that could kill a lot of them relatively quickly was my gatling plasma, but of course that broke after 3 cores.  Everything in there is a needlessly high bullet sponge for no reason other than to inflate the game's play time with a needless amount of difficulty.
---
You could always just do us a favour and leave the sub?
---
If you have nothing constructive to say, which many other people who have issues with this game do, unlike yourself, just leave. 
---
You add no value to the sub.
---
Or live inside the game 24/7.
---
Hahaha! You're my hero ♥️
---
I honestly might not notice if my camp were to be hit. The super mutants next door like wrecking up the place whenever a person fast travels to the nearby train station and triggers their respawn.
---
I still love the game but I'm preoccupied with life and other games like bf1 ( I've been addicted to it)
---
Somebody did something like that early on and I used it.  I think it worked for awhile, then didn't after a patch.  Code is seriously screwed.
---
How were you swindled and cheated?
---
The game itself is fun? But you still feel cheated?
---
Uh, how about no on pushing back the other titles. 
---
I think the vengeful mothman just takes a dislike to some people. I have encountered  him dozens of times now on 2 builds. The first build ate dozens of his eggs, the second ate none but he has harassed both of them.
---
It's all rng ...ie last night was the first time I encountered a behemoth after 200+ hours, I have only ever seen the flatwoods monster once &amp; never encountered the Damn charlston vendor bot but always run into grahm.
---
Water and Fusion Cores.  Like crazy.
---
But many other do. Cool that you play Rambo style, but I have a squad with various player types. Being able to store my riffles to issue out would be gr8.  This is in FO4, just saying it should be easy to have.
---
They did patch this but now it reversed.
---
There are places where the spawn is close to enemies so basically you're in a die-respawn loop.
---
Bethesda: I wish for my fan base to come together and be healthy

Love the cozy little builds. Yet I'm always going full boar max budget huge builds. Did a town an now I have a huge home on top of Seneca Rocks.

My endgame content is getting 3\* marine armor for all slots. I hit level 130 today, still 0/5

I swear, all the marine armor I got had only one useless 1\*
---
Feel free to leave the sub. We don't need you here. Constructive criticism? Sure. Bug reports? Sure. Suggestions on fixing things you're not happy with? Great 
---
But you offer nothing of substance. Just stupidity. There's the door -----}
---
Sneak shots with an Ultracite Rifle with all rifle perks + sneak damage  perks chews through tough enemies quite a bit. The damage isn't phenomenal - I hit about 60 - but ignoring some armor and x2.5 damage at semi auto speed tends to be better than my Anti-Armor Gauss simply because I can lay down so much fire in such a short amount of time without having to reload every few shots. 
---
I agree they need a boost or at least some of their own perks but I'm fairly happy with laser rifles in 76.
---
PA also takes some amount of rads, the only one set up that doesn't seem to have issue is Hazmat. And even that takes something like 1 a second
---
Not even I tried using it once and it didn't even last 30s of constant use, managing to kill only 2/3 SMs without a single proc of Luck of the Draw. Dropped that shit on the spot.
---
Thank you! This was so helpful!! I'm over 150 hours at this point and I have never seen a flatwoods monster or that charleston bot either! 
---
But, ohhhhh man, you should see them take off runnin', though!!! Hooooo-wee! Works every time!
---
(Besides, in case you missed it, the point is there's nothing left for us to do 😏 gotta make the best of it!)
---
&gt; Then I came offline. 
---
TMI ;)
---
Brutal, thanks 
---
For power armor?
---
That’s your perspective and personal definition and your idea of how the game is supposed to be played. If there are mechanics in the game that allow me to play a certain way, you shouldn’t be complaining about me if you don’t like it. Complain to Bethesda for allowing my style of gameplay 
---
Just curious, but can you craft ultracite .45 at the tinker bench?

Yeah it's a thing unfortunately - just a perk of legendary enemies. I'd prefer if they just had higher HP rather than re healing. 
---
I am of the belief that the bugs &amp; glitches are "unexpected side effects of this curious social experiment".
---
Everything in this game is a science experiment.  Everything takes a little trial &amp; error. Not everything works perfectly. And I'm okay with that. 
---
I play this game differently.  It's an open sandbox for me and my wife to goof off, kill crazy enemies &amp; share rewards. 
---
We both have over 500 hours in game.  
---
Wearing the Enclave underarmor with the Hunter's Long Coat will cause a display glitch, too. But it isn't nearly as cool. 
---
The argument I've been making for a while.  
---
We have been providing them these details for months and we've not seen them show up, after the failed attempt to get a response earlier this week I'm calling their bluff and doing what should already exist, a comprehensive bug list, complete and inclusive.

Bought a plan from a vendor today that wasn't marked as known until I tried to learn it. I got a message the plan was already known and then it turned up as known in my inventory after that point.
---
I'll add it to the NPC round up I'll make, thanks!
---
you use them once you no longer have the raw one, it will add another popup att crafting showing what it will destroy to craft it (you will see the bulked thing there)
---
and that is your perspective on a commonly used phrase, not really a personal definition either since it has a stupid amount of uses...
---
where did i complain about your playstyle? all i said was nice job on assuming mine and then i mentioned many other types.
---
complain to the thought police for phases having multiple uses
---
I never really had bad dc issues. Had it happen like 2 times since i started. 
---
Haha, I guess I've been playing it wrong :P
---
Nah. More anarchy, less structure. 
---
I was tricked into a players camp to trade(had it disguised s a store) but in reality it was a death trap. They wanted to try and get junk by either killing players with their traps or collecting the bounties after the victim blasted there way out. I knew what was up the moment it started and logged out the back in. No one at any point got a bounty. Until my team destroyed there camps(both of them). So according to an auto-karma system they would not get any negative karma but my team and I would. There will always be people that operate outside of a structured system. These tend to be the very people the system is meant to reign in. So what ends up happening is the system ends up constructing and punishing people it was meant to support. Perfect example of this is the current wanted system as it applied to the above scenario. My team and myself get bounties for dishing out real justice to players that found loopholes to take advantage of players who may not know what to do in the situation. I not saying I would never support so kind of karma system, but with PvP/Wanted systems being skewed at the moment I'd say those need balancing before a karma system is even considered. That being said it'll probably be in the next update haha
---
Ooh what kind of glitch?
---
I was using rifle until 2 weeks ago. Almost always rifles. I wear 1x %20 ammo weight and 3x%20 weapon weight reduction armor.  Fully modded hunting rifle was only 8-9 lbs. Then I started to use melee, re-build my character and went full fist. I forgot I had those armors for a while and when I saw my melee weapons at 0.6-2lbs range, it was nice. I had to let go some rifles I got and saved few for later just in case. Then tse nerf came. I didn't have any explosive weapons but double shots were nice until then. I'm glad to go melee now. I probably need to get more useful armor now since I no longer need weapon weight reduction. Saved a lot of mods (if I can actually find some)
---
Beautiful. Keep it up.
---
There's really no excuse for the lack of these fixes from the team. Aside from being completely inept.. which I fear may be the case.
---
Through my time playing DayZ I will point out the flaw in a built in Karma system.  
---
In dayZ you started Neutral and became good by killing bad guys or became bad by killing neutrals or good guys  
---
The problem is that when you are neutral and someone who is "good" started to attack you and you killed them, your the bad guy because you defended yourself.  
---
Players would also band together to force karma on themselves (1 guy would kill all his friends while they didnt attack so he is the ultra bad guy, then his friends take it in turns to kill him repeatedly so they are the "good" guys)  
---
We don't know people intentions IRL too though so highlighting peoples past actions in this defeats a lot of the roleplay from it, also if you are like me and would rather just change how you act on that particular day you would be bound by what you had already done
---
Nice. Take it to Whitesprings and smoke all of the legendaries before the cry babies get a chance to tag them.
---
That's what I do with my Instigating Super Sledge now that my gun got nerfed.
---
Crafting expensive ammo that isn't worth it isn't really something you can call an endgame.
---
Yep, did that. Didn't exit the armor bench or anything.
---
The repair cost is pretty cheap. I repair it when I'm just passing through and don't need it for anything. Though I'd agree the cost adds up in those lv80 fights.
---
You have to protect your turret from scorched mobs, but you can't stand too close to it or the scorchbeast will hit the turret when it attacks you.
---
Very much wanting to mod my plasma rifle to have this flamer mod. Who knows where to find that barrel?
---
Theres nothing fufilling to do and the game hardly works as is. Wait on it.
---
It's like a dream.
---
I've burned through hundreds of plastics and corks and whatnot to get buttressed on all Marine armor pieces and most of the useful mods. It's taken quite a bit and I've got a nose for plastics like a cocaine junkie now but overall I'm happy with the set. It's easily the best mid tier armor and gives rad resist but I'd be happier with a heavy set that does indeed outclass Heavy Combat. I think their goal was to offset armor effectiveness with weight and most people gloss over that, despite the fact that for all around effectiveness it's likely the best. 
---
As it is I only look for two kinds of armor, either Weightless for NPCs and Assassin's for PCs. My current Assassin's chest is Marine and I don't think I'm ever going to find something better. 
---
Let me check!
---
Sounds like you temporarily had the ghoulish perk maxed out. 
---
Anyone else is particularly fond of "Thanks Lenny"? :-) 
---
There is an amazing amount of detail in the game, you cant just run past, everything has a story,
---
 We are not support. Submit a ticket to Bethesda.
---
Interesting. What's the damage ramp up look like? Does it eventually cap out or does it just keep going up and up?
---
That's odd, last I heard the skin didnt work on Somerset or voice of Set...
---
Where is it?
---
I recognize that there is a LOT of different regions &amp; beasts and recalling them all is difficult.
---
Having said that - the Glassed Cavern has a dead scorch beast in it - the one that died wiping out the last of the brotherhood(this is the Main line quest belly of the beast) .
---
Don't go crazy trying to kill a scorch beast - make it easy - get DNA from one already  dead.

Occasionally when I enter a crafting station to craft or modify gear, the menu will appear and I will craft as normal but then be stuck in an infinite animation loop that I can only escape by restarting the game. At least I think it’s infinite, been going steady for 20 minutes. Also, sometimes when I use a crafting station that I’ve recently built at a camp or a public workshop, the menu for crafting will not appear, instead appearing minutes later once I’ve left the crafting station and not allowing me to craft until some time has passed.
---
Put all your resources in one spot, either stash or on your person. The game wont read it if some are on you and some in stash. 
---
&gt; Melee was so incredibly better than anything ranged that's not a VATS+crit build.
---
Might as well just get that out of the way
---
I can confirm it does. It's cool
---
Currently building a weightless marine armor set, halfway done. My current is a full unyielding marine set except the leg, which I kept for chameleon effect.
---
Yeah my only gripe is that the raiders aren't alive so I cant avenge the ranger
---
Almost 300 hours in but yea it’s trash. Kidding. I enjoy every fallout out that I have played and spend stupid amounts of time playing. I think this game has the potential to be a modern Star Wars galaxies with some refining and expanding. I am glad I don’t know how much time I spent on that game. Price per hour it’s def worth your money. 
---
Huh, never thought about that. That's kind of a good point. They can fairly effectively engage SB's and the other weapons could be for the Scorched which have very little energy resist. 
---
It was the climax of the game for me, though I didn't succeed killing the queen afterwards. I gained probably 3 levels.
---
I believe it’s because you load before the CAMP and so it can’t have you anywhere near so that you don’t have the camp form inside you. 
---
I think they also have you face the other way around to try and give the game a second to load before you notice it’s not there yet 
---
Where is this place
---
It’s right there in the terms of service;
---
“Laughter, fun, or any sense of joy is strictly forbidden and will result in an immediate ban.”
---
Obviously a joke, I’m having a lot of fun myself. And finding random fun in stuff like this is great to see instead of more complaining about anything and everything. Keep having fun, screw the joykillers 
---
I think the saddest ones ive found were the guys in the glass cavern who got trapped, making a holotape for his wife if he is ever found
---
Solved this for someone earlier. Put all materials in stash. If you have stuff in your inventory and not put in stash there is a glitch that it will mjn on show available for crafting. Give that a try 1st
---
I use Junkie, Mutant, Breserkers, and Troubleshooter weapons when I play. Ghouls are so weak anyway, GS is redundant imo.
---
Oh wow. Thanks 
---
Issue with latest patch; work around for me was to carry the MATs on my person when I was repairing things... and some users have reported having everything in your stash works too but I cannot confirm.
---
Not sure if its an issue when any item totals are split between your Stash and Inventory, or only with rare items like flux and black titanium.
---
I don’t believe this is even a thing. Wheres it at ill try it and report back
---
Well said :D
---
Some players are acting raiders so hunt them down
---
Yeah my brother and I grew up playing games together and always talked about being able to play a co-OP fallout game.  76 has its faults,  a lot of them, but we're enjoying exploring together and killing all the things like we always talked about. 
---
Obviously it could be a better fallout game.  However,  I'm enjoying it. 
---
I'm only level 29 but ran down to the southeast part of the map after a nuke was dropped to help fight the Scorchbeast queen with about 10 other players. It was a clusterfuck but I enjoyed it immensely
---
Just deposit those in the chest at the Overseer's Camp for some newbie to collect. You can't be THAT strapped for caps.
---
My wife lost 3 PA this last 3 days the friday 2 PA vanish 1 x01 (In the inventory) and the excavator (in STASH), today I craft a 2nd x01 (but we already lost all the sweet mods we farm hours for), and 10 min after being playing she notice that she lost the new x01 again!
---
She call it for now. think we are gonna have a break and play something else and come back in a few months.
---
I go to the Whitespring with my instigating Super sledge with 40% power swing and run through and find all of the legendaries and one shot them before anyone else gets a chance to tag them.
---
I use rank three of the battery that's meant to make them last twice as long. Since last patch they have been draining far to fast
---
Yeah that's my last Weightless hold out, a Chameleon metal leg. I'm kind of torn on it because of how cool it is. 
---
My dream is two Weightless leg pieces with -50% fall damage so I can sneak like a motherfucker and really shock people when I swan dive off a cliff without PA. 
---
In the savage divide I cant remember exactly where but it's right next to a road leading to cortega to the left of the elevator
---
The only thing I want Bethesda to do is to fix their garbage game, I’m not concerned about anything but that right now.
---
This is dumb. Bad karma is supposed to be beneficial in different ways than good karma. Not just penalize the "bad guys." This just sounds like more pvp prevention to me.
---
Cool I'll be more active just to spite you.
---
I will then
---
&gt; because it required them to fuck up decent guns' stats in the name of balance and pvp meta 
---
That literally makes no sense though. If their stats are fucked up it was done in the name of imbalance.
---
Devs need to see and read and understand and apply this post..... 
---
How about they figure out the game not crashing 5 times a session and freezing on load screens first.....
---
Why are we suppose to trust raiders.
---
I don’t think that OP is referring to things like balancing issues, I think he or she is just saying that players should stop requesting stuff like completely new content or unfeasible inclusions.
---

---
i appreciate the answer, il have to hop there until one is kind enough to pop up for me.
---
the hunting is mostly so i can get an AA/fast reload with a hasty .50 for robot killing with cheap ammo, unless you think the BoS rifle's .50 damage will outpace an AA?
---
Its just works!
---
It does no damage no matter which way you slice it. Any other automatic weapon will outdamage it.
---
Yeah its nice, i rarely have to reload when using it, the fire rate isnt insanely high - i havent found many instances of it out there, or any plans, so im not sure what kinda mods are available.
---
People have had the game removed from their accounts when they played an EU key from the US. Though the reports I've seen were g2a keys so you never know their legitimacy.
---
I don't think you'd want the lag of having to play through an australian VPN.

Get a Super Sledge.

There is definitely a bug with the large/industrial purifier output. It says it should produce 60/hr, but I timed it, and it only produces 1 every 3 minutes (20/hr).  (PS4)
---
If you think that Fallout 76 was ever marketed, intended or expected to be a typical multiplayer shooter then you have fucked up far worse lol. Have you not played any of the other games? Or ESO?

&gt;!She wants to get even with her mother by destroying something that the mother loved more then her (the order) and in the process free herself to live her own life.  Only after getting betrayed herself, did she understand her stupid actions.   !&lt;

Fun? Either the flamer-modded plasma rifle or the Gatling Plasma. Neither lasts long, but they're awesome while they do.
---
 So what is the secret sauce that makes a Chainsaw dangerous? I have scrapped many, but my melee is sword based. 
---
 Well and explosives too, melee based explosives are my new focus, although the M79 is not technically a melee weapon. ;)
---
*upvotes 10000 times*

Give mini guns to your settlers with a single bullet for it. They will be able to shoot infinitely, and will wreck anything attacking the settlement. I never had to defend settlements after I found that out. 
---
Im not sure it does my dude I was looking for like a sizable dmg increase after like the 10th consecutive hit in 😞 your naturally high ST probably lets you kill stuff before you can notice OR tge dmg increase scales based on your dmg maybe? 
---
Anthem is amazing, no doubt about it. I played the demo last week but being dicks to people on this sub is uncalled for. Personally when jump force comes out this month I'm probably going to slow down on fallout myself. Just restarted playing pokken tournament. Yes 76 had issues but it's still a good game at heart. Not what everyone wants. But still a good game. 
---
Hmmmmm....
---
omw 
---
Yes I have a problem; often my neighbours lock their water purifiers. 
---
I dunno why it always does that! I'm never offline!
---
I found it's easier to start a daily if you switch to different areas of the map.
---
There are many in each area though,so getting the one you want is still random.
---
Finally found a Gatling Plasma today and I have to agree, SUPER fun. Terrible accuracy and unlike the standard Gatling Gun the ammo was gone in an instant. Very much an up close weapon. I imagine in power armor it would be fun to Pain Train mobs to the ground then hose them with it, though.
---
Nerf TSE was an organized attack by melee players.
---
How much to do a jet pack/calibrated legs for a T-51b, you provide materials? lol
---
Try playing melee with them. Can be fun
---
That’s what he gets for killing our boy Texas red
---
I often load into the floor of my CAMP because it spawns me right where the CAMP is being placed
---
Something that was not mentioned is that when you log out of the game while in excavator (unsure of other variants) and re log back in you will have +100 carry weight on top of what you should have. This effect lasts as long as you stay in the power armor. It can not be stacked multiple times (spam d/c and reconnect will not grant +200 or something). This is not related to the current weight issues or the issues you outlined be cause it has been present in the game at the very least since patch 3, but likely earlier. I have the feeling that the game takes an image of your current stats or something when logging off and adds the excavator bonus when it is reapplying buffs on entering the server. 
---
Just make the best of what's happening on your server. I normally find where some people will be hanging an join in or prank people in their camps. Leave them a bag of fertilizer an a molotov on their door while running around naked screaming. This game has legit nothing going for it at the moment so were pretty much here to just do whatever anyways those of us still logging in. I find peace in building camps so I think of new ideas an rebuild my camp like 2 times a week.
---
Wow; I check threads such as these for interesting discussions and all I encounter are a bunch of haters and whiners.  How about this; instead of endless, useless gripes, how about offer some suggestions for improvements?
---
Glad to hear!
---
Omw 
---
The edit earned my downvote. Well played.
---
I've used the PA lamp a few times after the latest patches and never had any issues. Make sure that you're pressing the correct button/key, that you do have a helmet equipped on your PA and that you don't have an odd light mod installed such as Vault Boy, Purple color or Blue color.
---
A Vampire's combat knife is hilarious. It may not do much damage, but you can attack so fast that you'll heal more than anything short of the SBQ can hurt you. I've killed a Mirelurk Queen with it, and laughed my ass off the whole time.
---
I’m using nuka t51b, that may be the issue
---
I have 20 agi, max sneak and escape artist and get spotted and stuck in danger by level 3s through walls when I go raid screws in Morgantown.  Stealth is way broke.

I've actually seen and passed up a number of really nice legendaries of that exact model, I want to say Furious and Two Shot. If I saw an Anti-Armor I might buy it on general principle.

I have a gold lockpicking card  that does not count as a lockpicking  card if I equip all 3 of my cards for lockpicking it shows a skill level of two if I equip just the gold lockpicking card it shows I have no points in it. I am unable to pick lvl 3 locks now and no way of buying a normal non gold card for a lvl up point.
---
To clarify: It does work for Somerset since you can mod it. Voice of Set you cannot.
---
I asked for the a few months ago, I shall upvote in the hope you have more success though
---
What he have in him?  Had the hunters coat for me
---
Repair it to 200%! Damage goes up, without any perks, to 30-per-tick instead of 2! Run!!!!
---
That's what shotguns do in real life also. You don't even need an explosive one and they will kill anything.
---
Their Super Mutant perk cards are better.
---
Idk. I hated fo4 and really enjoyed 76. Idk what's wrong with me. 
---
If I recall correctly, none do. Some weapons are just like that. It’s really silly in this case because even Rifle is in the name 
---
Sow destruction, my friend!!! Watch the world BURN!!!
---
Water has always been that way. I mean My family has had a diabetes in almost every generation and they never drank, like I have to in fallout 76. As for food, I really never noticed a difference.
---
It's the Fallout 76 sub. For talking about Fallout 76. Criticising Fallout 76 is talking about Fallout 76.
---
You could always use bulk items for crafting. After the last patch, it glitched and you would have to unbulk your junk manually. But after the hotfix a couple days ago that issue was fixed.
---
Now another bug came out of the recent hotfix, where you go to scrap all junk, it scraps bulk junk as well.
---
Thank you for the advice! I'll definitely come to this as I level up and swap cards. 
---
What!? What kind of ridiculous unrelated response is that. Really weak dude. Really really weak. 
---
Financially many games do this so yes, its a common strategy, though theirs is more generous considering you can earn currency instead of buying in.
---
It sounded like you were complaining. So I was sticking up for the game.  Glad to hear you love it.  I love it too.  I must love it to have spent 60 hours so far.  Nothing holds my attention for that long.  For your sake I hope some additional content comes soon.
---
Same, ran around there a lot in PA whenever it was nuked and never had crashes on the PS4.
---
i had to restart my game as i loaded in 
---
That's the plan. You guys shouldn't have been downing on our guns.
---
Yeah I just built a new CAMP today actually, was fun
---
I wanted to use  the  perk load out manager on fallout 76 nexus  but didnt want to get banned 
---
raise the special points to 65 and let us have perk loadouts we can switch at the push of a button  
---
Here's what I don't get about that, why would the robots turn on the staff for being in the Whitespring, but not us when we wander around or set up C.A.M.P?
---
Armor pieces that reduce 20% weapon weight are freaking gold. Depending on what you carry you could be looking at a few pounds to 20+. Tack on two of them and you're cooking with gas. 
---
You just explained most games on the market today. Cod litreraly had no campaign and people still say it's better than this and it's literally a skin grabbing, daily quest grind, fortnite content clone. 
---
I agree. I hated 4 but enjoy this one. 
---
No legendary effect did.
---
The combination of 2 legendary effects that had less than a 1% chance of being rolled on the same gun did.
---
Mocking people who enjoy it is not not construction criticism.
---
&gt;misinformation 
---
Any proof there's "misinformation" on this sub?
---
Sorry, I realize I didnt clarify this:
---
The  stock BOS Recon rifle is still .308 but has a much higher damage rating so the .50 receiver damage loss isnt as noticeable.
---
Its a hunting rifle for all purposes of mods and plans, but has a higher base damage.
---
Wow! I always seem to show up just outside my camps boundary, I even did the “ring of plants defense” all the way around my base and would always show up outside of it.  
---
Come to think of it, I did show up inside the boundary’s a few times, I wasn’t inside anything luckily. I’m gonna add this to the long list of bugs ;) 
---
I usually give them to new players directly, just to be sure someone gets them. 
---
Explosive by itself was 3x damage with demolition expert.
---
TSE was a whopping 6x damage with demolition expert. 
---
Surprise surprise, people figured out how to glitch/dick around with them in the BETA so they ruined it for everyone before the game ever came out. 
---
They're not going to be put back in. 
---
Its all about level, go at a low level with no one around and you will get LOTS of level 9 to 15 golfers, if a player level 100 shows up they all get replaced by the higher level ghouls. 
---
Half the time I spawn in my house and sometimes get stuck in the floor. It’s not as bad at my new place. Previous house I would spawn 30ft or so away but all my friends would spawn under it and be stuck until I removed a piece to let them out. Out of nowhere I started to spawn under it also, and after a few times of that I just moved to somewhere else.
---
Some men just like to watch the world burn.
---
Welcome to the wasteland.
---
I pretty much always run Iron Fist Build til I'm high level. I'm making a shotgunner build now and I'm level 55 and haven't fired a shotgun once. Once I get all my perks I'll trade the perk cards out and respec as necessary. 
---
Running melee, Unarmed specifically, is good because it doesn't require a ton of perk investment, it is strong, it is crazy easy and doesn't require you to farm ammo. Start there, you may like it. When/if you get bored you can swap your cards around. Most builds you can't tell if they are fun until you have good perk cards to fool around with.
---
lol wut
---
His team can track. I got hit by griefers a few days ago an they had 2 people killing while one dude sat on a roof as lookout watching the map calling out to his friend where anyone who wasnt with them was. They have their fucking griefing down an blocking them doesn't do shit unless you leave the server.
---
I honestly think he has a point. Bethesda seemed clueless on how to deal with item duping and other basic cheating  when that really should have been a consideration in planning. That Bethesda took so long to react caused the player mentality to sour. It isn't all Bethesda's fault but they share some of the blame.
---
I posted this elsewhere, now reposting here hoping to get some feedback on these pain points I have. This is on XBox but the ideas would apply to any platform. Thanks.
---
I know some are "known issues" (missing Blade or other items needed to upgrade) that I have seem others discuss, but I don't know if they are planned on being addressed, so I am posting here to ask. Thanks for your time.
---
1) Quest items lost that are required in order to upgrade
---
I completed the Mistress of Mysteries quest. I have (had) all of the quest items. Somewhere along the way I lost my Blade of Bastet. I believe I put it in a paper bag temporarily, which then subsequently went away. Now, even through I know the plans to build/upgrade the Blade, I have no way of doing so because it is gone and is required to rebuild. Is there a plan to allow people to get these items back somehow,? I submitted a ticket, and was told "sorry, nothing we can do".
---
2) Other storage besides Stash for certain items
---
As I go through the game, I get legendary weapons or armor. Some of these items weigh a lot, so they take a lot of Stash space. Therefore, you are forced to sell these weapons instead of keeping them for possible use. I know I can't keep hundreds of weapons or armor, but it would be nice to have a separate weapon storage or armor storage where these things could be kept that would not take away from Stash space. If a weapon weighs 43, and another weighs 28, that is a lot of weight for just 2 items. I would like to have a weapons stash and armor stash, or some way to keep these things without tearing up my Stash space. I don't mind having to travel back to my CAMP to retrieve something from this separate storage.
---
3) CAMP building/budget
---
I see that some people have elaborate CAMPs. Mine is pretty basic (level 43). However, my CAMP budget is full, and also when I try to blueprint the CAMP it will not fully blueprint. I have to create 3 blueprints to cover the whole CAMP. Not to mention that when I select the option during blueprinting to select the entire structure, it will not select anything (it just highlights the build area in green). This is a simple two story wooden structure, pretty small, with 1 purifier and 1 generator, 4 basic turrets, and the standard workbenches. I am wondering why I can't build a bigger CAMP, and if there are plans to fix this so that you have a larger budget. I am also wondering if the blueprinting thing is a known issue.
---
damn i got happy when i took my 100 damage auto railway... it would be the melting gun for bosses
---
Nope, totally worthless, you should give it to me. /s
---
Seriously though, what you've got there is a low-end godroll. Probably worth 2000-4000 caps. Well done!
---
If you are having difficulty with enjoyment, Id say experiment with as many different weapons as possible and see what feels fun to you. Find the ones you like and make a build around that. 
---
Lol love all the options for how i can chose to play...
---
I got tse hamade 2k

A friend of mine also suggested horses too.. I thought maybe ghoul-horses with muzzles?
---
My stash has stuff missing all the time. I'll leave it 600/600 come back an its randomly 545/600 or something random.
---
Combined with 5 levels of perk cards.
---
Explosive alone was 200% damage.
---
TSE was 400% damage with 5 Demolition Expert perks. TS wasn't effected by the perks.
---
Ghouls specifically do this to me 9 times out of 10. Silly ghouls.
---
Yeah ok boy.  I posted this right after the patch dropped.  The night before when you fought her was before the patch.
---
Earn currency. Riiight...the game is falling apart, and you're happy you can earn currency. First, the rate you can earn Atoms at is a joke, and second they have slightly more pressing issues to worry about-namely a vanishing player base. 
---
Are you on ps4. Id trade it gurely but i gotta get some caps first. 
---
To bad i messed up the title
---
(Insert "I understood that reference" meme)
---
Next 10 expansions will all be raiders an pvp. Good luck!
---
They clearly did not if some weapons last many times longer than others even if they have similar fire rate and damage. There's just no reason for that if they actually were trying to have them all be balanced around the same perk loadout durability-wise.
---
Thats my bad i skipped over the platform somehow xb1
---
Actually, an Anti-Armor legendary weapon and the Glow Sight perk is going to kill Glowing Ones faster than a TSE. But yeah, TSEs are still excellent weapons. The problem is that guns in general are weak compared to the end-game enemies. 
---
Nvm that waw my fault. I edited it so say ps4 afterwards. 
---
I’ve got like 90 hours I think, I love this game it’s my favorite one. I just don’t know where to find some quests, like in fallout 4 you could go somewhere and pick a quest or something. Yeah I hope some content is going to drop soon 
---
Don't bother waiting past 25 for that woman of mystery quest, I did it at 52 and still got all the gear given to me at 25 (shitty)
---
Your best bet for finding Legendaries are at Whitesprings. Either make runs through it normally or get there when someone nukes it.
---
Mine also seems to be draining more rapidly. However, I haven't invested many points into Endurance or related parks, so it seems fair on my character despite the irritation. 
---
The bright headlamp of my T-51 helmet is also marked as an atomshop item. Guess all headlamps are affected?
---
Most the bugs they said were fixed were not. Its happened every patch their is a few things this happens with.
---
I was talking about the games construction. As of right now, 76 is a laughing stock.
---
Level 103, 240+ hours in, still haven't finished the main quest, haven't been to dozens of locations or all the workshops yet, still having a great time. 
---
I've recently completed my long standing goal of unlocking all Marine armor mods which has not been easy. Now I'm taking up the daunting task of fully upgrading my favorite Ultracite Laser Rifle. 
---
I have a great time with the game on my own, but where the game really shines is with other people. It's an absolute riot with 3-4 friends, doing events and taking over half the map. I pity the people that raced to endgame, got a couple TSE guns, beat the Queen a couple of times and then left. 
---
If you have a Costco, check there. Last time I was there it was $15 for console versions.
---
And to be honest I never ever complained about the “bugs” this game supposed to have and about the gameplay either. I just love every aspect of it. 
---
Yup. Duster and Sunglasses are a good combo!
---
The same happened to me, I didn't get the xp for the kill either.
---
What i understand, it only kicked them out "while" the construction was going on.  But guessing that took sometime and most everyone was dead before the bots finished and re opened the place.  
---
Same Still enjoying, last night I had a cool session, I finished the raider questline, hunted a few wanted players and upgraded my camp a bit...
---
They could've done more damage with sharp tooth brushes
---
I got a 2* quad and explosive fairly early on and not another in 70?ish levels but congrats 
---
I dont think they should fix this but like. 10 second spawn protection to get into power armor or rad suit or something 
---
I've had them spawn inside the Golf Club instead of the ghouls a few times as a glitch.  Took care of that quest really fast.
---
You're protest the shitty game by continuing to play it and taking your frustration out on other players?
---
no. i was not on hunted hunter. the guy was killing multiple people. i find it hard to believe all of them were in hunted hunter.
---
They almost certainly turned into regular-sized meat piles.  They could just be far from where you’d think with extra large enemies.
---
I understood it, but I didn't believe it. The villain's motivation wasn't believable. Like so many other Emil Pepperoni stories (I can't remember his last name) there's a character that has a response that's suddenly off the charts. It's not that it couldn't happen, it's that it wasn't written so that you could believe it. 
---
I don't know if Emil has a problem understanding what motivates people or just can't connect the dots in telling a story. Maybe it's both?

Yup. Happen to me 2 times bpth times all my junk was taken by assholes. 
---
i thought they patched that?
---
I also have been devoured by my camp. In my previous camp I used to fall through the world every time I logged in. Then I'd do the superhero slam in my PA... honestly it was kind of a badass way to load in even if it did get annoying after a while. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/am3agv/fallout_76_known_issues_and_feedback/?st=JRPI08VT&amp;sh=17bf9149 
---
They’ve highlighted some of these already and are looking into energy weapons as a group, not just laser weapons.
---
Hi, that's me. Legendary Mole Miner Gauntlet, +25% Unarmed Damage, 17 STR and all relevant perks. I'm also in full Assassin and have Lone Wanderer + all three perks of Dodgy so your hits at best will be doing 20% damage while I have AP. 
---
The TSE crowd might get some lucky hits in but I'm betting I can drop just about anyone in 1-2 hits. Don't fuck with my workshops. 
---
I’m still fairly low, I use my PA fairly often.
---
I don't blame you. There's a good game in here somewhere, but it's buried under a mountain of bugs that no one seems to be in any hurry to fix.
---
still isn't it supposed to only deal a fraction of the damage until i hit them back? (which i did not) 
---
"what fun is if if no one can kill you" the flip side of the coin of people who can't function if they can't one shot everything.
---
Maybe my save is bugged because none of my bulk resources allow me to craft
---
That’s because they killed these beasts before the game was patched... duh...
---
Yeah, but melee is far more annoying, you have to be in melee range (more time wasted moving around and exposed to attacks). You basically want melee to be completely pointless?
---
could be a newly introduced issue
---
PvP isn't griefing.
---
Do you have any unyeilding gear? If so I'd be willing to trade a TSE handmade
---
I'd be completely cool with that 👍
---
In previous games, you'd see caution or etc even if you weren't very close to any enemy if your Perception was high. Unsure if that could be a factor.
---
I've definitely noticed oddities with stealth though. I have a stealth build and in the past enemies often couldn't find me when I was nearly on top of them. This made it possible for me to team up with random high level players without them continuously having to revive me.
---
But now it seems like it's working that way sometimes and other times everything can see me easily :/ No factor that I've connected to it yet... 
---
Yep, they invented equipment degradation, just for this game. Wait no, it's a mechanic in pretty much every mmo and every survival game ever, not to mention fallout 3 and NV.
---
You have to wait a good minute or two after loading in for the first time each time you play. I usually wait until I see my quest tracker show up or I see the NPCs load in nearby, if there are any
---
What's the username of one of the Devs on this subject? Maybe tag them?
---
Ran into a similar situation. At one of the airports, if someone has claimed the workshop there and you pick the lock to go up into the flight tower you will become wanted. If you claim the work shop and go to the same door you will not be required to pick the lock, it just opens right up. 
---
This game doesn’t need NPCs. In fact I think they would ruin it
---
Show me my time stamp on my comment and I'll show you it was after the patch dropped my time zone. If I say last night it doesn't always mean night. I work nights so 6am is my night and about 2pm is my morning. And besides I'm not going to argue with you. You can have the weapon durability point, its pretty bad after patch, but the truth is my friends who still run tse still kill the queen and don't have to much trouble with it. You just have to trim the fat and focus your build. My gf who is lvl 17 with no dam perks, still runs around with a lvl 5 tse pump and omg instead of 1 shoting whole groups of lvl 68 ghouls she has to actually shoot 4 rounds to kill a 68 ghoul! So unfair!
---
Yeah, I found a pair of T-51b legs, went and dropped most of my caps on a plan for calibrated shocks for them, only to find out that I can't fucking build them because you need "Violet Flux" whatever the hell that is. Oh, turns out it can only be farmed from a nuke site in the bog. Great, so now I have to go figure out how to do the nuke mission I've been putting off forever. Wandered into Site Bravo with no clue what I was doing - don't even get me started on how that shit show went down.
---
The order of mystery gear you can upgrade to higher level...
---
...makes you wonder why you can't do the same with other uniques/legendaries
---
My favorite is dropping the IOU Toilet Paper note, you can find it in one of the free states bunkers
---
My guess, yes. I foresee a Vendor Bot or Genetic Modification Camp Structure to do just that... at a cost of Caps.
---
&gt; 5mm basically costs the same as 50 cal ammo to make so why craft it
---
Because Gatling Guns use that and aren't actual shit like the Minigun...
---
BSG gives sloppy head. Just saying. 
---
Well , mothman eggs aren’t the only way to get caps , Infact it’s a fairly long and pointless method given that you can get more caps easier by bulking junk or by farming Whitespring and selling all the trash legendaries.
---
&gt; for flux
---
I’m not sure , I would suggest nuking the forest since there’s a lot of vegetation but that’s for you to find out.
---
It should still be worth a couple thousand at least. It's the AA and movement speed that gives it most of its value, honestly.
---
I don't know what that means. But I sent a team invite
---
No Legendary Ultracite Gatling Lasers, but I've had various 1* Ultracite Laser Pistols drop (Anti-Armor, Two Shot, etc).
---
Can't wait to use my vampire explosive laser rifle. Best weapon I have, 2 reloads before breaking.
---
By best i mean most fun
---
This hotfix never fixed mine. I have 0 scraps and it still won't let me use my bulk. For example, plastic. I have 30 bulk plastic but it displays as 0.
---
As if caps matter to dupers at the cap?
---
You are playing it wrong. ;) I'll fire my char up in a while and he's in hs CAMP, deep in the mire. 
---
 He might go north a bit and fool with a town and Fissure he has issues with. A Beast and some Scroched will die. He will probably walk to The Whitespring and try again for a Jet Pack for the X0-1 in his pocket, and then walk home again after making a few caps in the bunker and the resort. 
---
 I'm enjoying not fast traveling.
---
I'm on xbox and the hotfix fixed it.
---
You just said melee is annoying. Why would a gaming company design their game around something that is annoying?
---
The actual fuck
---
Same. I have never started inside my camp, I'm always just outside the green circle
---
I’ve also been getting this.  It’s irritating as hell, 
---
Nice if only people wojld offer more fair prices then gotta guy who said 500 had to let that slide 
---
Just checking if all still good? Also did you put a US address in your Bethesda account info?
---
That's why it's a bug, and not just a balance issue. 
---
Unfortunatly i have no unyielding armor? You nee d something else? 
---
Collect Straight Jackets in Fort Defiance ;)
---
Would be an amazing concept. New human npcs with stories. Possible choices that actually matter? Maybe a fued within the vault that makes the dwellers pick sides and as they inhabit the land you will too have to choose the side to support or go against. 
---
There's so many ideas. It feels like theres no desire in the game to do anything but explore. I log in... And log back out cause im bored and have nothing to do no attatchment. I go on fallout 4 and build. Or skyrim. I hope they take the oppertunity to add in human npcs. It was a neat idea to make each player as the replacements for npcs ....in theory... But gamers dont see it like that. No factions no stories just makes it a free for all shoot em up. 
---
Sad but most likely they will never make this game what it could be... What it should be. Something that sucks u in. If it was more story drivin then i might even spend money on the atoms shop... (Did u hear that Bethesda) but it will be just a shit dlc with exploits galore and cheaters will ruin it for everyone if its even worth playing. 
---
We shall see i supppose
---
I still enjoy it.  Actually more so now that I've made a new character and went melee.  (Previous build was sneaky sniper which was boring).  Any time I see a lot level player, I try to help out my dropping them a bunch of Stimpak's and anything else I can spare.  being a Level +80 I carry a lot of extra stull like 50+ Stimpak's, water, etc...   I like exploring too.  Just wandering around and seeing the edges of the map or places that I haven't really been to,  Listening to the nature track.  It's cool to explore and run across other player's CAMP's in the middle of nowhere.  Especially when you've been running around overencumbered for a while.
---
And here is a happy little round C.a.M.P.
---
I'm on Ps4. I honestly thought it was a part of the game (hence the post). Haven't been able to use my bulk for crafting since I learnt that you could bulk (approximately 10 days ago).
---
Don't forget to level up your Mysteries gear as you progress. I think it's every 10 level on the 5s. So 25, 35, 45. Also make sure you're wearing the Eye Of Ra with it for the added bonus. Put as much room between you and what you're shooting at as possible and you should be in decent shape. If you're on PS4 I can trick you out a rifle if you want. 
---
It has npcs. It needs human npcs. Not lifeless robots only. 
---
Yes, they aren’t cap farms, they are just to meet your personal water needs.  It’s enough to cover your thirst every time you go home.
---
Everyone who sees this please upvote so people at Bethesda can see - we can make this happen 
---
I also have a vampire's cultist's dagger, it's pretty good but still gets outdamaged by a super mutant warlord
---
I found 4 recipes in there that are not usable.  Did you come across them?  Growth serum was one.  They all went to misc instead of notes.
---
I love my silenced gear. 
---
I've been seeing this a lot, and experiencing it to a lesser degree in-game. I think it's the old "not registering hits" bug acting up again, as sometimes I do full damage, sometimes I do nothing, or anything in between. It can, at its worst, make even the lowliest of mobs immortal killing machines. 
---
Not working for me on Xbox 
---
For future readers, you may need to equip Starched Jeans and cycle servers cure, irradiate, rinse and repeat until you start getting mutations. Feb 2019 5th patch and the system seems buggy. 
---
I'm pulling my hair out trying to get a good selection but the 'bad' mutations are always the first to obtain and the last to cure, it's as if it is coded that way :/
---
I'm being pushed in the direction of serums but not from the Enclave Bunker at those prices!
---
Probably, they are listening to player feedback. It's clear that some people want a full respec, at least when they majorly change how stuff works.
---
That said I feel like it'll probably be pushed as an Atom shop item and, if it is offered in game, be very expensive.
---
Yup, I just have the small one and most of the time I ignore it when I stop back in camp.  Water is a common item to find or get from events and I drop it often.
---
With weightless armor you can just use the chameleon mutation instead
---
Yeah some energy ones. But no mention of ballistic in either post. I don't want to end up waiting until next year for Minigun to be usable. Or Grenade/Missile launcher.  
---
I bought the chrome minigun skin and feel bad atm lol.
---
You've got bloodied super sledge...... instigating super sledge......super sledge with Unyielding Cavalier armor.......super sledge with assassin's cavalier armor......super sledge with bolstering cavalier armor....fried super sledge........steamed super sledge.......spicy super sledge......super sledge kabobs.....
---
If you like to hoard materials there will be a little frustration until you figure out how to manage your insanely limited storage space.
---
so true. Hopefully the current director will be fired.
---
I only learnt how to bulk about 10 days ago and I haven't been able to use bulked items for crafting since then. I'm doing another live test as I type. No luck.
---
Spot on
---
Nice.i gotta 2 star zealots explosive lever gun.... that now does 120 damage. Not cool
---
I've been stuck on 1/10 for over 100 hours. Sounds like I'll never get this one.
---
No there are no legendary ultracite gatlings :( Keep bringing it up so bethesda sees! Or maybe they know already, just like pipe revolvers and the others 
---
Game engine won’t allow this
---
If you haven’t been able to do heart of the enemy, that’s strange. You have the fourth floor unlocked at fort defiance, right? If so, all you have to do is go into the room with some knight’s terminal and pick up a letter or something on the table near the terminal
---
ahh it's because the server is full so it waits for a spot
---
Especially since Anthem is coming out in a few
---
Lots of people swore the trade-stealing bug was real.  I don’t trust anyone here and only accept what I see with my own eyes.
---
You need to understand, the Brotherhood was scraping the bottom of the barrel in supplies by the time they tried for glassed cavern and the queen. They used up all the good stuff earlier on and all that was left was energy weapons and miniguns.
---
It wasn’t “We’re going after the big one this time! I’ll grab my laser rifle! FUCK YEAH!!”
---
It was “We’re going after the big one this time. I’ve only got my laser rifle left. FUCK ME.”
---
Yes and any Ranger Outfits are very valuable. 
---
Here is the complete guide

---
Please tell me by "bought" you mean completed some challenges and didnt actually buy atom.
---
*idiot tricentenial edition owner here
---
I've mentioned this to a lot of people..
---
Fallout76 won't be completely vacant of NPC's. At first, yeah.. because the entire background to this particular Fallout is that this is when the vault doors first open, so of course there won't be any normal humans around.. they're dead. 
---
My prediction is that they'll release NPC's with DLC. Hell.. Fallout4 had an entire NukaWorld expansion that came with more Raiders, even when Raiders already existed in the game.
---
Friends of mine have already given me the 'well we'll start playing once they do' and, to me, that's kind of stupid. I'll keep playing.. building up perks, CAMP items, weapons &amp; ammo, armor, and leveling up so that when it does.. I'll be good to go. They'll be the ones struggling, grinding, not being able to use or equip reward items.
---
Just avoid the daily quests "Feed the World" and "The Path of Enlightenment" and your gear should be safe, and while mutations' effects are bugging out, I haven't heard of anyone loosing them as long as they have Starched Genes 2 equipped.
---
There's a journal entry by one of the staff on a terminal in Whitespring (behind one of the "staff only" doors, looks like a robot repair area) describing how he finally got the lockdown turned off... well after nearly everyone else was gone and likely dead.
---
Laser weapons are bugged and their durability is like 10% of normal ballistic weapons. 
---
I've already been keeping track for a few weeks now. I have about 120 legendaries so far, and the spreadsheet looks like [this](https://gyazo.com/b5323a7cea7d1ad972cb958933ca3fd2)
---
I'm waiting until I get a few hundred more to draw any real conclusions, but so far I probably have enough to accurately determine stuff like the breakdown between armor and weapon drop rates
---
Im sure Bethesda will make sure to nerf melee now, too. Doesn’t make sense to allow something to be effective in that game or fun 
---
Gonna call bullshit on you.  https://youtu.be/CUcP5TTKPi8
---
170 hours in, lvl 78 and absolutely no sign of anything TS or E for me 😢
---
Congrats on that one though, but isn't the reload time kind of a buzzkill?
---
Silenced Shotgun is still a thing, right? I always wanted to use one of those on a stealth build for interiors and urban environments. Unfortunately in Fallout 4 they never seemed to do very good sneak crit damage compared to rifles. I hope that isn't the case in this game, but it isn't something I'm super convinced they would have changed.
---
Any bloodied weapons?
---
That's interesting. Why do you think it would ruin it?
---
Ah yeah, my mistake. I have a bloodied one lurking in my stash too.
---
xbox,
---
I have spare (PC)....free :-)
---
Nope. That's part of the grind to keep the game going forever.
---
It needs CHARACTERS, the species of the NPC doesn't really matter. 
---
Todd Howard very quietly whispers "except when it doesn't" under his breath to qualify that statement.
---
same here. Finally with TSEs you could go toe to toe with scorched beast solo. Which you should be able to do as an endgame character. Now it’s like WTF?!
---
Make healing salves. You can sell 50 of em for 200 caps.
---
Simply do a google search for Fallout 76 PvP servers and several articles come up about the content being added in March. It's supposed to start in beta in March from everything I've read.
---
So they haven't made any progress yet? Sounds about right.
---
As long as its not robots ill agree. Give me super mutants or non ferrals or shit even talking animals. Anything but more robots. 
---
Do you have to buy the head first or something? I have 200 tokens and I do the daily quest everyday to earn 3 more and everytime I check the terminal the costume is not for sale? 
---
You are so full of shit.  I have maxed points in rifleman and demo.  Level 78 and it takes an entire 85 round drum magazine to kill a 2 level 68 ghouls.  Get the fuck outta here with your imaginary bullshit stats.  My tse shotgun now takes 7 shots to drop them.  That is 7 headshots.  And i dont spray, i hop on awnings or railings and throw short bursts with the handmade tse.  
---
I finally went to Camden vendor last night only to see the ridiculous price calibrated shocks cost. I died a little inside then. That is way the hell too much. They really need to cut these things in half.
---
I normally wait for my camp to load in before opening the pipboy. 
---
Jesus man, I already see so much hate for BHVR on r/deadbydaylight and now I have to see more in the r/fo76 subreddit? Come on, man...
---
nice work, although i wonder what these prices would be if player has 15 chr+hard bargain 3. (maybe i'll make a alt just for these purchases)
---
My silenced pump is great for CQB and corners.
---
Just wish I could silence my legendary lever action. 
---
I hear you. I think I can actually get loot from her 60-70 percent of the time, the rest is just wasted ammo and broken guns.
---
he still there?
---
Brutal. Fallout 76 is basically Myst as written by Cormac McCarthy
---
Ok, so it seems like a lot of players are experiencing it.  (Just an fyi, it’s definitely different after the patch).
---
Now, do you think that this behavior is a bug, or by design? I didn’t see anything in the patch notes that would reference it.
---
in game atoms lol. Wouldn't pay for this
---
It's my hope that they'll introduce content too as time goes on, making it feel like these things are actually happening along a real time line. When you &gt;!learn about the different raider groups with Rose's quests, it adds a tiny bit of backstory, but again, all of those raiders are dead.!&lt;  
---
 Though since it is an online game, I would like to see these events roll out like a "Living World" style, similar to Guild Wars 2 does it. If I we were required to pay any extra for it, I feel like a huge player base would disappear.
---
As a fan of sneaky builds. Lock picking and hacking would occasionally provide a tactical advantage in some hostile situations. In 76, it seems it's just for extra looting or to bypass a hidden pass code or something. These days I just keep those abilities equipped to provide my loot-happy teammates an excuse to think I can provide a useful skill to the team, and because I can't unlock the cards I *actually* want because my perception is capped and I don't want to invest any more into Intelligence knowing I'd have to respec those points later.
---
Lolz funny you mentioned that.
---
Submitted a bug to Bethesda couldn’t level the melee and pistol for orders quest.
---
A couple hours later, right as rain. Lolz
---
I found two at the Watoga brotherhood vender in the Super Duper Mart for 750 with all three levels of the Hard Bargain perk.  If he doesn’t have one, I could sell my spare if you really want it.  Just let me know 
---
Yeah you're right you do want Anti Armor or Furious, the next closest is Executioners. TSE are now 1 1/4 shot sparkler guns with bad accuracy. Leave out the Two shot aspect and explosives on guns are still good. Like a Anti Armor explosive or Furious explosive or even Executioners explosive are all better then TSE.
---
count yourself lucky if you have any of those!
---
I love building. I can help if you rebuild want. :) 
---
I do have Hard Bargain 3. That was used along with Grape Mentats to determine Best price. I’m going to be updating with what a previous comment referred to as “basement” price 
---
Right.
---
Keep in mind I mentioned having double the RR of a hazmat suit and triple of some power armor..... :\
---
its really powerful and this is the first time ive seen one
---
I'd love to join your group. Sounds like you have fun which is all I'm about.
---
A pickaxe
---
I would be ok with this note. 🤷
---
Wow, the pieces vanished or the whole frame?
---
No hate.....but if you traded for a full set of this armor it's extremely likely that at least 3 out of 5 pieces were duped into the game at some point NY someone.
---
I'd have to see at least a few examples before I could agree.
---
I have the calibrated plans and would craft them for you if you got the supplies and are on PS4.
---
You want to get in there ASAP, and if you miss it, sit on the corpse until the queen loot shows up. Sometimes the corpse will turn into a blood pile very quickly, so make sure you don't lose track of it.
---
I suspect the way it works is that all container requests on a server go into a queue, so if a lot of players are looking at containers then it can take a while.
---
My favorite are the ones titled "DON'T TOUCH" and "DO NOT TOUCH" to see people's reactions lol
---
Its hard to find those. Couldnt find anything in both trader subs. 
---
No matter what Bethesda does, somebody will make a long post detailing how to “fix” the game. If human NPCs are added, they would have to be impossible to kill and would always be crowded.  I wouldn’t mind that, but the people who are RPing as evil characters will be pissed that they can’t kill the npc and their “immersion” will be ruined and they will make a reddit post crying about how they will never buy another Bethesda game. But all that aside, I don’t mind if they add them, I just highly doubt they will
---
I'm mostly a solo player. I've never deliberately initiated PvP. I've also been griefed multiple times &amp; it was frustrating cuz I was new to the game. 
---
But I also really don't mind if another player attacks me if I pick up a supply drop they initiated, even if I only picked it up accidentally. I don't like being randomly murdered but choosing to participate in battles can be fun. 
---
I've had these forever and I don't have a clue what they do. 
---
Bump.
---
No PS4 is that a problem?

Player base is fine, from what someone else posted based on achievement data collected its still flourishing and like every single mmo out there, with them patching instead of release content (which i fully support, ide rather them come out better than the game release which everyone should agree with) its going to have a player base quantity reduction until a major in game event happens. That's normal. Probably 80% of player will return with the first major release at least for a month or 2.
---
I would like to see where you get this player base dying idea from also. The ban waves are for sure reducing player counts as they should.
---
I still need to figure out what to do with the dog helmet...
---
There’s a better grip, longer barrels (same length but the ends have a neat corkscrew twist), faster crank (only a little faster), double sized clip that reloads faster, a big ol’ drill bayonet, and ring sight that can’t be used to aim but raises accuracy a couple points. Found a bunch early on and scrapped them for some mods, then got a bunch at 50 or so and got the rest of them.
---
Rocking a fully modded legendary and it just mulches anything that isn’t a rad scorpion or a SB queen
---
The system that's in place is just fine. You can tweak and respec pretty easily.
---
inb4 "But it will take me 9 months to move points out of strength and get perks". That's rubbish. I don't know if most people try to level up by crafting, but in Fallout 76 you can get several levels a day without Whitesprings, server hopping, etc.
---
I was super smart and sold it all because I was all "wtf am I gonna do with lvl 25 gear that is crap anyway?" 
---
Then I saw that I could make a lvl 50 version of the items... But need the original to upgrade
---
Also the game is not "falling apart". Its gotten significantly better every patch. They are fixing 40 things and breaking 5. Im okay with that because eventually they will have it all worked out
---
Can I ask why you deleted your comment if you thought it was valid?
---
Thanks!  
---
People have been reporting either gains or lost total Carry weight, I have a friend that always gets a minus, and another that gets a bonus, it's very very strange.  But allot of people reported it was fixed for about 2 weeks, you think this is a separate issue?
---
The proposed fix should resolve it, both up and down, as  it changes the check / effect and put it at the power armor piece level, instead of the Main Power armor enchant 
---
Indeed.  For me, I was never that fond of 4's story.  It was trying to rehash the faction war in New Vegas, but it lacked the nuance and ultimately left me frustrated.  The NPCs were in such perfect, diametric opposition that the zero-sum conflict felt very artificial and contrived.  It needed a faction like Mr. House, who would rather exploit the other factions for his own gain than kill them.
---
76 won't win any awards for *how* it tells its story, but it returns to a darker, more cynical tone that I really appreciated.  And because you can't just pump an NPC for exposition, you are invited to fill in some of the details for yourself and that makes the story feel more meaningful to me.
---
To be fair to Lenny, those deathclaw eggs are delicious.
---
So far I brileve it caps at around 50ish. I tested on a s beast so results may vary
---
I'm not hurting for caps but It'd be nice to be able to sell them to offset the caps I spend on fast travelling
---
I'm not a heavy weapons user, but I do occasionally use energy weapons because they do more damage to the plethora of robots that seem to roam the forests of West Virginia. Comparing energy weapons to past games, I think I'd have a better chance fending off a Scorchbeast with the combat knife I picked off that dead Scorched than with an energy weapon.
---
The bright headlamp also, what the hairy hell?  
---
Thanks, will add it later.
---
Looked for 10 minutes after each battle, and typically enemies don’t immediately turn into meat piles 
---
oh? how much are you selling it for?
---
(gt is soureststraws by the way)
---
I dunno if a most likely post-lore-production nerf is really cause for outrage but aight
---
Killed a honey bee he was there but couldn’t collect, then my friend joined and respawned a new one. Killed him then collected loot from both, weird huh?
---
Does anti armo stack with tank killer? That would ignore 86% of enemies armor. 
---
How do you live?  X-men for life!
---
I literally just found this today. Very touching.
---
That is an interesting point about their mortality. That makes me wonder how that similar issue exists in the game now.
---
I had no problem with them. I took it as a challenge with the meele vs 2 shot. 
---
guitar sword is funny too
---
It's a buggy game. Things like that should be expected.
---
Is this serious? I can't tell. 
---
Yeah, slower gameplay is fine. Inventory management is fine. But what is there to be gained in making us craft ammo? Whenever a gameplay element is added, the developers should always ask themselves, "How will this improve the game?" Will it make the game more interesting? More challenging? More fun? What do you find interesting, challenging or fun about constantly having to look for lead, plastic, gunpowder, steel, etc., in order to craft ammo? It's a gameplay loop, yes, but is it necessary? I mean, The Division could have easily done the same thing. They could have given guns durability, and then forced us to craft ammo for each one. Just force us to run around New York, looking for lead and plastic. Why didn't they? Because it's not fun. They didn't want to force players into grinding for hours just to feed their guns.
---
Further, these things don't need to be mutually exclusive. If you love crafting ammo and managing tons of it in your inventory, have at it. The devs could easily let us craft specialized ammo, Bioshock-style, where shotguns had 3 different shell types: 00 buckshot, explosive buckshot and electric buckshot. Same with rifle ammo, it came with three types: regular, antipersonnel and antiarmor. FO76 could have let our guns run on infinite *basic* ammo, but if we wanted additional effects, we'd have to craft or buy that ammo ourselves. Bam. Now we have the option to use different ammo types, crafting is still there, but when you're fighting trash, you don't have to worry about ammo any more. The Division, incidentally, did this too, you collect consummables which make you fire flaming bullets for a while, for example. And these were limited. But ammo was limitless. So for your day-to-day generic shooting, you didn't constantly have to farm.
---
And if you search this subreddit, you can easily find people saying that after 80-130 levels they switched to melee, because they grew tired of constantly having to deal with ammo and repairs. It's one of the main reasons melee builds are so popular - a huge hassle of having to make and carry ammo is completely eliminated.
---
So while some of my ideas may seem horrible to you, they're not necessarily horrible. And ammo would do nothing to reduce inventory management, or speed up gameplay, developers can easily shift things around, and make other things, which are currently trivial, more important.
---
That's, I would argue, one of the main issues with the game right now. It has a lot of systems, but they are all trivial, and added together make the game an exercise in drudgery. We have thirst and hunger. But how hard is it to stay fed and watered? Not hard at all. But it's something you have to constantly be aware of, because your character has to eat and drink every 10 mins. How hard is it to be stocked up on ammo? It's not. Half an hour farming in Excavator with Super Duper, and you're set for hours. But that's forcing a player to do something they don't want to do, in order for them to do what they do want to do. It is not difficult, and dull, and not fun, but you have to do it. Which is textbook definition of drudgery. 
---
I always make sure I have my power armor on before I log out just to prevent this from happening. Also I never log out somewhere I know I may have a major issue with when I log back in
---
That whole scene was disturbing and a great example of environmental story telling that Bethesda is great at. Everything from jabbing drum sticks into caged mole rats to chucking bowling balls at Ragstags, it was brutal.
---
I spent an extensive time crafting in FO 4 as well as this game but continue to use tagged search regularly. I have a bad memory so it's not easy to remember every item that has components I don't use very often. Some items also don't appear very regularly and/or their components are not what I would expect. 
---
I had to stop building near water for my purifier with mine. No matter where it was or how I built I’d *always* spawn waist deep in radioactive water
---
I’d say same price so 750.  Gt is BenevolentDM and I’ll be on later tonight so let me know if the Watoga vendor doesn’t have it
---
what? it only shows the easiest spot to get the ring not both spots in the game. thats just a odd question
---
Get a plan for marine tactical helmets and sell them for 25 caps each. They take absolutely nothing of value to make...3 rubber, 1 plastic, 1 glass
---
Yes.
---
At first I was a little salty about my gun damage going to 120 instead of 400... But then I actually specced into the gun type and it does close to 200 or so, it's actually kind of refreshing not one shotting everything and having hordes actually terrify me now
---
couldn't agree more
---
I want to try jumping off the monorail next.  Might turn into a quick death though lol.
---
Good point
---
I used to own 3 from drops on the queen
---
This guy GTAs.
---
I almost don’t consider any bad experiences weird anymore, just part of the Bethesda experience lol
---
Not to sound combative, I don’t think duping was illegal, just immoral and unethical.
---
But I agree, folks got rich quick duping and destabilizing the game environment and ruining it for others.
---
I can definitely do this to deal with it. It's not a HUGE deal. But it is annoying and really compounded by the fact that when you try to open your pip boy as soon as you load in you're gonna be frozen for anywhere from 10 seconds to multiple minutes. 
---
Railway rifle
---
The problem is that the ranged weapons don’t do squat against serious enemies. They kill TSE - fine but they didn’t offer anything else in return. I’m also 100+ and I should not spend gazillions of bullets to kill a scorched beast and have two weapons and my pa break. It’s redicilous
---
&gt; Only after getting betrayed herself, did she understand her stupid actions.
---
No she didn't; even her mother said she was worse than the raiders when she learned her bullshit mentality was "The strong survive and do what they want–might make makes right" tripe. Whereas the raiders just want to prosper even if it means taking what they want and aren't necessarily even trying to justify it.
---
I Agree, I have 5 pieces in total that have the sentinel perk on them. I have never traded for any of the armor as I don't use it. I know its hard to believe me since dupers ruined the reputation of high levels but I'm one of those guys with close to 600 hours. Yes I work full time and no I haven't had a social life at all since this game has came out lol
---
How much supplies do they cost? 
---
nice!
---
I’ve noticed the same thing, and it also seems like having a perk each that lowers hunger and thirst rates are more effective now as well
---
Oh absolutely, couldn't agree more
---
I'm a solo player so I don't really care what other players have.
---
I will say that I enjoy guns and since I doubt Bethesda will buff guns...... I'm hoping they nerf melee until everyone is bitching about enemies being sponges.
---
Sold them kinda garbage if your not the build for it 
---
Its not the abilities. I have maxed agility, sneak, escape artist, sandman (the lot) chameleon gear and one piece of "you are hard to detect" and all is modded to help with sneak (shadowed etc). AND I GET SPOTTED BY RANDOM MOBS! While sneaking....
---
Even super mutants that I could previously sneak around now detect me (and its not the level).  Some even start to see me from what seems miles away and take pot shots with their stupid laser guns.
---
I removed and re-added all my perk cards, I dropped and picked up my gear and did not make a difference. So now I am just logging in once per day to sell bulk junk for caps.
---
Lack of stash storage killed my brother
---
I’m about to hop on and check
---
do you have adrenal reaction? was it 180 base or boosted somehow?
---
also, is the range really infinite? like, there's no damage dropoff?
---
we said it days before the stupid nerf hit the servers. But nobody at Bethesda cared. Think they finally reached their goal of people leaving
---
What? Get a hazmat suit
---
Ive noticed that on my melee character ive been getting a lot of unyielding and legendary melee weapons
---
My very first explosive was a doozy. At level 60ish, I was blessed with a Medic's Black Powder Rifle. Before the nerf, I believe the damage was 693 per shot. Mind you, I was a rifle type of gal so I had the 3 Rifleman perk cards applied all the time. But being able to take out a horde of level 68 ghouls in one shot? Gorgeous. Spent 90% of my time reloading but with good ol' Marsupial, I just kept jumping while I'm loading up a .50 caliber. Still a good gun after the nerf though.
---
Well said
---
what’s stupid is that no ranged weapons do exist for the endgame. Remove TSE fine. But create diversity. 
---
The people who post positive takes on this sub are just a network of overseers.
---
"I guess one person’s trash is another persons treasure. And trust me this game is trash,” Angry Joe. 😂
---
I noticed your hunting rifle is level 10. It's important to keep upgrading as you level. You should have the plans for it if you've been following the main questline, so craft a level 20 one, and scrap any you loot to open up mods. You'll definitely want the hardened receiver for it. Keep leveling up gunsmith so you can craft the mods too.
---
As others have mentioned some builds only really come together at higher levels. Until then use whatever gets the job done. 
---
You can use the build planner at https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks to see what you might want.  
---
Weird. I don’t remember mentioning melee at all.
---
And I run a shotgun build mate.
---
I was arguing for the TSE nerf, not against any melee nerf.
---
Now if u want my opinion on melee, I think it’s too strong currently, even without Legendaries like Bloodied.
---
No ammo stockpiling, they cost less resources to repair, and have higher dmg. With no melee investments I can get a Death Tambo to output more dps than my fully perk invested combat shotgun and I never have to worry about running out of ammo.
---
Look man, I understand u probably didn’t mean to be a jerk but not everyone that thinks the TSE nerf was a good thing is a melee player. Instead of assuming that, just ask what my thoughts were on the topic. Just because it’s the internet doesn’t mean we have to be trolls.
---
Seriously no hate.
---
I'm just looking at it mathematically.
---
In theory one would have needed to kill somewhere in the realm of 3,000,000 3* legendaries in 80 days to have 5 pieces drop. Not probable doesn't mean not possible and I'm definitely not hating on you. I'm a solo player so I don't really care what gear anyone else has.
---
Like I said if Bethesda released the data on how many 3* legendaries have been killed so far we could get a pretty accurate number as to how many people should actually have a full set.
---
congrats m8. Now you can throw it happily away since it’s damage is reduced by 80% 
---
Are you kidding me? I respected my level 50 character and got all the rifleman perks for it. Damnit I’m done.
---
This is really entertaining and the guy has a real.... soothing voice.
---
Yes, I bulked a bunch of stuff and then did the usual scrap all junk after picking some stuff up and it scrapped all the bulk items too.
---
&gt;Don't they all have player specific loads so everyone get the overseer stuff? As in. I take my share you still have yours... so if I put stuff in there doesn't it just disappear to the ether?
---
Things like the boiled water and dog food that spawn in the chest are instanced, but admitting placed in their by a player will show up for anyone else who looks. 
---
Have you used blueprints? I've gotten in the habit of blueprinting everything cuz the first time that happened I'd spent a long time building around an existing structure and it suuucckkkeedd
---
Problem is the ammo and durability sadly.
---
Yep. I noticed it as well. Thankfully, I'm now playing just for achievements and I'm only 3 levels from level 100. Then I can put down my controller and reflect on the pre-order that ended all of my future pre-orders.
---
That is literally the best option left. Maybe if enough players follow suit the game will be finally corrected 
---
I literally got nothing. It was my first scorch queen kill, my first attempt after getting a hazmat suit, and I got nothing. 
---
THEN, I glitched into a ditch and couldn’t move. No fast travel out, and I was just expecting to slowly die of radiation. Finally a scorched came by, and I was able to VATS attack it and freed myself, but jeez. The most disappointing event. I’m on PS4. 
---
But all the time, it’s Bethesda!
---
In a couple areas the scorched mobs spawn right next to the turret, giving zero time to kill them. The scorchbeast usually target me but the mobs completely ignore me and rush the turret if they didn’t spawn next to it.
---
from my testing the range is infinite no drop off ( just in accurate ) and there appears to be a invisible cone of fire still present as its explained in the video, yes i have a min max build with adrenal reaction, 188 damage was the most i was able to get
---
welcome to fallout 76. I lost a gatling tse that I bought from another player that way. 
---
yes that is true, hopefully bethesda fix the durability on laser rifles gatling plasmas and the flamer soon
---
Protip: have a hazmat as one of ur favorites..u should have enough time put it on before ur rad bar fills up
---
Well, my day yesterday was amusing.  I was exploring The Mire with a friend and came across this unmarked treehouse.  He's off somewhere else, so I start climbing it, and this Wendigo leaps down from above and screams at me.  I fall out of the treehouse instinctively backpedaling from it, almost kill myself.  I think this was the first truly legitimate jump scare I had in the game at 200 hours.
---
So later, we rendezvous at Whitesprings Station.  He's in there selling things and I'm just crouched on the rooftop admiring the view.  I leap down when I see him start to move and he's clearly startled by my appearance.  "Rawr, I'm a Wendigo!" 😂
---
if youre the right build for it its a pretty beastly weapon, wouldnt recommend for scorchbeasts tho 
---
They don't care, move on.
---
That's an excellent idea, thanks. 
---
This morning, after 3 hours of grinding West-Tek for Steel, Plastic, and Gears... My friend and I were headed to Watoga to Bulk, Craft Ammo, Sell, and Dump legendaries in the suitcase when we spotted a 3 star Protectron.
---
Little did we know that these Protectrons were extra explosive and a single legendary exploded 3 times... when we respawned, another player was in the middle of stealing all our Junk, then ran off and server hopped as soon as he was confronted.
---
Not as annoying as your disconnect, but you gotta love when glitches cause opportunities for this kind of bs.
---
Somebody out there is bound to get lucky. I have over 200 hours and have found one -15% damage while sprinting and zero -15% damage while standing still armor pieces. I've found one tse, one explosive-only, and a couple two shot only weapons
---
Wait so they re-spawn? where are they in the fort I must have passed them.
---
Yeah they tried to fix a thing where weapon mods were scraping. The fix caused this bug.
---
Aside from what everyone has already explained about the loading? Because it's a damn eyesore. There's a reason the fast travel marker in 4 was a doormat, it was small, flat and inconspicuous. Even in a single player game they knew you didn't want to have something sitting in the middle of a settlement just to mark the fast travel point. 
---
Human interaction being having the game played for you? Yeah must be pretty autistic to hate that.
---
don’t worry. People downvoting is normal. It has nothing to do with the quality of your post. 
---
I think personally you are right. There is literally nothing to do in the endgame and after the patch it’s not even worth logging in anymore 
---
Wow's rng is why i quit after 2  months .The new zones were actually pretty amusing and i had a good time leveling. Where they lost me was me trying to gear up and play as much as i can so i could raid and be an asset to my guild. Instead after weeks people who barely logged in other then to do a dungeon or 2 a night started out gearing me by margins just on rng drops.  That pvp player zone was not kind to me and those drops were just as terrible while i saw people getting gear that out did any of my work. Who wants to play a game like that. 
---
Fallout 76 is isn't quit like that but fairly similar. The end game is simply bombing greenbrier and farming ghouls..which they nerfed exp and the shit loot . Not that it was ever good to begin with. THen option b is the queen who drops nothing.  All of this fun the first 2-3 times but ultimately boring and shallow with no pay off for the grind or strife in any capacity. No long term factions to unlock, no patterns, no money gains, infact it punishes you for it. What kind of system is that. 
---
 All of this blanketed over gathering rare bits for my power armor and fighting over the only bullet generating location that was also nerfed. Which again is pointless because shotgun guy comes out of nowhere to take it over. 
---
Ok so ill just take over obscure workshops to dick around and build a fun themed building. Oh shit another dickhole with a shotgun talking about fucking my mother takes it. Somehow im paying for my own murder and now when i go to take it back it costs me 200 caps and i pay for my death again. 
---
You cant even get a social group going at the  point i quit because everyone sticks to themselves or has their mic turned off/group chat  now and are in discord talking about  some middle aged asshole warped to them and is trying to get a conversation going. Greenbrier is a shit place to socialize and there is no other common ground place to meet without being potentially attacked by a troll or raising some red flags for the safety of anyone.  The two times i actually  did make friends was on launch and one month in. But both times within 2 weeks they quit. I made a few friends in passing but never in a way where we grouped. It was mostly to reduce cap costs on traveling since that system as well is punishing and flawed.
---
All of this yet i am brainwashed somehow in saying i liked the game.Because when people ask i can describe moments that were amazing. Because all the way to the point where i launched a nuke coop and killed broodmother that first time. I had a blast. It was the following  month and half trying to find anything to claw onto that was shit slide. All while bethesda just sprayed at me with a hose. 
---
The picture with you sitting on the couch in the water is great.
---
It reminds me of my old apartment.
---
As far as I can remember, radscorpion omelet cures one addiction. Of course, you'll need to find the recipe and egg(s). However, it IS a craftable cure for addiction.
---
I can’t find any information on trophies not popping when they should.  
---
I haven’t gotten the trophy for reaching level 100, and I've seen a few people talk about not getting reach level X trophies, but not that much about it :/
---
Same thing with drum on quad combat shotgun. Doesn’t give full amount (36 instead of 48). I submitted a ticket on it
---
He was silent for 2 years everyone thought he was dead lol
---
then they said, it's by design lol 
---
dev gonna fix it next patch
---
I want to enjoy the game which is why I come here and provide my feedback. Currently the game isn't where it needs to be for me.
---
hehe. Yes. That is what we warned about before the patch. Melee was already super OP before. But at least you could fight back with the TSEs. Now we’ll you better create a melee character...
---
I think everyone should do it solo the first time. It certainly gives it an element of surprise. 
---
Bethesda has demonstrated how little they know Fallout players that I find your reasoning ridiculous.
---
No i didnt! That looks hopeful in terms of future content
---
&gt;Responder codes
---
I'm not sure what "Responder codes" you're talking about. Could you or someone else clarify for me? Thanks!
---
I've been noticing my water has been draining much quicker than i would expect. Been re-specing and have recently taken a point out of endurance. I dropped the perk which how much drinks quench your thirst and i still have the increased food one.
---
Seems to me that having that perk is maintaining my hunger level, even though the perk is supposed to do so. A top up to 100% food and drink left me with about 75% hunger and 25% water. My money is on the perk being bugged.
---
No I mean players who reached end game content early on and complained had fellow community members saying "You rushed the game and played it wrong" to anyone who brought up that sort of issue. 
---
Haha, absolutely. Faster than they can scream ;)
---
oh! I just discovered  his work.
---
If it is close enough to ground zero, it is destroyed.
---
Death from above mother fucker. 
---
Because the game loads the terrain, then you, then structures.  So if you load inside the camp perimeter it could create a juxtaposition situation and you could get stuck in a camp object or some other hilarity would ensue.
---
TSE Gauss 
---
there are reddits and forums for trades /r/fo76bazaar

How about they just bring back ammo scrapping.
---
Exactly what I had hoped for.  Thanks!!!
---
No doubt people hit the pick 6 lotto all of the time.
---
It's just that you usually don't see 50 people on the same chat board hit the pick 6.
---
That's not how it works. A comedy doesn't have to have every single one of its frames and every word of its dialogue be funny, some can choose to have occasional dark and serious or dramatic and somber moments too if they want. And it only makes them look more impressive if they can actually successfully pull it off within a comedy. 
---
&gt;1400 caps a day already seems like plenty.
---
It uses to seem like plenty, but then the price of most armor and weapon plans tripled. 
---
taking her down is a chore now. no reason to waste all those resources when there's nothing to gain.
---
it's not even a cool battle, she's just an oversized bat spamming critters.
---
There were 4 of them in the lower level lab on one of the steel tables.  I was hunting screws and plastic when i found them.
---
don’t worry you can’t trash the game. Bethesda did a fine job at that already
---
I was just playing for about 90min then had the 'server/controls not responding' and got disconnected
---
I think its factored in before modifications. ie: (base mag * 4) + gun mag modification or else some guns would be flat bullet spitters (Handmade with drum mag is 85 no legendary effect)
---
She looks like she's already pregnant but I guess you could give it a go.
---
I was think just cutting remark and barbs we can fling at each other like we do in reddit.  Very hurtful, should fit in nicely. ;)
---
It might be classified as a heavy weapon, though Im not too sure
---
BRAVE
---
No, not at all. 
---
The only thing I’ve noticed outside of the caution is that if there’s another player fighting up close or say a scorched is fighting a super mutant it says caution but I can’t score with my sneak bonus even though I’m cloaked with chameleon and sneak peeks on that I can still walk up beside them in caution 
---
I've got one to add: if you crouch in PA, your vertical look sensitivity decreases. (Or is hard-set to a lower value than mine is)
---
Quad applies to the base capacity only, and magazine mods go up or down from that in absolute units.
---
I have a quad handmade with 80 rounds base, 70 with the best armor piercing magazine that normally drops the capacity to 10.  I’m glad it’s not 40 rounds.
---
If you get a quad, forget capacity mods, they are not multiplied and you should just go with AP mags.
---
for flux you need nuke zones. And farm it. It sucks. Nope. Not an alternative
---
you can also filter by flair on the right
---
The "retake X workshop" events are almost always 1 wave vs 3-4 waves for a "defend X" mission, so I ignore the defend missions and then reclaim the shop. 
---
Yeah there's nothing I can say that will not sound like I'm lying so yeah idk man guess I lucked out ( But not really though cuz all I want is Vanguards with item weight reduction, and all I get is stupid sexy sentinels)
---
Indeed. Thanks for letting me know xx
---
That building was really inspired and well done.  I have to marvel at what's not in the video, the hours of meticulous trial and error.
---
I unlocked the plan to do this today on PS4 but my PS plus ran out about an hour ago and don't have the money for it at the moment, good luck finding one though 
---
compensating the games bugs / lack of content by removing the fun parts?
---
I haven't played other games where I can build something as complex and watch other players interact with it, so for me that process is still new and enjoyable. 
---
I like hearing people laugh at my silly CAMPs.
---
I also enjoy building weird stuff around in-game content and surprising people who have been farming the same thing or going to the game area 500 times and suddenly encounter an unexpected trap or etc.
---
I don't think most people enjoy the repetitive nature of farming, but for me it's more about the end result.
---
Don’t knock the laser rifle until you have a 2 shot scattered automatic variant. It’s deadly
---
On the 26/01/18 I had an issue with PA. At the headquarters when making my excavator pa, if I entered it when on the pa stand my game bugged out, removing my UI and allowing me only to fast travel. I managed to get outside and all I could do was exit the pa, which led to long arms!
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/4HxsDn5
---
I had to leave the server for it to fix. I don’t know what combination of actions causes it to happen, but my game does not like me getting into my excavator armour at all!
---
it’s another bug. It’s not a heavy weapon either since the perk cards don’t affect it

Some of us may even enjoy radworms, as it’s the closest thing to a pet I’m going to get. I call my worms Englebert.
---
They would probably do more damage than 75% of the in game weapons, lol.
---
Without Flux bloodied guns 1 shot every enemy aside from scorchbeasts and mirelurk queens.
---
1 bullet
---
With superduper &amp; ammosmith 2 you make a whole lot more than 1 bullet
---
And you get range advantage (no rads from ghouls, and with marsupial &amp; speed demon you can literally dodge everything including scorchbeast attacks)
---
Trade off is you have to make bullets. Big deal 
---
yup, same thing here, that last patch must have nerfed and bullet sponged everything to hell. I'm the same level as you, went into Site Bravo for first time with L50 all rise, gatling plasma, and a bunch of ballistic weapons. EVERYTHING took fucking forever to kill. Even the stupid maintenance bots and protectrons were sponges. Gutsys and Assaultrons were a nightmare. And I was in L50 X-01 with optimized bracers, power meleeing everything and still getting my ass kicked. Used up all my ammo, stimpacks, and broke half my weapons and kept getting killed before I could even find the control room. Finally tapped out and rage quit. Very god damn annoyed with what a tedious slog this game has become.
---
Idea #1 is absolutely genius
---
My money is on this item being available in the Atom store.
---
&gt; (I think unmentioned)
---
It's literally the only negative effect it has and is mentioned...
---
thanks for telling us your console or if your on pc
---
Your right . I did one last night and I’ll admit there was two other people and that’s it . We was sooooo close to killing her but we didn’t . So that’s when I decided to quit the queen . 
---
why waste so much ammo / resources? doesn’t make sense after the nerf anymore. This exactly what we warned about before the patch. Bethesda made sure to nuke their own game 
---
I just didn’t put it in the title. Don’t get you undies in a bunch.
---
But there's also something going on with how much food and drink restore that balances it out. I'm getting 37% of my thirst back from a single purified water instead of 25 % and 45% from dog food with the perk instead of 30%
---
I agree it sux. I don’t spend a lot of time playing so I can’t afford to loose anything. If your gonna stick around white springs go to the train station it puts you just out side the blast radius also
---
I think what we need to do is move on. Come back in 6 months if this game is still such a mess / has no endgame content 
---
Just my anecdotally experience. Maybe something changed in the recent patches?
---
If I took a guess, I would say this is because the railway rifle is not really a rifle at all since it does not use gun powder..
---
Just use the vpn to put your location in nz, then activate, and done. Don't have to do anything else special
---
Chemist is particularly useful when teamed with Super Duper 👍
---
good luck finding players now 
---
I’m on Xbox . And I did a nuke ( died 3 times ) while doing it alone .  After I biked the queen I was with two other people . And I personally think it’s worthless u less you want fluxes. I’m done with the queen . I’m off to whitesprings . Where you can farm legendary‘s . 
---
And I can’t use any of my two shot explosive . 
---
So I use a harpoon gun . Does 800 damage 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
&gt; found 2 calibrated shocks for my x01 the weight reducing perks don't really matter much anymore.
---
As someone that has 2x calibrated shocks+motion assist+14 Str I couldn't disagree more.
---
Yeah more or less commenting whats happening hopefully the right eyes might see this. Im not at a comfortable "lets go waste some ammo" point or i would have went down there just hard seeing things head in this direction.
---
I did it once at the peak, I got absolutely nothing, the group I was with (15 of us) were in a party and at least 6 or 7 glitched and had no loot, after 30 mins of hard work I got some ultracite boots which were worse then my current legendarys
---
Be constructive, not cuntstructive. 
---
I'll check that out when I play again, thanks for that!
---
If you get an open server they will all spawn. My level 94 character had 2 for a while eventually some spawned while legendary hunting n I was at 5 now I’m at 7 so they will randomly spawn 1-2 in the golf club pro shop I believe. I started a new character about 2 weeks ago n found myself on a sever by myself at like 2am on a weekday n decided to try my luck in whitesprings. Not only did I get all the unruly ghouls in 10mins but all I had to do was 1 lap around area in the manner you had mentioned. Couldn’t believe how easy it was with no one else around. 
---
Order of Mysteries, perhaps? I forget the name of it, but one of the items the machine crafts for you is a pistol with bonus damage against robots. I probably ought to hunt down lowbie bots in the Forest with mine. I'm a rifleman, BTW.
---
yep. That is the best thing to do.
---
It will force the managers to see that ignoring the community does kill the revenue. And hopefully it will turn around by then
---
By ground zero you mean the Red circle on the map?
---
It's just not worth it. The first time I did it post-Patch 5, her health got stuck and simply refused to deplete any further.  Total waste of resources.
---
I've watched the quest complete more-or-less regularly since then, but I haven't been keen to go back and participate myself because you get nothing out of it for all the stuff you waste.
---
check the neighbors trash can 
---
What the fuck did I just read
---
Did he just say "zee, a lot"?
---
Completely anecdotal, but I feel like I get Bloodied a lot with this character and probably have a pip boy screen of Bloodied weapons to prove it. I don't really think there's a character seed.
---
So the theory is CHA in groups changes loot drops but what about solo? I'm sitting at 8 CHA, 10 LCK, 19 INT.
---
Makes too much sense. If they do that five other things would break.
---
I hope not just make it like you go to a vendor and pay 5K that seems okay 
---

So spent a total of (4) Hours submitting Power Armor Bug reports as you requested, in detail.  
---
Spent another 45 minutes responding to emails, in more than a couple they advised sharing the issue to BethNet and/or Social Media.  
---
Is it typical to be [Chastised](https://i.imgur.com/vg7I93O.png) for submitting tickets?  
---
None of the tickets in question were duplicates, in fact the majority of the tickets responded to were closed as such.
---
Yeah it does, you could even throw a perforating mag on the gun which some redditor did the math on and it was about 7% armor ignoring, so in total you could be ignoring around 90% to 94% armor
---
no. I’m done with that. Bethesda obviously does not care for one bit about what the communities concerns are and keeps ignoring it 
---
I used to pvp until I took a stash box to the knee.  We all know how that turned out.
---
Before the TSE nerf, it took a group on non mix/MAXers a while and a lot of ammo. But now, it’s just not worth the cost in ammunition to do it.  Let the Melee who are the real OP group do it.
---
Some of (if not all of) the contouring and Shadow on your weapons is part of the texture map image. They could just make one texture map for color and use it on every weapon but they would either have to leave the shadows and contours out or it would look really weird where they don't line up on other weapons.
---
I honestly have no idea
---
Close to the center of it.
---
I accidentally scrapped my Blade Of Bastet. And there is no way to get it back....
---
Saw three different SBQ fights going on yesterday on PS4. Somebody also nuked the hunter resort in the Toxic Valley. There were two nukes on Vault Tec U. The only one that went abandoned was the hunter resort.
---
I used to pvp until i took a stash box to the knee.
---
dementia
---
You must be one of the "victims" that complained to Daddy Bethesda to get the weapons nerfed?
---
Yeah it is, but it makes more aware of coming into a fight reloaded.   There is a receiver that improves reload speed.  
---
I've been to every corner of Appalachia. It is apparent there is no future in this world. I hear the whistle and move my camp to the center of the blast zone. I remove my armor and wear my black tuxedo and hat and calmly wait. I have reached the end game content.
---
😆
---
dude it does not matter. Bethesda didn’t listen to the community until now and that won’t change. So let ppl wish crazy stuff - it won’t change a thing
---
Its been doing this all day. I tried getting on several hours ago but it just kept dumping me as soon as I connected just like its doing now sadly. That's if the game doesn't crash or cause my xbox to log me out in the middle of a game screen.

---
Can't wait!!
---
From what I hear you cant finish that questline yet to find out. But honestly I haven't gotten that far story wise, i keep getting distracted 
---
I have 5 two shots im holding onto until Bethesda changes their mind and buffs them again 🙄
---
This is a fun and interesting idea. I hope it's considered.
---
*nod*  
---
Thanks, I'll include that in the "Character" round up when I get to it!  
---
In the same boat actually, seems to have stopped tracking.
---
I was on a SBQ fight with about 16-20 others (second time in as many days) yesterday and only about 25% of us got any loot from anything after the queen died. Everyone else got constant spinning arrows. A couple of players said they didn't get the "quest complete" announcement until 5 or more minutes after the queen had been defeated. One guy said his "gatling plasma is broken" message came up 10-15 minutes after it actually broke.
---
PC or Console?  
---
If PC, Standard or Ultra-Wide display?
---
Idea - 9/10
---
Possibility of Bethesda implementing it - 0/10
---
Literally all we do on this sub is post suggestions, get the canned response of   
---
"Thanks I'll tell the team"
---
and never hear of it again.
---
Finding the problems isn't the hard part, Its letting go
---
System?
---
Why are you using ammo on mole rats? Get a machete or snag blades/blunts from enemies. Whack 'em already. 
---
The Recon Sensors Mod for Power Armor Helmer’s literally does not work. It is supposed to be a Recon Scope type modification for Power Armor. I have it installed on 5 sets of Power Armor and it simply no longer works. Not on T-60, X-01, or T51b. 
---
It was working a few weeks after beta; as I have had it installed on my X-01 since shortly after launch. You can aim at an enemy with a scope or iron sights and it will literally do nothing. No pip no anything. 
---
I have even gone as far as it remove the mod, server hop Modus for a new one, and reinstall it on my X-01 to no avail. 
---
Does this happen frequently?
---
Should be an album cover for some late 80s/early 90s group.
---
I’m using PS4, but I would imagine that it would be handy for Xbox and PC players too.
---
Well, with just using a level 2 traveling pharmacy card, my characters weight sits around 240-250 lbs with about 20 purified water on me and a handful of canned dog food. It leaves me with around 140 lbs of carry weight which i rarely hit in a sitting. Obviously the way different people play the game will change how much carry weight they need, but was just saying that they are definitely not 'required' on a PA build
---
Yep, I'm still casually hopping for my second mod from Camden because the price is too high. 
---
Exactly zero of the creation club mods took more effort than the main dlc’s. 20% of something using their tools and game which was agreed upon prior to the creation of the mod. They’ve either get paid as part of creation club or don’t at all. Poor execution does not make a good idea a bad idea.
---
I always spawn under the floor of my garage and have to spam jump to escape or fall through the map and then drop in from the sky and super slam my corn.
---
Gauss rifle works still tho
---
Actually, I do have Targetting HUD... I think the problem last night was mainly due to my internet connection, but i regularly experience issues, so I wonder if that might be the culprit?? Interesting... I'll try taking that of tonight and see if it makes things better. Thanks for the suggestion!
---
done with that. Bethesda doesn’t care for the community at all. They made that crystal clear by the constant ignoring. But they will care if most players leave the game :) 
---
That is what I call constructive. Fire the director and let the new one build up again. 
---
Ahhh so not a plea for someone to shoot you ASAP 
---
Unlocking a player owned lock always gives you a bounty. What the f you on about? 
---
I'm with you on the supply drop. But if someone locks their c.a.m.p. you get a bounty. Trust me. Level three lockpick and a dozen ten cap bounties experience talking here 
---
I want to know why the fast travel mat isnt availabe at camps.
---
Just because I'm a nitpicky turd (sorry) I want to mention that air rifles are a thing. I believe a "rifle" is named as such because the barrel is "rifled" as in it has a spiraled groove cut inside the barrel. Of course, since the railway rifles shoots railroad spikes that would not fit in a traditional barrel, its barrel likely isn't rifled and therefor it, uh, still isn't a rifle :p
---
bloodied is broken and will be nerfed soon. 
---
Serious question. What is coal used for
---
Waiting for enemies to *not* be bullet sponges, which will be never.
---
lmao, "super slam my corn"
---
Sure, but you should load after your CAMP. Lazy coding is not an excuse.
---
Well, that was dumb.  On both sides.
---
No tikee no washee.  Basic principle of software support and chinese laundries.
---
I've just started using the tesla rifle to get at least one hit on each enemy for the XP, it doesn't damage team mates (but will attack other players not on your team)
---
It wasn’t a player owned lock. I had a quest to recover a supply drop, when I opened it it put the bounty on me.  I know about picking player locks, that will and always have put bounty on you. But this is not that. Supply drops aren’t owned by players like that. Especially if I have a quest to go get it.
---
i quit doing it ages ago for this reason, it got way too repetitive with the only reward being another explosive vent and some one star wood armor
---
No... I’m not ‘Wanted’ right now... LOL
---
I am thinking that it’d be useful to have an emote that you could use in game to basically ask someone to ‘End It All’ for you, so you can lose the ‘Wanted’ status.
---
This is why I block everyone in the server upon loading in.
---
Vault dwellers vs. Enclave
---
On PS4 is that a problem?
---
Please fix the enclave bunker vendors. They do not work. They say, "Vendor busy, try back later"
---
Yep i dont care about tse guns, dont experience any bugs and dont like to grind so i dont
---
Been having a great time with the game
