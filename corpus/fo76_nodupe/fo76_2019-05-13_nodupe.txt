The last person who bought me out almost completely, (I quickly pulled what I could out from my stash), then tried tirelessly to kill my pet Mirelurk King and then me. I had accidentally picked up that mutation that shocks people when you get hit by melee, I forget the name but I'm pretty sure it's different from Unstable Isotope. Thankfully it didn't initiate PvP but I just jumped servers right away. I wish shutting the machine off actually stopped selling things.

It took me a little work, but I found plenty of dead creatures around the fissures.
---
I might do this. Me and my boyfriend started going to peoples camps and messing around with them (in a light hearted way) and then we would tell them how much we like their camp. Bringing some fun and kindness back into the wasteland!
---
Server. But you can put a fertilizer pen in your camp and milk/slaughter/repair it to your heart’s content (at least until they patch that)
---
Abuse wat?
---
Good call! I played all the instruments down there when I went to see Biv yesterday ...and they didn’t count either.  Thanks for the reply
---
yes and then i heard in an interview released later  by one of the devs that that wasnt true and that they did it cause bethesda thought its useless and not needed
---
I somehow managed to transfer it to my mule. So no camera on my main, but I have it on my mule, who can't use it do to no film/not having completed the quest. Not sure what would happen if I did do the quest with that character, would I have two? I can't drop it in a container, so I have no idea how it happened. I assume it glitched when I was rapidly transferring a large amount, but I can't get it to replicate.
---
It just made me really angry because I realized that it was part of this game's cheap underhanded tactics to keep you grinding away for crafting materials.
---
New contents are always super welcome. They are easy anyway if you have a mate to do them with. They don't feel like a chore anymore and sometimes they help me see again places i would probably never touch,like devil's backbone.
---
They’ve all been moved behind counters, just look around
---
They didn't pay the vendor taxes
---
Harsh, but fair
---
Agreed
---
May I request a map for Light machine gun (MG42) spawns and their plans? 
---

---
If this service ever becomes run by the end user the program would be considered godlike for its absolute usefulness - generating my own maps for specific items would be amazing
---
lol I don't think I've seen that before
---
Let's hope Bethesda catches up.
---
Still online? I have 1 stable violet flux at the moment. IGN roundyroundy
---
Encryptid never even happens because no one wants to spend their caps
---
Once and it was after I moved a few feet to the side after spawning in. I just fast traveled away and walked back.
---
I stopped when you had to run around to Max it out. Even though it's easier I still don't anymore
---
Other than buying plans From the vendor I never need a lot of caps
---
This, I like this much.  Like a vendor machine row by ws station
---
Never thought of that but makes sense, good tip!
---
Survival server?
---
I'm hoping for Bridge Day this fall.
---
Probably will require power armor to complete without dieing though.
---
 I've seen death claws do that at the abandoned waste dump, freaks me out!
---
Oh yeah.  Very true.  It is partially due to your personal data gating based on your provider and plan, in addition to server age, number of players in the cell, how long since server maintenance occurred, etc, etc.  I've had off-peak 76 gaming that was lightning fast, as if I were playing Fo4, and other times where I'd wait for several minutes on a pile of ghouls at the Whitespring to populate their loot.
---
Also I'll be vendoring some weps come see me there Killah_rnginu!!
---
Following. I'm having trouble also, I've tried endarol; didn't work. Then I made a new blank stringer; didn't work. I tried on multiple versions of a Yao gui incase that was a problem. I think it's bugged unfortunately
---
I'm level 36, and I went there today and got attacked by my first mothman. Not cool.
---
What platform are you on?
---
I would even buy just a jangles keychain
---
cap stashes for camps. having a free cap spawning cap stash could be too much
---
Where you able to make the frog habitat and it register? I wasn't sadly :(. My gulper photo and radtoad photos were also bugged.
---
Also can't forget your trusty aligned stock
---
Can I join in?
---
But how since you can’t choose a server? How can you “visit” a place? Or maybe you can’t? Unless you get a roll of the dice or if you first need to be friends?
---
Other guy hasn’t responded yet so sure
---
You sound so happy about your parasites lol
---
This is why the forest is a good spot. I moved to be on a lead extractor, but my old camp was on the junk pile in the Ohio river. There was always protectrons, liberators, ghouls, and scortched spawning there but who cares, they're level 1-5. Do literally any damage and they'll die.
---
Yep makes sense...just wanted to verify.
---
XBOX.
---
He meant a cap stash box, not a caps stash to get free caps
---
Request sent
---
It's a shame no one wanted to buy the high quality food and drinks I put up for sale for the buffs you can get from them. Company Tea, Sweet Blackberry Tea, Yao Guai Roast, Tasty Squirrel Stew, Assorted Cranberry dishes. There's so much passive power in the buffs you can get from higher quality food yet only so many seem to want to actually use them, the most I was charging even for higher stuff was around 60 caps. :(
---
Add to that the fact that there's no way to slow down the food/drink degradation unless they're in your inventory and I have even less of a chance to sell such items.
---
Junkie builds are fun. If you dont mind losing a lot of special points from withdrawls.
---
Yea but by that time the three of us jave probably completed them all and its doesnt concern us anymore. But atleast it will then be less frustrating for the new players. :)
---
Bethesda really does do stupid things some times, but I still love Fallot76.
---
He said a cap stash, not a capS stash
---
I’ve always thought the artillery should be a quick volley of artillery instead of an explosion ever 5 seconds. Say you have 3 cannons altogether. Instead of the 3 minute strike, what about a 15 second long quick attack. Similar to what is seen in real life and the artillery support used in Battlefield V.
---
Go with vanguard like the other guy said, as for weapons and perks I would go crit build. I've always gone for crit builds in fallout games but in 76 particular I like that you choose where and when to put a critical cuz with the right weapons and stuff I'm literally mowing through tough enemies. Have perks to fill crit meter quickly, bust out a bp rifle or the dragon for your crit headshot and you'll drop most enemies right there. On average your damage won't be impressive but don't underestimate criticals if you use them right
---
[removed]
---
The people programming the site are completely unrelated to the people programming the game.
---
I like this idea better.  Can be used for Bloatfly glands and teddy bears too.
---
You can also get a long scope for combat shotguns for whatever reason.
---
Like hey, you know what this short-range weapon needs? *A scope that can spot people across a gorge*
---
Btw I dont know how crit builds do in pvp, if you can't vats other players it's probably bad for pvp
---
Running bloodied I can get my TSE Gauss to deal 704 damage. Just saying
---
True enough! Maybe by the time the bugged ones are fixed, the tracking will be too, and we'll be able to utilise it for the last few steps.
---
IGN is stinkyglen
---
Why's that?
---
I’ve thought about doing this myself, having a simple camp made to look like a radio tower. Simple enough so I could place it anywhere, and find populated areas (white spring, cranberry bog during SBQ) to set up. At that time, I would use my mic and a Bluetooth speaker to “broadcast” my station through the area speech. On top of that, I could also be a DJ for said radio station, adding a very nice RP element to the game. I have yet to tackle said project, but I may do so soon.
---
Similar on PC. I got credit for kill a Yao gui with a pipe syringer but didn’t get credit for shoot a Yao gui with a syringer. Seems bugged.
---
Apex legends has me hooked. And i dont even like Battle royals.
---
It is a bit of caps to save up, but if you just get Marsupial, you can probably sell the serums and make up your money before too long.
---
Look on the bright side. 45 steel scrap. lol.
---
Doesnt it only happen at a specific time? How can u farm it?
---
Cool to do and play around with, but not cool in pvp.
---
Can you learn mods by scrapping? I haven't tried yet.
---
Yes its a chore! Lol
---
Nope, frog habitat failed too. I got the angler and wolf photos to work. I see the yao gai and brahmin text tags when using the camera but it doesn't check off the challenges.
---
This and every other explosive energy weapon. BE +AGI handmade has also been duped again.
---
Bethesda needs to track items with unique numbers. Maybe with that info they can undo trades and hit delete on all the items.
---
Not saying there's no other method, only that this one took me literally less than two minutes after the event, and I'd basically just put the challenge on the fail pile because I won't have the time to wander for hours around the bog tomorrow or Tuesday morning and spent the vast majority of the week's play time fully engrossed in becoming a possum scout.  If you have the time to invest, I'm sure it's possible through normal exploration.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I happened to spend 90% of my time up in Toxic Valley and The Mire this week, and completing this challenge while partied up with a discord pal on a rainy Sunday afternoon was a happy accident for both of us.  I wanted to share my surprise at how easy this challenge could be in the right situation, and make that knowledge free to everyone.
---
Hmmmm, maybe it's because; syringer. Pipe syringer.
---
Maybe there's a different syringer coming out within the arktos. Or maybe they are referring to the daily that gets you to shoot animals with a syringer that makes them talk
---
Best of luck.  That’s not going to cover it. Hopefully someone’s nice. I don’t have the recipe or I’d do it for that
---
Edit: Plan* I’m a dumbass
---
No, you can't earn backpack mods by scrapping. You can only earn them via possum badges.
---
Yup - IGN same as here
---
Yes frog habitat, stimpack diffuser and some musical ones as far as im aware. Still we got loads to do so pretty happy with that.
---
It’s a repeatable daily mission that gives you insect repellant, bug grenades, a random mounted insect trophy plan, and a rare (25%) chance for a possum badge
---
It's happened to me a couple of times.
---
Are u on windows 10?
---
One fall back is to have a second desktop with a task manager running. 
---
”Windows key” + TAB allows you to create and move between desktops.
---
Serious question. I do read a lot of articles on Fallout 76. Polygon just had one on cannibals:
---
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.polygon.com/platform/amp/2019/5/10/18537120/fallout-76-cannibals-eatt-guild-role-play-bethesda-perk
---
Also read another recent one on a fight club. But it never quite says how to find these groups since servers are random and you are placed where you are placed...
---

---
just a regula server ..  noticed it a lot that you have basically no chance against low lvls cause you make no dmg at all but they do dmg like they are thanos and just snap you away ..
---
Wow, more than the game current costs. I have an explosive auto laser pistol with a splitter that I got before the fix, it's fun, but it's not that fun.
---
Ugh I hate google amp...
---
I don’t notice it, but i have a big supply of water &amp; food so these problems don’t affect me at all.
---
Doesn’t pop enough? Shoot. I saw it on the same server four times in rapid secession, and see it about 50% of the time that I server hop at Ft Adams. I think it’s often enough and just needs a server-wide notice for those who want to know.
---
Just sent you a friend request
---
It only happens at night so I just server hop till its night and pops up
---
the mothman lighthouse has a lvl 0 in the 2nd floor of the house. grafton dam has a lvl 3 outside
---
Ouch. I remember before the nerf the Gauss easily landed 1000+ damage. I'm kinda glad they balanced it. It was like playing a game on easy mode. I'm perfectly fine with 600+ to be honest. I just tested it in West-Tek. One shot kills throughout.
---
You have to actually kill the bear with the syringer, it has to be your last registered hit. But I doesn't have to be your only hit. Weaken the Yao Guai with anything and finish it off with the syringer. I suggest the bleed out.
---
I don't see anything for shotgun in the shop
---
I agree with you. but let them be, they are wasting their times
---
The funny one is where ghouls stand up then drop on their belly.
---
Just don't hit them back
---
I one shot heart of swamp then the quest breaks
---
I would love to choose which events we get notified for
---
So I won't have to do those bugged out challenges
---
The frog habitat is but it doesnt register. Just try to do easy ones for now. Like swimming, athletic, and archery maybe
---
Someone made a post the other day that they found one in a container near NAR Repair Yard.
---
Be careful though because that’s also a possible sheepsquatch spawn location.
---
That I absolutely don't get unless the person has an avenue to sell caps for IRL currency. There's a 25,000 cap limit and there can't be a ton to spend then on if you're duping things.
---
They're masters of skating and killing!
---
didnt work ? i directly got damage .. i had to hit back to even have a chance ..  some mechanics in this game are so broken ..
---
The frog one didnt work for me, also had an issue with reparing crossbows as they kept GAINING durability. Bugs will be bugs I suppose...
---
Yeah. I don’t want to be snippy with OP, but they just didn’t use the search feature. People have talked about it for sure.
---
Yeah, I got 1 in a random container in the world. I heard meat bags (where supermutants hang out) is more likely to have, because it's a world container with a smaller loot table
---
Did it for a few hours on Friday, only got a few before I had to quit though but it seemed to be working decently 👍
---
You do realise what you just said don't you? SMH
---
How many possum badges have you gotten?
---
There’s still challenges you can do that aren’t bugged. I’ve done a few for the possum ones and it’s worked for me
---
This is hilarious.
---
I mean, a friendly assaulttron was in one of the vault boy shorts for fo76
---
Server hopping while standing at the camp. Also, it's not all that specific a time, it's just randomly between sunset and sunrise.
---
Someone likely dropped it to clear out their stash.
---
A few times I’ve dropped massive piles of junk I didn’t need in a place other people would find it.
---
I find once you get to level 25 and have a good supply of health aides your luck improves. I’m usually in the power armour lol so I can take a hit or dozen 🤣🤣 I’m level 72 now..and will purposely engage deathclaws, mireluk queens..scorchbeats.  The glowing ones are tough no matter what. Still can kill them but it takes longer.
---
Raider camps are typically pretty good
---
Props for flushing this idea out, but I feel that it takes the game a million miles off track
---
According to patch notes, on adventure server there is no more slap damage, so you shouldn't take damage unless you hit back, or you're in a workshop that is being contested.
---
Wondering if it's worth it - I can get about 15 per nuke. At 180 each that's 2700 per nuke. Tricky when I can get 1400 just selling random stuff to vendors. Hm. Maybe I'll do it a few times because it's kinda fun anyways. There's just so much other stuff to do now though.
---
Thank you for the advice. I do not have any defenses at all. But I do have a medium to large base almost fully decorated. I love to play Fallout for building and collecting (unlocking) everything. On Fallout 4, I have constructed at every settlement and reconstructed the wasteland my way with some mods, a great game too. I would be very pleased to sell you my Gauss Rifle but I play on PC unfortunately. Thank you again and have a great day.
---
It's almost like they *want* you to log in. And don't mention the 150 Legendary Scrip  daily as well. Oh my Gawwwwwd. 😆
---
Yup, I was wondering if it was just me, my hunger meter seems to be the worse though.
---
Well no, you must have hit them, because Pacifist is zero slap damage now, has been for a while bud
---
I've been checking meat bags, scorchbeast guano piles, every dead deathclaw I can find, gulpers, and killing deathclaws and haven't gotten a single one.  Why do I get the feeling Bethesda messed up the loot tables for the challenges.
---
I don’t know , steel sells for a a lot
---
He's across the hall
---
My PSN is Cactasboy13 and message me with what you need help with.
---
Me and my boyfriend like to go to peoples camps mess with the owner (in a light hearted way) and then we tell them we like their camp. We laugh so much when we do this. I dunno, just a lot of fun and from the ones we’ve done it too, they laughed as well
---
Sort by weight. Plans have weight. Normal games notes don't.
---
Thanks!
---
Dude my husband took all four of our kids out for a few hours so I could just sit and play and it was SO GREAT.
---
It’s one of the easiest resources to find in the game though.
---
except you didnt
---
Thank you! 😄
---
Yeahhhh, I think they are just very disorganised with all their dlcs
---
People that dont really need caps but run gun builds will do this. If they farm to much stuff to craft ammo. I usually try to give my extra to friends if they need it.
---
Ah gotcha
---
No, if you have 50 of the same duped gun you'll lose it. If you just have one you're fine. 
---
I found a TSE handmade and TSE radium rifle from the enclave vendor that I'm positive was a duped weapon sold to the vendor, shamelessly bough both for 500 caps and still have them.
---
Gt is Dookiestorm on Xbox...  I'm down to help the people of waste
---
1. Arktos is good for some lower level ones
---
2. What went wrong that title lol
---
Swimming,hunting,archery, and athletics are pretty easy to do. Do those first to get the backpack.
---
The kill the Yao guai with a syringer is the tadpole badge.  In the possum ones it’s only “shoot” a radstag, wolf and bear with a stringer.  So it’s different.
---
I love that!! I’ve read about a handful of pretty great pranks. 😊
---
I max my thirst and hunger before logging off every time and when i join back into the game I'm at around 20% of each as soon as I log in, I have also noticed that my thirst more then my hunger going down fast.
---
Did you have a workshop that he was contesting?
---
So much less of one now with shared cap pools for the vendors though! Oh my god was it ever so much worse before, took like a half hour just to hit em all, and that's if you didn't get distracted/interrupted by something 🤦 now it's just log in, sell to the nearest train station, log out (if I'm not playing a real session that day)
---
I did that once. It spawned me halfway between Harper's Ferry and the Sugar Grove. Inside a cave. *Directly underneath another Scorchbeast.*
---
Seriously, I wish I could sell them in my vending machine just to save people the trouble of having to sever hop for one
---
Wildlands
---
What are you playing this game for?
---
get a player of any lvl.
---
go down to the river near Charleston in the river only ankle deep.
---
You can lure the mirelurks or the supermutants over  get them to down your mate in water take out enemys as they only lvl 5 and go revive your mate.
---
rinse and repeat for yourself :).

I had this problem, so I went to the Palace of the Winding Path, which has a crossbow spawn and the one I picked up was fairly broken
---
Got the level 3s in there but I didn't go past fixing the pipes.  Thanks.
---
I don’t have those but I saw a tick in someone else’s camp.
---
Yeah...no. He can't damage you unless you 1. Shot him back 2. Shot first 3. Contested a workshop. Anything else and you are a liar.
---
good to know
---
Looks like I'll be hitting Watoga.  Thanks.
---
My only guess then is I bought it was around as a bundle or limited time item, I didn't mean to get your hopes up.
---
Heavy weapons? No
---
I got the high capacity mod lead lined and refrigerator by farming that event and doing the bug repeatable
---
They showed it in the ad and it's like they are teasing us. I would be appalled if they didn't make this happen. But it's really up to the community to decide.
---
Mind sharing some of that? I'm about to mod a bunch of guns so that would save me farming Blackwater mine or w/e for steel
---
got yellow cake about 7 of them chronic\_Coit is my psn.
---
ill be online about 5pm australian time after work :).
---
I lucked out and got mine off of one of the boss ghouls at the Whitespring.
---
After the most recent patch it just lists all components in the game and you can free tag or untag anything you’d like
---
How much do you need?
---
I frequently dump 500+ steel
---
Thank you for trying to help me. I have constructed my base paying attention to the aesthetics to have a great look, so is very hard to delete anything. I agree that there is no problem in not completing every task  as they launch, but I also think that challenges relying on future content should not be available until it can be completed. By the way, can you remember where you milked your Brahmins ? Will try something in a few minutes. Thank you very much.
---
Ok so I’m not imagining it!
---
its to do with vault 51. 
---
spoilers if you wanna know visit juicehead's video from yesterday he explains all :)
---
I've got the archery and athletics but the others I'm having issues with. I had a friend help early today with the swimming revive thingy, but it wouldn't register either :(. Guess I'll have to keep trying.
---
Had to have been a bundle or something cause I still haven't seen a single shotgun skin and I've played since launch. 😵
---
No damage melee bug is back too.
---
And major glitches while trading as well.
---
I did mammalogist in like 20 min. Pretty guaranteed spawns of all the animals.
---
I don't know if I'm interpreting this message the wrong way, but are you suggesting they sell badges in the Atom Shop?
---
Even if they're simply cosmetic badges you could display on a plaque or trophy for visitors, merit you didn't actually earn, is false information.  That's the video-game version of what Veterans call "stolen valor".
---
I'm no USMC, Army, Air Force or even Jenkintown Posse vet, but I worked pretty fucking hard to earn Leatherworker, Railfan and Photography badges, even if all I have to show for it [is a slightly darker backpack](https://imgur.com/wJHJv71) for my troubles.
---
edit: like as in actual things we can physically handle?  I'm 110% sold on that and would purchase a possum photography badge for my real life camera case immediately.
---
Once I had it move me within detection range.  I drank another and it dropped me in the same place.  It's always a gamble but I'll take the risk over being eaten.
---
Those tear themselves apart so fast I'm surprised you even noticed
---
I feel your pain :(. I've been at it all day to no eval.
---
Does it actually stack from everyone individually?
---
I might be a little too late ... but have u completed it ?
---
You responded to the wrong post so I just now found this and it says you’re offline.
---
Hmm probably around 400 to actually mod them all but every little helps! Railway takes like 20 steel a mod &gt;.&gt;
---
They do show up in random containers. I'm at 2/5 so far. No idea about gulpers or anything else though; so far meat bags and guano piles have been a bust
---
Also it wouldnt register that i completed path to enlightenment
---
Are you on PC? I wouldn't mind picking one up in a brown bag in return for me dropping some stuff for you
---
You would think they wouldn't need to touch the loot table for the deathclaws since they should drop a hide most of the time..  it's almost as bad as getting the magazines.
---
Just get rid of all the notes....I only keep plans/recipes/treasure maps in my inventory
---
I agree it was a dumb change but there’s no need to be rude about it
---
Yeah but fuck that. 😂😂
---
I wouldnt be surprised if people are only finding them on 1 platform.
---
Ah I haven't used melee in awhile but that seems like it sucks
---
It does lol
---
YES! I thought it was just me that I'm missing a few magazines, when I've got so many of them!
---
Furious is fine and anti-armor is excellent. For armor bolstering is underrated imo
---
I'll keep checking containers but I'm going to mark this one as bugged.  This is the 3rd or 4th bugged badge so far.
---
wow .. so it cant be the game no way the game is faulty .. i did not HIT HIM !!! and it wasnt a workshop it was my camp!
---
Its not a bad idea but the cost of time, money, and man power is too high for them to do that.
---
Read the whole post please. Edits clarify - so do other comments. I am not *nor ever* said in the Atom Shop.
---
You can only bulk 0 value junk. Bulking isn't for weight management, it's for selling junk that isn't worth anything individually. Screws can be sold individually.
---
I've been hunting them for days also, you can't even buy them and have them count now.
---
read my edits.  Took my tiny brain a while to figure out.
---
I guess it's going to be a grind to get them or I'll have to wait for the next patch.
---
Wait, what the fuck is Jan-U-Wine Bubblegum?
---
Yeah, I tried to do that also like 2 months ago. Took me a while to realise that they weren't working
---
Cool
---
Two shot was way too strong but now the accuracy and stability problems make it trash
---
Jumping on now.
---
Theft? Maybe some specific method. What do you mean?
---
Yo hol up I think you just did something
---
My grognak the barbarian collection is bugged even, it says I have found 8 of 10 but 9 are checked off.  Definitely frustrating.
---
lets just say the waiter is not helping the situation
---
It does sound like a cool idea, however after the Nuka Cola Dark fiasco and the canvas bags i don't think it would be wise for bethesda to release any more fallout related item for a while, can you imagine if they somehow botched it? oh good grief
---
I’ll take it off your hands partner.     ((( this is a stick up)))
---
Great idea and upvoted.
---
Fast travel to my location at Wavy Willard’s
---
Oh yes. Unfortunately you would spawn next to my acid collector and get acid burns if you didn't move after spawning in.
---
I finally found this post again but i have no idea how to post a pic on here lol
---
It was supposed to be faux rude.. I'm not actually a rude jerk. Upon reflection I would have expressed myself differently.
---
Banned
---
Photos work fine for me, you just have to be standing still otherwise it won't work
---
Where did you find the cat? Off hand if you remember :)
---
Hope the powers that be at Bethesda see and agree
---
I would do that, however i keep ahold of all of them in case my lower level friends need it. Like when it win't spawn, or their quest has bugged.
---
Exactly what I expected. So glad they're in survival.
---
I actually got one off an albino deathclaw finishing up Rosie's quest line.
---
I would play "What's new pussycat?" so many times in a row.
---
Not really any need for that to be included in a single player engine. Difficult to add on later. Not just in time and money but it would destroy performance.
---
Lmao, there’s not actually anything called that in game, I just put letters on my shop saying “Jan-U-Wine Bubblegum for sale!”. It’s a callback to Fallout 2 in which people weren’t too smart, so instead of saying genuine they said Jan-U-Wine.
---
XBox. I'm pretty casual so would be open to just about anything!
---
Just reached level 14... on my way to becoming “good”
---
That’s terrible!!!! This is the most important bugfix needed currently.
---
I teamed up with someone tonight and we did the revive a player in water challenge. It was tricky - the water couldn’t be too deep. We lured some ghouls down to the shallow water at the lake where the pioneer camp is located and took turns letting the ghouls kill us so we could revive each other. It was time consuming but it eventually worked.
---
Does this work with Xbox or no?
---
u/CarterG4 we need to try this.
---
I just logged onto your server the moment you logged off.
---
I’ll friend you at some point... I’m Crozetdragons15
---
Oops. I haven't got that far.
---
What lvl are you
---
Thank you for the info! But it looks like a tank build, I’m looking for a dps build :p
---
It’s ok!  Now you know though keep your eyes open if anything works for you.
---
Ight.. yea I like to earn me some good karma..
---
definately duped especially if your on xbox1
---
Nah
---
I grabbed it. It's pretty unique looking and fits on all power armor types.
---
I just like getting locations and recipes...
---
COUNTRY ROOOOOAAAADS.....
---
I have this with Zeta invaders. So i noticed I was missing it, to complete the challenge, but I was sure I already had. Then 1 day I picked it up in the wasteland and checked the challenge and it still didn't check off. I think it has something to do with if you found things or did things in the beta, so the game has logged that you've done or found something for a first time, but the challenge doesn't recognise
---
Yes I am now able to log back into a world with my main character. It took a little longer than 24 hours
---
hahaha this guy asking about legacy weapons why because everyone duped them now they are everywhere for sale.
---
NEVER BUY A LEGACY LASER WEAPON YOU WILL LOSE IT OR BE BANNED EVENTUALLY :).
---
Thank you for the information, good to know that. I love to build and collect in Fallout games so it is difficult to simply scrap everything or most of my items. Basically, my stash has a few of every junk to let me play without having to gather junk all time, a few of the unique weapons given on quests, some good legendary weapons I got, one power armor of each model (except Raider, but two X-01) to be able to apply the in-game paints (plus the Excavator Bone and Nukashine), some of the unique clothes like bomber jacket, black cowboy hat, BoS jumpsuit,  fasnatch masks and so on, some ammo for my weapons and one of each bobblehead and magazine, but the collection is not complete (these I can get off my stash but I am holding them for the display cases on the way). But I will follow your advice in a few moments. Thank you and have a great day.
---
I'll do It! I need it too lol. Gametag is: ghoullyd
---
I just hope they get added back in soon, cuz I've already been trapped in and/or under the floor boards at least 5 times now after fast traveling.
---
I'm meeting up with dookiestorm but by all means il help a fellow wastelander out.
---
**WHAT     ARE YAH DOIN IN MAH SWAMP!?!?**
---
This seems to happen with every patch a bit... While during Beta my character needed one water every hour by now it's every few minutes
---
I'm wondering what Bethesda is trying to achieve with this and not mentioning anything about it in the patchnotes
---
Soooo any one got help
---
Read the patch notes
---
What location
---
Yea I gotchu if you can do the same for me
---
Only a mere level 35😓
---
From where are people getting this Battle Royale thing? Have I missed something or is it just speculation?
---
You would be doing me a great service my dude :).
---
Thanks for help.
---
turn the tadpole badges in, same spot where you take the exams, little vending machine like the ones for ammo.
---
I luv u
---
Have you watched any of my recent coverage? I have been extremely positive around the game as of late, mostly because they are doing a ton of great things with it
---
Colonel Kelly monument
---
Yah
---
F*cking Bethesda, I just spent the last hour grinding gulfers to get this hide, but the one time it dropped the body disappeared before I could get it.
---
I think it was added in the most recent patch
---
Can you point out any of my recent content that is just clickbait shitposts?
---
I haven’t done it before but I can join in with my lvl 100 melee character. IGN roundyroundy
---
I accidentally duped some holotapes with that same method. I should probably destroy them.
---
It doesn't work if you spawn into a wall because you will be caught between objects and constantly 'falling.'
---
Dude, just report it to Bethesda's Support... if it's true, posting it here will make it spread rather than get fixed.
---
Same, went to the places they used to spawn, guess they stopped spawning there though.
---
If you pick it don’t you get wanted?
---
Why is Juicehead a dick?
---
I've found that exiting the build system and starting it again fixes the "nothing is selected" issue.
---
Join my world. Gt Explozive Force
---
I'm coming back...
---
I have but I'm sure those aren't the only major changes since the first week which is why I was wondering if someone could give just simple tips or heads up
---
The Valley Galleria would be a cool location for that.
---
Fast travel to 98 nar (east of ws) climb rock wall on right to billboard, 4-5 cats and supplies up there
---
I'm hitting you up in 30 mins!
---
Are you just critiquing me or the evidence put forward in the video?
---
I don't remember ever actually getting a recipe for this, it was just unlocked when the Fasnacht event happened and it was required for the doughnuts. I think it should be unlocked for everyone.
---
Thank you for the advice. I will get some items out of my stash for sure. I need that refrigerated backpack once my build does not have perk cards to raise the condition of food. I think that, based on what some guys said about it, will make my life easier regarding the food supplies. Thank you again and have a great day.
---
Thank you have not tried there yet and I am there all the time :)
---
Enemies used to walk up to my camp and now they just Star trek they ass right in front my fence. definitely didn't happen as often as it does now as well.
---
If you're going small, the cliffs east of the lighthouse in the forest.  Part way down a skinny camp will fit in with 3 Cu nodes and a Cu pit.  You might even be able to see the workshop east across the street.
---
Best one I had was on a point just north and downhill from Cobbleton Farm in the North.  Did find any resource nodes, but didn't look hard.  Pluses are close to the farm for materials, open space, elevated, and with a scope you could look east all the way to the space station.  I just camp al fresco, so my benches were all along the edge, with a fire, bed, and chair on the point.  Downer is the travel cost to anywhere else.
---
&gt;Lol, so how could one provide proof of the water going down quicker?
---
Data miners would have seen this change if it was true.
---
Probably not
---
It used to be caps till I hit max, started buying mutation recipies. But it wasn't enough. But the legendary scrip now...
---
definitely grab it
---
Lol
---
Oh hell yeah. Food goes down normal. Water is 2x as fast. Before they were pretty even. Not using any stims, just loitering in camp with happy camper and it's obvious thirst rate was buffed.
---
I ran into two handys named Vlad and Mia, standing in a circle of mannequins, caught in a conversation loop just this morning. I'm level 101.
---
Yeah and I got a 10 cap bounty I'll have to get rid of now. And the guy didn't even have anything worth buying!
---
Alright...dps comes down to the weapons mostly. Highest dps will be bloodied but a high fire rate AA weapon comes pretty close when specd right.
---
I work as a graphic designer, and embroidery is by far the most expensive option for custom work.  I think with the right supplier and enough quantity, badges could be viable, but the initial cost of producing embroidered goods is prohibitive for a small segment of a niche market.  I love the idea as a fan, but I would have serious reservations as business-owner.  There's no way I could offer even a large custom run of embroidered patches at a price the modern consumer deems reasonable unless I outsourced to Indonesia or Bangladesh, waited at least 6 months for finished product to arrive and then the Pioneer Scout craze has passed.  Of course I'd immediately get a few dozen purchases from die-hard fans that don't care about cost, but then I have 9952 patches that serve as dust collectors for the rest of eternity, clogging up warehouse space and eventually end up resold as wholesale lots again and again and wind up in a bargain store somewhere in the dustiest corners of the United States.
---
Honestly if you want a Pioneer Scout Patch for your actual backpack, you're way better off making your own.  Skyrim was a massive commercial success, but they never sold Iron Helmets in Walmart because the numbers just didn't add up.
---
They’re probably getting scripts from them and Bethesda is taking notes at what’s being turned in and by who... someone turns in a few dozen 3*... they’ll know...
---
Lol. I had a deathclaw do that on a road in the mire. Normally they're not much of a threat. But when they're in skiddy claws mode its terrifying.
---
That's only part of it. There more voice files I datamined and a separate source
---
Sorry, I'm not a regular viewer. I'm referring to the reputation developed from the earlier days of the game where every time a controversy came up, one of your videos ended up getting linked. Maybe the content has gotten better but I don't have the time to go through it all to check. Maybe after finals
---
If I end up being right will you apologize?
---
I'm pretty sure it doesn't need to be completely broken for the repair to count.  I only had a small sliver of damage and repairing it counted towards the 3 repairs needed.
---
Level 60 weapons &amp; armor will fix it
---
Where is the announcement on this?  Or is this just conjecture?
---
I can’t say I’ve noticed a drop in the generosity. Ive picked up some awesome cheap stuff and sold good stuff cheap too. I’ve also set up shop next to the overseers camp and usually find my crops and water harvested, as intended.
---
I love mine
---
Make tracked challenges appear first on the list
---
Did that yesterday lol
---
Kill the Deathclaw on Deathclaw Island or the one in the cave between Ammo Dump and the Pumpkin House.
---
Bridge day?
---
Did you log off completely then log back in to see if items were still there? 
---
Could be one of the same deal when it shows you that you have 1 million in some odd number of something...
---
That's funny ;)
---
I’d love this. I want more huge battles where everyone is together and fighting one massive fight!
---
I think it’s just team deathmatch
---
I was waiting pretty anxiously for this one as all I use is my Bone Raider Excavator and I really wanted a better suit of cool looking PA. I decided against it once I actually saw it in game. It just didn't look as cool to me "in person." That and I feel like every edgelord that plays is going to be rocking it. I would try to get a look at it first if you can.
---
Why cant you turn in a few dozen 3* and be legit? Not all 3* items are good.
---
Gahhhh wish I’d have seen this before we all logged off. One of our regular party members still hasn’t found the tourist. :( Making us all crazy since there’s so many camera Tadpole Quests
---
Totally read the patch notes.
---
If I were to give you a file containing a list of the coordinates, would you be able to run it through Mappalachia?  
---
If so, could you give me a formatted template for how they should be arranged?
---
That's the thing, we can't drop the cameras :(. It tells us that it will break/scrap if we try to drop it.
---
I tried the one on deathclaw island more than once and it didn't give any hides.  I'll have to check the pumpkin house one later.
---
I just want all four to fire simultaneously.  Give me my rain of fire
---
Wow, awful
---
I somehow got the red rocket one. I use them as retractable walls on my 3rd &amp; 4th floors. Open the walls when I'm home for the view, close them if being attacked. wiring was not fun, but came out nice.
---
IMO, the Tactical Ops suit was a waste of atoms.
---
It looks cool, but it only has an underarmor version so you will barely see any of it depending on what pieces you have on and it uses the weakest group of lining mods that you can't get the last two tiers of because the stuff that is suppose to give you them are bugged. They could of at least made it use the Enclave or BOS linings.
---
Yea I mean I think I got a bit carried away initially with a few videos, but recently I have been predominantly positive. I call out some of the bullshit that goes, but overall Bethesda has been doing a great job with the updates
---
Who actually cares? Everyone having good stuff doesn't ruin a game. EX: Borderlands 2 duping intentionally never being fixed.
---
This.
---
I think people are confusing battle royale with an upcoming deathmatch mode.
---
I really hope its not battle royale
---
Will give this a try.
---
I think the extra stagger is even better than all of that but the extra damage is so ingrained in the game by now that taking it out would get extreme backlash. 
---
In my honest yet admittingly unpopular opinion, the explosive effect should never have existed in the game in the first place.
---
I can’t find a squirrel to save my life. Server hopped, ran around in the woods... found rabbits and cats galore. No squirrels!
---
Haha awesome!
---
Its speculation... but it is believed that it will be something along those lines...
---
First of all, team deathmatch is NOT Battle royale. Second, it's likely only a part of the new content. Icing on the cake, not the damn cake.
---
I came back a month ago after playing a week, and I’ve found it a lot better. If you weren’t playing long I suspect many of the changes won’t mean much, but camps are better and there’s some excellent advice around now about how to play. I say just get stuck, ask around if you get stuck.
---
Dan so there still bugged after the patch :( I figured they would of fixed ut by now
---
Is this a joke or? He is literally referring to a channel post I made, not a video
---
This is literally made up?
---
Nope
---
The toon is fucked but all my other toons are perfectly fine, that's not a ban. That's character corruption.
---
You're right opinions can't, won't, and most of all do not change
---
Any examples of this in action or?
---
I've grown complacent about duping as long as it doesn't effect server stability honestly. The older methods used to crash entire servers due to item loading but with the item limit that had been mostly a non issue
---
You can craft a level 50 backpack and change the appearance at an Armor workstation. I just wish there were more plans than just the Pioneer Scout and Original. I’ve seen no mention of any others being found in the game so far. All of the concept art looked great especially the Enclave one imo.
---
Oh and also there’s the Keep Out one in the Atomic Shop.
---
I'm sure we'll eventually have 4*weapons followed by 5*  
---
There's prestige "legendary" coming, although it most likely be just for characters but I think it'll need some new specific weapons for the upgrade.
---
&gt;~~quite a few other voices~~ every generic male character in Skyrim
---
Exactly the type of comment I expected from players who play "just for fun'" or perhaps a duper.
---
left on d-pad switches to alternate weapon. maybe if they can do it by holding the button for a few seconds?
---
Exactly how i felt about it... I was really looking forward to this one. I'm happy i came across someone Who had it  before cause i really don't like it in-game
---
Ws bunker on the grassy spot that covers it I find a bunch
---
The simple answer is "what price would you buy the item at?" or what would you think is fair.
---
I respect that but do you understand how this completely ruins the game for some players?
---
It’s been mentioned several times :)
---
Not to burst your bubble, but the economy is currently crashing because there’s an exploit to duplicate. Just reported someone who has 20 of each of the best Bloodied weapons in the game and selling then dirt cheap.
---
Hopped it 3x and only spawned rabbits tonight. :( I’ll try again later though.
---
Are these challenges truly bugged or is Bethesda doing it to slow down progress? Like the Medic challenge for an item not in the game..
---
Should be under food
---
I love rare stuff... Weird outfit pieces, weird aid items, items with funny prices (69, 420, 187, 76, etc). And of course legendaries, as you mentioned :D
---
I also make sure to check out junk prices everywhere I go, but 90% of the time the junk is MASSIVELY overpriced (like ballistic fiber for 30 caps each or individual steel for 5).
---
One shop I visited had pretty much every type of liquor in one vending machine! Yeah it was overpriced, but it's sure worth it for Biv quests trying to make the hard-to-make drinks or future "drink \[x\] different drink" challenges!
---
Now that I think about it, the dupers also have access to pretty much an infinite number of legendary scripts... Higher level weapons will help but won't completely solve the issue.
---
Honestly id probably quit the game if all the gear i worked for is now not top tier. Who cares if people have certain legendary prefixes, dont take out the few people duping by punishing the entire playerbase.
---
No bruh in Denmark everyone pays 56 % . They have free medical and free college as well as 3 months off work every year If I am not mistaken..
---
So survival mode was advertised as a PVP mode from the start.. and no no one wants a small restricted arena when we have the whole map already.. if you dont like PVP or survival mode dont play it lol.
---
Opinions change, of course - and I hope you are enjoying the game now.
---
But your words at the time, that doesn't change.
---
"Never bet your future on pie, son." -Ron Swanson probably
---
I hope you'd all enjoy hearing Country Roads &amp; Big Iron 24/7.
---
After seeing how incredibly overpowered some explosive weapons were back in fallout 4, I'm shocked they didn't really consider changing it around here. At least they made it a percentage boost instead of a flat, what was it, 25 damage per pellet? But it was still very clearly unbalanced not only towards individual weapons (I.e shotguns vs everything else), but even in comparison to other secondary effects.
---
I really don't understand what you're saying.
---
Sorry that I don't keep up with your news, man.
---
But please, tell me you don't clickbait, so we can all laugh together.
---
belly of the beast is the final BOS story quest you should get the ultracite armour plans.
---
For those that somehow pull the god roll weapon and want to sell it, I'm sure it sucks a lot to have your stuff devalued. On the other hand, even a simply good drop weapon or armor can still net you something like 6-10k caps when the limit is 25 so really what's the point?  It has really turned me off of survival mode though. The spread of those god tiered items have made it 1 shot country there.
---
MANY THANKS!
---
The good news is, it's not a random spawn, it'll always appear so long as someone visits Camp Adams at night. (only once per night though)
---
Ha!! That’s awesome 👏🏻
---
You got it, dude. I’m just happy to help.
---
Thank you for the information. Good to know it is only UI error regarding the warning message. I only put in my stash scraped junk and only bulk aluminum, cork, copper, fertilizer, gears, lead, oil and springs because the bulked version of those items take less weight than the materials themselves (at least when I did the math some weeks ago). But for some time, those deathclaw hands took some of my space until I payed attention to them. Completely agree with the perk card setups to be able to swap on different situations, I am confident that Bethesda will add this feature at some time. Lets keep our fingers crossed for the stash and CAMP budget raise. Bethesda said that they plan to increase the stash size a little more and also increase the CAMP budget once it has not been increased yet, they only limited some items and reduced the weight ratio for them, but we need it as soon as possible because the new content added is awesome and we will have much more content in the future. Thank you very much for your time and have a great day.
---
It's been tried, she's immune.
---
One of the above suggestions on the OP was release new content making our current gear useless in end game activities. Awful idea imo but thats just me. Id just uninstall the game.
---
The limit isn't 25 though, I have many accounts with max caps.
---
In my opinion, automatic weapons had and still have the best deal when it comes to explosive effects. The perms stagger mixed with the ability to just erase a fool in under a clip is crazy
---
Selling blank holotapes?
---
How much?
---
I messed up one day and I’m at 898 now -.-
---
All I am saying is I was overly negative towards the game then, have realized that and as Bethesda has improved the game also improved my coverage of it. 
---
I also clearly said at launch I liked making video of the game, but that constantly gets ignored
---
I thought I heard talk that it was 25k?  What's the limit then?  Either way, my point stands regardless of that detail because 6-10k is still a lot in items that aren't duped much or at all.
---
Top of the world usually has a couple near the elevator. Much more reliable than the marked location
---
It was found though data mining, also I said "supposedly"
---
*tooting intensifies*
---
Well, the new content doesn't have to be applied drastically. There can be a level increase to weapons every few months that make lower level weapons slightly less useful.
---
I have one with bashing damage if you want to offer
---
I just plugged in my headset to my controller (PS4) and asked them.
---
Why? Why dedicate money and resources to adding five more songs to the game, when we can just listen to our own music? There's no DJs, it doesn't reflect story progression like in other games, so... why?   
---
Also, plugging my Free States playlist that I listen to: [https://open.spotify.com/user/1285825658/playlist/7jGkH39I97tt4YRSzvzlHV?si=vPR06msQRBe9DbxecFlLHQ](https://open.spotify.com/user/1285825658/playlist/7jGkH39I97tt4YRSzvzlHV?si=vPR06msQRBe9DbxecFlLHQ)
---
This bug irritated me so much that I quit playing 76 and went to go play a another game today. It really is super stressful when you can’t even place wires. They’d better fix this bug in the next patch.
---
My understanding it happens every night, but only if a player is there to trigger it!
---
What the level on it
---
Yes the limit for one character is 25k. You can make multiple accounts and have them maxed out at 25k. Pretty much everyone involved in end-game trading uses this method.
---
I said "supposedly"....
---
system...
---
Never even used the one the quest gave me, coasted on the ones everyone else trigger!
---
Oh shit my bad. Xbox and my GT is BethesdaDaily
---
50
---
That’s my life now. Oh, if I could get a time machine.
---
Stop Hitler? No, I need to remove hard bargain and do some tweaking.
---
I think the Fallout plushie market is a fucking gold mine, even though I'm not into it at all.  Hire a quality design firm with good toy-fun-playful credentials to create cute deathclaws, mirelurks, radscorpions, mothmen, etc etc designs and BGS might need to buy more rakes and hire more janitorial staff to sweep all that money that's being thrown at them into a custom build cash vault.
---
The plushie market is such low hanging fruit that BGS could offer a "rad-ant" or "diseased glowing ghoul" plushie and start counting sales immediately.  They could probably do "desk fan" and "tin can" plushies and swim in gold coins like Scrooge McDuck.
---
If the other legendary was better I would have thanks though!!
---
I'm claiming this as mine. Its a train, there for as a train, it is my brother.
---
On Xbox One. Not a duper. Are you saying you don't play a videogame for fun? If so, seek help.
---
It’s a grab absolutely
---
You forgot being on a team with someone who did those things, Jack off.
---
np
---
/u/valseek   can we pretty please not scrap our bug parts when doing a scrap all junk?     almost all the other junk things that have a use in a non-scrapped format don't get auto scrapped!
---
Picking a new ammo to farm and be a middleman to a bigger dealer can be different. It added some interest to my game.
---
Or level it down, since half the time legendaries are lvl 40+ even if you are lvl 20.
---
We are on multi platform and we have a discord if we want to join our cause. So we can help you on PC and Xbox but it will take longer to get someone to help you since I mostly play PS4 I will have to contact someone that is on our Xbox or PC side so we can help you.
---
I grinded pretty hard to get my current gear. Last thing i want is to need to grind some more. Maybe other people would like it but id just quit the game and play a different fallout where i dont need to worry about my gear being made nerfed every other month.
---
yea
---
Your replies imply you take this game way, way too seriously. Like you are actually upset your virtual currency is worthless. I'm worried for you.
---
You can if you complete the quest, but they will be unable to craft their own film without the quest!
---
Might be a dumb question, but did you uunequip relevant perk cards for durability?
---
try to reverse connect it. instead of connecting say conduit to item, do item to conduit.  especially if you have multiple wires attatched to one point they get in the way and make you jump instead of connect.
---
I never even considered any of this! I LOVE using a hunting rifle and sniping, yet never considered getting an instigating one. I'm absolutely going to rework my characters to incorporate this, and that ammo tip is top-notch too! 
---
My main focus in the game is as a trader, so I ran a melee build with the excess strength points for carry weight. Now I'll have to sneak some points into rifles for this, and I'm actually excited to try West Tek with a kickass rifle!
---
If you need help from my 90 player guild just let me know
---
I have already scrapped mine for scrip
---
Actually one hint. When you’re near the airport, go find Fraternity Row (by the high school) and drink the bottle of Nukashine. You’ll thank me later ;)
---
...and I'd take that workshop from you toot sweet with extreme prejudice after the 10th repeat
---
you the best.
---
Yes plz. The constant “did I actually get the picture” back and forth is making me crazy!!
---
Nope not at all. I'm implying you mostly like only play just for fun. Or perhaps you just don't understand how duping effects people who play the game for status in addition to having fun.
---
I completely agree with you, server stability aside, the idea is that you have to earn the top tier equipment, the time and effort that went into gaining the items I have over the last 130 levels has almost become completely pointless due to the proliferation of duped gear. Duper’s and those that buy from them (intentionally or not) are enjoying all of the benefits of gear most of us had to grind for. And then there’s the economic aspect too, people are making thousands upon thousands of caps because they’re cheating the system. 
---
I’d like to see another ban wave, this time permanent. If people are going to ruin the game for everyone else because they’re too lazy and dishonest to adhere to some quite simple rules, they shouldn’t be allowed to continue playing.
---
Just posted your edit before I did a message refresh. This might be the problem. Besides my tse, my other weapons go a long time without needing repairs.

Here is the pic.
---
Regardless of if it's a battle royale or team deathmatch PvP thing, we already know it's not going to be the entirety of Nuclear Winter's story content. Vaults 94 and 96 are going to be high-level raid zones. And I'd assume there'd be a few short questlines introducing all of these high level events, like how the Lying Lowe questline culminates in the Encryptid event.
---
Fair enough.
---
Liberty Prime plushie
---
if true then im stoked that people who dig pvp might get a dm/br mode they can try out...
---
Indeed and its insane that we have to keep looking inside. They need a notification also to let us know if a minor task for challenges is done.
---
"High level raid zones"

[Bridge Day](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_Day)
---
Yearly celebration where they close down half the traffic lanes of the New River Gorge Bridge and have a fair and allow people to bungie or BASE jump from the bridge.
---
That would be nice but hopefully obtaining 4 and 5 start weapons has nothing to do with legendary script. Dupers have pretty much an infinite supply of it.
---
Also, as long as they are tradable, the dupers will be able to outbid anyone on auctions with their seemingly endless supply of caps. Top tier gear will be extremely difficult for the average player to buy.
---
Joining.
---
Thanks!  I was able to pick up both royal jelly from your guide.
---
I’m sure Funko is already on it.
---
I didn’t thank you earlier. I really appreciate it.
---
I can drop a bag of fertilizer on your bed, will that help? :D

There is a fossil in a small pond outside wavy willards. Just to the right of the tip of the slide in the picture on the map. You have to stand a few feet back from the fossil so you can capture the whole thing in the picture for it to count. I hope this helps :)
---
Same here.  Good ole bugthesda.
---
Are you saying that the character works on other people's PCs or not?
---
No, Reboot was a TV show, that's what he's talking about. Tron Legacy was indeed a sequel
---
Are you asking me to differentiate from the two?
---
The cap is 1000 and you still got days before the vendor even comes.
---
You play a game... For status? Is your real life sad? I'm betting its sad.
---
Then D-pad could say only allow you to switch the saved builds while you're in the perk screen itself.
---
Why is that a bad thing?
---
Well, now I feel dumb.
---
This happened a while ago before the pioneer scout update. I for some reason triggered the quest early.
---
Advertised as plush but made of nylon.
---
There's actually two events there. I don't know if it depends on the time of day or what, but they're mostly the same except for the ending.
---
One has you kill a wendigo to end, the other just has you kill waves of insects and keep the fire going.
---
Status within the game xD. That's why most people play mmos... They all want to be among the best in the game aka high status.
---
Me and my group The Rebuilders can give you them for free friend me PSN Cactasboy13
---
They just recalled an elder scrolls board game for word for word plagiarism.
---
Who’s gonna tell him..
---
Appreciate your sentiment but I'm fine.
---
Believe it or not, this virtual currency has real world value.
---
I was lucky to find one near the overseer camp but I feel u.
---
I would feel pretty bad, I say let him be happy.
---
Ahaha, brilliant
---
As far as I know, you need to change servers
---
Keep logging out until you get one that doesn’t see you shredded on arrival
---
If that doesn’t work, check if you have Plague Walker mutation
---
Used to be issues with that in WS
---
My group The Rebuilders will help you if you need anything we are here to help anyone. We help the innocent and kill the guilty,
---
This is valid advice! Sometimes you have to connect the opposite way. Even if there aren't wires or anything else in the way.
---
But how can you distinguish between the dupers and the people buying from the dupers?
---
I appreciate that dude
---
Right!?! Like - the annoying PA-KOW of getting Atoms works just fine - why not something like that?
---
Thats right!! Thx
---
Mule accounts, such as yours,  are usually responsible for the destruction of the in game economy,  drastically lowering the value of the currency.  If anything, the large number of high level loot being sold for less helps balance out the damage hoarders are doing.
---
Overseer Camp spawn spot got me cats and rabbits 😔
---
That legit looks like he is melting or he pooped his bag!
---
Thanks for the help
---
It's so hit n miss 😔
---
Wait seriously? So i can make one and film and give them away?
---
Have u done this?
---
We have killed many raider type people. Like 2 armies and 60 people for stealing one guys stuff. We make sure people are safe and in my opinion we do that well. I got a level 2 person to level 30 in a hour. We are strong and we have your back.
---
Try automatic pistol crit build. Your brain will explode
---
Just to clarify this, since a lot of people dont seem to understand. When you need to fill the fire bar to move on to the next part, you just loot the kindling. When you need to keep the fire alive however, you have to loot the kindling -and- go over to the fire and interact with it to add kindling. Otherwise its just gonna go out regardless of how many sticks you're carring.
---
For some stupid reason I've been getting "this item or something related is currently in use" meaning I can't even delete the friggin thing, let alone move it. I literally have a giant floating statue way above my camp cuz when I placed it, it teleported to the roof and now it's there to stay unless I move my camp. 
---
So in it's place I wrote a sign that says "WTF Beth fix ur shit"
---
What's so funny? I love survival mode and exclusively play it but there is a difference between survival and a PVP death match mode. Survival should be all about the normal game with freedom to PVP when you want not a mode where PVP is the purpose. I think there is a real tension here
---
I am of the same mind as you. I have 4 characters and I doubt I ever do all these quests on more than my main and MAYBE my alt, it's tedious as hell past the first two times. But that's just me.
---
Go with your heart. I sell everything for half of the in game value because I don't need millions of caps, and they're not hard to come by.
---
You bastard, this is how we get ants!
---
As long as you managed to get an extra broken camera, I managed to find an extra one thanks to a crash, but every time I found thr corpse since it won't let me loot another!
---
It has different endings, so maybe the timer on it depends on how the quest goes.
---
Afk, pose in a corner
---
The thing is, these people selling the duped items horde 100x the amount of caps any legitimate player could ever earn. I know a guy that spent over 1.5 million caps on duping with in two days.
---
This is the kind of stuff I like people don’t get that this is how the game is meant to be played
---
Had an issue like this yesterday when we created a team before joining. Haven't had any trouble with the usual method (join player, then invite).
---
May your happiness duplicate forevermore!
---
AKA sad.
---
I mean it could work but why not try out another sound for minor task. It might confuse others who think they got atomic points.
---
Walking in with just your underwear looking all morbidly obese and sleeping on their bed ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Yea one of our missions a couple of days ago was to protect this level 3 thats was being picked on by a level 80. At the time i was level 60 and I almost one shotted him slimy bastard.
---
Know any locations for “Imported Chinese Panda” or the “Pristine Bear”?
---
Drop random junk on the floor to make a bunch of different paper bags appear.
---
I like to get into the persons locked camp, while they are nearby, by using crafting tables through walls/windows. Then they come over, looking confused, and I wave while running out the door they just opened to come in.
---
we have your back, always. We have a lot of good peoples backs.
---
Lol yes! Almost bought a be laser too for the hell of it! Trying to take advantage of it while the getting is good.
---
I must live under a rock. It's a nice rock though .... has power gates :)
---
Yes, although the stagger chance is lower (undocumented). 1% per perk point rather than 3%.
---
Probably inventory clearing. I just dropped an ungodly amount of garbage 1☆ armor at the overseerers stash. I'm hoping some noob finds it and is smart enough to cash them in for scrip. Though they'll most likely list them in thier machine for 5K each like every other player.
---
Oh. Well. That's unfortunate.
---
There's a hidden Enclave power plant underground. It's fiiiiiinnnneeee!!!
---
Added you im lvl 28
---
Waaaaaaaaait hard bargain and charisma effects it?
---
Do you prefer to be a low status loser? In the game and in real life?
---
but perks such as rifleman increase weapon damage for energy weapons as well as ballistic weapons.
---
Nothing says "Im having fun" quite like missing 15 shots from 3 ft away.
---
Yeah, I Know
---
That they were duped? I assume everyone knew that.
---
Bwahahahahaha .... a mouse in their pocket .... sigh :)
---
 :: ribbit :: 🐸
---
Cool I’ll add you when I get back on
---
I think I am going contrarian and specifically NOT buying a BE laser.  But those handmades have a siren’s call....
---
Did I say all 3* items? No... by now pretty much everyone knows at least the top duplicated items. 
---
On the data side they know what to look for...
---
Agree...I so very much agree...if not because it's op, it lags the game.
---
Maybe fo4 firework launchers for july? Working grills? Outside activities at the waterpark?
---
Ive always wanted Chief Cornstalk’s ghost and some native lore quests. Lots of burial mounds in wv.
---
Danger zone!
---
I know right! I don’t use laser weapons but 5k is so much better than 25k! Yea I slept on them a couple months ago (the handmades) and I regretted not getting one when they were going for 3! They really shot up in prices, and fast!
---
It showed A weird number like (13094573854) Steel one time for me... I quit and logged back in and it was fixed. 
---
Just thought restarting might help, if not do a hard reset...
---
Yes, either way I don't think there is any perk that keeps weapons from never degrading at all is there?
---
How many
---
Level 15 so far. He was attacking my workshop so I couldn't just ignore him.
---
Yeah I had a FO4 Batman playthrough too, much cooler with Mods
---
They need the caps to dupe more. I know a guy that spent over 1.5million caps on duping. He has a collection of pretty much every top tier combination of legendary effects.
---
Theres also a potential and semi frequent death claw spawn if you go to watoga station and follow the tracks north. Little encampment can spawn all kinds of things but i usually encounter gulper (which can also drop it) and the occasional albine deathclaw.
---
If I could turn that damn music down compared to everything else; I'd freakin' love it.
---
As far as I can tell from data-mining:
---
1. It should apply to any damage against that target.
---
2. You can tenderize multiple targets.
---
3. Multiple shots and multiple players with tenderizer both stack, but the total modifier is capped to +40% incoming damage.
---
The difference between one person and no-one taking Tenderizer for an SBQ fight would be huge, but you'll get some diminishing returns beyond that.
---
When nobody's home, I use the bathroom and dont flush.
---
I agree it would be cool to have actual ones ... meanwhile i make jpegs of the stuff i like, print it on sticky back paper and slap it on the outside of my iPad. It's not quite the same but it makes me happy. Nice blend of FO76, Watchdogs, farcry and just basic science nerdy stuff at the moment with a little Amnesty Intn'l and World Wildlife.
---
This should be a timed event to last 2-3 waves of robots at WS...lol
---
Do you drop toilet paper and spoiled meat? Because that would be awesome.
---
I did. I'm pretty over it now. You can only hear the same music so many times before it kind of drives you crazy, and even with my music slider turned all the way down it still comes in full blast.
---
Hey I ran out to get food, my character is slowly runnin to a wall at my camp soo I don’t get kicked lol, as long as the server is still up ur good to go!
---
Tyler County Fair Grounds has majority of the bears. Pristine bear spawns at Graniger Farms on a matress near the floor safe in the crapped out house.
---
You can always reprice, too. List a thing at X and if it goes fast that was underpriced. If it sits there as 15 players visit, maybe over priced. Im doing this with serums. They fly off the shelf at 200 per, also at 250, not so much at 400. Currently at 300 and selling slowly. Maybe 275 is the sweet spot.
---
Would be fun, id personally love a way to stash items publicly. Give players coming to my shop more than just free water
---
I make all my plans 60% less than the in game value, so they're all affordable but I still get a few caps out of it. I saw someone trying to sell pocketed leather limb plans for like 300 caps, good luck buddy.
---
Yup. User name checks out...
---
:: howl :: 🐺
---
I'm just glad that people are still selling legendaries to vendors, so I can buy them with caps cheap, and exchange for scrip
---
Yes, had to relocate a mule’s camp by about 20 feet to avoid this. If a cliff or even some tall rocks are nearby the camp device this can be a very annoying start to a session!
---
I tried putting mine up for sale once and it didn’t work. I think it’s because you need to take a picture of the tourist to get the quest triggered off?
---
I like laying down in a swimsuit on their floor in the photomode post while they're looking at their inventory. The three second pause when they look at me is beautiful. I also leave a single raw fertilizer on people's front doors steps.
---
They'd fuck it up somehow unfortunately, but yes a Sheepsquatch plushie would be great! I was thinking of having one comissioned or some such. Is that a thing? Etsy maybe?
---
Hmm. Could be they have nerfed class freak? I'll have to see if any other mutation negatives seems stronger.
---
Speed freak will increase thirst &amp; hunger  by 50%.
---
I must be getting old or something .... stupid maybe .... but whether a human has a dangly bits or most everything tucked inside is pretty ....not really irrelevant but more like "not the point / no one's business  .... " (to me anyway) ESPECIALLY on-line where half the guys I meet are using female avatars. If we treat everyone with respect and dignity then labels should matter less.
---
You can’t trade the camera sadly. I tried to give one to my bf and it didn’t work. Just deleted it
---
Random legendary drop that has the “Explosive” prefix. Finding one in the wild is all grinding and praying to RNGesus. Alternatively, you can buy one off another player for an exorbitant amount of caps.
---
Yeah I don’t understand why the Whitesprings music still comes on. I just want some peace n quiet!
---
The Grafton Momster
---
Sleep in their bed or play one of their instruments, take a 5 minute break IRL, then come back and leave.
---
It would be great elevator music or music when you are on hold on the phone. =D
---
Yeah it looks like the red rocket one is coming back to the store at some point, but my main wish is to have ones that have different wall frames (eg. so I could have one that matches the brick wall of my home)
---
Hunger and Thirst have been quietly nerfed for awhile.
---
Just in time for the Cooler backpacks and Refrigerator, right?
---
It's definitely calmed since the ban and I didn't move because well, I didn't want to. Glad I didn't.  Thanks for the response
---
You use to be able to trade the fixed camera, but not any more.
---
I think you can still trade the broken camera
---
Title is pretty ironic coming from one of the biggest dupers on xbox.
---
I see what you did there. (☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞
---
That had nothing to do with Bethesda game studios only zenimax online and Bethesda publishers. The only that BGS had to the game board was the link via zenimax owning them both.
---
...well that makes sense.
---
Also, at the same fair grounds, check the slide and a building named Tyler County Scare. Its behind the Throw and Bowl. Finally, check the Palace of the Winding Path. Go to the highest structure (tower) in the water and see there. If you watch We Bare Bears, you will like the little Easter egg.
---
Totally agree and was lamenting the lack of variety. A nice clean skin with  neutral shade would be nice. A Corvega one would be cool too!
---
Still Bugged
---
On my way! Thanks!
---
I've been listing them for 6 apiece.  I went higher on the first day, and everything left is clearance, no matter what the game says they're worth.  Exceptions are super common and free ones, like chemistry bench and ultracite PA basic plans, all of which I list for 0 caps.
---
Speaking of canvas bags, did they ship them out yet?
---
Ah gotcha, I wanted to give the camera to my gf but I guess we just have to keep server hoping for the camera dude. Thanks for the info y'all.
---
I have fairly recently had my brain opened to some of the things women have to live with everyday .... it's frightening and i bet most males in the world have absolutely no idea of the tension women and girls have to live with.  The potential escalation from simply saying "no" to someone, the unwanted attention, the constant "on guard" posture you need just to stay safe ... etc ... it's sad that what pretty much amounts to an "Incel" way of thinking should be floating so close to the surface of ordinary guys.
---
I made one. Just used a player vending machine and wrote “tips” on it with neon letters. Inside we’re just single junk items for various prices (25c, 50c, 100c, 250c, 500c, 1000c) in alphabetical order. No one’s used it though.
---
Black titanium is practically free now. I grabbed 200 for 1 cap ea last night.
---
Don't attack or ignore the insult bot because it really gets pissed off
---
yep, can confirm this method.  Also, crossbow doesn't have to be completely broken to repair, just get it down a bit to fix it.  Repeat.
---
Nailed it!! Thank you!!
---
What do you mean ? True though F duper’s I don’t get what you’re saying that
---
found a 3 * death tambo for 29 caps at whitesprings station.
---
hell yeah I'm gonna convert that to scrip.
---
Ah good tip
---
There are times I feel like I am playing a different game from everyone else. Maybe it's just exposure and i will stumble across these things eventually but I have "lived" all the fallout games for years and (very VERY wrongly) felt I should know more than a classic newbie by this stage of the game. I'm a level 60 and now that i think about it ... I'm probably playing too much like FO76 is a FPS, not a multiplayer universe .... hmmm .... things to think about. thank you very much!
---
This is posted every day and is also one of the retired topics under [Bethesda plz](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/bethesdaplz?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)
---
This would work nice in a faction based open world pvp persistent server.
---
Not the shitfest the game currently is.
---
Hahaha I feel like before I hop on the game I’m always on my phone, very high, and then find myself enjoying it like lil Fallout elevator music! It gets me in the mood to play the game
---
r/boneappletea
---
Toot sweet lmao
---
You shot a robot. That server won't exist in 24 hours, and just keep hopping (or walk away) from whitesprings.
---
And I thought this was just me! Good to know it's a bug I suppose. I've just stopped using VATS in melee.
---
Were you able to finish the survivor stories challenge? Its saying I still need the Colonel's holo but I've picked it up with both my characters
---
Yeah I get that, I also like to either keep the Pip-Boy radio on, or listen to my own fallout playlist when I play. I feel like all of that music just sets the mood for the game, I feel like the atomic shopping music fits.
---
I would totally buy a Sheepsquatch plushie, and a Jangles the Moon Moneky!
---
How about you adapt instead of whining to the devs to make it easier for you?
---
You want to put in the bare minimum of effort and somehow get the most out of your shitty 2x2 "camp".
---
Easy fix, run backwards.
---
That comes with a pull string.
---
"DEMOCRACY IS NON-NEGOTIABLE!"
---
At current duping rate and Bethesda’s total incompetence to handle duping and dupers, any handmades and BE lasers will be in the hundreds in a week. Then Bethesda will nerf them again so everyone got nothing but shit again. Duping always kills the game.
---
Sven worse when you have a shit ton of loot and the bag drop is 30 feet in the air.
---
I agree, if anything it's increased.
---
Thank you. With so many different variants of one item I didn't know if anyone had made a pricing guide yet.
---
I know this is a really old post but to clarify: The number shown for players who've won the trophies was compiled mid-November, so for games that came out around that time (Fallout 76 came out Nov 14), the number is inaccurate, which is why it was pulled off the site. Same with the Spyro trilogy. Somewhere around Nov 20, Bethesda tweeted that they had millions of players.
---
Try r/fo76bazaar
---
Didn’t know this one actually!
---
That’s an issue though! Melee has no access to crits then
---
I think that the available perk cards should be sorted by usage instead of alphabetical order. I'm quite sick of looking for super duper near the end of all available luck cards, or starched genes.
---
You can also turn on Passive mode so you cant accidently tag for PvP, its amazing for raids.
---
Well somebody needs to keep him company since we don't have NPC's.
---
Yup, I've been able to reproduce this at Ft Defiance a dozen times. 
---
They're not disappearing, they're just teleporting back to where they spawned.
---
If you find them and they look dead (or are standing but totally still) bash them a dozen times and they'll make death sounds and be lootable.
---
That's my kinda style. I don't mess with people but if they mess with me I'm going to fight back- even if they'll probably kill me. 
---
What system are you on? Say PS4 so we can start a vigilante crime fighting duo. I'll even be Robin if I have to. Though I'm going the Damian route if that's the case.
---
Prydwyn Plushie body pillow ftw
---
Yea that os a good point. But also without duping the vast majority of people wouldn’t have anything to get nerfed in the first place. I mean I think I’m level 150 and I’ve found 2 explosive weapons in all of my play through.  Well they patched the dupe (xbox) so I don’t think there will be a very many more than there are as of right now. Idk for sure tho. But I will say I think it messes up the servers or something because they have been running slow since the last update. Maybe because of the extra weapons on the game?
---
My wife thanks you as well!
---
I've started making supply kits when ever I see someone below lvl 5, usually just some Boiled Leather, a Serrated Machete as well as some Food/Water &amp; Meds.
---
I saw the same thing. Fell through the floor, and wound up in a ditch between the building and the ground outside.
---
I was able to jump back out though. About ten seconds later it fixed itself.
---
I'm going to bye duped item, and thus support dupers. Last time I passed, hoping everything will be erased, but they let dupes stay. Bethesda legitimized dupes, and now it's totally fair to bye duped items even if you exactly (via extreme rare stats) know it's duped. Sad, but legit.
---
It happens sometimes. For me like 50% chance.
---
Saw a guy make his sign say “Sheepsquatch ate my bitch!”
---
I want something like that giant Minatore mini boss in one of Eso's dlc's. Its in the dlc that gave us the Blade of Woe.
---
Holy shit. That actually worked.
---
Nice! Finally something that might actually kill you before getting to the end boss
---
Which is smarter, goat or sheep? Never had any farming experience.
---
Wtf is reboot?
---
I did Codebreaking, Swimming and Athlete. 
---
Codebreaking is dead easy (hack some terminals, launch a nuke), and Athlete has obstacle courses that are actually pretty fun (more of these, please!). As others have said, reviving an ally in the water is a pain – mostly because my allies kept dying outright, drowning seems to properly kill you – but otherwise not too hard. Make sure you've got a swimsuit.
---
Saw it at vault 76 yesterday
---
Athletic challenges won't start for me anymore. I push the button and nothing or it talks but never starts
---
I think it would be broken if you could swap metas in the midst of PvP. It doesn't take to long to switch around your cards
---
Good idea.  Looking back I do love the fact that we as a player base do get to make the market.
---
Thank you, I am on PC though. My new Character is Baba Yaga
---
Sorry JanynFletcher one word
---
Burgle the cat?
---
People bring their real world behavior right into video games. It’s the thought that counts. Those who lie and steal in real world will continue in video games. When caught they all try to lie their asses out of it, none of them were man enough to admit it. That really reveals what kind of individuals they are. It’s just sad to see parasites destroy the beautiful world Bethesda artists put together and the company hasn’t done much to stop it. If they take one to court and let him pay a huge fine, the rest of them will vanish in seconds.
---
If it was a perk that ranked up you could never have on one star picklock or hacker.
---
POLES ON THE CORNERS OF MY PORCH!!!  😌
---
These are all great — can't wait to watch them. Would be great to see advanced stuff for doors/electric/terminals. I spent hours figuring out that stuff.
---
Canvas bag lol they didn’t !
---
The terminals I used (with some server hopping):
---
* 0-level: downstairs at the General's Steakhouse; the Tygart water treatment plant
---
* 1-level: Sunday Brother's cabin
---
* 2-level: Appalachian Antiques
---
* 3-level: Grafton Dam, Poseidon
---
Same on PC.
---
This is why I destroyed my drum.
---
Yeah, that doesn’t look right lol. You may have busted a duper or found someone offloading their mules maybe?
---
Hopefully Bethesda see this.
---
This is the best thing about having crap Internet... I have time to run away from the camp before it loads in so I don't get stuck 😂
---
I don't know how he's getting that much for sale, but that guy is probably a duper with that much radshield alone.
---
Raising cap every other month is a bad idea. I like horizontal feel of character development.
---
How much more carry capacity dues the basic pack add?  How much does high capacity hold?
---
&gt;This. I started with medic but the diffuser isn't in the game. 
---
FYI, I’m 99% sure they’ve stated they’re aware of this one and it’ll be added in the next patch.
---
Haven’t seen anything on the frog habitat yet, though.
---
Why would you keep them on always? You can change them out whenever you need to pick/hack something. Use those perk slots for much more useful things
---
I'm more surprised you played the game for over 1200 hrs. Jeez.
---
Uh oh... your bout to see the haters
---
But even if he got everything by duping or not how could he bypass the stash limit? I haven't heard of that glitch before
---
Ifnonlynwe could light the bag on fire
---
Why’s that?
---
That mental image properly made me laugh! 😂
---
You mean me taking over an hour because I didn't realise what was the problem.
---
Eat more fiber
---
i will be sure to tag you
---
Don't worry, it's not like he's Yongyea.
---
It was the requisition holotapes. I was giving them away for people that might need them because my CAMP is near Vault 76.
---
I dont know but people are haters on juicehead for whatever reason.. I dont
---
It was originally 12 cores per hour (1 every 5 minutes), Bethesda thought this was too much and wanted to lower it by 33% to 8 cores but they screwed up during data input. Instead of 8.0, they entered 0.8 which we were stuck with for a patch. They fixed it and made it 8.0
---
30 for the basic and 120 for the high capacity (-60 in both energy and radiation resistance)
---
Do you have the herbivore mutation?
---
To be fair I always choose to be a conduit and then ISS kills me almost immediately. And I kill the robots cuz they are attacking me. I'm high level and still get killed over and over no matter what I do.
---
Also ❤️ the user name
---
I lol’d way more than I should have at this.
---
Eats it right up, you only get on try.
---
When I get into someones locked house, I leave a Propaganda Flyer on their bed
---
Might be an idea to report the dude to Bethesda support if you haven't already.
---
This is what I did, too... lol
---
That works. I suspect they broke it up to allow for level requirements. 
---
Though why they can't have level requirements within a perk card like fo4 is beyond me.
---
Absolutely no idea how they’ve done it but they’re almost definitely cheating. It’s that kind of thing that knackered server stability. People doing this really should be permanently banned in my opinion.
---
Yep.
---
I always take a few with me.
---
You guys are sweet ignorance is truly bliss
---
Even if I had a slot to spare I still wouldn't keep them on.
---
I do not want to have to fight with people to pick up items to view. This sounds like a giant cluster****.
---
I don't think charisma or the Hard Bargain perk affects the amount of scrip you receive.
---
I won’t say bugged but the leatherwork one has scrap 5 death claw hides which don’t drop from deathclaws but are rare finds in containers
---
Survival mode is all about the normal game with freedom to pvp. Most ppl will attack on sight in this mode so dying happens fast and without warning. You can tell where the pvpers are pretty easy and it's easy to avoid them or join them. I know full n well the risk of losing caps n junk randomly to players who find me or were stalking me I love survival mode as it is with all the fighting and avoiding fights it has to offer. I dont see why ppl wanna change it when theres other options for them
---
Don’t think so got the glow fly yesterday from dolly’s
---
Check mutations.
---
Stealing can never be justified by saying we aren’t paid enough. When people complained Bethesda listened. So many awesome changes have been made since release. If many players complain about low drop rate they will increase it. Instead dupers made top gear worthless and ruined the game and Bethesda had no choice but nerf gears that are being abused and also made top tier drop even more rare. In the end everybody lost except the dupers who made a small fortune in real world money.
---
Awesome. Thanks. Was it hard to get the basic?
---
Basically. And no one wants pvp
---
I heard that it was tdm not br
---
A lot of people don't seem to like him. Not sure why. Some of his videos are nice to get info out of.
---
Oh my god, yeah I just realized that’s probably the culprit - thanks, man.
---
Then what did you mean by your last comment? o,O
---
I just renamed it for fun
---
That’s what I’m doing lol, you don’t have to like the guy but the info on the game that he is providing is valuable in some way.
---
Report the duping scum
---
Yeah I agree
---
Yea the backpack is still shown when I'm in my power armor. 
---
But Bethesda doesn't want me to have a fridge in my power armor so too bad for me.
---
The basic was comparatively easier since you only have to do 3 of the lower level badges (and most of the exam answers people posted up by now)
---
im_chris1186 I need revive in water to I'll return favor
---
The rabbit one
---
Report him
---
Imagine roaming through the wasteland only to hear a megaspeaker of sorts blasting Barbie girl
---
Uranium Fever does that sometimes too
---
*big iron intensifies*
---
What does this mean
---
Oh didn't think of that
---
Context sensitive keys are annoying. I tend to get it in pipboy. Either fav/unfav items or move my camp when I just want to navigate tabs.
---
Aww I thought BGS did it. XD
---
Time to buy a $2 mic and play stuff off of my phone into my mic while convincing everyone that it sounds perfectly fine
---
I really like that I can have on 1, 2 or 3 star picklock. Where because of changing points I need 2 star ghoulish and I only have 3 star. You can't stack individual cards that can be ranked up so you have to rank them up but you can't take the rank down after that. Picklock and hacking at the moment at least give you the ability to change star rating.
---
There are a few bugs with the vending machine .
---
Make sure you log out than back in to see if it's just a visual bug. Also before you log out see if you can pick them up. If you can't it's just the visual bug. If you can it's one of the dupe exploit.
---
Again that isn’t how the quest works. Now it’s just gibberish. Siri power off
---
I saw someone who had 17000 and more rounds of amunition for sale
---
Yea and pipe-automatic weapons didn’t count as “automatic weapons” for the hunter badge for me either.
---
I would only want a diseased glowing ghoul plushie if it lit up like Glo Worm.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glo_Worm
---
My special stats were all messed up for a brief minute.
---
Also bad lol
---
Not interested in pvp personally, which is exactly why I play games like fallout. But I guess there a people that would enjoy it and Bethesda seems to be trying to please everyone.
---
Unfortunately I fear trying to please everyone may well be their downfall.
---
YES - Even with perks that are meant to reduce thrist/hunger..
---
They sell the caps on EBay for real monies
---
Ahh, okay. Still easier to equip one ranked up perk than scrolling through to find all 3 or 2. Eh, to each their own I guess.
---
I mean yeah but walking backwards just fixed it?
---
Spent my mother's day in Appalachia
---
Idk. The number 1 thing I see in here is people complaint that they never get good drops or that 3 star enemies always drop 1 Star legendaries. Also the game is far from ruined for me. And even if they did nerf my bloodied explosives (which I don’t think they will...again) my build will still be great for pve. I get what your saying but I don’t think I lost out by getting god roll weapons for half price at this point. And to be honest, without duping no one would have an explosive lever or handmade and they would never be traded or sold because they would literally be the rarest guns in the game. Even with the original dupes they were still 20-50k IF someone was crazy enough to sell for caps. I do get what your saying and I genuinely respect your opinion, even if we disagree.
---
I already did the camp McClintock agility course ling time ago, it won't let me do it again. Says talk to master sergeant, and he says I'm a general. Nothing let's me start the test again. Please help
---
Well I went backwards forwards and in circles but yeah something worked lol
---
Cant get private servers up soon enough. I only take the shops for the fusion cores, I only need the fusion cores for my power armor and laser gat, both of which are great for pve but crao at pvp. I could make a pvp build, but then I wouldnt be playing fallout, I would be playing a shitty version of fortnite. defending a shop is impossible without stealth and a pvp set up. it sucks. that is not the fallout I want to play. luckily i get left alone most of the time but theres always that one dick thats gotta f a good gaming session up for me.
---
Pictures of dead things count so you could try blowing up a vertibot and taking a photo of the remains.
---
I predict the battle royale mode will be as dead as the pvp server.
---
I ended up joining your game. Thanks so much dude!
---
yes  i cant play long sessions because the only real music radio atation only has like 20ish songs which I know by heart now and its anti immersive. 
---
Using spotify via ps4 doesnt quite cut it imo
---
There are people who enjoy battle royale but I don’t think there’s any that enjoy it broken
---
The stimpaks do not really stand out to me. It is legitimately possible to farm/craft that many.
---
Why would one do that? Unsure, but it is achievable over a few days.
---
Conversely, thousands of X-Cell and RadShield? That would take months and in the case of X-Cell I have... reservations.
---
All they gotta do is add a tag to current weapons, and delete those without said tag. Their code is simple af, tbh
---
If you use your jet pack you can literally watch it drain
---
Interesting, it’s still competitive PVP
---
To be fair I use an accelerated minigun, lmg and .50 mg so I’ve often got more than 20k of each ammo type.
---
(I spend soooo many caps on steel 😂)
---
The mod doesn’t stack with the original capacity?
---
What's worse is the dupers will have a huge advantage over all of the legitimate players. People who spend hours every day grinding for high tier gear are outclassed by people who spent a couple hours duplicating items.
---
Burn him burn him burn him.....
---
Oh nice, that’ll be good for events to
---
I can't even view my challenges so I don't know what they are. Just not gonna bother with the backpack mostly a PA user anyway
---
Please, it was a joke. 
---
Everyone knows what's going on at this point, especially if you are active on the market as I am.
---
Well if it’s truly battle royale then you would come in empty handed and only be able to use what weapons you find
---
correct
---
If they have a large house and you're on their team, hide a powered sound box somewhere. Make it a siren if you're feeling ambitious.
---
Awesome glad u got it!!
---
it says i know the plan, but i don’t.  i mean, wouldn’t the vending machine list if i had known it before buying it?  what do i do with the plan now, keep it? sell it?
---
Let's say he got everything just farming but how can he have so much stuff in his stash if the limit is only 800 pounds? He has thousands of pounds stored
---
Send them to me too
---
Really?? Last time I tried doing that I hit an invisible ceiling. I couldn't go above like five stories.
---
I’m in the same boat I’ve got so many skins but this one looks so awesome I might have to buy a few atoms.....
---
Well like I was saying I think the leaderboard is really important to this fighting and avoiding fights dynamic. If your position is marked based on things that you can't really control (time alive, survival points...) You can't avoid fighting which is why I think it's detrimental and should be changed.
---
I can't start camp McClintock. I already did it long time ago and won't let me again please help
---
They don't. An armor's condition does not alter its resistances.
---
If you double-space at the end of a word then hit enter it jumps the next line, like this:
---
Some people say a man is made outta mud  
---
A poor man's made outta muscle and blood  
---
Muscle and blood and skin and bones  
---
A mind that's a-weak and a back that's strong
---
They’re nerfed the item because they could not figure out how to stop the ripper from being powerful.
---
Instead of giving difficult content they choose to make the players weaker. \o/
---
Based off of the recently datamined information, Nuclear Winter  will introduce a battle royal game mode as well as other PVP type modes. This is sad news, especially since the majority of players are looking for a PVE experience from this game. The battle royal bandwagon will ruin all of the progress that this game has made since launch, especially if Bethesda does what Epic did with Fortnite, which was originally a story based PVE game.   
---
The PVE aspect of Fallout 76 will suffer as development shifts towards the PVP cash grab that is battle royal. In turn, this game will fizzle out and die a proper death since there is no way it will be able to compete with franchises who have capitalized on the battle royal genre.
---
It doesn't. My friend tried it on his PC without luck, I tried taking all my mods off and relogging, I tried rebooting my PC and I've tried giving it time (up to an hour). The singular character does not log in at all I just get "DISCONNECTED FROM SERVER" and occassionally the game will bug out not showing a menu at all, although I can interact nothing comes up so I have to force close Bethesda's launcher (as the process magically disappears to).   
---
I can log into my other characters without an issue, just my main is somehow corrupted IG?
---
I’m asking if you’re saying it’s bullshit because I am the one saying it or because you listened to all those voice line and conclude something different
---
I would say your graphics card is fine, it happens to me on PS4 at times although my character has been and alcoholic for a while.
---
My friends and I have had the best luck looking at the top of the lighthouse.
---
I can not attack certain enemies when I use VATS. I hit enemies and they don’t take damage, they hit me and I do. Bugs. Annoying bugs too.
---
If I hear that 'I didn't know the gun was loaded' song again I think I am going to fucking kill myself.

^^I ^^am ^^a ^^bot.  ^^Feedback ^^appreciated.
---
I havent played survival this week I'm stuck in stupid backpack shit in adventure so I dont know how the new scoreboard is personally. I'll be back when I'm get ot over with tho
---
Me
---
I had a feeling they nerfed it. Sucks they did though because the bonus was pretty nice for the armor.
---
Yeah, it would be nice to get the wilhelm. I remember how the goats in wasteland 2 would make that sound from time to time...always catches you off guard
---
I got mine from the super mutant vendor at level 37
---
I don’t know but something sounds fishy about that. I just started collecting possum badges so idk yet.
---
Try exiting out of build mode then go back in.
---
THIS FUCKING RIGHT HERE!!!
---
I lucked into a Mirelurk Queen getting herself stuck on the concrete, (just west of Watoga) right EXACTLY where my artillery barrage landed, and guess what it did to that big ugly?! NOT A GOD DAMNED THING!!@#!$#!!
---
I did more damage, faster, with my gatling gun. SO F'ING ST00PID!!
---
There are a few backpack mods that you don't need to "know" the plan to apply the mod, simply having it in your inventory is enough.
---
I've seen posts all day with people asking to borrow backpack plans to apply their mods.
---
Haha brooo you just found a duper forsure hahaha i would shit my self and become friends with him after just to get stuff from him tho not add him on console or whatever hahaha
---
You are one dense mother fucker.
---
Cool thanks
---
I think we should all be forced to use commie wackers. That way it's 100% fair for everyone.
---
I get this a lot. I honestly hope they don't remove it
---
Yeah I dont get that - stimpacks in my stash weigh 1lb, so that doesnt seem possible
---
It does stack. There’s a bug where once you own the plan it automatically has you learn it. You’ll still have the plan in your inventory.
---
The hc mod gives an extra 60lbs carry weight with -60(?) dr
---
I’ve tried that, even moving the walls here and there, and it’s just been cycling through all the available errors like “support is needed” and “no object selected”
---
Top part of the map. Toxic Valley. At least, it's where I see the most acid deposits.
---
Oh I'd support that then. I need content like that. The recent dupe exploit completely killed this game for me.
---
Try out middle section Savage Divide
---
I keep finding him at Janet’s pretty often but he never has the damn coat.
---
Idk then. This fallout build is more architectural than fo4's artistic building.
---
Oh alright, glad to hear it wasn't malicious.
---
It made sense too. If it is more durable, then surely the armor reenforced.
---
My mic did not work in this game for a few months after release, but worked in everything else. Turns out some Windows privacy setting or permission was screwing it up. I think this is what fixed it for me.
---
Windows 10: "Settings" -&gt; "Privacy Settings" -&gt; "App Permissions \ Microphone" and turning on "Allow apps to access your microphone"
---
For ammo it's not so crazy if you have a heavy build, right now I have like 7000 between .50 and 5mm, also ammo doesn't weigh that much
---
Noted. Wasn't aware that existed.
---
It's actually kind of a neat idea.
---
A set of power armors for 150 bucks haha
---
I saw I guy with 60 of them. They are being duped like crazy. Don't waste your caps. Be patient, make some friends and you can probably get one for free.
---
Nice solution though. They CAN download DLC. Just put an equivalent price
---
The material would be too expensive and we’d receive Cardboard cutouts
---
Can I borrow the plan for caps? :)
---
What’s your gt?
---
Okay I Got you , i did found some good youtubers that said they will grind the BADGES out but havent posted anything yet prolly kuz they are so long to do haha ..
---
So a 3* proper RNG’d bloodied power fist is worth 150 caps to you?
---
Do like. Also reminds me of the music from the original Sims game.
---
Want to explore more lounge music? Check out some of the stuff from Soft Tempo Lounge on youtube.
---
I'd take a cardboard cutout (as long as it's for free and not to replace what would probably cost $45)
---
I can only hope I find someone, because I tend to solo most of the time... And avoid people.
---
Congrats. I just got the armored backpack myself. Good luck with the possum missions and avoid leather one. Deathclaw hide isn't in the game yet.
---
The bad man touched his back hole?
---
I'll check it out thanks
---
Youre lowballing yourself on good rolls, but hey, makes people happy.
---
It doesn't, no, but it still really bogs down the gameplay sometimes, and more than once I've found myself crafting a ton of bullets or something only to realize that I forgot to equip the super duper perk and lost the chance at all the extra ammo it would have gotten me. If it was as easy as pushing a few buttons every time I go back to camp, I probably wouldn't forget as much. I do agree that it would be broken if you could swap like that, that's why I'd sooner see it with some limitations, such as being disabled when in combat for instance, or being reliant on a placeble camp item (a card binder, maybe).
---
1. There is no hint they have any plans to make that Battle Royale the sole center point of upcoming updates
---
2. They have given no sign that Survival mode is their new focus, given all the new content updates following it have been PvE related in every way
---
3. You're a year old account with 11 karma and like, the fifth of your kind I've seen today alone, where the fuck are all you alts and throw aways coming from?
---
Agreed , I'm tired of running around taking pictures and collecting boy scout badges, I want this to feel like I'm in the apocalypse
---
is that a mod for the backpack?
---
If I'm not going to use it and its just taking up space, then yes.
---
...secret passage?!
---
Tried this recently 
---
Been changed, unless you’re ages away from the first bag, they just amalgamate
---
I'm all about spreading the love lol
---
Yes you can buy it with possum tokens. It reduces the carry weight of the backpack to 30 but gives a huge 91 damage resistance.
---
There is a skate ramp by the Riverside manor would be totally stoked to see some skate action in the wasteland!
---
It just works.
---
Download Zedge and search fallout 76, make it your ringtone
---
Also, metal worker, electrician and railway expert were the easiest badges to obtain imo.
---
They do stack.
---
OP is nutty.
---
100% the engine can't handle that. It can barely handle 2 people pvping let alone a full battle royale
---
Sounds like a food build thing to do 😉😁
---
I have a similar pricing strategy. 100c per star. Unless it’s something epic.
---
I bought a two shot Gatling for 450 caps
---
Are you sure? I swear I got a hide from a DC a few days ago? It scrapped as leather?
---
Thanks yes it’s great to be able to use the best weapons in the game without actually farming for it, which can take from 10 days to 10 years depending on RNG. To the game company however duping really kills the longevity of the game. Few people will grind for the good gear because they can easily buy from dupers. Then after a short period of fun they will stop playing for good. Why do anyone still play a game if they can one or two shot most bosses. In order to counter that Bethesda has to keep nerfing them and killing the fun for everyone.
---
I usually only sell them for about 1k :( sorry you haven’t been able to find it
---
If you are looking for ammo it's better to find a lead deposit and make your own. Near the top right of the map, to the northwest of the red rocket truck stop, is an ammunition factory. Not only can you make ammo for free, there is a lead deposit as well. There might be lead deposits you can build your camp near, although I've never bothered looking.
---
So... Any luck??
---
I don't think you can even have more than one anymore, right?
---
I only used a Tesla once... Does it chain through adjacent enemies every time?
---
Same but I'm finding him more but he doesn't have it
---
They drop deathclaw hands, not hide. If you can any find evidence of the existence of hide, please let me know. You can find posts from people claiming to kill 100+ deathclaws without a hide drop.
---
Nope. Kinda just forgot about it and started picking away at other challenges.
---
I do this, but then just lay in their bed, lmao.
---
Can you list stuff that 'in your character' or only in your stash?
---
Because if is the latter I cannot wrap my head around how that is possible.
---
Chems without weigh reducing perks are heavy and those do not affect the stash at all.
---
800 stimpaks alone will fill your stash.
---
Across from.the keypad door, a little down that narrow hall is some bramble/vines on a wall, walk thru it. Theres yet a second secret passage inside that one as well
---
Given that fences were already the most broken item in the game and the last patch, which was supposedly meant to fix them, broke them *even more*, I don't know if I'd trust them to not make an invincible Lvl 1024 Scorchbeast spawn every time you tried to place one. \*rolls eyes\*
---
All I want to do is snap the fence I used to have back where it was, damnit.
---
The server is probably laggy because it's overloaded with duped items.
---
There’s lucky break or whatever that could be blocking. Int and luck should have it all.
---
Let's just make CAMPs completely immune to all damage.
---
It's ass when someone can pull a Scorchbeast or something over and it destroy everything.
---
Vats is screwed up in general. On a pistol sniper build with concentrated fire, all headshots. Can normally take a super mutant out at Mac range in 3/4 clip, now I can’t take one out right in front of me, with the second shot going up to 95% accuracy. No or almost no damage 1/2 the time.
---
And having limited time to play (I'm in the same boat) makes it last just that much longer.
---
+30 is the Carry of the Tadpole Backpack you get at completion of Tadpole Quest.  You also learn to craft it at the same time.  So if you craft a lvl50 Backpack its +60 Carry
---
Like right by the place, or down the road?
---
You get points when you get experience points and also if you kill someone you take a percentage of the points they had accumulated. Just do the backpack stuff on survival like us proper players 😉
---
I do the same. I sell legendaries for 50c per star and plans/maps/recipes for 10c and special clothing for &lt;50c. I just visited on one camp selling 3 star knife for 700c and 3 star rifle for 1500c which might not even be that bad if I could inspect it and see what are the other 2 legendary effects (Bethesda please allow us to inspect stuff on player vendors!). One camp was selling lame legendaries and basic plans for ridiculous prices such as 20k caps... Like what's wrong with people? No one will buy 1 star lvl 5 Zealot baseball bat for 10.000 caps...
---
I no-lifed it. I had most of them done the second day :D
---
They should totally include this after eating a glowing fungus.
---
I really agree with your ideas and think it would be an awesome idea outside of PvP.
---
Bug. You’re not stupid at all!
---
They exist on xbox. I found one in a container at solomons pond.
---
Yea that is a good point! I’m sure a lot of  casual players would lose the will to grind if they already had every thing to grind for. I guess for people who play more seriously we are never happy! Lol. I know I’m always trying to get the next best thing or switch up my builds. Personally I can’t wait for this new vendor so maybe I can get something weird or a combo I maybe hadn’t thought of before. I know a lot of people have been bitching about the purveyor but I see it as an absolute win tbh.
---
I think it’s bugged. My friends and I have has similar issues.
---
I was able to log in today, took about 22 hours of waiting from my last login. No issues server hopping either. Fingers crossed it stays that way
---
it wasn't nerfed. it was a bug. 
---
the card says nothing about increasing an armors stats, only condition.
---
it was a bug, and they fixed it. we all saw this coming a long time ago.
---
Spreading the love makes this game good. I got some choice picks from vendors (player and robot) thanks to the kindness of others, and I plan on paying back (or forward). Good on the OP.
---
Looks like a super duper to me! I would report and also don’t buy from people like this.
---
Oh no, do you play on PC...? I hope that wasn't mine.
---
HambleBoBamble, on xbox though
---
Tennessee Ernie Ford is the shit. I'd throw a few Shenandoahs into the rotation myself. The first time that came on when I was prowling through ruins it gave me chills.
---
You know, I knew this.
---
And yet I did it anyway.  🤪
---
fucking yongyea.
---
Man would be nice if they worked that good on all my other weapons haha.
---
Ah!  The game's afoot!!
---
as far as i understand it, when you offer an item in your inventory, it moves it into the stash.
---
don't quote me on that one, though.
---
Cool!!
---
Ah thank you - don’t understand why this isn’t an option on PC!
---
I can get lag, but servers I get put in don't feel laggy, unless I'm joining a friend from a different country. Also, it only doesn't respond when using consumable item or note in the pipboy and never does that with any other actions.
---
They should!
---
It seems like they are mostly in containers now and 10 times rarer to boot.
---
For the cargobot I found it less 'hit and miss' to do the event in Morgantown Airport.
---
You have plenty of time there to snap the picture.
---
For the vertibot I just hopped around the workshops that have one - ammunition factory, power plant, airport (not Morgantown, the other one), didn't take me long to find one.
---
I got my backpack the night before the last maintenance and have't been able to complete certain challenges in the Possum category. Be wary of that. Not all are able to be completed right now.
---
And congrats on the backpack. It's nice.
---
Go to a small stream on whitesprings close to the golf club where the firecrackers spawn and hold a grenade while in the stream this helps
---
Hell, I'd be happy with a square build area.
---
Thanks!  Additional Tip:  complete Collision Course at Morgantown Airport and snap a photo of the cargo bot at the end.
---
i just hope i can get a decent deathclaw gauntlet.
---
in my entire time of playing this game since launch, i have only ever had one legendary drop.
---
it's actually a decent 1* role, 10% more damage if mutated, but i want one with like, faster swing speed or something.
---
What system are you on? I already sold mine but I can hunt it down for you. I’m on PS4
---
I bought the game a week before launch, played for 2 weeks, and left it sitting.
---
This patch made me check the game out again and I'm really surprised how much better the game is now. No more FPS drops on PS4, combat is smooth, my VATS isnt perma-bugged anymore 
---
The stash is HUGE now. Holy crap. And the backpacks are an awesome addition.
---
This game has really turned around
---
Grafton, WV and Philadelphia.
---
https://www.philly.com/news/mothers-day-philadelphia-anna-jarvis-history-20190512.html
---
Me too...gonna have to keep an eye out. Cheers
---
I knew immediately, same thing happened to me.
---
Hard Bargain definitely does affect Scrip.  Check unequipped vs equipped.   It's a pretty significant difference.
---
Take over Grafton Steel workshop for a bit and power the steel extractors and build a lead extractor.  Oh and you can harvest gunpowder from nearby supermutants.
---
It's a win-win-win!
---
I had similar issues expanding my camp, is that an internal or external roof above or below another roof? It took be about an hour but I realised if I switched and/or extended the height of my building with half walls you can then place a roof on top of them. 
---
I think the glitch, or design, updated in the last patch is that you can’t snap a roof if it would interact or intersect with both the floor and top of a single wall piece which already has a roof interacting with it
---
I'm also on ps4, my psn is the same as my username.
---
Well Thats pretty awesome. Is that ballistic resistance
---
Alright. I’ll start looking
---
i'm going to be the one to point out the rumors with the "lunch boxes" that were supposedly going to be sold on the atom shop.
---
and it never happened.
---
take this "rumor" with a grain of salt, especially when it comes from that dude.
---
Saw a perfectly preserve pie going for $275, I was tempted but then thought I’d be just pissing away caps. I think it’s one of those thinks where I want to feel the satisfaction of getting that pie on my own someday.
---
I had something like that happen to me in college once.
---
Thanks in advance.
---
Had the happen today, sold a LMG.  Now if only someone would take the fatman off my hands.
---
The grid should appear only on and around foundation and extractors.
---
I'm in canada aswell. How did you activate a EU key to play on NA? From what I can tell the codes themselves of Region locked even if the game isn't.
---
Are they a mod or a plan? I just started the missions so I'm behind.
---
Well they were datamined as actual objects to be sold in the atom shop if I remember and there were even graphics and 3d models of them weren’t there? If it never happened it seems like a change of plans for Bethesda, not just a false rumor that had no credibility.
---
Other people on this sub said you can find deathclaw hide in like one location and it just spawns it's not a kill drop idk tho
---
Except if it was an unintended bug introduced by one of the other changes in Patch 9, like Bethesda does every so often.
---
I personally had my food and water depleting at roughly the same speed up until Patch 9, and now my water meter seems to be dropping 2-3 times as quick as food.
---
Theres probably a few reasons why
---
I have 2 right now....down from 6 three days ago
---
Also the Speed Demon Mutation which prolly everyone has does drain the Food/Water Meter faster.
---
Thanks, friend ♥️
---
Every patch someone says this. Every single one.
---
Maybe the patch has changed how you play? Are you fast traveling more? That drains the water meter. Using more chems? Ditto. 
---
The meter drain hasn’t changed, you have. Every single patch.
---
Yeah i think you are right because since the past update i haved killed like 5 and i have gotten the hide before

Bethesda is walking into wrong way with Fo76... We don't want battle royale or PvP. Fallout community would want more base building, survival, NPC, more different quest (like we have not gotten like lying lowe and pioneer scouts). I'd love to have multiple camps, I'd love to have bigger camp. Id love to "clean" some locations and restore them. Like restore responders airport. not entirely but rebuild the world, like the game was adverticed. except that's not possible in online game, so in conclusion: WE NEED OFFLINE MODE AND NPC!
---
Oh yes the purveyor is definitely a great addition. Again it really showed that Bethesda does listen and improve their game when players complain. Like you said I keep wondering what else weird combo could be out there to make my seemingly great build even better. That and the beautiful atmosphere are the only reason I’m still playing. Let’s hope the purveyor has some nice surprises for us instead of the usual ‘junkies with bashing damage’.
---
When did they do this?
---
No problem. And if you are really wanting it and I’m not able to find it really soon, I can give you mine for like 200 caps maybe

---
It’s above a (single-level) stairs.
---
I think it’s related to how the recent patch broke stairs more than it already is, I can’t place most things under the stairs when I could last time, and those that could always pop up to the second floor when placed. Might be the construction placement box (but not the snap point) for the stairs just shifted up an entire level?

Alright thanks.

---
I had the hardest time this morning getting some foundations to work. They said that all you need to do is place 1 down and the rest don't matter, but it's even worse now when you want to change like 2 things you have to take half your build apart because you keep getting that damned, "Part of your base will be inaccessible." message. I nearly cried for real.

It's not fun or realistic. My dude eats and drinks more than I do irl

Lol I am prepared for a senseless amount of bullshit but no doubt about it I’m going to dumb every piece of scrip I have in the vendor the first day! Also all I ever do is drop or vendor all those random legendaries. 3 star hunting pipe wrench with blocking? 40 scrip! Lol
---
Every patch, man. I don’t think people realize all the things that increase thirst, and when anew patch comes out they change their play style and that new style drains water faster. They didn’t nerf food and drink to make refrigeration pointless. They don’t have anything in the atom shop that helps with thirst. They have no reason to nerf this and make money. They aren’t some evil corporation looking to nickel and dime you every chance they get. They didn’t do it this patch. They didn’t do it last patch. Or the one before. Or before. Or before. 
---
FFS everything’s a conspiracy. 
---
I maintain well fed for my 2* rejuvenated cards. I pay very close attention to my thirst and always have. There’s no change. Stop fast traveling so much for the new content.
---
I like leading creatures to destroy their camps now that I can't do it.  Creativity!
---
Devote a lot of time. Did 3+hrs of wavy Willard’s and White springs hopping and nothing.
---
Absurd.
---
Just pick a location quest guy spawns at and server hop till hes there. Thats what i did
---
I agree, but everything you described is basically single player fallout. Base building/NPCs/quests/offline mode  are what fallout 4 is centered around. The problem is that they didn’t create this game as a multiplayer online game just to slowly turn it into a single player offline experience. They’re set on bringing in new features like PVP/Battle Royale that expand the multiplayer online factor of this game which makes sense because that’s why this game was made in the first place. It wasn’t made just to be changed slowly into a single player like experience. In my opinion, THAT would be taking this multiplayer game in the wrong direction. I want a new single player offline fallout game as badly as anyone else but this is not the game for that, fallout 5 is.
---
I’m going to do a few hops and if I don’t get it, you can have it. I know how it feels looking for something like that and feeling unlucky. I’ve done this so many times looking for other things he sells and I can get lucky with him some days

I check back in with you tomorrow after I kill a few.

I haven't seen any change in the length of time it takes for a gun to break
---
Oh I totally agree, had a similar experience earlier in the day too. Bethesda’s build restrictions are arbitrary at this point, because I’ve seen giant floating monstrosities around, and yet a vertical flight of multi-level stairs “will be inaccessible”.
---
I got one that works from Tanagra Town. Go to the very top house and then you will have to climb and jump up to the second story. Royal Jelly is in the tub. This one works. I did find one that is bugged and doesn't work. That one is on 59 road just as it meets up with 94. There's a skeleton with a bike and you will find Royal Jelly there. This one will only show up in your junk and won't work in the recipe.
---
Yep! It's there! Thanks!
---

Ye, after you pick it, it shows as (known).
---
I don’t understand why Bethesda would ever implement private servers in a game they specifically created to be a massive online multiplayer game. Why would they want you playing alone?
---
Juice is awesome.   I don’t see the haters doing videos or anything useful for that matter
---
I just checked that and you can't sell things in your character, it goes to your stash
---
You are right
---
Yeah it’s a pretty good deal if you think about it. If you don’t like the purveyor’s random three star item, drop it off at the recycle machine and it holds 40% of original value. The legendary scrip is a much better currency than caps. My max level bloodied three star fire axe only worth 17 caps lol.
---
Personally, I feel like it's a completely separate discussion as far as C.A.M.P. attacks go, and the solution to this issue would simply be to make it so that the vendor machine does not get reset when it gets destroyed, and rather remembers what's being vendored, so that you only need to rebuild stuff.

---
Yep, atom shop fridge mod assured spoilage rate would get increased, gotta create the problem to sell the solution.
---
you on PC?
---
I'd say you're severely undercutting yourself for 3s and 2s, but for 1s where they literally make up about 95% of all legendaries, they're not worth a damn. Seeing people trying to sell a 1 star hunting rifle with the assassins effect for 500 caps is insane.
---
I only run gunsmith 3 and I don't really mind. I just mele most stuff until I really need range. But yeah it does degrade faster. I found I have over 20 repair kits in my stash. Never bought a single one.
---
This is a very good idea.
---
It is! Haha  i love walking around showing it off haha

https://youtu.be/u4RcHQJBzr4  it did :) you needed vats headshot critical, nothing else would kill those people.

Heh, we're only at the start of the '4-6 months' they quoted for manufacture of the canvas bags. Hell I'm an international customer and I think I'll be lucky to have it before October.

Yes this is way easier than the US aid drops
---
He's a mixed bag in my opinion but I get where some of the hate is coming from.
---
He's very much the kind of youtuber that cares more about sustaining and maintaining his revenue stream than his content. Not as bad as a lot granted but far from  Totalbiscuit-like champion of the people.
---
During the early days, he openly admitted disliking the game and only playing it to make youtube videos. On a number of controversial topics you see him not at all give his opinion in case it has the chance of alienating his viewer base. Prime example is his thoughts on duping and exploits. Back in his earlier videos, he refused to give an opinion one way or the other. You even see him trying to milk likes because he spent so much listening to so much audio regarding the recent datamine/new orange crate stuff that he did a vid on recently (poor little dear).
---
On the other hand, his content has gotten better than the lowest of low effort youtubers (looking at you Yongyea). Hardly a high bar admittedly. He's followed up with dupers about getting more info about what's going on in the scene. Talk to banned players about their banning situation (though he could be more rigorous than just taking them at their word like with Mr 900 hrs).
---
Like I said, mixed bag. I find someone like MrMatty more ethical overall in terms of his Fallout coverage but Juicehead for me is ok. At least he's one of the few presences still left in the scene. I still watch Juicehead's stuff but I never take his content at face value.
---
no probs, good luck
---
Hi I know this isn’t actually evidence but I did pick up a deathclaw hide from a container outside of the tattoo parlour however that’s the only one I’ve found
---
Unless they changed it in a recent patch, crouching definitely hides you on the compass, regardless of your agility and perks. I don’t see any point in investing in perks and stats to escape and go stealth after someone has spotted you. Your info on how everything else works is spot on. So if people are interested and want to invest in stealth perks to specifically escape or hide after being spotted, which I highly advise against, go ahead and invest in stealth perk cards. You are much better off with one chameleon armor piece as you said and crouching then jumping around with vats after being spotted. Again, there are exceptions like sniping people from really far away and running back and trying to re enter stealth as they close in but that’s a very specific play style and super challenging, considering many pvp people run in teams with explosive weapons and time to kill is extremely fast.
---
Im on now but you will have to explain it to me
---
Because you have to do camp venture not camp mcclintock.
---
still around?
---
Maybe a mid-point where the barricade and  fusion generator aren't made of tissue paper and/or the turrets occasionally hit their targets...
---
I have turrets and spotlight, and half the time I still find the turrets sitting there doing nothing or shooting up in the air as if their targeting was controlled by an intoxicated toddler.
---
I think it would be a mistake to remove the mobs entirely... I just didn't know that rebuilding America specifically meant "rebuild America once every 10 minutes because the 'defenses' were only named that way as a joke". ;)
---
I'm gonna do the same.  I found it, got a few, and will lower the price to something entertaining but affordable.  I'm now rather grateful to have gotten my 6666 caps (less 667).  Barnum was right.
---
Yep
---
Yeah it is annoying .. I recommend investing in the fix it good and weapon artisan perks to get more duration out of armor and weapons. I've noticed it too a patch or 2 before the repair kits were added I noticed both an increase in wear and tear on weapons/armor and feels like I'm constantly &lt;50% on food/water ... 
---
however I have talked to a few ppl about it and not all of them seem to be experiencing it while some have so I'm thinking maybe they didn't directly nerf decay rates but instead accidentally made something negatively affect decay rates ... who knows I feel it though and it's obnoxious
---
Did someone say Johnny Guitar?
---
You know how fusion cores drain more quickly when you’re jumping around and sprinting etc? Maybe food/water drain rate works in a similar way. I think when I was a low level I spent more time wandering, looking around, wondering what I should do next. 
---
Now as I approach L200 I sprint everywhere, jump like a monkey all the time, I’m carrying way more weight due to perks I hadn’t unlocked as a low level. 
---
I’m always on the move with a goal/destination and rarely static. It’s no surprise to me that I burn through food and water faster as a higher level player.
---

A pretty good and reliable place is the Pioneer Scout Camp archery range, I think. Everytime I've been there, there was a plan for the crossbow and the water filter.
---
There's one just south west of hemlock holes. I had mine there for awhile. Downside high rads near extractor sight and spawns include grafton monster, snallys,  and other random mobs
---
nah I just checked too, junk version

No, that happened on my ps4 and it is so funny

where's the tourist?
---
I had this issue starting last Thursday. I tried logging on daily with that character. What "fixed it" for me was basically not even trying to log into it for nearly 24 hours. I played my secondary character until then. Logged into it after that and no issues since, fingers crossed. 
---
Give it a full 24 hours and try again.
---
I imagine the percentage of players that care deeply about the game’s economy is fairly small.

[](/necklestia)I made a point to sprint whenever I could during my test, but I didn't jump much. If thirst drain increases dramatically while jumping it might be unnoticeable on a normal player, but one with marsupial, and bird bones could see a major thirst increase.
---
I replied to your post but wanted to add this in. I had the same issue with the menu not appearing.  When you get the "Disconnected from Server" message, waiting like ten seconds before hitting OK should bypass that bug.
---
Wavy Willards water park, edited my post.

You are pathetic. I prefer to play a game for fun. My real life is fine, and allows me to play games for fun.
---
Playing in Survival Mode, there are weekly challenges that reward unique legendary items. Except this week it was bugged and players in Adventure Mode could complete the challenge...
---
Ooo thanks for showing me this channel
---
It’s not worth it. I’d dump it in the legendary grinder at a train station and roll for a better weapon once you’re at a higher level when the legendary vendor comes out.
---
God bless you!
---
+karma
---
thanks man
---
It seems like most players over level 50 run marsupial and speed demon, those two could be the explanation right there.
---
Because with the right build, a bloody explosive laser rifle can hit for about 5k damage. And until assassin sentinel got nerfed, the only really successful PVP strategy was sneaky sniper with headshots. Because they were mitigating something like 98% of all the damage. You got to hit them hard enough to overcome their health rubber banding. You've got to one shot them. 
---
The other thing is that people are stacking magazines and perks to get stealth boy duration on the Mark 3 up to 10 minutes almost. So you got two basically invisible people stalking each other and trying to vats crit on each other.
---
People want all the advantage they can get from gear in PvP because a lot of times they are playing with cheating bastards. You're playing poker with a stacked deck. Bethesda's codebase is a buggy hot mess and in PVP, people are openly using aimbots and wall hacks.
---
It's actually kind of interesting because the people that hardcore PVP are somewhat tight-knit community. It's lots of super friendly people than enjoy murdering each other.  Actually on survival servers a good way to meet cool people is to fight it out fair and if you kill each other a few times, and you're a good sport about it then you end up making friends. 
---
Yeah, Fallout 76 has such a positive playerbase that even the people that enjoy murdering each other are really nice to each other as long as there's fair play. 
---
These days survival servers can be very dead. The new changes to survival are making it more dead. 
---
The cap lost for death is 50 caps now. so people that wanted to PVP to make caps and one shot loot pinatas aren't as interested. 
---
The survival points system is cool though. It's really geared towards people that want to actively PVP. It doesn't give as much weight to longest life.  The unintended consequence is it makes survival more attractive for people that are into PVE. 
---
Because you can find yourself on a very dead server with 4-5 people. and the people who want to PVP or server hopping to try to find a more active server.  
---
So if you want to level, as long as you stay away from the train stations and the popular farming spots you can rack up the experience. Another cool thing is that if you're looking for static spawns, like plans, or server hopping to farm materials, survival is where it's at.
---
If i was a duper, i wouldn't have one character who is almost always desperate for Caps. Did i hurt you or something?
---
Yeah, I definitely make a point to switch out cards when repairing items (perk card loadouts plz). I might get ten more shots before my weapon breaks as opposed to repairing without the appropriate cards. I didn’t realize how much materials my gun cost, but at this point I’ve repaired so much that I couldn’t continue the nuke zone. Instead I have to leave the nuke zone and farm springs :( I miss being able to finish a nuke zone without my weapon breaking. 
---
So I think I’ll just take a couple days off the game until my tolerance threshold has been restored 😅
---
Yep im in adventure mode with this character. Weird. Well i could scrap it in the new machine. Naver done that so wonder what ill get?
---

Not gonna work as they aren’t stacked they’re individually

Oh yea I ran across that encounter as well but some mongrels came in and attacked me with ruined the encounter

I can try, I haven't done it myself. Name is VoidForged.
---
Wait! You are u/Ciokt. Alternate accounts much?
---
No, it makes sense in a game-logic kind of way. They didn't want to put it all onto 1 card as you can get max lock pick at a very low level. If you only go for the final rank, you're not investing the 3 perk points required to get the benefit of a full unlock.
---
It probably would have been best just to have the 1 card and level lock stars within the card itself but that's not what we got in the game so it is what it is.
---
Yea I can help you as well.
---
Sauce Boss
---
No matter what I did, I just kept jumping 😩
---
Is it possible to change the key binding for placing wires to something different than jump? Or is that a change we need to wait on Bethesda to make?
---
It does it a few times a week for me. Sometimes on top of my camp marker and it freaks me out for a minute.
---
I’m on console and they have both jump and place wire set to the triangle button. Sometimes the game can’t decide between the two for whatever reason.
---
💜 need some Johnny cash on the radio too
---
Oh so your not a part of "the beach boys." Someone must have went through a lot of effort editing your name into that duping video.

Unintended bug or not, we would still see a value change when making a diff between the files before the update and after.
---
Duping and people who buy their wares.
---
What are you selling to get 1400 caps a day?
---
I thought my guns were breaking super fast then realised I had Gun Smith lvl 5 off. I haven't noticed them breaking much fast. Can this kind of info be data mined?
---
I know guns don't stack, I mean an account that has multiples of a couple different guns like they have 3 different guns that are incredibly rare and they have like five copies of each. That should be an obvious red flag.
---
Bugged.
---
the log map is hilarious holy shit
---
Go the the small pool at the base of the serpent slide at Wavy Willard’s. Take off your armor and let a scorched kill you. You’ll be deep enough to get the water revive and the scorched won’t kill you outright.
---
No clue. Some others from my group are noticing it too. Either gunsmith is bugged and not working as intended, or condition rates on certain guns have been reduced by a large margin.
---
I don’t really like having to-equip/unequip but Having three separate cards allows for a lire but more flexibility vs having it all on one card at 3*
---
I was surprised how much I missed it when it was gone. :(
---
It won’t let me revive you
---
Is...is this the new Bee Movie script...?
---
Same with PC i.e. space bar.
---
Try to build another and see if you can.
---
Can I revive you in the water tomorrow?
---
I have a Deathclaw hide in my inventory. Fortunately it did not auto scrap to leather. Unfortunately, I have no idea where I found it. I definitely haven't killed a Deathclaw in a while so it was from something else.
---
Hopefully made better than their collector edition bags.
---
Care to share what video you mean? Also, aren't the beach boys just raiders? Go ahead and post a link.
---
There's a lot they can do with the perk card system in general. For instance if you equip the last one in a series, odds are you want the others too so why not auto equip, why not have build profiles etc.
---
Hopefully this all gets sorted in time.
---
I found 1 Deathclaw hide in a foot locker at Cobbleton Farm.  I would suggest searching all containers, particularly around farms and shacks etc.
---
Depends how you build your camp. I had a camp that was built on 2 foundations and was easily placeable almost anywhere.
---
Don’t forget to build a level 50 one if you can it’s double the capacity of the one it gives you!
---
A new character gets atoms quite quickly - if you look at it as rewards for dalies rather than a money sink the idea is a lot more acceptable.
---
While I appreciate the idea of having the whole map in play, the current balance is so bad between builds that some players would face bullet sponge everywhere. 
---
Guild war 2 used downscaling on overleveled players. It’s great when it works but it’s dangerous when you can never level your way out of a problem due to artificial caps.
---
but you still have to invest in those cards to begin with.
---
unlock card one, level up unlock card two, level up again and bam third card unlock. while it might not be taking rank points, you still have to work towards getting each card unlocked, and to make it more of a challenge, add to it to unlock each card you must unlock "X" amount of locks/terminals to advance.
---
People were blaming Bethesda of stealth nerfing it
---
Me too! I was wandering through Helvetia the other day and missed it so much all of a sudden!
---
Dupers are really killing all the hard work Bethesda has put into this game.
---
hunter , archery and swimming all worked for me
---
Go to the fissure site near watoga station, there is often a dead mega sloth which should count for the picture
---
Yeah I've got around 38k 5mm, had around 50k. That I bought up for cheap

---
Don’t you only lose 50 caps on death now? Come on man, stash your junk and stand your ground. Put some turrets out and make the other guy think twice about attacking.
---
Sure send me a request
---
One of the biggest flaws to Fallout76.
---
You dont have to pay for the one the quest gives you.
---
Unless you're going to personally use it during this playthrough, who cares where it goes. Scrap it for scrip, give it away, or sell it for a few hundred caps. Either way it's better than clogging up your inventory, since you weren't going to use it anyway. I used to save "someday" weapons and ammo, now I just dump it.
---
Victornotcare username. I don't  mind playing with folk
---
Is this your first day?
---
Why don’t we wait and see.
---
Mine was on 1 foundation and I literally have to rebuild it every time I move because it never fits
---
These POS make the servers unstable. Report them!
---
You have a 1 foundation camp that you can’t place? Weird, I never had that problem.
---
Deal! I think I already did that though, how come you feel otherwise man?
---
And for anyone who reads this, my Xbox GT is knucklessyrup. Feel free to hit me up if you believe this guys lies, I'll gladly talk and play. He is mad i discovered him and u/Ciokt are the same person, and he gets all his value in life from videogame "status".
---
They really are, it's turning me off from playing as I have worked so hard to get where I am and to get what I have and now everyone is getting the same stuff or better as me for only thousands of caps.
---
I think directly north of wavy Willard's theres one, close to the north border of the map. I camped there for a while
---
If your on PC i can just give it to you. Since theres no headlamp on it its kinda pointless
---
Oh rly? Never noticed that one. How much does it drain? Like the same when u would walk the Distance instead of fast traveling?
---
Reasonable but maybe the Devs will see this and have a idea
---
Battle Royale would be...interesting just for the simple fact that players won’t be able to use duped weapons and will have to use whatever they find laying around
---
I am on ps4 dang
---
what you mean?? when i go to craft a backpack,  it still says 60+ carry weight for the lvl 50 one .
---
Mothman
---
I can’t imagine super negative moaning on a thread about being glad to be back will help the game much either. I’ve never encountered a duper. It’s hardly going to be important to a low lever returning player for a while. I hope Bethesda fix the problem, but there’s like hundreds of threads to talk about that. Here I’m just glad the OP is back.
---
Thank you!
---
Its a bug, pretty much every one has it
---
Hey thanks! That might actually be it. I'll check when I get a sec.
---
Why? They already track the condition, mods, etc of every item in the game. What is one more data point? They don't have to track things in real time. They just have to log trade events, which they probably already do. Then they just periodically cull any items with duplicate unique identifier.
---
And if it's full? Is this a way to circumvent stash limits? Or does it just nope you?
---
That seriously worked on the first try, thank you so much! Nice username too
---
Those are hard to repair. You need red and blue paint!
---
This guy resorted to calling me a duper and accusing me of being a " beach boy", of my name appearing in a duping video (with zero proof) all because i said i dont care what others do and play for fun. He is mext level pathetic and petty. Watch out.

Correction: You can't do anything but finish the event as quick as you can. With the bug waves it's impossible but with the Wendigo all you got to do is kill it in order to win. And pro tip: it goes down in one Fat-Man hit since it's only level 21

The game relax me for  some odd reason after a rough day at work.
---
I just explore every location I see on the compass, read the notes and terminals and do quests, I don't think I'll stop until I've discovered every location on the map.
---
Those cannons in that field camp near that place are a godsend for scorchbeasts
---
(I'm bad with names)
---
according to that link it's called "high tech light set"
---
edit: and your welcome bookmark that link :)
---
Not only that, the game and creatures and levels were designed under the condition that legendary items are very rare. Dupers essentially handed out overpowered weapons and armors to everyone, this kills the longevity of the game right away. It’s sad to see a few dishonest and selfish individuals ruin a beautiful piece of work for a few bucks.
---
I wouldn't say it's too rare, I get one for every 2 or 3 times I do the event
---
I’m informing OP that the game is still having issues (a game killing issue since almost all MMO are focused on it’s economy between players and any long lasting player knows that about FO76) so I don’t have to see the same OP or others make another post about how “It’s the same garbage” etc etc once they encounter a duper. 
---
But alas, any negative opinion of Bethesda’s blessing of Fallout 76 is heresy in these parts. 🤠 Hopefully OP and you don’t have to encounter any dupers but who knows at this point. 🤙🏻
---
I didn't even know squirrels were a thing.. That'll be a fun challenge to complete.
---
This is a great area.
---
Possum or tadpole challenges/badges ???
---
yep
---
You get it by scrapping combat armor (preferably minimum-level light arms, because they're cheaper), but the chance per piece is only 0.75%.
---
Give me Jangles the Moon Monkey! or give me death!
---
I just saw some jumping child with an explosive harpoon, 50 cal looking shotty that would blow up everything. He's hopping around destroying everything. It's a one shot with long range explosive. I stopped what I was doing and watched lol the ghouls that could load were obliterated. 
---
The gun broke the game making the ghouls spawn and move in place but wouldn't engage.He was level 230 PS4 at WS. I logged off when I saw that lol. Talk about somethings broken wow 😂
---
Edit: The gun he was using was bigger than he was lol he had no PA. Marsupial on steroids too. I'm just a little lvl 170 in PA watching 🤣
---
That too, and I feel like the game was just starting to gain some good traction.
---
grinding for perfect gears (that suit my build)
---
killing time while waiting for borderlands 3
---
A lot of people don’t experience the full fallout because they are to busy doing the same things over and over. They get tunnel vision. For those who are impatient and can’t seem to do anything on their own, they let youtubers basically do all the work, watch how they did it and skip a bunch. I’m not sure why so many people are in a rush to beat new content. They are usually the ones complaining that there’s nothing to do.
---
I usually do a multitude of things throughout fallout in a day or I space it out. The only time I really dread it is when I have to make ammo. My main is 333 and I’m playing a 164 right now. I can tell you for a fact that I haven’t done everything and I’m fine with it. I like knowing that I’m a high level and there’s still stuff to do. The ones I can’t understand is the ones that only farm legendaries when they know 90% of them should go in the trash or the ones who exploit xp. Of course you’re going to get bored.
---
I've tried it, was hoping for 60 seconds of running the fuck away and then an easy fight afterwards but nope. She's immune to Karma
---
Fast traveling really hits your thirst/hunger because the calculated "route" you take to fast travel is not a straight line, it's the route a NPC would take, following main roads etc. If you jump from corner of the map to other corner, that's easily a half hour to and hour assuming you're taking the most efficient path, which fast travel does not. If you're jumping camps repeatedly, you're basically simulating 2-3 hours of real time game play, or a full day game time. Of course you're thirsty.
---
Hell yes 😍
---
Yeah the visit the Grafton dam is annoying me. Is there a workaround?
---
Yea it’s much better now than launch thanks to Bethesda’s efforts.
---
I tried but couldn't find it in the app
---
Shhhhh. I dont want anyone to know what harbage my tse tesla rifle is when I try to sell it in a few weeks.
---
Wait... wut? 🤮
---
I do.
---
That’s a good link
---
Finding a player with the set on shouldn't be too hard &amp; it'll let you see if you like it in game.
---
i can't take credit for making that but i will take credit for showing it to you :)
---
They'll just fuck it up  lets be real
---
Yes it is actually the first time I killed one
---
Alternative solution lol find it on YouTube, copy the link , find a YouTube to mp3 converter site, download ringtone app, whallaa magik
---
I thought you were always able to do this
---
Fertilizer, corn, and toilet paper on your bed are the only tips I leave.
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Not sure why, but the deathclaw aren't dropping the hides right now. I've heard of them dropping from anglers though, or being found in random world containers. If you're working for those badges though, you have a small chance of getting them from the "Campfire Tales" event over at Camp Adams in The Forest region.
---
Jeez thank you
---
That’s only if they touched the hunger/thirst constants. It’s possible that the bug lies in the actual game code, possibly applying a multiplier that it shouldn’t, and not in the constants that the data miners would be looking at.
---
I’m assuming that if the change is indeed an unintended consequence of an unrelated code change, that the code itself wasn’t obvious enough for the developers or QA to pick up, and so could easily slip by dataminers too even if they reverse engineered the game code.
---
That song is part of the reason I hate white springs
---
Seems like they are incapable of tracking items with unique numbers, otherwise duping wouldn’t be an issue.
---
*Gotta love the megasloth shrooms*
---
yea even with good with salt max ranked I noticed all my food was spoiling faster than before.
---
there is a max limit of 1500 including your stash and your limit on person so say he 300 carry weight on character and 800 stash he is still allowed 400 over and above to make the 1500 max cap of weight.
---
still unsure how he is selling so many fusion cores
---
It's like 15 bucks for one, so a set of 10 skins for like 150? :)
---
Try a glowing deathclaw lvl 80 or higher haha that should work !
---
You can (almost) never place half walls on top of each other. Idk, I’ve noticed all sorts of little things are harder or don’t work, but it hard to keep up with it because every patch they make it harder and harder to build. 
---
Ok we can have floating foundations now. Make sure you place it exactly where you want it the First Time!.... you may not be able to remove it. 
---
It’s such a headache. And blue prints are almost useless these days.
---
Just level up
---
 So, what is the game about? What happened in West Virginia?
---
it's a bug. you can get it in adventure.
---
it's kind of a decent gun perk wise, but it being on a gatling gun kinda makes it bad.
---
either way, free 40 scrips.
---
In locked camps I turn off all the lights.
---
If I get to find one I will.
---
seeing stuff like this makes me sick
---
I'm still wondering when those PTW lunch boxes are coming.
---
same, i always dumped them onto a bag at peoples feet, and they would take the ones they didnt know, and then they'd do the same for me. Then paper bag issues became more common, I just stashed em. Now I put them up for sale at 10% of the "value".
---
Haha I know but hearing the numbers just sounds insane at this point
---
Well I just learned there are 3 different songs that can play in the atomic shop and now I can't pick which I like better lol
---
God yes to all of the above.  🙏
---
lol
---
&gt; For the vertibot I just hopped around the workshops that have one - ammunition factory, power plant, airport (not Morgantown, the other one), didn't take me long to find one.
---
No need to server hop in this case: the vertibot launch pad at Poseidon, next to the workshop, prompts you to &lt;repair&gt; it, which will spawn a fresh vertibot. Be sure to take your picture before it launches, though. And no, no need to claim the workshop for this to work!
---
Geezzz this got me baad hahaha
---
Yeah and it only cost one badge
---
Yes, I agree.
---
Say what now? When did this happen
---
I've got wooden stool in my vendor machine for 25. GT Jay_31_ House north of Lake Gad (big dry lake in middle of map) on creek. On now.
---
They made the white springs vendor area doing the atomic shop music to make people buy more ATX.
---
I'll have to look for some anglers also.
---
Today I spawned it at daylight but I must have walked up just before the official night/day transition
---
I think that the Savage divide and Cranberry bog are already fine. We have the Fake Sheepsquatch and the SBQ already.
---
Considering the canvas bag and nuka rum shitstorm, i think they shouldnt.
---
Cap sink to level legendaries from lower levels. Damn that’s good. I hope it goes into the game. I got some OP level 40 stuff.
---
I would come back and play again if they did this. There’s so much needlessly tedious stuff in the game that took away the fun. I started putting it down longer and longer then eventually just quit picking it up. I see updates sometimes and load it up but am quickly reminded why I stopped.
---
Are you looking for the quest or just the camera?
---
I just looked it up. It's not one song but 3 different ones and it just cycles through them. I had no idea either.
---
Holy shit...... How how I never noticed this, I can't even remember which one I had , I'm totally mind blown even after listening to all three it's like yea they e been there!
---
Agreed. Still the best survival lite game out there.
---
Hi thanks! Not really into role playing tho :/ only shooting ghouls and super mutants
---
The frustration of an AAE LMG  being Lv40 pains me to no end
---
Cockroaches colored to look like radroaches.
---
Assuming you're ignorant and not really a member... the beach boys are raiders but the main focus of their group is finding dupes, scamming and making cash irl. When people accuse them, they weasle their way out of it by claiming "people are just mad because we are raiders and destroying their bases."
---
I never went for assin sent, I went unyielding and got a full set of that. It’s great, synergiezes well with anything-
---
Melee- your strength goes way up the more damage you take
---
Guns- your agi and ap go up the more damage you take
---
Barter- go shopping with a few hp and way higher cha.   
---
Carry weight- over encumbered? Not once you blow your foot off with a grenade!
---
Crits- low hp, luck through the roof
---
Etc
---
Paired up with a Bloodied weapon, how can you go wrong
---
This is where it's up to individuals to self regulate. I had a max level assassin vats explosive pump shotty. I had pre decided I wouldn't take more than 7k for it because imo that's what it's worth. I had a guy LOWER the price by 1k when I offered 9k for a mini gun. People can and will self regulate the economy because the reality is the average end game player doesn't have a ton of mules. Moat people I've spoken only have at max 2 miles and that's if they're serious about the grind. The rest of us aren't into that. Mind you I have not ever hit max caps, owned "god tiered" gear, or bought a duped weapons and ive played since beta.
---
Sheep squelch and dragon so fahh
---
I'm currently stuck on the same challenge. Happy hunting, friend!
---
Thanks, you to.
---
Yep. I'm on a 500gb ps4 and it struggles deeply when I get staggered like that. I still take it as a neccisarry evil now though. Without that effect, nothing would stop melee from being the only viable end game build.
---
Blue paint at the prison and red is at Camden I think.
---
If the stash is full and you try to sell stuff from your inventory it fails
---
Yes very irritating.
---
What you said sounds made up. Also calling me ignorant because I'm not aware of some reddit group? Lmao my guy. Get some fresh air.
---
That and it would power my vending machines. I want to have the ability to hide my camp. Oh well.
---
They have done a really good job of the music in this game, and the Fallout series in general. 
---
That Fasnacht theme was stuck in my head for weeks afterwards!!!
---
I was looking for the quest but I found it
---
I’d rather not trust folks who think 25k for a gun is reasonable.
---
Also still waiting on that video link. Just saying.
---
That does not work.
---
Can you post a picture. I've done a lot of research and haven't seen one yet.
---
I over 20 the other day without it dropping.
---
Your own personal carry weight is seperate from the stash. 
---
Also no perks apply to the stash.
---
So the person in the pic has 2274 kg of just Stimpacks, Nevermind the diluted and super ones. 
---
Last time I checked 2274 &gt; 800
---
Nice
---
Food spoil rate going up every patch is a stealth nerf to make people buy the refrigerator when they release it on the Atom Shop.
---
Kinda egotistical, aren’t you? You don’t know his motivation at all, but you assume he did it to mess with you. Could be any number of reasons that have nothing to do with your camp.
---
Aye I hear you :)
---
Thanks! I've been looking for a link like this and haven't found it til now. I appreciate it!
---
What happened with nuka rum? All I remember was people being upset about it being a plastic casing over a glass bottle.
---
Oh shit, one of those was in Big Mouth
---
Send one to the people that didn’t get a canvas bag
---
Wow, you're quite the DC harvester. Is it a hobby?
---
Hello. I can help you with that. I’ve unlocked the BOS helmet and can make them. I’ll put them in my vending machine next time I’m go on.  I found one combat helmet in the wild. I took a chance and scrapped that. Luckily, it unlocked for me the ability to make them. The BOS helmet mod got unlocked after scrapping many many combat armor arms.
---
Psn: unikron08 
---
I’m at work right now. Hopefully I can play later in about 3-4 hours from now.
---
Campfire Tales sort of feels like it but nobody is ever there
---
I'm half Mega Sloth.
---
Yea np
---
I wish I could help you but I am sadly on PC. Personaly I have seen a few in vending machines from players for around 500c so I hope you find it
---
I have taken to building under bridges now. Open air half walls, i really enjoy it more because its more open.
---
Why not just use your mic?
---
..
---
You’ll get 40 scrip to spend at the purveyors shop tomorrow.
---
Retracting your comments says a lot.
---
This here.  Finally figured this one out recently.
---
A witch!
---
You can find one by jumping on to the roof of the... Garran Mining HQ, I think it is, and following the monorail line until it ends
---
Deep south in Ash Heap, centre of the map
---
South of the Garran and Hornwright Estates
---
It did? If you say so. I’m still selling things with no care about duper’s or what others charge for items.
---
By that logic I should use the Wendigo one.....I mean the normal human one...
---
I am 99% sure it works like this:
---
When you fast travel to your own camp, you’ll spawn on the north edge just out of the circle.
---
When other people fast travel to your camp, they will spawn next to where you ORIGINALLY placed your camp bot thing.
---
Moving your camp bot AFTER you place your camp does not move the fast travel point for other people. It will always be next to where you originally placed it when you put your camp down.
---
Sheepsquatch is like that (the herd events). I wish there were more global notifications.
---
Honestly, this is probably a good thing or the game considering how much explosive is unequivocally the best secondary effect in the game.
---
 Great damage boost,  no conditionals, fantastic perk support unmatched by any other weapon set. The only thing that comes close is Vats crits, and that's crazy conditional.
---
If you don't have an explosive weapon, you're objectively suboptimal.
---
Tl;dr- duping is actually good for the game because BGS refuses to balance legendaries.
---
3?!!! This is mind blowing
---
Kinda illiterate, aren't you?   I never once claimed I was being singled out by anyone, I simply pointed out that the location I was at was a relatively high density area where someone could possibly hit multiple camps at once.  And as I also explained there's no other reason to nuke this particular area.  My camp has been in the area since permanent camps became a thing, it has a handful of low density enemy spawns featuring super mutants and random enemies and fairly sparse flora spawns making it otherwise horrible for either legendary or flux farming.
---
Thanks man, I’ll give a look around. Hope you have a nice day!
---
Agreed. The music of the series really sets the theme for me
---
So for you it's dipping into another world? I felt that a little to be honest and killing super mutants is satisfying
---
I just really want to complete all of the badges
---
I tried to explain this in one of the recent threads with people whining that their thirst meter is running out in "minutes".  I did just what you did, topped myself off and ran around doing challenges, I went until I hit the first stage of dehydration and landed somewhere between 40-45 minutes.  But that doesn't fit people's narratives so my post explaining it is currently sitting below the threshold at -14 and dropping.
---
It's getting hard to tell if these people are just too thick to notice the -thirst on so many meds or if they're just trolling and karma farming.  If this sub had any mods this crap would get removed as baseless rumors under Rule 7 unless people took the effort to actually prove it like you went out of your way to do, but that's never going to happen.
---
Plan
---
Yup i noticed it with fast travelling. I tried not to when i first started because exploring is fun and interesting. Once i started doing it a lot more i drank more. I think it calculates based on distance how much food and water is used. Think it was the same in fo4 as well.
---
Lol, no need! At least you asked. To be fair, not nearly as many people have played Fallout 2 as most other Fallout games!
---
I know!! I never noticed.
---
I went through there today and only 1 of them was lootable for meat, the main end boss (which was already dead when I arrived). The others are all just static corpses
---
i don't think it's been updated so it's mainly the stuff we started with
---
I like it but I collect all of them Nukashine, Bone Rider, Plague Rider, War Rider and now the Black Rider. To me it looks cool and quite high quality. The only thing I don't like is that the default eyes are red but the lighted up ones are white no matter which headlamp you use,
---
[Black Rider](https://i.imgur.com/LxuCrxd.jpg)
---
Yes, happened to me almost every time I fast-travelled to a camp.
---
I would like a guestbook myself.
---
Needs to be fall damage or mob damage
---
Rad damage &amp; drowning is insta death iirc
---
Good place to jump and go down is in the lake you do the swimming test to race to the bouys
---
Tank killer is just for rifles it doesn't matter if it's automatic or not as long as it's in the rifle family such as combat rifles assault rifles handmades submachine 10mm submachine

If it's not in the production, it is NOT in production. This is like getting pitch fork to burn beth's HQ down because someone said battle royale in brainstorming session.
---
This sub has proven again and again and again and again that it wants to reeeeeeee rather than think. 
---
Take the latest explosion on repair kits. They are ABSOLUTELY inconsequential. This sub doesn't need any more reasons to go apeshit on speculations. Because it's fucking terrible at that.
---
I did Athlete, Hunter, and Archer
---
i had the same problem a few weeks ago but in combination with reddit i found my satisfaction as a vendor im playing and do the usual grind but i recently started attending leader of the pack events and taking every rather rare outfit i can find and sell whole sets to low level players this gave my gaming time a new purpose
---
I get scrip for all my legendaries i dont use or want. At least until i get to the 1k cap.
---
Jesus, relax I was just having a discussion. The only one going apeshit here is you
---
I got one from a locker
---
I get stuck under the world as well. Die after a second, lose junk under world.

Ya know if they let you pick any song it would be constant horst wessel Lied and the Soviet anthem
---
Right? If they can give us free content so that we spend money on their virtual currency (atoms) for buying a software, may as well eliminate the middleman (virtual currency) and sell the software as expansion for countries that aren't allowed to deal with the atoms. Beths only need to make a deal with their selling partners or licensees for profit sharing.
---
Patsy Cline is needed
---
Yeah, same. Though I like the pioneer scout appearance, it sort of matches my Enclave uniform.
---
It's between 6 and 6, officially iirc
---
With the ammo making perk, you can pretty much double your ammo production. Certain rounds are produced in ridiculous amounts. So not out of reality. Unless they are extremely rare resource intensive ones!
---
Actually, you are inferring emotion in a text environment. There is zero emotion in text based communication unless the person expressly indicates an emotion or emotional level. 
---
Honestly, he was just responding to the discussion.
---
That's because there is no quest for possum. Once you finish the order of the tadpole quest, the possum badge challenges are in the challenge menu
---
The letters actually take quite a bunch of the budgets though(15 letters will took 2%, 15), but that's what I'm doing, but I'm on the PC, I guess I will ask people to add me as friend(in case of I'm logoff) or invite me to the team when I'm around, this inspect bug and the 'logoff equal to lost track forever' thing really annoying, I just finally saw a explosive gauss yesterday, then the whole camp just disappear in front of my eyes, and all I can do is to add the person as friend and hope he will accept somehow, btw this friend thing only notify people once, I just found I had a few friend requests that I don't even noticed, so the hope is slim :&lt;
---
Here's some hints as I'm halfway through:
---
Deathclaw hide can be found in yellow wood crates and it's a black roll of hide.  I've found 2 so far in random spots.  
---
Gardener:  crafting fertilizer means saving that spoiled fruits, vegs and meats.  2 rabbits spawn at the Whitesprings service entrance.  Doing the repeatable bug scout quest in Dolly Sods will also help.
---
Smores take brahmin milk and a shit ton razor grain.  Plant some now.
---
You will most likely have to go to each train yard twice to kill 15 enemies.
---
Dead things counts for pics 
---
Make lists to help keep track
---
Half to the Musician badge are glitched atm
---
PM for anything else
---
Mobs should have my level in every part of the map, like TESO. I don't understand why they have not done this
---
Hi, it’s a bug atm
---
You ‘learn’ it when you buy it from the machine
---
But it gives you a duplicate plan to pass on to whomever you like
---
Potent stuff
---
I genuinely think this is the truth. They didn't want people finishing these in a few days because they knew they would
---
Over the years Imagine they will create events for different holidays then they can simply implement them when the time comes around like destiny has the dawning ,the festival of the lost and crimson days
---
Yes
---
I did NOT know this thanks for the PSA. Server hopping for legendary grind
---
Ahh thank you for letting me know it’s a bug!
---
Aloha! Well if you don’t mind another fella. I’ll be mostly online in the evening hours (CET) . PSN: Yukon-96
---
Cheers.
---
Not saying every other month but once they nail down duping, and only then will they raise the cap. I honestly can't believe they will continue to have so many duping problems after a year of bug fixing(Secretly thinking of quitting the game since odds are duping will still be around in a year).
---
So you are asking for energy weapons to become overpowered just because? I dont understand your post when you already understood the other damage increasing perk cards buffed their weapon category already.
---
We need the Doom doot meme, but with mister handies instead of demons
---
I've managed to put myself at 801/800 by depositing a specific amount of .38 before. Possibly there's a way to infinitely exploit that. The only other way I know of is that anything you scrap at your CAMP is automatically placed in the stash, so you can put yourself over by scrapping while at max limit. But obviously there's nothing you can scrap to put fusion cores and 5000 stimpaks into your stash
---
Well I’m not just randomly doing so. We all communicate in text on the internet and it’s commonly understood that a comment using cursing and ALL CAPS is written angrily. There’s a difference between “when are you coming?” And “WHEN ARE YOU COMING?” and once again “when are you fucking coming?”
---
are enemies exploding in a bloody mess pg-13?
---
Wow that guy hasn't had stash access in forever. Unless there's a new method, that's a really really old exploits.
---
And then you hear the telltale ping as you walk away.
---
Would assume he would be talking about stealing from legit players, example if player 1 finds and sells high quality 3 star he gets 5k caps, if dupers destroy the market too much it goes down to 3k caps or less thus if a legit player finds a valuable item then its value is greatly diminished in a healthy in game economy. Please don't burn me but would assume thats what he means and not how I feel, just assuming since literally every person I've meant on Fallout 76 hates dupers but wouldn't want Bethesda to stop dupers from selling gear to them or wipe them off server.
---
Hey OP, question for ya! I built a foundation, put stairs on it, put a floor on that, and one more set of stairs all totally separate from a building, just to the side of it, so that I could reach the top of the building temporarily to put something on the roof.
---
Finished what I was doing on the roof and wanted to take down the stairs but it’s giving me this “A structure would be inaccessible” when I try to take down the stairs at the top of my little structure.
---
Am I screwed here? Is there no way to take that structure down because of a bug or something? Really not interested in starting my whole camp over.
---
Ok I did some reading and there are subs like r/marketplace76 and r/fo76market that are more reputable. Bazaar does seem to promote inflation like you said.

Np

Very beneficial bug atm, trade the plan for a fridge mod :)

---
Hello! I will send a request. psn CLotUSvss
---
I could have sworn there were only 2.
---
Oh you don't know that when people were duping with artillery it let you get passed stash limit too, and Bethesda never punished console player dupers and theres many players from original days with stashs far passed 800 lbs currently. So in short it was a duping glitch that allowed for passing stash limit and Bethesda never took action against it since it would hurt player count.
---
I thought even duped items had weight, do they not?
---
Please name them ".Master Picklock" and ".Master Hacker"
---
Or alternatively perk loadouts
---
I wont believe any of it until i actually see real evidence. Datamined stuff can and has been faked in the past in other games.
---
Something similar happened to me as well. Also with steel. I was selling steel to a player. I had 1100 steel. I was selling 1000. On my screen it separated 1000 and 100. On player screen it showed 100 and 2billion.  I asked for screen shot. Sure enough it seemed that I had 2 billion steel. Player backed out of trade. Got scared.  I relogged and my steel was 1100.  This happened weeks before player vending patch.
---
It was artillery exploit they used to get passed stash limit back in the old days and Bethesda never made you remove those items.
---
if I could upvote that more than once I would
---
I just started playing a couple weeks ago, so it's still helpful to me!

Im in the same boat, from what ive gathered looking EVERYWHERE the only reason they are available on pc is because of people entering the dev room and then flooding it through the economy. They arent in game on console depite the file being there.... makes me sad that they havent fixed it
---
good list.
---
imho bobbleheads and magazines should be weightless too (and showable in CAMP), even if they have a funcionallity. 
---
btw, what's up with the tickets in the laundry building of Whitesprings? What are those used for? I've noticed they weight 0.1.
---
Yeah, I had that very event right on top of my camp today.  Twas a bit odd.
---
Pretty sure you can't event scrap them for crystal to make film &gt;:(
---
If you look at the various zones it’ll give you a good idea of what to do next - basically :
---
Only do quests in the forest until level 10 - the responders quests for example. After then you can go into Grafton and the toxic valley. Like the bureau of tourism. 
---
Once you reach level 15 you can go into the savage divide and whitespring - but be careful because you will see enemies that you aren’t ready for yet. You should be able to do the first part of rose’s quests - and if you’re lucky find yourself some raider power armor.
---
Once you reach level 25 you can go into  the ash heap for the fire breathers quests and to search for the excavator armor. You’ll need breathing equipment that your PA or fire breather outfit will give you (as well as the veil from the Mistress of Mystery quests).
---
You can also finish off Roses quests, which will send you into the mire around level 30, where you’ll follow up with the free states quests and try to get into the Enclave bunker. 
---
Both of those paths will lead you into Cranberry bog around level 35 for watoga and brotherhood of steel quests. You’ll get some higher level power armor, and work to gain access to the nuke sites through the enclave, which you’ll need for your final battle with the scorch queen around level 50.
---
So, easy way to tell is bring up your journal and see where the quest is taking you. If you’re level 13 and the quest marker is sending you to the more, maybe put that one off for now.
---
I can data-mine the values for individual weapons, but not the mechanics.
---
I haven't seen anyone nuke Whitespring yet. I have a camp south of Summersville and would love to get a preview of the carnage at my level (hit 30 tonight). At the very least head to my roof and maybe get a tan.
---
I'm quickly approaching the point where caps are meaningless now that player vending exists. Buying items to flip them at a markup has served me well. I haven't dipped below 10k since the patch. Just need like a dozen more power armor mod plans. And tbh I might just skip on stuff like blood cleansers.
---
Oh ok never heard of that exploit before, well that explains it =/. I'm on PC though
---
I was thinking about this today since I’ve been wandering around everywhere trying to collect badges lol. What I think would be really fun is if instead of spawning high level creatures, whenever I’m in forest area or other low level areas if we could get mass spawns of low levels. I’d love to obliterate swarms of ghouls and scorched 40-50 deep that are all one shots, the XP still wouldn’t compare to what we get when we’re in a high level area and it could just be entertaining if we were alone if they spawned that way! One pulse grenade takes out 15, or a Tesla shot just melts em away. Even if it wasn’t common i would absolutely love it

Sheepsquatch ate my sweetroll
---
[](/grumpytia)One of the bigger problems is that it's just so hard to test. Unless you have the foresight or good fortune to have the right footage from before the supposed nerf it's nearly impossible to test.  
---
  
---
I want to test food spoilage, but there's no notice when something spoils, so I can't use old footage unless there's some old youtube clip of someone picking a mutfruit, and slowly watching it rot on his pip boy from patches back. I want to test weapons apparently breaking faster, but I'd have to find footage of someone before the supposed nerf using a freshly crafted weapon, I'd have to see his perks, I'd have to see his active effects, and I'd have to see every shot fired until it breaks just to test it.  
---
It's nearly impossible to test any of the claims, but I can't fault them for the claims themselves. Not only has Bethesda had a few slip ups with the patch notes, but I can sympathize with the people making the claims. It does still feel to me that I'm running out of water super fast on my main, but I abuse tons of chems, and have speed demon, so it makes sense that it'd happen even if it feels disproportionate. I've had guns that I swear are breaking way faster, but since the longevity of my guns is directly correlated to RNG via luck of the draw(I've also heard some claims on this, but I might be able to test it with footage thanks to that little on screen pop up when it triggers, I'll have to look into it) it could be I'm just unlucky.  
---
All in all, I just wish I could give people the answers. Most of the reported issues can only be answered by Bethesda(or people with unnatural foresight, and a ton of footage that would seem to the every man to be crazy).
---
I'm on ps4 and some of the player vendors are fucking ridiculous.  500 caps for a fasnacht mask?  Several thousand for a shitty 1 star weapon thars completely broken and you'll have to repair?  
---
Only thing I do full price are the alcohol recipes and the Nuka Cola power armor paint.  The rest are severely discounted.  I want caps but not greedy
---
Also 2 PSA's:
---
Serum recipes are 19200 at the bunker
---
Don't sell/buy the perk magazines.  They dont count for the atom badges
---
what about flags, they never sell flags from the game
---
Ohhh ok I didn't know that about the NukaShine quest.  Thanks for the tip.
---
Let me guess
---
😊
---
Thanks i will try there on a few servers
---
Edit: holy shit my first ever silver. Thank you so much kind stranger!
---
The point of having extras available is so you can make spares for yourself in the event you drop your first one or if you want to have one for each type of lens so you don't have to swap mods.
---
Looks like it's a rare quest reward at best. The plan's not in the LL\_Recipes\_GrenadesMines\_Energy list, unlike all the others.
---
I wouldn't mind playing together, IGN Skye_Wolfe. Can't play right now but I will add you later
---
Just witnessed two instances where items were bought from me for a fraction of what I should have got. 
---
142 rounds of ammo at 1 cap each and I only gained 41 caps. 
---
And a weapon that I was 100% positive was in my own stash, bought for 219 caps. I have no idea about this one, I NEVER would have put it up for sale.
---
oh right, I remember...
---
I fear to hope for a quality stuff animal. Lets just leave it as it is.... Bethsheda may not recover this time around if the stuff animal comes out as bad as their "canvas" bag.  Pretty happy with the game, lets not spoil it.
---
I'm getting close to the cap limit so I'm trying not to sell much besides what's in my vending machine
---
Get your hp low with rads, then jump off a building into shallow water. Easier with marsupial: There's a spot in Wavy Willards that works.
---
I can’t play now either tbh, working shift work. A night shift at that. But I’m down as well! My IGN is Syphonz :)
---
Is this the actual answer or just what you think is happening?
---
I always assumed it was an error in coding. Since your maximum health goes down the more rads you have, removing them adds that health back to the pool but doesn't heal them. Meaning the percentage of your health that's full decreases. So the game plays the audio since you "lost" health.
---
I was stuck underneath the house and 1st floor today lol alrighty! Thank you! Cost me 16 caps for that fun 😊👍
---
I fast traveled home 😁🖐
---
Must alternate. I was looking for Rabbits and another thread said to go there (also 3mo old), and they were Rabbits for me!
---
Added
---
One explanation could be that OP invited someone to his team, and that person placed a small letter or word or item on the ground somewhere, to be a funny guy.
---
My friend once did that on the back of a chair at my CAMP, back when putting letters on items caused the entire CAMP to be unplaceable upon moving. I’m sure he didn’t even know it would do that. Really good thing I found it
---
I used grafton damn as theres plenty of mirelurk to take you down
---
Holy shit scaling forbidden knowledge based on the amount of tech data would be amazing
---
I’ve seen many myself and heard of many. The original people who got it found it in the beta. I just never really wanted it until I wanted to go all U.S. Marine role play. It’s here, we just gotta find it. If I manage I’ll help you out too!
---
Oh yeah true, that’s a great point
---
I've fought 3 at once at my base several times, once when I was only lvl 50ish and turrets were so much weaker, they destroyed my first decontamination shower.
---
You really want to run away from your base and fight them in a field, because their AOE damage does a number on your entire camp.
---
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY NOW
---
Random reward for doing events in Ash Heap
---
That's great. You're required to make plasma grenades for a merit badge. SMH
---
Thanks
---
This guy is a legacy duper lmao, used to be a glitch that allowed storage over max stash weight, now vending allows straight from the stash trades- guy must be making a killing
---
Any standing water will do. If you're working on the swimming badge as I assume alot of you are, the wave pool was a perfect spot for me and my p.i.c as the pictures for that challenge are right there
---
Spending points to unlock cards is not the same as needing three to equip one. The logic behind this is more obvious for things like damage modifer cards.
---
They are separated for flexibility. This way, if you have for example, 3 points in perception and want to spec into 2 points, you can still use the cards instead of grinding a new one becausw the old one is stuck at rank 3.
---
Yep. it's pretty lame. My weapons is breaking left and right. Before patch 9 I rarely needed to repair them. now Im repairing them like twice a day.
---
Why have you not bought one?
---
Same here, i definitely hope that what ive been told is wrong. With player vending i was finally able to get the legendary marine armor i wanted without being bankrupt and its a let down to not have the helmet lmao ill save this post an let you know of anything else i find ab it
---
No problem. Thanks for stopping by.
---
I find it relaxing and I can play it while I think on other things. Never fast travel anywhere hardly just walk and explore. Go through places I've been before just to see what I missed.
---
Good bot.
---
I could see it being a PVE survival horde mode with multiple safe zones.
---
But I can't imagine they think a classic BR mode would work. You lose everything that makes fallout great.
---
So I'm assuming we may get an interesting variant.
---
I was playing with an online friend in Survival when we got attacked by two super high-level players. I died taking out one of our assailants, but my friend lived and used a Hallucigen Gas Grenade on the remaining guy.  
---
Before I knew it, my partner was shouting about how he took out the last guy. He told me that after he threw the grenade, the player started shooting at nothing and hopping around. For all I know, the guy's server crashed or maybe the guy just got scared after his teammate died, but other than that I've no experience with using the Hallucigen Gas Grenade on another player.
---
If you'd like, I could conduct a test or two on myself and a friend if you're really interested.
---
Have you seen r/fnv? They will not shut up about their NCR flags
---
Would love it if they use the old timey music.........or maybe give me the Wii shop music tune. That can be pin repeat till the day I die
---
Ounce of prevention is about the only sequential quest. Top of the world is just another way they get you to go there. Ypull get there some way or another. 
---
All others are side quests. Maybe get tentative out of the way so you don't have to move your camp again.
---
Shut up and take my money.
---
The fucking chess set! The one with fallout robots! TAKE MY MONEY!!
---
The entirety of the BR rumour comes from the audio logs that talk about a firestorm closing in, and not being in a safe zone. 
---
Though this could mean anything, everyone is taking it as "proof" of BR.
---
Or have it like the intercom in SCP containment breach where you can hack the airwaves, activate everyones pipboy radio, and make crazy announcements or do DJing while claiming the workshop.
---
i haven’t and i don’t doubt it🙄what about a pre war america flag, i’ve seen ones before but they aren’t like the in game ones, the ones in game have a much bigger star in the middle. there’s plenty of cool in game stuff i’d love to have. i really like the model plasma weapons they made and bobble heads have always been great but there’s a lot more.
---
Add 20k karma to XB1 user CrusaderCook37. Messages him what happened and he dropped it for me to get back. 
---
Thank you for being a stand-up dude.
---
For now I’ve removed all of my vending machines till I hear from others that this glitch/issue has been resolved.
---
If I catch you online while I am, I will gladly help you level up. Are you going melee or something else?
---
A lot of people want PVP.
---
Currently there is no set thing im maining but I'd like to eventually main melee.
---
sadly Gamingheads has the license for stuff like this, and while they make good stuff they're slow as all hell. they just put up a Mr Fuzzy plush recently so I don't see them announcing anything else for a long time. 
---
that said i'd love to see the Sheepsquatch, but more so a Mega Sloth and most of all a game accurate Jangles would be just the coolest thing ever.
---
You can add me if you'd like and just pop me a invite or message whenever you are willing to help me
---
I just want a rotation nuka cola lamp. IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR BETHESDA! (Even in game plz)
---
Yeah I got a extra but was hoping to trade it for a another mod
---
Yeah, if he has to do it every single time he moves then I don’t know. My CAMP isn’t one foundation and I don’t move it anymore so I can’t speak from experience, but that sounds like just another placement-barring glitch to me
---
I’m running melee as well and after a certain point I am now adding in heavy weapons. Will be glad to help you but you will have to hit the targets once with something to get exp
---
Yep I have since gotten a couple.
---
I thought it was just one.
---
I don’t, but they have -60 energy and rad resist, so you might not actually want one
---
Should we not consider that it's the HUD that is the real issue?  Being able to display sub-points for all Tracked 'anything'.  A 'simply' tree structure that you can collapse each node on the HUD.  That way you can track the individual tasks within a challenge as you need to, without open the map, clicking on the challenge tab, scroll to a challenge and then scrolling on its sub-points.
---
\-G
---
I'm fine with that. Adding heavy weapons sounds good considering the new weapons they've added. Thank you
---
I’m planning on running a stealth build so I don’t get in direct combat very often
---
You should mention your region and general play time when you looking for Fallout buddies.
---
Gotcha. Do you do the daily quests (toxic waste and insects) every day?
---
Well it’s glitched at the moment I believe, when you pick up the mod you learn it without having to use the plan. I can give it you back once I’ve learned it.
---
Pretty much yes as well as the camp Adams event
---
Please don’t think you’re speaking for everyone because that’s just not the case.
---
That’s all I got for ya then 😊
---
Just store all your junk before doing the quest and enjoy the ride.
---
My apologies, my reddit scrubness is coming out.
---
Im in the atlantic time zone (ADT). I usually play early afternoon my time, to late evening, although I work shift work so my schedule is constantly changing. So, anytime from 3pm ADT to 2 am ADT :)
---
Dupers are the absolute scum of the earth. And no, until now I haven't even bought a single piece of ammo from someone.
---
i got one from one off the vendors last week, I want to say gratfon vendor but not sure. I would have to see if I still have it but if your on xbox I can see it too you or trade.
---
Would give high level players a reason to give a shit about lower level events with guaranteed legendary spawns aside from scrapping them for scrip, which would itself drive up fast traveling to said events draining even more caps.
---
It would be cool if next year they remix it up somehow and have new limited time stuff
---
you can track the challenges tho and then it notifies you if you've taken the picture
---
I believe Vending machines are only powered by a direct connection.
---
Haha, right on.
---
OK thanks for the tips.  What's Tentative about?  (I never move my camp anyway :) )
---
I really need to complete those power plant events to get that plan!
---
Or maybe still keep the low levels just have higher chances to spawn at mid to high range legendaries. I was up at Mt Blair yesterday clearing the 15 enemies from the trail yard and out of no where at Lv 50 Legendary Sheepquasch came at me
---
The outrage possibilities are immense. 
---
"It's not made of real sheepsquatch fur, it's the canvas bag all over again!"
---
Good tip, thanks! :)
---
I have it but I like my bone one better.
---
The War one was cool though.
---
If you look closely the War pa paint is made of different guns.
---
Liberty prime should never be a plushie. He should only come in cold hard steel so you can use him to crush commies.
---
Ugg yes every time
---
Are you actually buying?
---
Melee is OP in endgame.
---
This is why Bethesda is the greatest developer.
---
If you are on Xbox and the CAMP was at white springs, sorry!
---
Energy weapons just need another damage buff(like another 10-15%) and have there durability increase by like 50%.
---
You know you can scrap it to get the plans to make as much as you want, right? You can make a butt-load of caps by doing that. Anyway I don’t have much to offer other than some serious gratitude (and like 300 caps)
---
And the stuffing is just old torn up chinese newspaper
---
I'm in love with the Mothman pack.
---
That explains it, thanks.
---
Been playing since beta but I had never heard of this glitch before.
---
I'm surprised Beth let this one slip but hey, the guy must have been eagerly awaiting player vending :D
---
I heard the rum was pretty low quality as well
---
Thank you for correcting! Will edit it
---
those tasks are bugged. I did the One Violent Night event about an hour ago and that didn’t work either.
---
Probability of mission hindrance: ZERO PERCENT
---
Yep, broken for me too. I was about to post something about it too but you beat me to it.
---
If you head up towards the ferris wheel on the map you might get the event Leader of the Pack. It would likely give you loot that you can use at your level.
---
It’s not a tradable item. Unlocking the plan only allows modding a backpack owned by the player that has it. Backpacks can’t be dropped or traded. 
---
Only other option is grind the challenges. They’re a bit more involved but at least the work is towards it and not just a chance.
---
It would make more sense if we could spend scrip to level it up or down depending on preference.
---
Thanks for being one of those guys.   
---
I'm still trying to figure out how to level but I still drop stuff in the Overseer's boxes and the whitesprings box Hopefully they help people.
---
The plan is droppable though, you can pick it up and learn it without consuming the plan
---
Actually what I was looking for is someone to rank the above quests as far as difficulty and/or story goes.  Thanks.
---
No PS4.. 👍
---
I found that one. I also found one where I had to escort some cows as a shepard.
---
Thx for the clarification i added it!
---
I wonder what sort of performance increase the servers would see if they didn't have to spawn extra enemies to attack camps or track the HP &amp; repair cost of every single camp object on the map.
---
What's your gt btw?
---
I read this to the tune of worry worry worry.
---
Dance from fortnite would be cool 
---
No
---
You suck it up butter cup, go look around for folks and use your mic and ask.  Most - if you explain what you're doing - don't mind if they are given a chance to put junk away.
---
The alternative is to find someone, stalk them, and swoop in to revive them; which if you know that's what you have to do, going to events (particularly Encryptid) where other players will go is #1.
---
Encryptid, especially, you're practically guaranteed to watch a couple people die during it.
---
Maybe Bethesda can add Pink Floyds  '"Another brick in the wall " to the radio stations or jukebox ...👍👍
---
Gonna wait until the next update ,maybe it will gets fixed ,maybe it won't.  
---
Then Il gonna submit a ticket
---
Happy to help! Gt is Corbzilla9296 just join a game anytime u see me playing :) level 70+ but still learning
---
My flamer misses in vats even at 95%. Yet when you vats with a grenade launcher they become heat seeking missiles. It's really funny vatsing a scorchbeats and seeing your grenade rounds doing 180 curves when they fly past the scorchbeast.
---
Forget about enemy levels and forget about wanting to 1 hit everything. Just play the game.
---
Believe it or not, when I was levelling, some enemies took 6 or 7 bullets to kill.....imagine that....
---
Pretty sure is ProfesorAwsome if I remember correctly. Icon is a white shaggy dog looking thing. I’m at work right now for about 6 hours so it’s hard to check.
---
Peta
---
Apparantly that isn't it. You have 6 more hours left?
---
Probably in other parts of the us they may have survived
---
I don’t ever remember it... but it wouldn’t surprise me if I never noticed it lol
---
You have to do at least 5% damage on her to get any loot at all.
---
Happened to me. What you need to do is instead of connecting the current connector point, start with the other you want connected instead. Worked for me this way
---
Not really, these ones are not against meat. And will kill an animal if they need to. Their main job was to try to stabilize things and try to bring humanity back to the top with out causing to much harm.  
---
Peta is just crazy these guys where atleast a bit sane, well more sane.... god now I Wonder what a fallout world Peta would look like.   
---
"don't eat meat, feed yourself to a deathclaw."
---
Same here, gonna miss my view
---
Yeah, it's a little pointless honestly
---
It over-repairs the weapon, so it takes forever to degrade to the point where you can repair it again.
---
Sorry I did actually read the whole thing, I was 2 minutes in and was like: how much is left?
---
The best place I’ve found is the small pool at the bottom of the snake slide in Wavy Willard’s. Take off all armor, agro some scorched, and stand in the pool while they kill you with you ally nearby.
---
Errr in theory yes, but how are you getting these coordinates?
---
Which system ?
---
You need to choose which melee build you want to use instead of trying to take perks from them all. Unarmed&gt;2h&gt;1h
---
XBox
---
Literally all they had to do was get Kracken rum to go a special bottle or something, how is that so hard?
---
I spawned underwater under someone's floorboards.. Couldn't fasttravel anywhere but vault 76 (as far as I managed to try). Nightmare-fuel
---
I will be on in about 20min lemme check see if I have it
---
Just get it. You'll forever be curious and you'll keep asking people if its worth it. 
---
It's worth it to some, and not some. It's improved yes, is it worth the full price purchase? Depends how you play. Just buy it.
---
faster fire rate is better
---
Who said anything about a dance from Fortnite?
---
I recommend going to the Mothman Museum &amp; reloading until a tourist spawns under the Mothman Statue. It took me about 4 tries on PC.
---
Appreciate it.
---
And it was a free download
---
Honestly I can't wait for Bethesda to release new weapons, legendary effects that render those useless..
---
Don't discard advice just because it isn't the advice you are looking for. It is an event that will give you three legendary weapons/armor. It's like a low level Uranium Fever(you'll want to do that later) but nobody learns about it until they have leveled past it. If you are already doing bureau of tourism it will put you in the general area and you will unlock locations(giving xp) on your way there.
---
There is also a workshop right next to the fair. Claiming workshops and/or defending them is a good source of xp, plans, and resources.  .
---
I'd hold off on the top of the world quest for a bit at your level. If you are on xbone give me a shout and I can hook you up with some good crafted armor or weapons for your level.
---
If your on Xbox Can I come admire your camp???
---
I never asked if you were "fine." I asked if you prefer to be a low status loser. That was a nice non-answer answer. But, now that were on the topic, it's odd that you claim you're life is fine even though immediately resort to insulting someone you disagree with. Sounds to me like you're insecure.
---
Lol wth are you talking about. Got a screw loose?
---
Nah its actually pretty nice, can use it to see where your camp should go instead of running around looking for wood in a barren area
---
Still get quite some traffic but you’re right. It’s because it was new and it’s pretty much like a sale in a shop. The good things get sold quickly and a lot of vendors are now left with so-so stuff. Plus I think many spent their caps on good weapons and serums and are now good to go for a little while.
---
"Welcome to our home. Place your imprint on the legal waivers and deposit your admission fee in the box by the door. Remember, my house is my house."
---
I understand that you're trying to be helpful to me, and I appreciate that.  But in reply to your admonition about accepting advice, I could just as easily say:
---
"When someone asks a pointed question, don't come at them with a whole bunch of stuff they didn't ask about.  It may not be helpful to them, not what they need to know, and may insult their intelligence and waste your own time."
---
I mean, as long as we're making shit up ;-)
---
&gt; This. I started with medic but the diffuser isn't in the game.
---
Pretty sure the diffuser will be in the next update, which makes medic the easiest challenge IMO. All I need is the diffuser and I've done three of them.
---
It comes in spurts, had a few hours earlier no one went by the camp, then I sold a lot to different people out of no where. Probably depends on time of day
---
My favorite part of the new update is being able to easily view other players camps and learning that 99% of players are at least 10x more creative than I am
---
A two-story 3x6 in a wide open field is still respectable, right? right?!
---
Yeah,  but as they mentioned, with Weapon Artisan equipped it goes past 100% and is a bitch to get back down
---
... unless you power attack with it
---
I have 2 Broken Pro Snap Deluxe Cameras that I found in my travels in case anybody needs one. I’m on Xbox, gt is Eddie_the_fink
---
Isn't it one of the songs in Fallout Shelter too?
---
I spent all my caps fast traveling to everyone’s base
---
Come buy shit from me so I can start doing the same again :p
---
Ah, thanks for the heads up. Finally got it
---
Thanks for letting me know. Do you know if they plan on fixing it?
---
This. All of this. That is exactly what happens to me more often than anything else. It is only made more annoying because the turrets have a poor detection range and often will sit idle as it is being shot at.
---
It wouldn't be an issue for me if the turrets could actually scratch the enemies they shoot at and didn't break because of a scratch.
---
Honestly, pack of mole rats likes attacking your garden? We should be able to set up a damn shotgun turret and expect it to protect our food from pests.
---
Super Mutants taking potshots from long range? Make missile turrets strong enough to at least put a dent in a Warlord and make the missiles heat-seeking so they DON'T MISS because their inept automatic targeting system doesn't know how to lead its shots.
---
I was thinking the same. Travel costs might just not be worth it to “hope” to find something.
---
Just for the fun of it..I been living my xbox running while I watched two episodes of got while keeping my character active in the game by jumping. 😂
---
Well, it's in the Ash Heap quest rewards list, but there's no connection between that and any quests in the ESM. Maybe something that's coded elsewhere. Would be interested to know if anyone's actually got the plan and where from.
---
What would you use coal for?
---
Only time will tell maybe they will find a way to make it cheaper from folks to browse. I was thinking it would be cool if folks could browse players inventories from the personal terminal.
---
And if they like something then spend the caps to travel over and pick it up. Kinda like online shopping.
---
I also yesterday got my 8 possum badges and bought the refrigerator mod and freed one slot from Luck, as the backpack doesn't stack with the Good with salt :)
---

Sometimes when I log into the game at my camp (seems to be after patches) I am stuck in the water in the river next to my hut.  Not just in the water but like...below the game world.  It's weird.  Doesn't happen too much tho.
---
Wouldn't it be nice
---
That's not in the game yet.  Bethesda says it will come in a future update.
---
Sorry I scrapped it I didn’t realise it had any use at the time I’m not even sure if it did have a use at the time tbh it was about a week and a half ago
---
One Violent Night 'recorded' for me.
---
However the 'playing instruments' and the 'playing instruments in location x' did not.
---
Other ones that did not record are the 'shoot creature x with a syringer' for Chemist.
---
On PC you can hit the Enter or Interact keys to confirm the wire placement as well as the key the game tells you to use (default SPACE). Maybe your Interact key/button will work on console too.
---
I hate the jumping so always do this.
---
I don’t buy legendaries because there apparently is a bug that makes it so that you can only inspect vendor items when the owner is nearby.
---
Aaaaaall the time
---
Bureau of Tourism is a Toxic Valley quest, so maybe leave that until you have a few more levels. Top of the World is extremely dangerous, especially if there are higher-level players around, because the enemies are uncapped. Everything else you can follow through.
---
Normally people run into trouble when they follow the Mistress of Mysteries questline to Whitesprings. Same issue as Top of the World.
---
I do think not being able to see the other stars is really hurting the sales.

For collecting the bones wearing a Fedora, I tried wearing a Dirty Fedora and a Crumpled Fedora, but it didn't register the bones.  What hat were you wearing?
---
I turned down some free "god-tier" weapons because they weren't dope heavy weapons that go thunk thunk thunk thunk thunk
---
If it is really the same as this photo,[Marine combat helmet](https://imgur.com/gallery/1b12ZQR) 
---
I want me to make and sell at my xbox.
---
I literally have to go in there for a solid 5 min before I play just for that music. You are far from alone on this.
---
It's dull as fuck, I have 3 characters and early game has always been a slog. My rifleman being limited to the hunting rifle and only really becoming fun once my vats perks started kicking in. My heavy weapons guy was really crap as it took forever to get a gatling gun but once my build and gear started to take on a semblance of the finished product it was awesome.
---
Both the above characters are 100+ now and deal great damage and are fun to use. My melee guy just hit 20 and I'm so damn bored. The idea of doing Rose's quests again is actually killing me but I know once I get mutations, gear and perks it'll start being good fun again.
---
I've always maintained that 76 is at its weakest pre endgame. Exploring is fun but it limits the player to much. Just stick with it or spec to heavy guns and it'll pay off.
---
The body can spawns at Wavy Willard's water park in the parking lot. Just go to the crock at the top of the map and server hop until you find him
---
So it sounds like I just need to pick new challenges
---
I'm afraid the internet would ruin that...
---
that'll work
---
send me a screenshot of the stairs
---
West Tek, Whitesprings, or Harpers Ferry
---
How would it now hurt sales? There were plenty items I thought I would buy until I found out the I couldn’t inspect them. I’m not going to take a chance and waste caps on an item I can’t fully identify. I’m sure I’m not the only one who thinks this way.
---
It's related to your larger question. Doing bureau of tourism is going to trigger events that you may or may not be quite ready for without help(Grafton Day and Protest March).  Neither of those give as good of rewards as the event I suggested.
---
You should be good to go on all the quests you asked about except for top of the world and Welch(you should be ready soonish for that). My whole intention was to expand on the good advice given above by Darth without parroting his advice.
---
I would buy that
---
sorry i didn't have it
---
Still waiting on my canvas bag, don’t want to give their fabric Department now to do!
---
Protip, you can just open up photomode and rubberband/hairtie your two thumbsticks towards eachother.
---
You should be circle strafing the enemies when it takes more than 1-2 hits. Don't just stand there.
---
Tapping ALT will use your power attack.
---
Got a link to download them all?
---
I am confused by your comment. 😬
---
Probably a bug? If it's not it's a very, very stupid duper. Why on earth take the trouble of duping diluted stimpaks and then telling the world about it through his vendig machine?
---
If you're talking about the Entymologist, then the key to using one that you pass around is you need to sell to a vendor first, buy it back, and you'll get the challenge.
---
Another redditor loaned me his wing to sell to a vendor and it definitely worked!
---
We all know how things released by bethesda look nowadays. I don't want a plastic stuffed animal.
---
Did you find the overseer?
---
Her story isn't over yet. We've got to wait 'til "Wastelanders" DLC arch comes out, as there will be a further continuation of the main storyline. So I'm thinking we'll have more little notes from our Overseer.
---
take sneak 3, escape artist, max agility and if you can find chameleon armor that makes it a bit easier (even better with 2* and that other effect that increases stealth), mod that with shadowed and you should be pretty invisible already. unyielding build is also great for sneaking with the high agility
---
You got downvoted, but this glitch definitely works, a guy on PS4 posted earlier offering to help people and he hooked me up. If you search the reddit, you'll find the post, he was super nice and probably willing to help you out. Could also search my commented posts. 
---
There's no way around it either, since you learn it as soon as you pick it up, there's no way to 'consume' the mod.
---
Intentional or not, it's unavoidable.
---
Far as I know, her body is nonexistent.
---
Sweet!! 😂😂
---
Ahhhh that’s pretty interesting actually..! I really hope that’s the actual case and that it’s not some annoying quest bug.
---
That's alright. Appreciate you looking.
---
[Another view](https://i.imgur.com/9KetZWL.jpg)
---
In my opinion, the outrage was overblown &amp; unnecessary.  It has been a good game for me since beta &amp; launch. Don't get me wrong, it didn't work perfectly every time.  
---
Fallout76 gave the wife &amp; I what we wanted ever since 4: side by side coop mode in the wasteland. We work together as a team &amp; share resources between each other.
---
It is vastly improved over launch.   And a lot of fun.
---
So the quest ain’t done is it. I’m pretty sure this is supposed to be ongoing. It’s not complete, so it’s not complete. Capiche?
---
tbh just escape artist, 1 piece of Cloaking or Chameleon (the one that makes you invisible when crouched andnit moving), and The Fixer make me near nonexistent to enemies. I was getting Sneak Crits in the SBQ and Imposter Sheepsquatch and all Ads just by crouching and staying still.
---
what you just said is exactly why is hurts sales. I have a powered/unyielding/WWR piece that hasn't sold and I'm sure it's because nobody knows exactly what it is.
---
Lol what is so confusing about it? People aren’t going to waste caps on a 3 star legendary when they can only see the effect of one of those stars.
---
I think you may have misread what I said.
---
I’m pretty sure you’re  beyond homosexual capiche?
---
How do you even get the campfire event to spawn. I haven’t seen it on the map and just going to camp Adams and talking to the gutsy does nothing.
---
My thing is if I see a LVL1 still in the vault, I'll craft them some pipe weaponry, .38 ammo from my stash and some leather armour. I'll then wait for them to leave the vault and drop the items for them
---
i get sneak criticals on the queen with melee all the time without perks or armor so it’s not hard to do that on the bosses, but i think op was talking about staying completely hidden when standing in front of enemies, sure you can deal sneak criticals with fewer perks but it’s a lot more fun to play around when you have all of the perks and literally nothing sees you
---
My base is a bit out of the way, so I rarely get a lot of traffic. But it has been fairly steady when I do get it.
---
Umm... that... is ... wierd.   Making it harder for Griefers will shorten the lifespan of the game??!!!!  While Griefers do exist, they make up the far minority in the game, you just remember those more.   Not sure what the other player was thinking...  Its better to help out 95% of the population than the 5%.
---
I’d assume the duping method used the vending machines to do it somehow, which makes sense considering they’re new. New things means new bugs.
---
Yes it is, I killed a gulper the other day and he dropped a deathclaw hide.
---
It's at least less a aggressive statement than kill a Brahmin or tear down camps before it was patched but... on the bed? Thats a bit harsh.
---
And just out of curiosity - 1 or 2 rolls of toilet paper?
---
that's what I did too.....just kept on my Scorch murdering rampage after the first 50 for the badge....I've got the taste for crossbow killing now.
---
I didnt say “now hurt sales”. I said I do think. I was agreeing with u. 😂
---
76 was built off of a lot of the improvements that Fallout 4 brought to the table. Things like weapon modding, junk farming to craft, legendary enemies/items, and a layered armor system all return in 76. The perk and special system are totally different though. If you'd like to plan your character and get an in depth look at how it's different, use this website: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
While it is technically a survival game, it's definitely a lot easier than Fallout 4's survival mode; however, it's been my observation that the recent patch increased enemy perception, so hopefully they're tuning difficulty to make the game more rewarding. That's not to say that combat isn't enjoyable, but I'd say it's closer to Fallout 4's normal difficulty, which makes sense. Just wanted to clarify that, because it's a survival game... but not Fallout 4 survival. 
---
Survival systems are mostly hunger and thirst, but you will occasionally acquire diseases which are easily curable. Adrenalin has moved from being tied rest, but is now a perk/mutation that increases damage with each successive kill within a period of time. 
---
Overall, the game is very similar to Fallout 4, but there are some differences. I think that the differences make sense when considering that this is an online game that many different kinds of players will engage with, and I think they did a really good job.
---
No I know exactly what you said. Why would I want to go visit a camp when I know I can’t really inspect what I think I might buy? I go to camps to find legendary items. Now there isn’t really a point to that because I can’t see the legendary effect by inspecting the item unless the owner is nearby.
---
I wish they had a frog one 😂 massive arms
---
It's starting 6pm to 6am ingame while just show up at Camp Adams. But only once at night it will trigger the event.
---
Thank you!  That's the kind of info I was looking for.
---
Hahaha that is an amazing caption. maybe we should make it a meme :P
---
👍
---
Gotcha...sounds like Bureau is one to save for later.  Thanks!
---
I'd get them from the random encounter locations that I sent to you. In case you can't manage to automate those, I might be able to use some mouse/keyboard macros to do it.
---
I dont know where you are even coming from. But I think you missed the IS.
---
“I do think not being able to see the other stars IS really hurting the sales.”
---
Use the Lady Janets Soft Serve spawn instead.
---
And if you have a tesla - bring it with you. It will come in handy.
---
I love being 1 shotted by a level 60 with a TSE anything, then receiving a message about how bad I am at the game. Really motivates me to start the game back up! 
---
I only show up to sell some items at my camp then I log off now.
---
Clarification because I might not presented that perfectly. Crouching hides you from the compass as long as your sneak wins against the opponents perception. If you go after full unyielding sniper with pe like 35, you can crouch all you want, you'll probably be seen on compass. 
---
The point of that investment is that I don't die from VATS, ever. I'm squishy, so few good shots and I'm out, but at least they have to aim. Even if they get first hit (so I should be vatsable now), I'm not. I judge that by looking at the path of bullets.
---
Chances are it’d be made of cardboard or sand paper. But your right, it’d be great :)
---
That guy tried to rob me in the toxic valley. Tried the "help" trick on me, too. 👍 I shot him in the face. He was lit up like a friend, though, and not an enemy.
---
Cool thats awesome. What kinda stuff r u selling?
---
This weekly 'survival' challenge was bugged. enjoy your 40 salvage points.
---
i played the game on the original Xbox for the first few months, i also know off ppl that play to this day on the OG xbox one with no problems.
---
You can't really afford to be competent at more than one and a half weapon categories in 76, and most people stick to one. Pick the weapon types and fighting methods that you like most and work from there. You can always make another character later and take a different path.
---
Vendors will buy any junk, but some of it needs to be bulked at a tinker's bench first. Don't keep a lot of junk that you're not using, as it's all farmable later. Don't bother keeping any non-legendary weapons or armor unless you're intending to use them soon. Dump any weak legendaries in the scrip machines at the stations.
---
Mostly plans. Some ammo and crafting mats.
---
24 players is going to be one boring BR; but seriously, I'm fine with BR elements in 76 because it'll be something new and from what I've read from the datamining, it's not going to be PUBG/APEX/Arma style BR, it'll be BR-like but with Fallout elements and of course, limited to 24 players.
---
I make the mistake to go there last week for the lead and after that i spend 2 days trying to gather the necessary acid to break the lead. (with the help of Hemlock holes workshop). Jokes aside is a great place for lead.
---
You can build at the dish that is east of there.
---
It’s a lotta min/max but this is (about) my build for sneak. Stealth boys can be pricey but for long range PvP it helps a lot.
---

---
“I climbed to the top of NIRA and all I got was this lousy ~~t-shirt~~ picture”
---
Nice. Maybe I am having a run of bad luck.
---
Or Bethesda can make a better game?   
---
I tried really fucking hard to like Fallout 76 but this shit bugs out EVERY single day and ALL the time and it is fucking unexceptionable from a AAA developer.   
---
Oh yeah and it has no interesting npc's, no real characters with fleshed out backstories other than one off holo tapes (Unlike fallout3 and NV which were gods at backstory in comparison).  
---
3 Scorch beasts spawned on top of me at Morgan Town Station level 67 while I was level 25 (level 40 now).   
---
Coming from a life time fallout fanboy (Been playing since Fallout 2 on PC), this game is poorly designed and shit. It is THE WORST fallout available (Next to brotherhood tactics) And that's not an opinion, its a fact. 
---
Let the downvotes flood in!  
---
Each downvote just shows me how much more I'm correct about this shit pile of a game I've been addicted to.
---
Winged Cyborg Robobrain Deathclaw
---
I hear it's in the game, just not from deathclaws. People are reporting getting it from various containers. So keep an eye out.
---
Coming ! :)
---
why should the many pay for the few. I for one have over 300 hours logged already and would stop playing if they this that.
---
Tommorow? Isn't it the 16th?
---
Maybe. I have been thinkiing of moving it but not sure where to.
---
Completing the Campfire Tales event at night will sometimes drop a wall mount plan.  I got a Stingwing one.
---
Picture of the incremented challenge would be sufficient I'd say.
---
I am in the middle near top of the world. Not sure it location matters with the way the map shows camps. But who knows anything is always worth a shot.
---
This vid shows the user playing bad not the ass/sent giving immortality. There are multiple methods of killing ass/sent mofos and there is only a single situation in which this armor does not suck. It does not suck against super-long-range slow fire hits. You took the worst possible tool for the job and complain it doesn't work. Next time when you want to peel paint off old gate, use Karcher, not your fingertips. Stagger high RoF. Laser/plasma spam. Rad weaponry. Sneak headshot with 2.5x multiplier. Consumable explosives.
---
Legacy servers where all the accounts would be moved at wipes. You should keep all your dudes and their gear, and be able to play any content. The idea is just to offer a fresh experience to those who want it, not to punish anyone.
---
weidly, the houses are inaccessible :P let's jump to another server :D
---
Please explain how people duping items is affecting your 76 experience. I really don't care about it since it doesn't affect me but I'm open to having my mind changed.
---
Bugs? I don't mind, as long as I can VATS them because lately it's been a crap shoot.
---
Yesh I am south of defiance in the hills just down from a relay tower.
---
i play solo 95% off the time.
---
M'Appalachia
---
Yep. That’s it alright.
---
That's sounds like a pretty good... Hey, wait a minute!? Oh, nice try Bethesda!
---
/u/Tuskedcargo, how much Bethesda pay you for that one?
---
JK, yea. This would be a legit good idea though 😆
---
Nice. Well there is a saying of dont fix whats not broke. So maybe your spot is a winner.
---
Yeah I’ve grinded the event a bit already haven’t gotten a mount yet rng I guess
---
To be fair there is a perk which decreases the weight of meds by a lot and with chemist you get double the amount of diluted per stimpack so in theory this could be legit. 
---
I don’t think it’s likely they duped this as they knew it could be seen by anyone on there server. It’s probably more likely they decided on making a ton of stimpacks just to sell them.
---
"I got better."
---
Relatable
---
I can't get into the house for some reason 😱
---
i would kill for so much stash space :D
---
should we do the queen, and then come back to the frat house to see if we manage to complete the challenge? :P I think we both need to be inside it while wearing a beer hat and be drunk :P
---
I want pvp. Just not the pvp they have now. Actual competitive pvp would be a problem with damage bugs and clipping.
---
Maybe
---
Agreed, one of the most annoying things I've ran into with player vending.
---
I grinded Harper's Ferry a few hours straight and suddenly all the super mutants changed behavior.
---
They'd still come investigate the noise, but when they saw it was me they'd go "RUN AWAAAAY!" and literally run off to nowhere in fear
---
The White Wolf Fedora
---
Thank u ! 🙂
---
I know it's a little late but just in case someone else is reading this, a good way to get a lot of them is during the Scorched Queen event.  Just spend a sec taking a picture as many of the creatures show up as extra spawns during the battle
---
Use the shoulder buttons (R1 and R2)
---
Yes I’m gay, not sure what that has to do with anything though?
---
Yeah, I thought of that just after I posted...thanks for confirming, will try it when I get home.
---
thank you too (Y) true MVP :) have a good one
---
This would be nice my character often decides to take a rest while I'm grabbing plastic in Wataga High School.
---
That’s amazing. Water and food seem to be a big issue for me starting out because I haven’t got a fully set up camp yet, that and the 600 pipe pistols I need to break down at any one time :D
---
Don’t break an arm jerking yourself off.
---
I just want that they fix the scochbeast queen life, last time I've done it, it was bugged
---
That was in patch 9 changelog.
---
pretty much just stick to a weapon that you want to use and have fun with a lot and build around that weapon using perks made for it
---
You can buy one from the clothing vendor in whitesprings
---
I recall reading similar post just after the latest patch.  One of the community managers for bethesda commented confirming the change and apologized for not including it in patch notes. Not sure if they've been updated to reflect this info now.
---
I could two shot every other player i met. Now even guys who have this gear. Because it gives max 75% damage reduction, not nearly 100%.
---
Ok thx very much boys 
---
I believe for melee stealth it’s the same but weapon perks the other?
---
I definitely agree, its not like anyone can damage your camp so theres really no point in it. Mats would be great. Got stuck in a guys foundation, did the help emote and watched him run around trying to help. Also had some poor guy spawn in my 2x2 that stores my generator no way in or out, had to take the wall out for him lol
---
I have almost 20k ammo for sale in my shop and that’s just from picking it up in the world no crafting, so that’s not a hard number to get to when it comes to ammo. It helps that I play almost completely melee besides the secondary weapon just for tagging legendaries.
---
Hey, I’m spiteful but I’m not Satan. At least I don’t kite mobs to the place. Also: 0 toilet paper. Just I just drop and waddle away.
---
Challenge didn’t exist at the time so it didn’t count towards it.
---
Ah
---
I wasn’t aware of that spawn point. Much appreciated!
---
Me too! Sweet weapon and the range was great!
---
Those guys are reason why is game less stable now.
---
i'm selling 2 mutation serums (500 each with 9 charisma + hard bargain + grape mentats), extra bulked junk, and extra aid items
---
Campfire Tales rewards badges at random.
---
I haven't experienced this myself but several friends have.
---
Love to learn
---
I feel the same
---
This games exploration and "quirky" side have taken front and center as opposed to the dark survivalist apocalypse. I want dark events filled with new monsters and some intense lore. I wish we got to explore more about sheepsquatch in that sense
---
Now, there's nothing wrong with these things but I just prefer a darker more intense fallout over boyscouts and parades.
---
I was expecting the events would be like "Explore hidden mutation lab where cryptids are made" "FeV mutations facility explore it"
---
Idk, I mean it's been fun anyways just saying my piece and I agree with ya.
---
I have 3 broken ones in my stash and I wanna fix them up and give one to my boyfriend but if he has to server hop to find and loot it from the dead corpse then do the quest then someone tell bethesda what’s the point
---
That's what I did
---
Yes, that happend to me too. And in that case  i udnerstand why there is no bag since everytime you would climb into the fissure to retrive it you would Shuffle right of your mortal coil once again.
---
Just south of Morgantown you'll see a decrepit billboard sign. It's after a small junk yard.
---
Veer left off the road and trigger your vats.
---
Cats, beavers, rabbits and foxes have a random chance to spawn there.
---
I know this because it's been the location of my camp since the beta :)
---
Before 3 stars stopped dropping hard and nuked whitespring xp was nerfed i was dropping anything into paper bags which was not explosive. 3 star 2 shot explosive lasers dropped frequently. So someone must have followed me and picked these then useless weapons up. Bethesda could ruin that trading market by making explosive trait a craftable mod box or a plan. Make this happen, devs.
---
You can get the White Wolf Fedora from the imposter sheepsquatch Event.
---
What junk should you keep around? I pretty much have my base where I want it so I just need stuff to repair weapons and armor and mod them. Are there specific junk that I wont need?
---
Deathclaw hide can be found only randomly in containers, i had one in last 30hours by using junk deposit. 4 more to go, but i don't need them as i made 14badges doing event: campfire tales.
---
I havem't found any yet, I thought I coud find it in some camp :v
---
I got stuck in a foundation earlier. Luckily he had a decorated porch so I was able to sit in a chair and that pulled me out of the ground.
---
The repeatable daily called “Stings and Things” (I think it’s called that) rewards with insect wall mounts and insect repellent, it’s the scout robot at dolly sods and you can activate the daily on the personal terminal
---
Dont generalize looter shooters as a bad thing. Borderlands 2 is a great game with a great story and its a looter shooter. Not all of them are microtransaction messes like fallout 76 is.
---
I just got one from an epic behemoth.
---
I got downvoted for ranting post about people who fucking pick wood and dont feed fire. Some dicks responded to me, i am wrong and it is automatic, like wtf? i did it 50times i know how it is done.
---
The fact that you used TSE as your reference means that you are not current.  You are safe in Adventure (as is your base) unless you take a workshop
---
You can take a picture of the dead cave cricket inside glassed caverns and it’ll count
---
It would seem that way.
---
Said that I am unsure if these Chemist related ones I mentioned are 'bugged for me' or 'bugged for everyone'.
---
I guess you can quickly test those 'steps' before fully committing to the challenge.
---
I managed to do enough of them to get the 'fridge mod' and I still have a couple of badges to spare - the Campfire Tales event or the dailies have been stingy in terms of awarding me badges - so you can still pick and choose a bit.
---
I would however not recommend the 'Collector' one unless you have a reliable method to fulfill the last five requisites.
---
I did not scroll all the way down and thought to myself 'I can do this, no problem' and that I did... Until I hit the 'Find Unstoppables #1-#5' part... then I lol'd and moved on.
---
They could add candy bowls for your camp and use that as part of the event for Halloween too.
---
Yea that’s exactly what happens. I try to take a workshop and TSE noob comes in to ruin it. Or they attack you with a BS weapon to start PVP then the TSE comes out and it’s game over. Toxic AF
---
It is imposible all ways, when i conduit all pylons, sometimes those noobs are not able to do any damage to boss in minute that i am alive. Better avoid that even :D
---
After you find your initial one, it’s actually pretty crazy how commonly you’ll find more broken ones around in random containers. I have 8 extra ones that I would love to give/sell to players but Bethesda won’t let us :(
---
I was hoping the personal computers would let us leave other players positive messages. It drives me crazy to see an awesome build but not be able to let the owner know I love their work. Or that their camp literally saved my life or a long slow walk. I always leave a bag of ammo, purified water, etc to show my appreciation but yeah caps and/or a message would be amazing!!
---
I heard that fast travel point for visitors is tied to camp module position. Still,I moved mine several times to no avail, people keep getting stuck at the same point in my camp's foundation.
---
I found a semi-decent solution for it to help people without PA: I put a chair nearby so they can reach to activate it and sit down. After that they stand up right beside my vendor machine -)) unfortunately it doesn't work if they wear PA suit...
---
:(
---
You're being scammed. What you're asking is impossible
---
Yeah. I got blood bug wall mount plan from it
---
Bethesda should work on getting fallout 76 ro an actual 1.0 state and not some early access alpha beta charlie gamma pile of heaping shit.
---
Take Grafton steel or the munitions factory, repair the vertibot pad, take picture. 5 minutes, tops.
---
How do you "earn" anything in 76? The entire loot pool is rng.
---
so the cd keys are a 1 time activation correct?
---
Time travel confirmed?
---
Tentative is about "learning how to camp"
---
You deploy your camp to make a stash and a cooking fire. That's it and then there is no other mission that requires you to do anything with your camp.
---
Following as this is the one thing preventing me from being able to complete the chemist challenges :(
---
There are five stars.  Once they definitively fix duping the can roll out Level 55 4 stars and all of the duped stuff will become valueless (although still useful).

I love how OP gives a big essay on his/her idea and this one word comment sums it all up.
---
Guy locked all his doors.
---
I jumped using marsupial and glitched into his house using a chemistry station.
---
I then found his bed and left a bag of spoiled meat, 1 corn and 1 toilet paper on his bed.
---
Then I sent him a msg and picture over Xbox live telling him about theater dangers of unsecured work stations by windows.
---
Still no response lol
---
1. Server lag.
---
2. Future balancing of content.
---
3. Nerfing weapons that are too rampant that were balanced with rarity in mind.
---
4. Possible banning of inocent players.
---
5. Dev time wasted on handling this shit instead of new content.
---
6. Messing with the in game economy.
---
Its not affecting me directly, but we all play as a community and dont exist in a vacume.
---
It would be like saying that what the banks and credit rating agencies did in 2008 didnt affect me. Sure i didnt loose my house and i dont live in the usa, but it fucked with the global economy. It affected almost everyone.
---
Absolutely
---
Came here to say this. I guess this is exactly what they'll implement in the future updates. Would also be great to see an ability to buy additional random legendary affixes which might most likely be a planned addition too.
---
Yep spam button eventually it happens
---
Apparently, if your building has metal walls, they can tank the scorch beasts much better.
---
But the atom store revenue is 60%  pocket money /s
---
Meh, not convinced. Server lag hasn't been a problem for months and the rest is self inflicted. Thanks for the reply though.
---
This makes a ton of sense if true
---
Put it this way. If I don't get milk from them I get a hide!

Gmod intensifies
---
I did 3challenges in whole day grinding, then i switched to event: campfire tales. and did 13 badges in two days. Btw: if you have friend with carry capacity mod, he can give it to you, because it is bugged and you learn it upon picking (it wont consume plan).
---
Someone put a scarecrow in my camp and I really thought that stopped enemies from spawning.
---
Sorry I missed this. Sure! IGN TheMasterDev on now
---
I got my high capacity mod last night on ps4 and it instantly learned without me going to inv and clicking it. I've got a few friends who don't play enough to get the mod so if I can buy it again and drop id love it.
---
Exit build mode, reenter it and wire from source to whatever needs power
---
That does it for me
---
I agree with your sentiment but to be fair gear is made obsolete when any game has a legitimate expansion.
---
Xbox here. A person who was more than half my level had a gun that killed me in a millisecond. Lots of it going around lately it seems.
---
A newt?
---
MY TURN!
---
Artillery is more an AoE damage than concentrated fire. It might not to big damage against a single beefy target but it sure does wipe out all the ghoul mobs at white spring in one shot
---
It does not give 75% damage reduction, it gives 75% chance for 15% damage reduction per piece, which translates into about 20% chance for all 5 to work, and about 60% for at least two pieces to work at any given time.
---
You had an opponent good in one thing - standing very far and being hard to take down across big distances. Something assassin sentinel is specialised to counter. Somehow people are able to grasp the idea that gamma gun will not do anything to a robot, yet they try to snipe antisnipers and will complain it won't work. The principle stays the same.
---
Judging by the fact the opponent in this video is called exploiter, we can safely assume its merit is nonexistent.
---
Are they actual game coordinates though? Cause if they're not on the same scale as the game they won't map
---
10-15%? It's not even close. Lasers need to do like 100% more dmg and plasmas maybe 50-70% to be even competetive with ballistic weapons. Other alternative would be giving them some ER penetration or lovering ER on enemies.
---
Top link in the post has the whole album
---
That's what I want to do as well. At level 250 I've never cared about making plasma grenades, until now.
---
For the camera challenges at least.
---
Depends
---
 are you asking if the disc just acts as a cd key? 
---
Technically all do, game size too big for the discs these days
---
Or if theres just a paper with a cd key inside?
---
Thats possible but they wouldnt buy it
---
Gamefly has this game for rent and so does gamestop used, dont think they would bunk people..
---
Ask the store if its a physical disc, and if theres a return policy if you cant use the game
---
Took 20 pictures of foxes yesterday.....living foxes, dead foxes, with zoom, without zoom........it didn't count the fox-pics!

To this day I’m still using my lvl 20 AAE western revolver. Best side gun I have so far.

Ok ill be on in a bit if ur still game

Give the "F you" to dupers yourself and don't buy their shit.
---
There's a datamined team deatchmatch content that revolves around ecologists hunting poachers and hunters hunting eco-terrorists. Depending on which side you are in, you hear that beavers population are out of control and must be reduced, or that poachers illegaly hunt beavers threating their extinction and another ecological collapse.
---
It wasn't a bug, it was a conscious balancing decision
---
Water comes easy once you get at least a small purifier set up, foods a different story, best source I've found is the workshop that produces packaged food &amp; just mass producing Salisbury Steaks.
---
So what you found is someone's old mule. They set up this character during the height of the duping frenzy and loaded it up with the artillery glitch (you used to be able to overload your stash by adding to it through an artillery gun's flare box.)
---
These are the accounts that have been sitting on "destroy" rather than trade, but with the advent of vending machines, old dupers are running their stuffed mules as vendors, and not having to destroy their stuff, but sell it instead.
---
Why do people keep acting like it's about the repair kits, and not lies from the VP of the company?

I always wished for 3 star legendary wood. Sadly, as I get older, my wood is more like a sapling. :-(
---
We'll get one made out of nylon
---
Not really true.  One of the reasons i always like fallout is most weapons have their pros and cons. Fallout 3, new vegas, and 4 all had expansions that brought more weapons and armor but no weapon was made obsolete from the base game. So in the event that bethesda adds the chinese assault rifle to fallout 76 it should just have its own strengths/weaknesses vs just making my handmade assault rifle obsolete. Same thing with scaling weapon levels. Unless they give an option to somehow change the level of your gear so you can continue using it end game but that would defeat the purpose of making things obsolete by increasing the level cap of weapons.
---
The rich pay the majority of all our taxes in America. 
---
The top 10% of income earners pay around 70% of all taxes collected by the United states. So they're using tax loopholes to save some of their highly taxed income but they're not able to completely avoid it. Since most of them run companies that are also part of that majority of tax collected. 
---
You can Google this.
---
All are great. Except  scorchbeast king, as that doesnt make sense. The queen was accidentally made in a lab through genetic engineering. I suppose they could retcon it in and it wouldnt hurt anything.
---
I saw that one the other day looking for a pet near Abbies bunker lol
---
Then again I found an interesting one near the fissure and memorial near whitesprings. Theres a load of dead super mutants and one level 1 'Injured super mutant' hes babbling "white horn killed my brothers!"
---
It was actually a little unsettling since their bodys were mutilated :/
---
Didn't stop me grabbing their loot though :)
---
I mean, how would they possibly find people who'd majorly hacked this exploit? You'd have to do some major coding wizardry like opening up a spreadsheet and using crtl+f to find values over 800. It would be next to impossible, I tell you.
---
I have a used copy on the ps4. Works fine, no key required

oooooh! much thanks and upvote! It was a bit of a drag server hopping to look for pets too

You can stash the majority of notes and they don't weigh anything.

Or, if you have a few characters at cap limit, buy everything possible from as many accounts as possible so that after the initial 25k, the duper does not make a cent from and other sales, as they disappear above the cap limit.
---
Do event: campfire tales. Kill all bloodbugs, scrap shit they drop, get easyiest acid ingame. And chance for possum badges.
---
I think the more should have a giant hermit crab with a church as it’s shell

Ill try those. Photography, atomics, and mining are very easy too. Archeologist; foxes are at freds bbq shack.

Apparently the one we fight are younger queens that don’t fit in the current hive so I imagine there is a huge one underneath
---
Well yes but we should at least be able to give them the broken camera so they can repair and start the quest at least
---
Comes back next Fasnacht, which is roughly in 10 months. Its a yearly event.
---
Went to a vendor to find that i was locked in the guys house. I looked out the window and pressed A on the guitar he had outside. It teleported me into the chair and i left laughing. (Looked through vendor and found a vampire gauss rifle for 100 caps.)
---
I don’t give a damn about sheep squatch tbh it’s a stupid animal idea and no hype around it.

I hate that song because it’s on and not even fucking good. Yeah Johnny Guitar was on all the time too but at least it was a good song. I can’t stand the gun loaded or “praise the lord pass the ammunition”

At least Shenandoah is good and depressing and some other great songs but damn. This playlist has GARBAGE songs
---
It’s on a timer it seams so if anyone milked the cow then now You can’t milk it.

Is there any links for guides on this event lurking around? 
---
Ive joined a few times and just kill the mobs since I don't know the routine yet, but would at least like to help with what looks like a searching around the camp quest
---
How smart
---
That's right, but who have more than 500steel in stash don't have space for other things. And then you want to craft ammo, which request more steel.
---
Grounded.

I’d like a ham radio to broadcast from. Shit would be amazing. Have a radio that intakes all the proximity chat to have guests.

I recommend this map, it's not pinpoint accurate though https://fo76map.com/
---
14 badges in two days for me, so yeah it work, but it is little grindy.
---
That's a completely different situation, because you can fit hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammo into a legal stash and with a little efforts it's entirely possible to make that amount quite legally/ The stuff in the screenshot? No.
---
They added a backdoor to the old diner behind top of the world too.
---
I don’t know actually. I got the digital download, but the same $80 version. Got the outfit and power armor skins but I never got 500 atoms. Only the standard 100
---
Could you make it for me? I will send message you in XBOX !
---
They were done properly as people have already told you the answer to this bug. You just don't want to admit that they're right. 
---
The thing with bug reporting and bug fixing. Is that you must fully, and I do mean fully, understand the bug entirely. 
---
Document every stage of it.
---
You start out with 10,000 @ 1 Cap each. 
---
You get a notification that you sold then all.
---
Collect around 1800 caps. 
---
Check your stash. Do you have 0 or 8000.
---
People are saying that almost the exact same happened to them but instead if claiming 0 left they're noticing they still have 8000 left. 
---
There are more people that confirm the 8000 part of this bug and a few mostly just you claiming the 0 theory. 
---
Go back and fully check it entirely. If you report the bug wrong and they "fix it" based on your report then the game becomes more broken than if they fix the real issue of a bad notification system. 
---
Thus when they fix the real issue "your bug" will be fixed as well.
---
I've read enough of this thread, and have enough of an understanding about game development, to know the most likely scenario is a bad notification of sales instead of a fault in the stock being sold at "differing tax rates". Because it would happen to everyone at exactly the same tax rate regardless of the amount sold or price sold at. 
---
Thus you're likely wrong, and should understand this, and verify that what others have been trying to tell you. Which is that your stock isn't being sold off entirely but that your notification of sales is misreporting what you've actually sold.
---
Christmas nukes don't cause damage, instead when they hit it sends out a blast wave of snow and ice, freezing enemies in the initial blast area solid. The ground inside the blast area is now covered in snow, and the weather effect is a blizzard instead of the usual

Server hop at camps adams to trigger it and try it solo.

1. came to fire
---
2. Kill 5 shadows that apear and are marked
---
3. Spam emotes near fire
---
4. go to trees that are in marked area (3) and pick little wooden things around them
---
5. Check shacks around there will be object that will mark once you look at them. Pick them up.
---
6. Go again for those wooden things and bring it to fire, keep fire up. In meantime kill bugs and finish event by killing legendary radscorpion/vendigo.
---
Same with me, I've tried picking up Colonel's holo a few times and won't finish the challenge.
---
It's not a glitch with the stock being sold for less. It's a visual glitch of the amount of stock that it's saying was sold versus what was actually sold. 
---
Double check what you had on sale versus what you have left.
---
At the grave - not once for me,and the one further down at the toxic waste. once
---
That's reserved for the final content patch of the game, where you try to go back and stop the war. Unsuccessful, seek refuge once again in Vault 76 before it initially closes...as the overseer. You were following your own footsteps the whole time.
---
good thinking batman!!
---
Oh no not me I was just confirming that that is indeed the helmet we’re all looking for, not the ninja looking bug-eyed one.
---
I reported a similar person earlier, they had about 4000 stimpacks.
---
Cheats and cowards!
---
yea this game still needs a lot.. I really would like to see dungeons/raids for levels 10/20/30 etc up to some big end game raid.
---
Seems straight forward enough I guess? I always seem to join at the end around point 5 and then it fails :/
---
Sorry but I think you mistook me for the other guy. I was just confirming that it is indeed the helmet we’re all looking for
---
I know who. Capt. Cosmos that’s who. Jangles always taking the spotlight, can’t get no raises with jangles around smh.
---
I don’t know if it’ll help or not but what happened before I lost it, I completed a trade that was a bit glitchy, the stash at WhiteSprings Station wasn’t appearing for me, and someone’s camp has popped in and out a few times, I hopped because of lag and wasn’t able to log in again.
---
Thumbs up for Tin-foil hat =)
---
That would very much be appreciated :)
---
I believe they are. If you are in a hurry I have the Marine Arms, Torso and Wetsuit plans for sale. 1500c for all 3.
---
Alright! Cya soon then!
---
Oh OK, Is it Only PC ? I hope it in XBOX too.
---
Why does their house matter. A button to check their items would be nice but then they couldn't charge you the fast travel fee and hence wouldn't make caps off of us.
---
The backpack you get from the mission gives +30 carry weight.
---
But you also get the ability to craft backpacks, so you can craft a higher level backpack that gives +60 carry weight.
---
Sorry that you are having problem. Would be helpful to to us to know what the last thing you did was on character as would probably be what caused issue  usually is with IT stuff. Did you build stuff in camp? This seems to be a common cause and do you have a complex camp?  One tip I heard about when this happens is if you have lots of friends remove them. I heard this from someone  who had 300+ friends and when he removed it allowed him back in. I think with lots of friends F076 loads them all up and it probably has a limit. But I cannot verify this and only try this at your own risk. Not sure if we get a patch in a few days or if they just turn on Purveyor but hope a patch and you get back in again. All the best
---
Were you able to get credit for hitting bears and other animals with the syringer? If so, how sid you do it? Afaik that part is broken atm
---
No people only have it on pc from the old dev room glitch. People on xbox have it because it was available in the beta (I found it myself on a merchant, so I can vouch for that). You can scrap it and get the plans to build as much as you want, so there are many on xbox out there with it :)
---
If you get me unstuck i will buy anything just for making the effort. Tips would help with the gesture.
---
No tips... ask bethesda more caps for your chalanges... If you are not happy come to European Deadzone we make more caps here comparing to Appalachia.
---
I get a glimpse of that every morning.
---
Then I pass water aaaaand... is gone :P
---
Trying to take and use workshops today this took at lest 1/2 of my building time. It’s just keeps getting worse :(
---
It's a game it's going to have bugs and glitches. No matter what you think should happen. 
---
Bethesda did a wonderful job on delivering fallout 76 and they even admitted that they're going to keep working on the game post releases until it essentially dies out. 
---
Skyrim probably had a few random bugs and glitches but they also spent months on the polishing phase because once released it wasn't going to be worked on much more than the applicable hot fixes to fix what they couldn't have predicted. Which most are off the wall bugs.
---
76 is being continually updated. I dare you to find an online game that releases large updates flawlessly without needing to go back and fix bugs. Blizzard is constantly working on their online games to fix bugs and glitches because when you're working with a constant state of game changes you inevitably will have bugs that sneak past quality assurance due to not being able to test every possible outcome. Then there are some you'll never see until it's posted to the live release due to needing real world interaction with players to catch them because of external networking with the game servers. Such as communication bugs and player to player interactions. Which when done internally don't necessarily pop up.
---
Exactly. If you must lock doors, at least leave something we can interact with outside by a window so we can get out. An instrument, workbench - anything.
---
Or just dont lock doors at all.
---
I’ve certainly come across some overly complicated camp designs when all I needed was a portable toilet plan lmao 
---
But at the end of the day, it’s their camp. It’s up to them how they do it. Some people don’t even care about selling stuff, the store is an afterthought. Others might not be able to figure out how to get the power to the store when it’s outside. 
---
Maybe just go easy on them. Again, it’s their camp after all. Their camp, their rules
---
Drama much?
---
Sounds fun.
---
This is why I build my camp close to landmarks, free fast travel to get out if bugged ,and a 10-30 second walk to get back to my base and the vending machines. Its a real pain when I get stuck in someone else's base without a landmark nearby lol.
---
You're tracking caps but are you tracking your stock?
---
Because you could easily sell 1k of an item you have 10k of get the notification, still have 9k, but think you don't. 
---
Unless you keep tabs on your actual stock then all you're providing is misinformation since you're missing an entire half of how transactions work.
---
He’s offloading old stuff that he shoved in their before the artillery glitch was patched. His stash is probably loaded. Hasn’t been able to put anything in their since it was patched. And is just now clearing it out by selling instead of destroying items due to the new overall item cap
---
It's too loud.
---
OP, how the fuck do you THINK it's possible?
---
Report him.
---
Campfire tales event at Camp Adams has a chance to give it (I'd say 25%), or if you see my base there I am usually selling it
---
I agree with this, because I do like to have a look at camps to see if there are any good ideas for mine and give the owner a thumbs up if there around.
---
I think most people are realising the issue with the machines right now. It looks like you spawn literally next to the vendor from what I see.
---
If theres any form of foundation at your base you will spawn under that sadly :/
---
We need to all spawn in where the owner of the camp spawns in if there are not going to be fast travel mats. My spawn point for my camp is completely fine for me, but there's more than a few times now when players haven't been quick enough and I have to remove a foundation for them to escape.
---
Actually I like this idea. Very much.
---
With a caveat: once you put it up for sale you can only sell it or destroy it, you cannot take it off sale and use it yourself.
---
Otherwise is a free "anti-entropic field".
---
Ah! Great explanation. Seems like a case of "correlation doesn't equal causation", then.
---
U do get the salute emote
---
As of yet we don't know, there isn't any official sources that say either way.
---
Thanks, very clear.
---
Wait!? NO Drill ⭐⭐⭐ ??? 
---
What a bummer...
---
vault-tec could hiding out in a still sealed vault in appalachia, they would not want go into the enclave bunker so would have built their own somewhere remote. vault 76 is supposed to be a control vault (i have my doubts about that) and our job was to rebuild america, vault-tec could then reappear to take over and the overseers mission was to take control of the 3 nuke silos in the region no matter who owned them which could be a way of stopping anyone targeting vault-tecs vault when they reappear, it would be pointless to carry out so many experiments in the others vaults if there was no way to recover the data.
---
on the security terminal in vault 76 there is note saying that if the experiments in the other vaults failed then vault 76 would be in trouble
---
There's no understanding it. Survival mode took a beating the last few patches.
---
over 200 hours of playing i have never seen radshield lol.  where can you find it?
---
I've been playing online games since 2000, starting with Ultima Online back then. Cheaters and dupers are the worst and cause lasting damage to the games and the legitimate players. No need to sugarcoat those pieces of shit.

Not true.

In fact this bit:

So what?

Are you suggesting that we must continue to elevate the rich to the level of kings?
---
I'm usually on 8pm til about 1am PST if you wanna add me. Ingame name is the same as here.
---
when I get told that someone has sold, and then go to the machine and verify that, yes, that person bought it all, then that means the stock is being sold off entirely and I am only receiving a third of what I should be earning.
---
your gigantic wall of text means absolutely nothing.
---
Really? Ok better to do drama than to dupe and get banned. Thanks for ridiculous comment. Blocked.
---
End game melee is pretty good even early game you just need to spec perks. Action boy, Incisor, bloody mess. Make sure you vats into a attack to close the distance. Then circle strife. Block if you have the chance I usually forget it's there
---
That's nothing. Anyone spawning into my camp will find themselves in a tunnel under the road.
---
&gt; I have not noticed it being any quicker or slower
---
Because it isn't
---
Camp space occupied, no camp was loaded in. Just finished a trade before hopping
---
I can't wait to FT into a room full of rad emitters where the mat is on top of the pressure plates so I'm dead before my game loads.
---
Though, that's a niche case for sure. Mats are certainly still a strong, maybe necessary, addition.
---
If your idea of a post-apocolyptic adventure is joining the scouts now is the time to get back into it. Seriously. The new content is joining the scouts and doing the relative dailys.
---
You seem to have been grinding this event quite a bit, is it true that it can award Possum badges?
---
I keep hearing about this but as far as I am concerned is a myth.
---
Even basic phone games track items with unique IDs. Once items started getting duped, any item that had been duplicated, they deleted the item number and all items in the game with it got deleted. No idea why Bethesda can’t figure out how to implement this in 2019.
---
&gt; there has been NO visual proof that the bar is draining faster. 
---
In fact there is proof that the rate has not changed.
---
Yeh true like I said am unsure how he got that much worth reporting for sure
---
I had to murder and eat a cat before because it was blocking my fast travel. 😕
---
They really need to add a spawn point floor mat. I was having this same problem so I decided I was gonna set down a new camp and design around the shops. I put down the camp site and a foundation for it to sit on. Then I ran away and spawned back at my camp (8 times) so I wound know where people would (mostly) spawn in. Designed around that spot with the shops right in front of where I was spawning and build my beautiful, max camp limit camp. Got done and powered everything up so people could come and BAM! They're spawning in the water, nowhere near where I had and my base is complicated with a basement in the water so they couldn't find the shop :( 
---
I was told the spawn point has to do with where your camp thingy is set, so I moved that around a bunch and did the spawn back thing way too many times. It does seem to have some effect, but none of it is reliable right now.
---
The drama is real.
---
&gt; when anew patch comes out they change their play style and that new style drains water faster.
---
Notably, with the new player vending people are probably using fast travel more, and fast travel consumes the same resources that slow travel the same distance would, but "in the blink of an eye" (or at least a loading screen :)).
---
A few days I've had 1 Scrip leftover.

I have the same problem along with a couple of others.  But there's always a guy who can pick it up at the end. Not sure what the problem is.
---
You should see the Ghoul Chair in Fallout 4...always felt bad to see people sitting on that poor bastard
---
All evidence points to much drama. Turn on pacifist and relax. It isn't hurting you or me.

No, it doesn't "make sense", it's a stupid conspiracy theory with no factual backup.  It "makes sense" like QAnon "makes sense".
---
I think they need less of a damage buff and more perk cards that up stagger chance or cripple limbs/ bypass armour. Maybe some for an increased fire rate and vats headshit damage so it really leans into the gunslinger/ Western vibe.

Wasn't this a pc thing were they didn't give physical discs. I thought consoles had physical discs like every other game
---
I'm saying that bitching about how much they make and "how little they pay in taxes" is incredibly ignorant. 
---
They pay more in one year than most Americans will pay in over 10 years. They get tax cuts because of all the additional income they provide. 
---
The amount of taxes collected by companies that rake in billions per year equate to much more than the tax cuts they recieve.
---
Let's say completely hypothetically that a company pulled in 10 billion in a single year for taxes to the United states government. The government offers them a 50million tax break. That's 0.5%.
---
That 50 million is then free for future development of that company and their endeavors and the next 5 years they see steady growth and they pull in 11 billion. That's a revenue growth of 10% for the federal government at a tax cut costs of 0.5% for the company. 
---
It makes sense for the government to do that. 
---
Plus those companies and individuals that donate to charity so they don't pay taxes, they often have to donate more than their taxes would've cost. Though they get to choose to help charitable organizations. 
---
There are also taxes that cannot be avoided at all. 
---
There's always more to the picture than anyone really wants to see because it doesn't fit their narrative.
---
I mean I used to flat murder people and destroy camps for doing that so I'd say you're being entirely to reasonable.
---
No, of course he doesn't.  The only proof anyone has is proof that the thirst meter is draining at exactly the same rate it drained during the beta.
---
that doesn't matter. they've done it before.
---
So among all the "me too" posts you get voted down.  Typical herd mentality.
---
It's gameplay loop is essentially the exact same as 4s but you need to grind for junk more.
---
Got them just a few days ago from top of the world station in two server hops.
---
I agree with you. The schmaltz tune fits
---
Well your username suits you. 
---
Since you're not actually checking your stock. 
---
Where else would those items possibly end up? I also doubt you're actually checking your stock or inventory at this point. Just because it'd be a huge embarrassment if you actually found your missing items. 
---
Nothing in your "tax situation" adds up at all. 
---
Since you have a wide variance in the tax rate on all your different transactions. 
---
It'd never be random that's not how coding works. 
---
It would ALWAYS come out to the same tax percentage every time. 
---
They'd have had to manually code in a randomizer for your situation to make sense and everyone would have noticed the same exact thing not just you. 
---
So check your stock and inventory again. On every item you've sold and sell again. Check everywhere that your items might end up. 
---
Because you're the only one dealing with this 'exact' situation.
---
It does indeed even if you haven't joined the scouts yet, however the drop rate is pretty low, I think it goes down the more you get from it as for me it seemed to be about a 50% drop at the start now its more like 10%
---
You may not be out to spread lies and misinformation, but you are doing.
---
&gt; I genuinely believe thirst is decreasing faster.
---
People "genuinely believe" many things that are not true.
---
A friend lost his camera shortly after it's launch and for a few weeks he couldn't do Atom challenges. Finally after a lot of work another friend managed to transfer his from an alt. Now he'd just repair a new one.
---
I think they're sort of a safety back up way of getting a new one if you loose your first.
---
If I were to design the events, I'd make it something like...  
---
Christmas: A robot of some kind needs to deliver presents to children for a sort of secret santa affair, he uses either a pack brahmin or any other type of transport, however, special small sheepsquashes called "Krampus's minions" come in to try to steal presents. Your job is to escort the brahmin, and try to prevent the minions from stealing all the presents. If a minion picks up a present from the cart, but gets killed, you can loot the present off of them and put them back into the 'cart'.  
---
Halloween: You have to go trick or treat at a couple of houses, everytime you ring a bell you have a random chance of either having a friendly Mr. Handy opening it and giving all the players a small halloween reward, or it has a chance to spawn a (set of) enemies, including dressed up scorched. Rarest enemy spawn of all would be a set of scorched, dressed up in winter clothes, called "Commie sympathisers", because as we know, nothing is scarier in the fallout universe than a commie!
---
&gt; Who would have had the foresight to time their water consumption prior to patch,
---
Are there FO76 gameplay videos online?
---
Just had this happen earlier in Whitespring shops.
---
and guys please careful with paper bag stealers in events..
---
When i find out people have locked doors i like to find the nearest window closest to the bed and spam A to rest so they can find me sleeping when they get back.
---
I made new characters to experiment with new builds, have a vats crit rifleman, a heavy weapons  build and have just started a melee.
---
Gathering plans and making camps also killed time. Grinding for weapons and armour as well as mutations. Chasing atoms doing challenges. Player killing in survival is good fun as well.
---
The added content helped but mostly I found it relaxing to play.
---
or you can buy one from my vending machine lol
---
Violet flux.
---
I want a Gatling Gun weapon skin
---
I took a picture of a mutant hound in one of the houses at Becker Farm
---
As for the radscorpion try Graninger Farm, Kiddie Corner Cabbins, or even the Toxic Dried Lakebed 
---
Guplers can sometimes spawn at Graninger Farm or a little past it towards Philippi Battlefield Cemetery. As well as Anglers. 
---
And I have no clue about the mole rat. Those guys can be anywhere unfortunately
---
anglers sometimes spawn just west of the cemetery, and there’s a farm that always spawns radscorpions. i dont remember the name of the farm offhand but it’s one of those in the middle of the valley (graninger farm?)
---
What platform are you on ? if xbox, im more than willing to help out
---
Faith in humanity restored .... or at least bolstered! Well done sir, well done.
---
Unless it changed, duped guns do stack because they share exact values in every way. Change the mod on one or using it a bit to degrade the condition unstacks them. That's the only definite way for other players to know it's duped (or the duper admits it I guess.)
---
Craft ultra light on all stored armor and standard mods on weapons. Drops tons of weight.
---
you won't get any atoms from it because it doesn't give you any.
---
all you get is weapon and power armor skins, an outfit, and an emote.
---
I want to have more tattoos for our naked wastelanders
---
How did tou complete collect bones while wearing fedora? It isnt counting for me. Which exact hat were you using?
---
Locking camp doors doesn't make sense anyway, not like people can take your stuff.
---
That's a powerfull curse, carefull there Satan
---
You can still do that today. Visitors spawn where you originally placed the CAMP device.
---
Kurwa gimme desk fan plushie with a bonus battered clipboard one!!
---
One random comment deserves another
---
How’s survival mode or have you quit and gone back to bullying folks in adventure ?
---
Thanks mate, but I'm PC.
---
We really need a Looking For Group option where you can pick a trackable Challenge or Quest to flag for help.
---
-G
---
I still think that this is the product of a childish mind. Once? maybe ... perhaps the first time anyone did it was truly funny but now it's just lame.
---
What system you on? I have him right now
---
I'd buy THAT for a dollar!
---
Yeah it’s crazy unstable. I typically get dc’d 2-3x in an hour. I’m on pc.
---
Exactly same for me on a mule. Camp spot occupied. Logged out and now screen is black with the loading spinning in the corner 😤😤
---
LOL.... ya ... sad but true. At least until a means to identify players in the real world is introduced. How many duoers, grifters and grievers would be such dickwads if you could simply click on their name and identify them?
---
Yeet.
---
Mine also at ws station after a laggy trade.
---
Please lmk if you find a fix . I'll message you if i solve it
---
Nice to hear someone else shows appreciation too. I have never left the "fertilized corn bag" but i often leave a thank you bag of goodies.
---
Yeah, thank you too!
---
my username does suit me, it's always nice to meet another braking system enthusiast.
---
because that's what my name means.
---
as for the rest of your condescending crap, i am checking my inventory. 
---
also explain why things i have up for sale at 25 caps are *only giving me 7 caps*.
---
the only things i sell for 25 caps are stimpacks and treasure maps. my stock of stimpacks haven't budged since last night, but my maps are all gone.
---
all i saw on my screen were 7s.
---
clearly this isn't happening to anyone else, or if it is they aren't noticing/speaking up about it.
---
but it's happening to *me*.
---
No, but you should lose the weapon.
---
I had this issue with a different course, i server hopped and it worked
---
Thanks, I will keep at it.
---
I think I might have missed out on that badge bonanza as I joined the party late.
---
Said that I am about to finish the challenges, well, the ones that can be finished anyway so let's grind the event with renewed hope and determination.
---
I thought the dupers accounts were banned?  Did they get their accounts unlocked?
---
I heard that when Bethesda locked out the users account and all their characters were locked as well.
---
I would imagine some players have their vendor setup so when they are close to max caps they can lock up while their transfer caps or spend them before unlocking?? No one wants to have stuff selling while maxed out and lose the profits. And no one want to redo all their vendor prices over n over.
---
Sometimes it just easier to lock up shop for the time being
---
First off, you may have noticed that my argument is that the tax revenue the government collects is misspent. Spending as much as we do on the military is literally insane. 
---
Secondly, the only thing I wrote about taxing wealth(ier) people is about raising taxes on incomes over $100,000. The justification for tax breaks over that last forty years is trickle down economics and that has been proven to be a non-starter (literally in the economic sense). I see no good reason we shouldn't return to a top marginal tax bracket of 75%. Which would still be less than the high of 91% in the 1950s.
---
P.S. Don't bother to imply a narrative unless you stick your argument to what I was discussing.
---
No, and that's how you learn to look a gift horse in the mouth.
---
Nice try Bethesda
---
Report them!! It's the right thing to do.
---
If you buy stolen goods you don't get your money back, in fact you're lucky if you don't end up in prison yourself.
---
Id be happy if this also applied to the larger purifiers. Trying to line them all up is a hassle sometimes :/
---
Holy shit yes.
---
I had an alcohol addiction that seems to have cited itself. Now, no matter how many whiskeys I drink, I can't seem to get the alcohol addiction back. I'm trying to do an alcoholic character. Wtf?
---
what happened is that they kicked off the ones who had over a certain, very high number of specific items. I don't remember the precise number, but maybe someone will - it was basically "if you've got more than 20k of a specific bobblehead then you're out" but a tonne of people avoided the ban because they were under the arbitrary number on the specific search items.
---
Alternatively; fix armor pen so energy weapons benefit from it.
---
Gatling Plasma would be the highest dps in the game if it benefited from Stabilized.
---
60% dmg is on the explosive dmg. Test it, its not so much of a deal anymore
---
They don't need damage they need armor pen.
---
I'd like to see better weapon specialisation across the board, with pseudo niches for every class of weapon. Shotguns currently have the crippling crown. Rifles are good against armour. 2H Melee is great for burst.
---
But pistols are kinda crappy, rifles with no armour pen, 1H melee is kinda lack lustre and heavy weapons are good at eating ammo.
---
I'd like to see energy guns giving status effects like the burning effect some of the do have, but with say an armour sundering type of effect. The stringer also could use better utility, maybe with a tranq round for taming or something.
---
Currently most of end game is grinding that perfect weapon, finding your build has been nerfed, then switching your special over to the new FOTM build. And that sucks.
---
He’s clearly duping etc. Report him.
---
Absolutely not. But nice try Bethesda.
---
I have a ticket w/Bethesda about this.
---
Can’t attach wires from medium and larger generators to power connectors 
---
I can build generators and power connectors but I can only attach wires to small generators
---
It would be fun if the legendary monsters in the event wouldn't drop legendary loot unless the event succeed. Than might force the one-shotting egoistic players to actually care if the quest succeeds or not. A small step forward.
---
I personally love the corn, fertilizer and toilet paper bags, I think they are hilarious!!! And love getting them, giggle everytime. My only grudges are that they aren't on doorsteps and that the flamer doesn't set them on fire.
---
It is. I've forgot to re equip it a couple times after I put weapon artisan on and you can tell the difference.
---
First world problems in a post apocalyptic world? I honestly had never considered this. Makes sense, as long as the FT landing point isn't near it.
---
Say your gun does 100 + 20% from explosive effect = 120dmg . Demo expert adds 60% only to the 20% i believe . Stopped using it myself after the nerf
---
Depends, only get 500 bonus atoms with Xbox
---
Hmm glad I'm not the only one, not even sure why though but I hated building bases in Fo4 yet I love it in Fo76. (Maybe because there were so many bases)
---
Good to know . Thank you
---
Whitesprings as a whole is fckd, they wrecked it on the last patch.
---
Ok  👍
---
Whats its background? I remember I saw it several times and it only says somethings and moves along..
---
Some player had its vending base up on the Seneca Rocks peak so naturally, fast traveling there puts me at the very bottom. Took me like 5 minutes of jumping and a Jetpack to get up there. I finally arrived at the peak (with the teddybears) and the door is locked. No business today I guess vendor person!
---
Coat is a rare drop from the mire dailies, which are currently bugged.
---
i don't know where it's been, someone could have used it and had cooties or something
---
yeah i used to camp lakes and getting them to line was annoying
---
It's not though. It can't be happening to just you.
---
It's a visual misrepresentation. They've said this several times. 
---
You need to check what you actually have on sale for the exact price per item, check your caps and your entire inventory after the notification pops up. 
---
If you sell 3 items for 25 total. Instead of 25 each. You get 7 caps after taxes when 1 item is sold but it said all items were sold. Then you check your inventory and either have 25 caps per all 3. 61 to 62 caps for all 3 at 25 each. 2 maps left out of the 3 for 25. Or 2 maps left 1 sold for 25 which you get 22 to 23 for. 
---
Or you sold it all at the right price received the right amount of caps and the game gave you the wrong number in the notification. 
---
Though every time you describe your situation it gets to a different variable and tax rate. 
---
Only recieving 7 caps only makes sense in 2 scenarios. 
---
3 for 25 selling only 1 keeping 2 and getting 7 caps for the sale of 1 of the 3.
---
Or it's a visual misrepresentation brought on by a bug in the code grabbing a value that makes sense to the transaction but shouldn't be given.
---
😂
---
Ah your kidding! That sucks I think I’ve got it on a another character is there a way I can transfer items across?
---
I have been using the "rejuvenated" perk since around launch, meaning I always try to have close to full hunger and thirst. I also have marsupial and speed demon, and must confess that there has been little difference to me between now and the beta/launch. I did notice that fast traveling takes  a good chunk of your food/thirst meter if you do so more often than not, but after the vendor update I don't fast travel around as much anymore, so I care less about it.
---
(Also, nice that I wasn't the only one noticing juicehead's "drinking problem". As a person using a well fed build I have been getting triggered watching him running around with those glaring red condition bars at the side of the screen. Sorry for rant, still love his videos.)
---
I thought it was east of where you placed it. I think I may be old and out of touch.
---
Someone posted about a week ago about having more radio stations- I agreed with them saying they needed more genres as well- bluegrass, honky tonk, country and western, folk  
---
So yeah, Patsy and Hank senior would be great! Would love to be roaming and hear Kaw-Liga or My Bucket has a Hole in it when crafting some beer...
---
Something needs done that is for sure. 
---
Setting visitor spawn points to where the camp owner spawns is probably the best option. This way the camp owner knows where it is and they arent going to make their camp so it is awkward for them to spawn, so it wont be awkward for anyone else. Much easier than getting a friend/willing player to test it out when you build a camp.
---
Spawn mats are also an idea, but it would need to  be done so it isn't abused. I mean, what is to stop a player placing one down to trap another in some crazy maze etc. This could maybe be done by means of if you have a vending machine, it automatically sets a guest  spawn in front? Something like that.
---
I don’t think anyone was banned or kicked out. I think their accounts were just suspended indefinitely.
---
My point is, how are dupers selling stuff unless they got their accounts unlocked.
---
I got it. It's cool, but man does it look like a heavy metal wet dream.
---
It also wasn't in December -- it was the numbers for mid-November.  You know, minutes after the release.
---
You should still have the mod if you didn’t “consume” it
---
Innosurvivalist, she has great tips at showing how to do the challenges.
---
yeah - what I;m saying is that there were plenty who weren't locked in the first place.
---
Doesnt change when u move it for quests just yourself.
---
Guests always spawn where it was originally placed.
---
Do you have [Pain Train](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Pain_Train)? It is said just sprinting by the robots ends up aggroing them.
---
Ban him!!! Destroy his life! Doxx him and contact his place of work. Nazi!!
---
Even if the caveat is that it's only effective up to X range, I'd be down with that. Love the pipe revolvers in this game, but at a certain point they just become completely useless and outclassed, even if specced into pistols.
---
406,795 players on one of 3 platforms in mid-November 2018.  For a game that launched on 14 November 2018.
---
Another tip is relocate your camp machine around your region build zone and the spawn point tends to be closer to it. 
---
I.e.  I keep mine far away from my building right to the edge of my zone. No one spawn inside for me.
---
someone sent me a message that my house broke because he spawned intro the floor.  then when i got to camp, i saw a player stuck, so i removed stairs and foundation then built it in the sky
---
Had this a lot recently on PS4.
---
Stupid question but forgot to use starched genes perk?
---
Hunters long coat could work, although it's quite hard to find. Grey wool hat could also work and is fairly common, but it makes my hair disappear when I wear it lol.
---
My flamer lasts about 3 reloads, same for my AGL. I have a nice fire rate laser pistol  / rifle that lasts even less time.
---
Durability needs a look.
---
It's your own fault,  Knight, didn't anyone ever tell you to make sure your optics were clean?
---
Sorry forget to mention Im on XBox yeah.
---
Glaad to see Ernest Tubb in there
---
The packaging clearly states I would get 500 Atoms though...:(
---
Where would I find a hunters coat do you reckon?
---
i‘ll give that a try, thanks man!
---
I Still do lol. Im getting ready to write a opening post for my shop/safe zone for all lol
---
Yeah that's a great idea ..
---
Totally agree mate
---
If you can live without I'd wait. There's probably gonna be 4 Horsemen bundle later on with all 4 for cheap af.
---
Their main draw to me is that they let you mix and match armor classes and still have a uniform look. War Rider is my favorite
---
Havnt seen that for myself.. but I guess maybe terrain plays a role too perhaps as I’m build right long a cliff 🤔.
---
According to the [Fallout Wikia](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/) there is a Quest, internally at least, called [St. Valentine's Day Massacre](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/St._Valentine%27s_Day_Massacre)
---
Sadly just the way it works and why we need welcome mats back.
---
Having to scroll down every time to check is a pain. Or at least have a separate challenges section for your tracker challenges
---
I agree that our taxes are mismanaged on several levels of government.
---
Therefore we should not give the government more tax money at any level. They should fix their budgeting issues.
---
The military budget goes for a whole fuckload of things.
---
Do you think people shouldn't be paid who serve?
---
Where do you think most military members live?
---
Do you know of anyone, personally, that's served?
---
Do you realize how shitty some of the benefits actually are that retired military recieves?
---
The military spending covers housing, payroll, development of the 4 branches of the military, technology research and development. 
---
Yet they're constantly dealing with issues of being underfunded and dealing with shit housing situations unless they reach a higher rank. Their pay rates are above that if minimum wage workers and the higer their rank the more they get paid based on pay scaling. 
---
A 75% tax rate is absolutely stupid.
---
You have no other reason to suggest that other than pure jealousy against the rich. 
---
The 1950s tax rates were absurd but necessary to help the United states recover from the cost of ww2 and those rates dropped back down to where they are today because the government promised to not continually tax at such a high rate and in doing so promoted businesses to grow and allowed the rich to invest. Thus we have a strong economy today.
---
Go to west tek, Kill everything loot every mutant, you will get around 40 Assault Rifles, each sells for 30-50 Caps with hard bargain.
---
There's lots of stuff that's rare if you adopt a policy of never buying god-level weapons.
---
If you get stuck in foundations, etc, deploy power armour (as far away as you can) and then "get in" - it may pull you out of whatever jam you're in. I've used that a few times. Not sure if you can cheat *through* walls, but works if you're *in* walls/floors.
---
Also you can apply a Pioneer scouts skin to your new backpack to jazz it up.
---
Getting a full set of troubleshooter armor and weapons helps a lot too. Doesn't have to be the best gear to have awesome offense/defense when you match the enemy specific perks.
---
I got a two shot combat shotgun after about 450 hours.  Two shot, less damage when aiming, lower vats cost.
---
I feel tho the hold back can easily be the abuse some players would use it for. Like trap bases lol!
---
This would be rarer but there’s always the few that will use a feature in a negative way haha
---
But still they would be nice.
---
LPT: If you want to enter someones locked CAMP, look for windows that have workbenches on the other side of the wall. If you press the craft key on them through the window, your character will pop in front of the workbench. Another method is to use your power armor chasis. Stand next to a door, and put the chasis in the house, and enter the power armor. Of course, this won't work on all circumstances, but it did help me get in a few times.
---
I've been dragging on for 7, 8 months. Gimme something. Possum hat, wheeeeeee,,! Let's kill some baddies.
---
False. This is goes for MMOs that have open PVP. 
---
It doesn’t affect fallout one iota
---
&gt;  Their code is simple af, 
---
No, their code is insanely complicated.  That's why they can't do simple things.
---
If folks r worried just teleport in power armor.
---
Spruce Knob Lake, where the swimming test for pioneer scouts is located. There's a tiny cave along the water, there's a few signs low in the water pointing in.... go in there and there's one of those pointy boards traps you can lay in your camp in the shallow water..... take turns stepping on in, it worked perfectly the first time my boyfriend and I tried. You might be able to put the pointy trap in the water at your camp and do it there but I haven't tried.
---
you are trying to make sense of something that isn't making sense. good luck with that.
---
meanwhile im going to go launch a nuke with my key card that doesn't expire, and doesn't go away even if I get the launch code wrong.
---
im sure everyone has one of those at this point, too.
---
look, im not worried about this anymore. my good stuff isn't for sale anymore, and taking hits on ammo I don't use, or excess aid items, or other stuff I'm not going to use doesn't bother me anymore. im sure it'll fix itself after the next maintenance.
---
Beware of the empath mutation if you play solo. I got it using the same method and basically had to start over.
---
Let me first say I like this idea- of taking over a "workbench" radio transmitter, so peeps caan tune in if they want or take you over if they really don't (even though they don't have to listen)  
---
Having said that, it is already painfully obvious that Beth didn't want to pay a whole lot for royalties, thus why we have such a small playlist as it is on Appalachia Radio. And I don't think that will change.  
---
Truthfully, the best way it could work is for Beth to hire performers to record from the vast library of publicly available traditional folk songs, many of which are mining related or are long standing traditional songs that are standards in bluegrass and folk- that way they own the rights
---
Who wouldn't want a Fallout 76 Mothman plushie.
---
Or one shot in events always grant you a shiny new drill. MAX prevention
---
GT: Same as here.  LV 95.  Always looking for fellow dwellers to survive the wasteland with.
---
Wow, you have to be really rich *and* really stupid to buy caps for money.
---
Doubt anyone really worried, just the nature of how people play the game.
---
I blame my Brahmin... set up a brahmin pen for the milk/scout quest and was at 800/800 at the time. When I came back after some time, my Moomoo had added 5 fertilizer and I was at 801/800.
---
Tl, dr: Brahmin don't give a shit about the stash limit
---
What and where is this list you speak of?
---
Ooh- good call. Thanks for the notice and sorry you found out that way
---
Good looking out! 👍🏼
---
Lost a three star legendary today that way. Got a glimpse of a junkies fat man as the mutie was falling before he disappeared so I wasn't too pissed but this is a problem.
---
Oh yeah, I've seen it. I've got like 1600 hours in FO4 lol
---
Now you have to grind search bars to find the answer to your question.
---
Which adds to the whole survival aspect. Folks need to learn to be careful cause their r Raiders out there.
---
i wonder if sprinting and jumping are impacting consumtion rates, its something we do naturally in the game without thinking about it
---
The pain is felt. I run pa too.
---
But it's okay, cause power armor is OP right? Especially compared to sentinel and cavalier armor. No one's gonna use it since it's nerfed now, right? Right? :/
---
Cd keys are a PC only thing. 
---
You can rent or play any used game on PS4.
---
A few times now I've become a conduit with all 3 of them and then jumped on top of the building so I don't die and people can kill the bitch.
---
The conduits need to stop dying.
---
thats a duper, i'd put him in the report bin.
---
huh.
---
yeah i looked it up, apparently you are supposed to get 500 atoms with the xbox version.
---
Mimimi i don't want to run around in this game, let me buy stuff from everywhere mimimi.
---
Hey I am new to this game, what is a scrip limit?
---
Yes, but the straight line borders are hilarious.  You can see where different teams have worked on different areas.
---
It looks like one of those satellite pictures where you can see international borders from space based on different agricultural practices/subsidies/whatever.
---
Just as everyone told here - just average day for PS4 player. Welcome to our world, where chems are cheap
---
I'm looking forward to sneaking around west Tek dressed as a tree. Those dirty muties will never see it coming...
---
do the campfire tales at camp adams to get some badges ;)
---
its something like 1-8 chance of getting a badge each time
---
Will you play bongo bongo bongo?
---
You can always buy them.
---
Sounds like communism vs capitalism.
---
How is it scummy? You chose to sell it low and chose the resell it higher to make profit. You got your 5 caps, let him play the game as he chooses.
---
Being able to pick armor, ranged, or melee will narrow it down a bit, but yeah still going to be a long shot for good rolls.
---
Capitalism alive and well in post apocalyptic America it seems
---
Is there any benefit from using those? Are they multiple use? Aren't they only used for creating purified water?
---
Forgive me if I'm naive, but if you flip the switch to turn off the vendor, do you have to redo everything?
---
A tax protest will only make operating the country harder and make conditions worse for the citizenry. 
---
In order to correct spending we need to elect intelligent people who are not criminals. Our voting process could be cleaned up to weed out the criminals. I don't hold a lot of hope for Americans to vote for intelligent people, but maybe reducing the impact money has on elections would help.

Please, quote me where I said that reducing the military budget should be done by taking away soldiers pay. I'll wait...

A top marginal tax rate of 75% is sane. That applies to money over $500,000.

I have a lot of reasons for my opinions. I assure you jealousy isn't even in the top twenty. Speculate all you want, but do not accuse. That's disingenuous.

This "strong economy" is going to stumble in the next stiff breeze.

If you have legendary items you don't want, you can turn them into "scrip" at train station scrip machines. You can then use the scrip to purchase new random legendaries from the purveyor starting May  16th.
---
I equipped it and all my other mutations are still there
---
Ok, I'll give it a try and see if it works.   
---
I just wish they'd fix these dumb ass problems with the game instead of the dumb nerfs they're putting in which only serve to increase clientside/serverside instability (LETS ADD MORE RNG CALCULATIONS TO ARMOR EVERYONE USES!!!)
---
&gt; Great map appreciate the work that went into it! 
---
u/AHeroicLlama is using computers correctly -- he did a lot of work on the tools to *avoid* doing a lot of work on the map.  Laziness is a highly sought after virtue in programmers, who will often work long hours in an effort to avoid doing repetitive work.
---
it doesnt give you tadpole badges.
---
I want a unicorn pink 50 cal that shoots rainbows. And a makeshift gat gun that's got, like, a bike pedal as the crank and stuff
---
from what i recall the daily quest for cleaning up the waste and the bug parts can reward tadpole badges, but something like 1 in 5 chance of giving you ONE badge.
---
Correct. I bought on Xbox 1, came with a disc. So I'm not entirely sure what the OP is describing. I thought that was PC only the "CD Key" thing.
---
Nope. Powering it up only allows it to be spotted on the map, doesn’t shop people was actually using it, it one were to stumble across your camp. And as long as you don’t store or scrap it your items shouldn’t have to be reapplied
---
Visitors and the owner spawns in different places. The owner is said to spawn at a distance relative to the actual placement of the device. Moving it will affect your spawn point, but I havent looked into it. It's mostly visitors I've tried to get to spawn in better places and avoid getting team members stuck in floors when visiting.

Isn't *Fallout* officially too adult for LEGO? I thought it was one of the franchises that they said didn't fit their youth-friendly all-ages policy.

&gt;  It's also important to remember that you can skip the launch code part if you can find them elsewhere

Elsewhere means https://nukacrypt.com/

Some times, he just drops dead. Could take seconds, could take minutes. Whenever I find him I menu-bounce with friends to find the good stuff. And he just drops dead eventually, everytime. Without cause.
---
If a vendor isn't near the white spring station I don't go to them anymore. Paying 18 caps to see someone selling 8 pipe pistols a bolt action rifle and two leather armors isn't my idea of economical. A hub would be great.
---
Yeah, it'd have to be Megabloks. I just know if I said "I'd love a Megablocks Prydwyn!" a lot of people would go "WTF are Megabloks?"
---
It's not, saw another post where someone tested it now vs the beta, it drains to empty in about 51 minutes
---
Exactly! I've seen several post proving it's not
---
Because of this I have never crafted a water filter, they're pointless.
---
If your idea of a post-apocolyptic adventure is joining the scouts now is the perfect time to come back. Seriously, the scouts.
---
if i was on hat, i'd expect to be able to build   look at all that space!!!  
---
then i'd plant crops, make wooden rectangles, fill with dirt, plant then water  
---
i think it'd work, even in real life, right??
---
what if he purchased, left server and resold, would that make a difference? (you wouldnt know what he did with it)
---
i find resale/price gouge people are hilarious, love it when they buy my stims at 5ea and then fail to resell them for 30ea. (was afk on the same server as him, he had 0 sales on stims)
---
Water filters are.
---
I think there’s some discrepancy as to whether scorchbeast is a scorched or an animal though the 50 cal prime receiver is great cuz there’s no hardened receiver for the 50cal
---
THIS BETHESDA! PLEASE STOP US TRAVELLING INTO CONCRETE FOUNDATIONS..THANKS...COULD SOMEONE DIG ME OUT PLEASE
---
👌🏻
---
Yes. It's called credit card (if you choose to fall for their scummy money grab design and prices).
---
I only found this out earlier today so I swiftly took my 21 tokens and cashed in 20 for that level prize (some various scrap mats), no way I’m going to save up for a main prize again with that kind of weight on them
---
Yeah i agree this would be good, my camp is in that monorail tower and the game went through a phase of spawning me at the bottom of the cliff which was super annoying. Also would help when visiting camp vendors the other day I spawned inside someone’s locked basement
---
Thank you! Looking forward to doing it :)
---
Not really. You could setup a database script to comb through the script to report back "if \[item\] with \[value greater\] than \[x\]". Then they'd manually have to review those accounts as of that point, but it'd help them find dupers right off.
---
Bethesda never put their foot down when all the duping happened. They could have searched inventories, they could have gone above and beyond, wiped accounts/inventories, take more action, but they didn't. A lot of accounts got banned, but the dupers were able to keep most of their items if they escaped the banhammer. 
---
The implemented that 1,500 pound limit to try to stop dupers, but as we see here, clearly that didn't quite solve the issue.
---
Put on passive mode and go bloody like everyone else. Put on lots of food and weight reduction perks too. The wastelands are surprisingly warm and fuzzy.
---
I’d buy it lol, I’ve already got the RL mr fuzzy plushie so he could keep him company lol
---
Free States, man! It's the evil government putting their dirty fingers into our private lives! I'll only buy from Free states vendor to avoid all taxes from now on!
---
I didn't even have to read this before I upvoted it. Thank You Sir/Madam
---
what console? cause kinda interested
---
With what? I've put at minimum a dozen shots from my TS Gauss rifle (300 base damage) into that thing without killing it.
---
Alot of people have it and in my opinion it's not that good so I'd pay a couple hundred at most. Really depends on who's buying and so personal preference is the problem
---
I built a house once that killed me. I ported to my own home, and it put me underwater... and immediately loaded the flooring above me, trapping me under. I went to port away, but by the time I realize what was happening, I got a disease from being in the water that lowered me strength and forced me to be over-encumbered. I died, and left my loot under the base.
---
I had to tear part of my floor to recover the gear.
---
Another friend's base randomly drops people off cliff's. Not sure which is worse.
---
Hm yeah contact Bethesda support
---
It's still extra damage that I could do with though ha! It just sucks because I've got to lv 175 without it being a problem not having gunsmith equipped. Wouldn't even be that bad if it wasnt so damn expensive to repair!
---
Ahhh, you must be prego :)
---
The dark brotherhood dlc was fantastic.
---
You have answered your own question.
---
The whole basis of the system is to make getting them for free - thus adhering to the 'they are completely optional and can be unlocked without additional purchases' Live Services Mantra - grindy and awkward to add appeal to the option of forking out a few ££.
---
If I have to pay for skins, no thanks.
---
Don't smoke the Kanawha kush when out in the wasteland. Do it at home from the safety of our couch.

Xbox one
---
It would be so cool to have plot around the aliens, like somehow they naturally have some level of radiation do the ghouls don’t attack or whatever
---
rip, ps4, and i’d sell it for like 500-750
---
I honestly don't see why it matters if you want to save caps play the game and walk there instead
---
If you know exactly what they have what's the point of when going there, may as well just sell it from a distance too
---
Finally, workbenches!
---
Weighs the same as a duck?
---
I play solo 100% of the time, and you can get some atoms leveling up or doing some non daily challenges. Yes, its anoying when they offer 20 atoms for taking a photo of a player equiped with an unicorn outfit while riding a SBQ at night, but there are other challenges you can complete
---
I actually did this last night! 
---
The guys camp was built on the small river near Flatwoods and his mixture of generators looked like spaghetti junction. So I messaged him to return to camp and built him a fusion generator :)
---
I put low level weapons in my vendor set up at 1 cap each. My camp is near flatwoods so I know low level just starting will stumble upon it. Also free water and food.
---
I wish you were on xbox, so I could join you. At lvl 200 I always have more mays than I need, and I like to help out other players as much as possible. My favorite way to help (especially with melee builds) is to introduce them to the wonder that is the bloatfly syringer. Unlimited glowing meat steaks, farmed from the comfort of your base is fantastic, not to mention the acid and xp.
---
\^\^- Happiest people in the world.
---
(Due to beer, not taxes...)
---
If you log in wearing the excavator armor you get an extra 100 carry weight you will only lose it once you get out of the armor. I try to make sure I'm at my lowest weight then jump in mine at the end of gameplay ready to load up the next play time 😊
---
Does it really screw server stability? Genuinley curious as to how just bigger numbers would do that. I would be super surprised, for example, if each individual object is a db entry.
---
They can't punish the common buyer. They can't expect everyone to know what is a dupe and what is not. That said, if you have 10x the exact same weapon on your inventory you are in danger of getting burned (or just lose all but one of said items).
---
I could literally record it depleting. I can physically see the core tick down while idling around my camp doing god knows what. It's definitely not a lie.
---
Which I don't think makes sense. Safes never seem to have any better loot with higher lock requirements. And while hacking does offer a few additional perks, nothing it offers really seems to be game break either. It either gives up a bit of lore or allows you to open nearby safes (or, rarely, hack into turrets in the area).
---
It would be the best thing to do to remove them, no doubt. But still, Bethesda can't track every single duped item from every single inventory in the game and remove it.
---
Whoosh ;)
---
If you log into a server while wearing it, it gives you the extra hundo, but if you get out of the power armor, it resets to the regular +100
---
A battered fedora sometimes spawns on the table in the army tent around the back of the university in Morgantown, the clothes there are rng and change all the time but it might be a way to get a free one if your not already sorted.
---
i keep 150 of each component but 400 wood, at all times in my stash, and to reduce weight, my brother told be to bulk:   
---
aluminum, copper, cork, fertilizer, gear, lead, oil and spring  
---
everything else will be heavier if bulked
---
but since the release of vending machines, my stash is EMPTY then load it full of stuff i'm selling, but still have so much to sell, i wish we could limit 500 items instead 120,  
---
so, i no longer scrap anything. i keep all junk as-is, let benches auto-use what's needed and sell for 1400 daily caps, then drop the rest
---
\*re-reads your comment\*
---
\*re-reads his own comment\*
---
Well... fuck! I thought this coffee was caffeinated.
---
you can still help we have three sections to our guild PS4, Xbox, PC. We have a discord and a guilded. Since I dont have PC or Xbox I also hire Xbox and PC people to fulfill missions and help people which in case I cant. If you want to enlist my discord name and numbers are Cactasboy13YT#8632
---
I have a few in my vending machine, priced at 1887 caps, and while they don't sell like hotcakes, they do sell. There is two ways to get the plans, and both are rather inconvenient.
---
On the photos side I had issues taking pics of things until I realised that you have to make sure that the camera identifies what you're taking (grey text box in top right corner will display what's in shot) then it seems to register. 
---
Obviously if you've tried that/knew already I apologise for teaching to suck eggs.
---
The problem is not with the prices, but with the knowledge of value for items in the game - I've bought insane weapon form vendor machine (3\* B50/weigh red Handmade), I've talked with the guy who bought Western outfit &amp; Chaps for 100 caps. It's all because people sometimes don't know the real value of items - tattered mole head is 100% spawn in dolly sods, so the real cost is just one of fast traveling there. But not everybody know about it - they see the item they don't have, see the price and pay it if accept. I won't buy it, because I know I can easily get it myself, but not everyone knows that.
---
I just kill all the ticks at the lumber mill and moonshiner shack with butchers bounty, then server hop and repeat for 30 minutes or so. Then I craft about 100-120 stimpaks or so and sell them with hard bargain on
---
Same. Now my CAMP has a hole in the roof.
---
You deleted yours. My comments are still there. Are you insane?
---
I hope Bethesda sees this kid.
---
Nah you can put a switch on them but if you turn them off be prepared to have to relist everything. Learnt that the hard way this weekend
---
I've already sold 5 of them (2 via trades, 3 via vendor machine) for 800 caps each. People are sometimes lazy to do the mini-quest and get it for themselves.
---
I sell mine for 100 caps but reading these other replies it looks like I’ve been undervaluing them lol, they sell though and maybe they would just collect dust if I priced them any higher
---
only place i can think of is to wait for someone to nuke whitesprings   never thought of west tek or harpers ferry
---
Its not always that easy. If you post your legit trade list on the market and somone offers you a reasonable trade for it, you dont think that he's a duper. And many dupers do it like this.
---
Of course, the guys who post "H: BE Handmade, BE Gatling Gun, BE .50 Cal, BSS Powerfist W: Caps"... thats perfectly clear.
---
Thanks for that.. I tried everything and didn't have a clue I'd still be wondering how all week if I hadn't of asked 👍
---
They need one per town/city in my opinion.  They also need a nuked version of these bosses.  They should all have a chance to drop unique gear/guns/emotes/hair styles/camp shit.
---
Seems legit
---
I'd like to see waterfilters have a condition bar tbh.
---
That'd be AMAZING for saving weight while traveling!
---
I pretty much sell everything half price than the stated value regardless. Unless it’s really special then I do 75% stated price.
---
Thanks for that! 👍
---
Sold a two shot gauss rifle for the same price
---
its a glitch if you start your game in PA you will get the extra 100 pounds, once you get out of the PA or die it will be the normal weight
---
Doesn't it require adhesive to make a water filter? And it requires I purified water to make adhesive. So if you purify water you have just enough to make adhesive to make a water filter. Lol
---
Thirst and hunger are faster , i was in my camp with the perk card that makes thirst and hunger slower in camp and still became dehydrated 4 times in an hour
---
Same happened to me. Pro tip you can go into Survival and lose it easily. Just make sure to stash your junk and aid.
---
hold map. scroll to your name, leave server
---
press map, press L1, leave server.
---
Not seeing a lot of difference.
---
If this is a legit exploit, you should probably delete this.
---
Are they coming after duped weapons/items again? I thought the ban wiped happened for dupers
---
Yes saw one today for 100 caps immediately bought it i saw one for 4000 caps.
---
Where does that make it not dodgy?
---
Wish it wasn't a glitch the extra 100 helps alot when looting.. how longs it been doing this for do you know?
---
This is interesting.   Would be cool if they limited what patches you can buy based on which ones your character earned in game.
---
They will eventually.
---
I didn’t mentioned, because adhesive is common component.
---
&gt; I can physically see the core tick down while idling around my camp doing god knows what. 
---
You said:
---
&gt;  standing in my pa
---
If you can actually see the core depleting while standing in your PA then record that.
---
I’m glad they gave enough time between releasing scrip and the purveyor so we could hoard up on scrip beforehand
---
I dont know what they do, but its perfectly clear, that the game gets flooded with fresh dupes.
---
If somene offers you a BE Handmade +1 agi, you can be 99% sure its a duped gun. They are everywhere, they are as commen as a Mutants 10 MM Pistol.
---
Okay and I will when I get home.
---
I placed a fertilizer in my CAMP from the resources tab and milked the brahmin that spawns with it. After that I stored the feritilizer and placed it again and it gave me the option to milk it again. I could repeat it till I had succesfully milked a brahmin 10 times
---
That isn't scummy... I spend my day buying things that have been listed at below market value and resell them at my machine for my perceived value. Is it scummy for retailers to buy wholesale? No, it is not. It's called profit
---
never thought of that.   
---
my brother and i was going shopping and didnt want to exit, so i went in the bathroom at a train station, shut door, then take my brother's xbox controller and turn it upside down, and put a heavy pillow to push the character to run in circles.  
---
my brother and i came home an hour later to see message:  
---
"disconnected due to inactivity"  
---
i wonder of bethesda could detect that i was running in circles and not doing anything for so long???
---
I guess you missed the parts where I started: A. I'm a vendor. B. I had just shy of 2k rounds if that ammo and it was all for sale in the machine and all gone after that one sale.
---
Why is it so hard for you guys to believe Bethesda ducked something simple up,yet again?
---
It damn sure isn't their stellar track record on bugs...
---
E
---
Decent foot traffic to my shops but not a lot of legendary purchases. My stock is definitely bringing people in. However, most people are buying plans and chems. I think most people are looking for undervalued items right now.
---
That's brilliant! Kinda like the Punch Bowl but for candy. What's going on with the punch bowl anyway why did they disable that?
---
When i try to place the sixth turret the game says the build count has been exceeded.
---
I don’t believe we have that title anymore. 
---
Maybe Netherlands;))
---
But yeah that was indeed because of cheap beer. Hands down 😆
---
One could say they are 75% as good as they used to be.
---
They are playing the game...
---
 They take either dirty or boiled (not certain) and turn it into purified. I think they're single use, but I'm in much the same boat. Lvl 160 and never used em
---
This is just so wrong
---
Upvoting because I’ve rolled legendary rolling pins What the F*** 🤬
---
Thing is, duping has caused prices to drop so much that those who have a legit god roll or legacy will hold onto it to sell it or trade for what it's really worth - because they only have that one. Dupers have entire inventories of these items.
---
Yeah that would be great
---
FO4 is still more fun with Mods and Vreation Club items. FO76 needs a few more years to mature.
---
It's never too early to learn that the government is a greedy piglet that suckles on the tax payers teat until they have sore, chapped nipples.
---
I thought they nerfed assassins sent more thanks for that
---
for a while, and yes it will suck when the fix it, just like when the fixed the fusion core glitch.
---
I am currently shopping for pieces. What platform? 
---
Also I agree. I only buy a piece if I can see all the effects or the price is cheap enough that I know I can resell it if it isn't what I was hoping.
---
What happened with the fusion cores?
---
no, its a little bit different. Perfect rolls can't be bought with caps at all under normal condiftions. You cant buy a BE Handmade for caps. Nobody would ever sell it, he would want 2 Assassin/Sentinel pieces for it or something like that.
---
The dupers sell these perfect rolls for 25k. And this means: All other weapons are worh 0 caps. 0. You dont pay anything for a Bloodied Handmade if you could get a BE Handmade for 25k.
---
To make it more realistic, use water filters for water purifiers and fusion cores for fusion generators.
---
Are you the player that sells Fasnacht Berets for 50 caps? Because I bought one for that price last night. I haven't put that one on sale again just yet, but it surely will be more expensive, as it's rather rare, is not obtainable in game for another 10 months, and in demand.
---
As for the mole head, I've sold one or two for 300 or something; if that's what it's worth for someone, there's nothing wrong with it. You are welcome if you don't need the caps, but I kinda need them to buy overpriced items from other players. ;-) I spent more than 2000 on the Imposter Sheepsquatch outfit, for example. And I would totally buy it again for 100 caps if somebody offered it to me, if only to recap some of that expense.
---
They would have to you know add some real CONTENT not these annoying chores... but still no I wouldn't pay for it
---
Well I appreciate the info.
---
Well probably about 99% of all be lasers are duped by now
---
The only thing I have on the "k" range is a candy stuffed mr.fuzzy at 3k (or whatever it's called in english)
---
When the game first came out, if you exited the game while in power armor and came back, it refilled the core you had in your armor to 100 percent, and the cores drained slower before. So you could amass a ton of fusion cores on the original one if you kept relogging in to refill it
---
One of the few bugs i don't mind
---
This is an illegal item that is stollen from the dev room. Not sure about this sub but other subs ban talk of trade regarding this item and will suspend people who traffic in this item.
---
I also play solo 95% of the time, the only times I join team is for events, when someone ask for it (then - why not?) and I'm able to do almost all challenges (only that require Hunter/hunted I pass - I hate PvP) - most of them you can do in 2 minutes and can ask anyone in the game (microphone is very useful) - you tp to the place with required gear, make a photo, you change roles and done - total 5 minutes per photo.
---
It's just every other weapon class has extra modifiers, I think pistols really lack this. Given thier role they definitely should have great synergy with vats.
---
Lady Jane's soft serve... fast travel... for past the trailer.. walk onto the main rd and pass a whitespring bus on its side... much easier spot to get him to spawn
---
So then depending on how you set up everything you’ll want incisor, barbarian (for extra defense), gladiator, and martial artist (if you want to go that way, I prefer it because it adds to swing speed which can be great in harder fights and especially pvp and more hits can land)
---
Oh damn, yeah I have seen that specific  variant alot of the times. Are their other variants of a be handmade that aren't + agi. I haven't got lucky with explosive weapons since I've gotten this game and haven't bothered on Reddit because of the amount caps people ask for.
---
I've managed to get 2. Found them randomly in containers. 
---
Unfortunately deathclaws dont seem to drop them, at least none of the ones I killed did. 
---
So not bugged, the hides do exist. But I'm guessing fairly rare. (Or if there is any lying about openly, they've all been taken).
---
Difficult to acquire them. My boyfriend and I saw a guy selling one at his camp for 25k...
---
Please don't share the link. We are all aware of the duping. Don't distribute the how to video. You are just showing others how to do it.
---
you do understand that spreading the fire only makes it worse, right? you’re just encouraging more people to ruin the already broken economy
---
And you’re helping by showing people how to dupe ? Lmao 🤣
---
Taking a workshop at level 17?
---
That's the endgame content I've been looking for
---
And that's what I'm saying. Prices have dropped - those with legit weapons will not sell or trade them until the storm is over.
---
Ah another glitch that I wouldn't of minded on staying.. fusion cores ain'that hard to come by at the minute and with the right perk cards the cores are lasting a little longer then normal.
---
I haven’t tried the prime receivers yet. But reading this it sounds like it’s something I won’t be grinding for. 
---
BUT the water filter I totally agree. ATM it’s useless but I think it’s a nice add-on. 
---
Right now boiled water is ‘worth’ more than purified water from water filter. Way too many materials for 1
---
Thats is not only a duper he is a gamedata changer. He rewrites local client variables to make his junk weight absolutely nothing so he can store them without any problems. Dunno why this is still possibly and beth isn't doing anything about that by putting those values on their servers \^\^
---
Former scout here as well.
---
This is a really good idea. Because as a scout that book goes everywhere. Going backpacking and counting ounces? Awesome! But remember your 2# handbook. Heck, I'm 35 and still have mine.
---
I'd like to see this as well as a shash for all our badges
---
That’s on pc. There was a thread where someone actually contacted Bethesda after receiving this item because he was worried he would get banned. Beth said that it is obtainable in game (as far as WE know it isn’t) and that there is no reason it would affect his account.
---
Please try shooting me with a TSE.  I will beat you to death with a walking stick.
---
All of you saying it’s not helping showing the link, get over it, it’s not helping while we all sit idly by and don’t put it on blast forcing BGS to do something about it, not only that but they should be EMBARRASSED PUBLICLY for this level of sloppiness, I hope EVERYBODY sees this ESPECIALLY BGS
---
Got a video?
---
Wait a second...why is that on the list then?  I'm level 13, I already did all that.
---
I hope that **Bethesda read** my post and do something for the next patch!
---
&gt; But that doesn't fit people's narratives so my post explaining it is currently sitting below the threshold at -14 and dropping.
---
I am gonna drop you a hint at why your posts are probably not getting the attention  you think they deserve: It's not so much what you say...

You can fill in the rest. Try being less Q and more Picard/Data/Troi/Riker/LaForge/Crusher.

Reported the YouTube link for promoting terrorism.

I know it was risky. I expected someone to try and take it. What I wasnt hoping for was somebody to obliterate usable equipment that you can claim merely for the amusement of it. If he had taken over and used it I wouldn't have been so butt hurt about it.
---
Thank you so much for this. Proper testing and empirical evidence, that's something we just don't have enough of right now. Conclusions are jumped to wayyyyy too quickly here
---
Sometimes things magically get done faster when you light a fire under someones(BGS) ass
---
There's a long list of challenges, there is a lot that are easily done, just have a look. The 'Kill 76 scorched with X weapon' can be done in a few minutes of your time by simply going to Morgantown Airport and Point Pleasant a few times, and you can kinda cheat your way through 'Mod 76 pieces of X armor' by applying and removing paints; all you'll need is 38 oil.
---
There are also similar wire connections on top of the nuka plant.
---
I found a snub nose 44 that ignores 50% of armor... Not sure if you could find a 3 star and higher lvl.. But it absolutely sucks unless your fighting robots (at my low lvl) in melee range. Even with concentrated fire vats it awful till you can touch them with the gun.

I'd have though it be cool if all your badges where placed automatically on your bag you get if its the tadpole or possum one. Not any of the atom shop ones

if you use a max rank fireproof perk tse explosive weapons just tickle. i know this because i have a tse 50 cal. and shoot the ground around me when i get surrounded by enemies, so i don't have to worry about killing myself anymore.
---
Taking a workshop at any level opens pvp while you are on site. Claim the workshop, collect the plans and goddies , and leave.  Don’t go back to defend it.  Easy peasy. The game is great. Don’t quit.
---
I never knew how to dupe, thanks to you i know it now. I'm gonna ruin your game by duping me some fresh awesome shit i actually dont really need. Thank you bro. Definitely not reported this sub so it gets deleted and stuff. All cool. lets dupe together to be the very best! \*sneaky sarcasm off\* \^\^
---
If they don't ban the people responsible and delete the duped items, this is bethesda's fault this time around
---
It's still ridiculously good, it's just not god mode anymore
---
Possibly a bug, more likely dupe
---
This sometimes happens for me:

All you're doing is fueling the fire and showing people how to dupe by sharing the link. Bethesda literally could not care less what you specifically have to say, you're not "embarrassing" them
---
I was hungover and very tired after my birthday, I wrote this and then crashed haha! 
---
My god it's a mess.
---
I upgraded my gatling gun receiver, and now I never use it 😐
---
And just to continue. 
---
It seems that the game is loading the extra loot a bit faster if you press search before taking the stuff already in there. 
---
Sometimes when I search after, it tells me I found something 5-10 seconds later. At this point I’m already gone. 
---
Don’t know if that’s just me. Try it out
---
This won’t be deleted lmfao and if it is I’ll post it every hour from new accounts until Bethesda does something about it 😂
---
Not a clue why but yes that is currently the state of things
---
I still have to be there to defend it when the mission pops up right? I'm not sure how else to get the plans it rewards you with. I knew pvp would be enabled so it wasn't such a surprise that I could be killed, what pissed me off is that the guy did it for simply the joy of being a prick.
---
I found that someone sold it for about 100 caps and bought it on the spot, and I don't even have X-01 armor! 500 caps seems like a decent quicksell price or else go up a bit more if you're willing to wait.

Do the food spoil while in vendor machines??

He is not only a duper.
---
He is also a exploiter of the weight limit.
---
I am trying to set a VM with chems and foods, and just trying to show 20-50 of each is a hell (no perks for the stash)...

Rare spawn in certain containers like Super Mutant meat bags, SB guano piles, Gulper bellies...

Do the encyrptid event.  There's a small pond by the hut and people tend to die alot in this event.  Thats where I got it.
---
Yeah dude. It's a jerk move to lockup. I have a 1x1 locked room upstairs with nothing but a stash in it that i use for bag transfers with friends and thats it. Come on in. Repair your shit, have a nap, grab a couple water bottles. I'm not gonna let a nuclear apocalypse impair my hospitality.
---
Nope. You just wave goodbye as it changes ownership and go about your business.
---
Real bad PR and exposure....Higher priority, I’m not going to explain such a simple concept to you idiots any further
---
It's not just the event, though. The two dailies can award badges as well. I had my first Possum badge when I was still a Tadpole and had never done the campside event.
---
i posted lewisburg 6 months ago but found out it was random to other players.

but one guy commented "oh yeah? i'm a fat man"

---
Yeah well, your post got removed from the looks of it. So, nice try, idiot. 😂 we're all right, though, all you were doing was showing people how to dupe. No "bad PR and exposure" you're not that special lmao
---
And we'll just keep reporting it until you possibly get banned or suspended from the reddit ;)
---
Oh yeah, legendaries can make them more viable but all the other classes get the same modifiers plus a more diverse perk card pool.
---
You are right.  Stacks don't destabilize anything.
---
Lmfao I’ll just post right again idiot  and you’re literal trash, literally 🤣
---
There's a quest up in the mire where you learn to make it.
---
And you'll get reported it again, and it'll get removed again. Looks like you're the trash lmaoooo dumbass

Just bock back into fo76 and wow, the community is a whole lot more friendlier than when i last played (Launch - mid December). I'm not being hunted down by higher levels for my junk and I just gift the lower tier players power armor from the West bridge location.
---
Also I just give the higher level guys in my servers the nuclear key cards I collect and any silo codes from the officers in exchange for small quantities of Ammo or for them to repair my weapons (I'm mostly melee but i carry a revolver, 10mm SMG and a silenced hunting rifle for sneak engagements)
---
Reported for sharing how to dupe
---
they have stated it will be in the next update, nothing on frog habitat yet
---
Report this guys, he already posted this and it got removed due to sharing how to dupe. Report it
---
The stream in Flatwoods during fertile soil. The robots do so little dmg that they don't insta kill you
---
Have 35 reddit accounts, the whole day off and plenty of scripts to auto post, this should be interesting 🤣
---
Yeah, you have to be there to defend, but do it and leave. Just collect resources occasionally and leave. Crouch while you are there. In and out, head on a swivel. Taking a workshop at level 17 is fine. Mostly, you'll be fine. That guy was a douchecanoe.
---
Duping, uhh... finds a way.
---
At least prices are cheaper now on the market
---
Lmao well you'll just keep getting reported and removed
---
Or better yet, let us see the objectives of the challenges we're tracking in the data section of the pip-boy
---
Only to influencers, the others can have carcinogenic plastic.
---
There are many people like that playing MMOs. They must have a very sad real life if they need this kind of gratifications.
---
...but then again, when they face someone of their level, you should see them running away and jumping like rabbits, getting killed 5-6 times before they disconnect.
---
Karma.
---
Speakers of the radio mounted on the PA!
---
I only have 1 piece and I notice a difference. Wish they woulda duped some armor instead of all those shitty laser rifles
---
then why even release them all in the first place? Release a few challenges each week if you wan to slow it down. Why release a bugged challenge?
---
And more and more people will find out ;)
---
People were spiking the punch! To many people dying from when someone would say put in nukashine or something dangerous
---
I wish we could have that but sadly they want it as challenges. 🤨
---
This is an insult for all the legit users!
---
Bethesda, not being capable to handle this, is making legit users and legit traders to feel like the village's idiots here.
---
Again, the only thing your not special dumbass is doing is sharing HOW to dupe. Bethesda doesn't give a shit about what you have to say. They're aware this is happening, and it will be dealt with, just like it was before. Everyone is aware of the duping, this isn't news. Literally go away lmfao
---
Brahmin have always been sketchy IMO.
---
Check train station post boards for random "Investigation" mini quests if you haven't done all of them yet.   There are 5 or 6 in all and award mount plans.
---
You need to read r/FO76 more.
---
Did you just put a signature on your own comment? Thats ridiculous
---
Sincerely, 
---
 \- Paul
---
Well this explains why the whitespring is so much more laggy and crashy than normal.
---
Exactly how I feel. Why would you want to take away someone’s feeling of accomplishment when they finally upgrade from a pipe pistol, or start bolting better and better bits of armour to their vault suit? It’s the same with player vendors. You don’t have to scrimp and save to afford anything anymore, as so many sellers just want to ‘help you out.’ If you wanna help me out, stop being so eager to squash all the danger in this post-apocalyptic wasteland.
---
Nah, I'm good.
---
Sharing it will get Bethesda to fix it quicker.
---
I was invited to a chat party and some of the old methods are working on duping. Won't mention which ones, don't ask unless you're BGS.
---
Left the party. Enjoy your TSE bloody lasers scum.
---
Lmfao I can feel the salt and anger pouring out of you all the way from here I can’t wait to see how heated you can get when you see this ALLLLL DAY LONGGG 😂
---
Nah, it won't. They're already aware of the problem, him posting this is gonna do more damage than good cause it shows how to do it. He's being dumb
---
Lmao well I'll be laughing my ass off at you every time this gets removed so, good luck with that. 😂😂 pathetic
---
yes it should be, but just buy random stuff, i have bought plans I will never use just to give caps away.
---
Finally someone who has some common fucking sense, thank you
---
I usually craft a hunting rifle
---
Um... ok... I often tag my posts on here or forums... being doing it for 2 decades... what's the big deal?
---
Ah. Your standard issue warship waifu pillow.
---
I’ve just never seen anyone put a signature on a comment before, not a big deal. Do you put a signature on your texts as well?
---
You guys remember speed demon double the food and thirst drain when moving right?
---
i also heard that it tastes like crap.
---
You mean someone who somehow agrees with your dumbass? LOL your post got removed again. This is great. Keep spamming and embarrassing yourself ;)
---
I used to, but it became a but too much after a while. Then I couldn't turn it down so I now I hate it
---
No! Don't make people come here and taka my spots! Keep away from Morgantown. It's just low level scum here. And me. Unless you want to hire a room at my motel...
---
I love knowing I can get to you 😘
---
Are you all on console? Never met those on PC
---
I’m curious as to what the one called insulated does?
---
I just love watching dumbasses like you embarrass themselves over and over, but it's definitely painful watching how much of an idiot you are lmfao
---
Me too. I’ve looked on YouTube and online and can’t find any description.
---
I just grinded gulfers and I finally got one, but when I saw that he had dropped it the body disappeared before I could loot it. Bethesda you messed up
---
Well, then RNG has been having a field day with me.
---
I have done the dailies without fail since the quest release.
---
Perseverance is key I guess? :D
---
Most everyone playing the game has duped gear or weapons.
---
That’s why you put your vendors on a switch.
---
Stash your junk and go to Vault 76. Someone will claim your bounty in a short time.
---
Also for spam
---
Lmfaoo except this isn’t embarrassing and people are finding out about it now this is exactly what I want lmfao it’s up again btw bb 😘
---
Automated Surface to Air Missiles
---
That's hilarious! Why would they remove that?
---
They are selling them at player vendors fo4 6k 😀. My buddy got two.
---
Iv got the insulated aswell. +90 energy resistance with 30 carry weight
---
Dude, everyone knows.
---
Yup yup, wouldn’t expect anything less from you bb ;)
---
So put them in your stash? They have no weight.
---
Thanks! Do you have any other ones?
---
He's an idiot, he doesn't care. Just report the post every time he shares it 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
Lucky hole mine has tonnes of lead ore. I get on average 500 ore, which comes to like 1250 lead once smelted. The pain for me is getting acid to smelt it. I normally server hop for yao guai near mountainside bed n breakfast, but it's quite tedious.
---
if there are dupers, i'd take 900 and buy me a couple of stim paks, i always die, but play all day anyway, end up wasting money, so, daily, i hoard junk to sell for 1400 the use whats left for repairs at camp then drop  
---
but then bethesda said that they have an algorithm to detect was was duped.  
---
then the original person would have all but one, erased from inventory then what was sold to others would totally disappear.  
---
unless that last part isn't true???
---
Was there any new ones of those since sheepsquatch?
---
Not in the slightest.
---
If it's for the PS4 then the disk will work fine. The game will install and download the required files as it's mainly downloaded with a bit of data on the disk.
---
Likelyhood is the code that has been used was for 500 atoms.
---
How about being able associate you pandora or iTunes music through the ingame radio.?
---
Who thinks they should fix the game before adding more crap!!!
---
Put a stock on your pipe revolver and choose some rifle perks. My pipe bolt action sits at over 200 dmg.
---
Make sure you wear excavator armor when you mine though. Doubles your yield.
---
Nope, sneaky commies
---
I've also seen several there, especially around the train station. It's central on the map and the trainstation is often outside or very close to the edge of nukes. I think that's a good shopping district. If the train station is outside of nukes it's a very good place to go for scrapping, bulking, selling and scripping legendaries...
---
Oh no, cheap TSEs /s
---
Eh..
---
Not for me.. I’m on pc and the lag and frequent server disconnects, suck..
---
Testa di cazzo
---
Lmfao have fun wasting your time, I’m gonna make some coffee start the script and play some fallout, I’m curious as to how many posts you’ll comment on in the next few hours, me and brother are making bets 😂
---
Carry weight. I’m gooing for the line lead one now
---
Please report back
---
I'll just report it when I see it, cause it will keep getting removed. You're not special, Bethesda doesn't give a shit about you. Oh well 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
Yeah, building is kinda hooked. Sometimes it is wires, sometimes I get the “can’t place object” message ... exit workshop mode, go back in. It’s annoying.
---
Where’s this mine located at ?
---
They should just remove the ability to lock doors, unlike extractors/purifiers there is no point to it.
---
Think its just west of watoga. Google it, you'll find a pic of the map location.
---
Thank you
---
No probs :)
---
Hi FNrekt, great work!
---
@The\_Wolfdale: I have the Excavator Powerarmor and I even discovered a 4x mining output when I was looking for lead ores. Don't know if it is ore-dependent?
---
@FNrekt: I am still missing this information about mining output in the sheet. Do you have an updated list?
---
Thank you in advance :-)
---
Server hopping also drains food and water!
---
I went ahead and did a purge of all the game files... 53gb later, the pet rock was alive.
---
Where at?
---
Honestly they should keep them user Challenges, but also copy them to the "Data" tab in the Pip-Boy, and make a new heading for "Scouts". 
---
Would also make it so you can track them like quests.
---
That's pretty much right. The mapping tool can do wonders when it's used how I built it for. When people want new features it's a lot more work
---
&gt;I haven’t tried the prime receivers yet.
---
Almost nobody uses them. Prime receivers are only good for Scorched, the ammo is too expensive to make, and you can't toggle between ammo supplies (which is stupid). If Bethesda changed it so prime receivers could swap ammo types they'd be viable, but until they do, they're not worth it. Better to just have a good legendary than waste all your time on ultracite ammo (which you'll most likely burn up in a single Queen fight).
---
Ive been running a junkie build for the last 2 weeks and havnt had any disappear. Id be a little upset, especially since calmex, daddy-o, and daytripper are hard to come by.
---
They were attacked by a sheepsquatch
---
And also... a good way to earn caps is to take that lead and turn it into ammo then sell it on here. I make a killing selling 5.56 ammo.
---
 Scoutmaster here.  Did someone say knots?  (non Scouts may knot get it, lol). 
---
Needs more emphasis on the buddy system too.  Any Scout knows you don’t go anywhere without your buddy.  
---
And yes, we will be checking your book at the next review.
---
So you took over a workshop that flags you for pvp and now you are mad because you got attacked?
---
You actually have to click a button to agree and it warns you that you will be flagged for pvp. Nobody's fault but yours.
---
Wood floats
---
Doing God's work.  Someone PSAed this a couple weeks back and it's been life changing for me.  I felt so silly after hundreds of hours.
---
TBH I didn't know about thos but I assumed duping methods were still alive and kicking. (Way too many BE and AAE weapons out there) This hopefully will be fixed soon.
---
I don't think this should be posted here. Should just be reported directly to BGS
---
Don't they do Star Wars sets which features people getting graphically cut in half by plasma swords and planet-destroying superweapons killing billions of people?
---
True but I have to keep going inside to see what I need to do.
---
There's nothing even close to as good. Says something about how broken it was before
---
Also, just out of curiosity, how many addictions doyou guys have. I feel like im missing some
---
The prime receivers are totally worth it on the gun you take to fight the queen. People that do it all the time know this and often have prime weapons. I'm guessing you don't run the queen multiple times a day or even daily. Maybe you do, but they're not useless.
---
Also, different prime receivers require different fluxes for their ultracite ammo. Not everything runs on fluorescent. For instance 50 cal takes violet and plasma cores use yellowcake.
---
Anyway, prime equipped weapons can be a hassle, but when you're downing the queen in less than 15 mins, it seems worth it.
---
Even if you locked your doors, I can usually find a way into your CAMP.
---
And then I drop a communist propaganda flyer and leave.
---
Just to let you know I was there.
---
That makes better sense.
---
Last year you could overload the stash with the artilary glitch, alas you can't do that anymore.
---
The body in the faschnacht effigy were duper accounts
---
Exactly my point, Bethesda has many things out of balance.
---
Basically you're still standing there taking damage since it's not a singleplayer game anymore.
---
Anyone know the negatives of refrigerating? It's the only one I'd like to use, but need to farm those badges (got 4 right now, need 8).
---
I checked there like 3 dozen times. Go figure it's there after I made this post lol.
---
Yeah like i know you can’t pause anymore so you don’t like temporarily leave the world or anything? still just standing there lol
---
Same. I can often find a way into locked camps, it can  be surprisingly easy. I also leave something to say I'd been. Usually a Bobby pin, that seems fitting somehow. And doors open/closed to spook them.
---
But it can be easier getting in than out, short of fast travel. And even harder if you land up spawning in in the foundations.
---
I mean you knew you were near the cap limit and still had things for sale that would put you over the limit?
---
Pretty sure you forced the "not fun" on yourself.
---
If you don't want someone reselling your items, you're gonna have to price them higher. This is a fact.
---
Id also be interested in getting one if you can craft me one as well. Ive been searching for so long and assumed it was a pc only item.
---
congratulations on advertising this....we are so proud of you!!
---
I saw this by the random encounter near the war memorial south of whitesprings. Yea its the sheepsquatch lol.
---
Yep. Just awkwardly idling there. 😂
---
You're being sarcastic, right?
---
I thought demo expert no longer buffs explosive energy weapons. Am I wrong? I find mine also breaks super fast even with gunsmith equipped ranked up to 3 stars and luck of the draw on.
---
Is like to even know the positives, like what percentage longer does it keep food fresh? If it’s only 30% or something it might not be worth it.
---
My experience is that where visitors spawn point is where the CAMP device was initially placed and where the owner spawns is related to where the CAMP device is placed currently. Not close to it, but if you move that around so will the owners spawn, but not visitors.
---
Yeah, but Lego doesn't do war, and war... war never changes.
---
Well see, sir. I've been really busy with school lately. Haven't really had time to practice my lashing...
---
Thanks for the tip! I've been wondering which ammo sells best. What have you been listing it for?
---
thanks haha. this is the first online game i’ve ever played so i’m still getting used to other people seeing me fuck about lmao
---
tse tesla with 90% weight reduction. I know a tse pump action with 90% reduction got heavily duped in the past, but now the dupers are all crying that it can't one shot everything from across the map anymore so they might have moved on to duping other guns.
---
Theses would be my workshop tips:
---
1. Don’t stand next to the red workbench to claim it, you can claim it from anywhere inside its area, useful if your claiming an owned workshop.
---
2. Make a mental note of where the green boundary is so you know where you need to be to be out of pvp range
---
3. After claiming go outside the PvP area and wait a couple of mins to see if anyone tries to fast travel in and kill you while you’ve got your hands full with building items (I was 1 shotted once  while putting out a power pylon) then if the coast looks clear set your bits and bobs up.
---
4. Invest in the perk home defence when it’s available to build better turrets and the contractor perk when it’s available so building is cheaper and there’s less need for you to use your own materials.
---
5. Let turrets do the defending work, the enemies will be drawn to your generators and extractors so place them around these things so you don’t need to be there. You will still get the plan rewards even if your not in the area, just as long as your turrets kill the enemy waves.
---
6. Put locks on your extractors and only go back occasionally to collect then run right out of the area as fast as your legs will carry you so your not in the PvP zone. Also before fast travelling to your workshop to collect check the map and make sure no-one is around. Last night I had 3 white dots hanging out just outside my workshop for a while, I’m guessing they we waiting to see if I fast travelled in and would pounce, they gave up waiting and took the workshop in the end but I’d already cleared out the extractors so it wasn’t an issue.
---
7. Alternative strategy: go to the mothman museum and collect mothman eggs, make mothman omelettes sell to vendors for caps, go to player vending machines and buy the plans, I put duplicate plans in my machine for 10-50 caps as lots of others do.
---
Finally the world of fallout mirrors the real world in terms of there being mostly a fantastic community of players but at the same time a few a$$hats that would see you as easy pickings. Don’t let this out you off the game there’s a ton of fun to be had, good luck out there
---
3* wood pieces would be super rare since they don't drop.
---
Why are there so many posts about this. Its a workshop, you get a pvp notification before you take it. Its literally one of the only ways to organically pvp outside of survival now.
---
So what if he didn't build on the workshop, hes under no obligation to. Might be annoying but you opted into it. Also 9 times out of 10 it won't be an issue as players like that are few and far between. Game easily has some of the best player interactions as far as gifting and helping people go.
---
Feral ghouls and scorched would always open my doors to come and kill me while I was crafting inside my house. That's before I put turrets down. 
---
My front door is open now and I have a dedicated crafting shed outside my regular house, but I also have a few turrets watching things now, and my bedroom door is still locked. So I can still see the importance of door locks. I just hate that people will load up a vendor and lock it behind a door, just to taunt people.
---
Thanks! I will have to investigate the excavator armor then. I don't use PA too much, so I admit I haven't bothered with unlocking it yet.
---
Was waiting for this comment, thank you
---
An underappreciated source of lead is nuke silos. You can just go in, grab all the barbells, and leave without doing any of the launch tasks if you're not interested in that.
---
How aboit a yeah sure 1000 caps for a one star legendary weapon go jump in a fissure site emote.
---
i die so much, so all those stimpaks would be great for me. my aim is very poor, unless i use vats, otherwise i only use melee.  
---
and when i'm fighting i rarely ever pay attention to my health, so, i'd press Right on my xbox controller to use stimpak.
---
I want one so freaking bad I can't stand it. I need it or I will just die.
---
Why wait 3 days for any event when you can always go start it yourself. Fast travel, if it doesn't work, do other things in the area and go back later. You waited 3 days because you are lazy, and could have done any event several times by now.
---
Tips the responder bot 2 caps

Tips the raider bot 200 caps every week
---
Unpopular opinion: just imagine everyone on the internet is trying to be helpful or supportive. It'll make you happier.  Usually wrong, but happy.
---
You got a point there, but the hassle must be more rewarded is my opinion.   
---
I use a prime combat shotgun, I was not impressed by the prime receiver vs hardened receiver.
---
Yep, I've used fast traveling to accelerate fermentation too.  
---
Fast travel also affects food spoiling.
---
It was scrapped. Probably.
---
5.56 and shells sell best for me... .308 too, but that takes ages to craft a decent amount. Can easily sell 5.56 for .75c a bullet. So if you craft 10k, you can sell for 7.5k. And if you're on xbox, I can craft you excavator if you have the mats :) But I'd advise you do the quest so you can make your own ha
---
I burn through 1-2k .50cak rounds on the queen each time. Couldn't imagine grinding for that ammo
---
It's been an issue for the last 3 patches now!
---
Food spoils, no matter for what you intend to use it for. This would make no sense.
---
What you mean is: Please give us a refridgerator as vendor station, so that we can sell food and drink and ingredients.
---
I'm sad to say that I'm guilty of not really selling any great items. I mostly just want to mark my different characters CAMPs so people can come and look at them. I have sold some stuff but it's just small stuff. The items are themed to what place it is. My bar sells most of the alcohol and some snacks. My motel sells some food and drinks, but also toothbrush, toothpaste, toiletpaper, and stuff.
---
Welcome to Fallout 76 where duping and glitches are common. If you didn't knot that already please come back to reality. Bethesda isn't fixing anything. They just tell lies to people.
---
Also I see pretty crazy prices on ultracite ammo
---
Sharing how to dupe isn't helpful at all but okay sure lol
---
Never going to happen in game due to royalty issues.  If you want that set up a discord and do it on your own.
---
No, use chameleon armor and hide somewhere if you gotta take a piss.
---
how did you know this was the entire reason i was asking 😂😂
---
I had to go and mine deposits but there’s 3 at the Tyler dirt track and one at bogtown, I also did 2 breach and clear events that gave me silver ore so a combination of all that eventually got me the badge
---
They already have the plastic buckets, some costumes, and Halloween candy from the monster mash event in Watoga. They could easily make some sort of Halloween event for next year.
---
Lmao everone wants this
---
because initially fanrage was at having their solo destroyed and having to share servers with d bags. private servers were promised but not right away. and frankly if it weren't for 1% of the current population 76 would be amazing to play solo. especially if you could make it persistent like in ARK.
---
I used Farma farm since the release of the game, because I'm I hugh horder! 
---
After 150h gameplay, I learned,  that you actually have the press search in the container.
---
Congratulations its a hard grinde to get
---
Sadly, I am on PC. I think that will be my goal today.
---
Ah yes breach and clear, good shout!
---
workshops could be awesome but then " der leEt pVPers" jump in and fuck it up.
---
I sell them for like 100-150c. The plans are lootable daily on each new server if you have the key. I pick this one up and the x-01 quantum daily to sell. PS4, so let me know if you want one.
---
It does, it's just been nerfed to death. And if that's the case, it should no longer take up 5 points... but thanks for letting me know gunsmith doesn't really make a difference. Guess I'd better start stockpiling crystal and aluminium 😪
---
Feral ghoul!
---
I've been doing this as well, but slightly different. I like to travel to people's camps, and I've noticed (especially among the lower levels) that they haven't done the Excavtor Quest, so I make them a PA station. I dont charge or anything, I just build it and poof, I'm gone.
---
Also, I just.kinda sell whatever I have on me for dirt cheap. Don't get very many visitors (I'm in the corner of the ash heap), but when I do they usually buy at least 5 or 6 things, it's quite interesting.
---
&gt;did other things get duped
---
There is a duping glitch. EVERYTHING is getting duped
---
Build a bridge out of her?
---
Possums scout badge not the tadpole.
---
You need a zealot's to be a scorch killer. Hunter's is the wrong prefix.
---
I am too. GT profshade2
---
I did say you'd usually be wrong,  didn't i ;)
---
Big Iron?
---
Wot
---
Nah I'm definitely not wrong here 🤷🏻‍♀️😂 you're just as dumb as OP damn
---
I read something else, a *scorchbeast* is an *animal*.
---
Can confirm that orbital strikes still work wonders on camps bro's. 
---
Don't think you're gonna get away with trying to sell a non legendary raider arm piece for 700 caps lol.
---
No one at all :
---
u/duuudewtff : DO NOT BUY FROM DUPERS YOU ARE LITERALLY ENABLING DUPERS TO DUPE!
---
*Yet exposes where/how to dupe* 🤦🏽‍♂️
---
While I completely agree with you you're not going to find much love here, the majority of people here are min maxing their biulds and they're not really here just play the game have fun
---
Well that’s ignorant of you
---
I’ve been to the event spawn every single night cycle I have played actually
---
And it took three days of playing for it to spawn
---
Path to Enlightenment. Finicky spawn rate. But thanks for the flaming pitchfork enthusiasm you have there
---
*finger clap*
---
There's *sooo much* underpowered shit in this game. For example look at all the cooking recipes!
---
Uranium fever is a good way to get at least one legendary and a decent amount of ammo and materials when scrapping all of the weapons and junk from the mole miners. 
---
Wes-Tek seems better, but I prefer killing things within 3 or 4 shots. 
---
White spring seems to be good when it’s nuked. Even when it’s not nuked, there are still plenty of ghouls that will spawn, and will usually get you at least 2 legendaries per run. You can obviously get more.
---
I read that the robot will self destruct rather quickly.   Its usually not any player killing it.
---
Praise the lord and pass the ammunition is a great song. It fits Fallouts theme well too, considering it’s an anti communist song.
---
But what about drops though? Will it be good if people just get chances of getting legendary, or everyone just gets one regardless of the level?
---
Read my post again... you clearly misread
---
Haha, yeah you’re so right.
---
Just piggy backing on your post lol. I do like the sorry emote idea.
---
Wasn't this fixed today?
---
I read something else. Who knows, then?
---
Lmaooooo true that my friend
---
Not once you have the tnt key #7. Get the key once and you can claim the plan anytime you want just by going back to the bunker. I get it daily and sell it dirt cheap
---
Hardest part about it is getting springs for the legs. Again, yao guai are the answer, they drop 5 to 8 each time. Mountainside b n b again is the answer ha! Once you spawn there, head down the road til you get to a broken bridge overlooking a little valley with a crashed train. 2 spawn there everytime, just keep server hopping and repeating til you have enough :) mole miners and deathclaw are good for black titanium also.
---
If you tend to sell more weapons, people will start buying things. It annoying because I’m trying to sell my surplus of useless, to me, armor that’s either 2 star or 3 star.
---
That is some professor chaos level evil.  I like it.
---
He's more parasite than man. That's them talking
---
Apparently I still am since it looks like you called me wrong for saying sharing ways of duping isn't helpful lol
---
Nice. Thanks for that. Does it still let you scarp even if your over limit? I didn't notice and last I checked two days ago I was close to 800.
---
Nothing in that video to suggest he is cheating. You were just VATSed down. Also it wasn't a one shot, it was several shots from what looks like some sort of auto pipe rifle, with each hit taking 15-30% from you. The comment by a viewer in your survival clips video gives good advice, clearly an enlightened individual. You would have needed to be invisible with a stealthboy, or kill him from sneaking so he needs to hit you once manually before vats works to get a melee kill on a pvper like that. Taking melee into a gunfight is always tough, especially on pc where people can aim well and quickly.
---
3? You are so lucky. I go to Prime regularly and maybe one spawns. I need those damn Prime Handmade plans and I mostly get Ultracite Knuckles plans...
---
i hope they ban you too...
---
Just eat some flux 
---
Dine expensive and you will be just fine
---
Do you drink the flux or do you eat it ?
---
If it just stamped your username it could work?
---
Shhhhh this doesn't happen. No need for alarm. In fact I've never noticed this ok.
---
Your reading skills are weak
---
War is literally in the name of it though... Star WARS
---
I appreciate you trying to make Bethesda aware.
---
But you need to take this post down. Please
---
At 95% to hit!
---
The wandering protection vendor sells it, and he can spawn all over I think, although popular locations that people server hop are down the road past the bus at lady Janet's soft serve, and outside Charleston station, and further up the tracks on the bigger red bridge that straddles the river. 
---
I came upon it randomly, and haven't seen the coat since, but got a couple of other cool bits.
---
Just got to server hop like mad mate!
---
Thank you so much!
---
I mean, "The Prydwyn is my Waifu" has a certain ring to it.
---
How are you finding your first online game?
---
Maybe they do it on purpose as a Possum. Frog in a jar anyone?
---
There sadly is a very easy repeatable dupe they brought back with the new patch
---
I used to like putting my camp near Deathclaw island, but I kept spawning in the river and getting diseased
---
Yeah, it's better to kill her quick, but at least the violet flux is where she is. Not much more of a grind than making the regular ammo if you've got a good team. It'd suck solo, though.
---
This might explain it for me. I've been doing way more fast travelling recently. Thank you for clearing it up. Don't feel as crazy now lol.
---
It is supply and demand. Personally I can't be arsed to sell stuff so I find a low level character who is selling and drop all my spare plans ammo for them to sell. I don't need the caps. Even gave a t51 jetpack plan the other day.
---
you actually craft ultracite 308 rounds in 4 times quantity compared to normal ammo, which makes prime hunting rifles and lmgs almost better in prime. The lmg is a bit of an ammo hog, so it really doesn't matter what ammo you put through it, it could chew up 5mm and 50cal if they let it.
---
This is a good price I just bought both Nuka Paints for this price and I'll probably never use them.
---
So you get killed after claiming a  workshop and come crying to reddit, so typical.
---
I've been going into sneak mode in wherever I find a bathroom.
---
Done by the European branch.
---
I had to keep my floors over the dish cause if I don't, when I log in it'll spawn me up top, but without the floor rendered and I get to BASE jump without a parachute.
---
Thats +90 rad resistance.
---
then there are refrigrator, which gives 60% slower spoiling food (there is 3rank perk which gives 90%)
---
and that armored which gives +90 all damage resistances.
---
You had me at Gaming Justice Trolls :)
---
I have to mute the tv when I shop.  I normally play without music because it’s so distracting- I’ve bought almost 1000 atoms worth of crap I didn’t want because of that stupid music and how badly the purchase/preview is set up.  Muting really helps.
---
I played 50 levels on my first character without realizing it.  Finally randomly noticed the search choice and did a faceplam, like wow...  duh.
---
The chemist badge is glitched too.  At least it is for me.
---
I love it and even bother to browse a bit just so I can use it as a mood pick-me-up.  lol
---
Yep. And two others. One by West Tek and another that's angled (where my camp is).
---
I’m really love this game but i prefer to do my own thing most of the time. Joined a team but didn’t really enjoy it so excused myself and have been playing solo ever since. But it is nice to have sweet little encounters with other players and help each other out sometimes. Really enjoying the new update with player trading. it’s so nice to go look round each other’s camps and stock up on supplies. And i love seeing where other camps are on the map so i know where my neighbours are lol. Still don’t think i’ll be playing in a team though i prefer to just pass through
---
They are bugged, because tehy don't drop from deathclaw, but it is true, you can find them in random cointainers.
---
No matter where I place it, I and they respawn in a random position!
---
Well, I have unyielding build and have a quite high carrying capacity (110 lbs delta), so if capacity from LVL50 backpack (60) will be cut in half to fit the refrigerator that'll keep my food 30% longer without spoiling I'll gladly take it - I have no space in perks to use "Good with salt"
---
3 Scorchbeasts, you lucky person you!

Happens when another NPC of the same type in the area takes his spawn ID. Happens all the time in Watoga.
---
put them all in your stash they dont weight nothing, it is also a pain if you are trading with someone, i hate having to look all off them notes before I get to the plans or recipes
---
This can happen by accident though. It's just a simple QoL request
---
)
---
You're saying the resource collectors at like workshops are giving you scrap? They always give me ore...
---
I did that to my buddy. I got a good laugh out of it.
---
Listen. Plans are everywhere. Folks give them away. All the player shops sell them. Resources are everywhere. You don’t have to claim workshops to get resources. If you feel you must go this route, go in with the understanding that you may likely get killed, annoyed, etc. There are other avenues you can go down.
---
I have the opposite problem where I loose the set bonus, and only get the boost from the calibrated shocks!
---
I had taken the locks off my doors because I realized how much fun I was having taking looks around other players camps and getting inspiration for future camp builds. It's not like anyone can rob our house anyway
---
you took the risk...
---
I totally foresee them upgrading the cap on gear to 60 maybe within a year.
---
This would allow everyone to re-grind for the new top tier gear.
---
Weird, gonna have to check now as I had the workshop with 3 silver deposits up in the NE Corner for a few hours yesterday, collected loads of silver but had no ore to scrap.. its the only one I haven’t done from that challenge..
---
Just *everything* should be able to be sunk. It's horrible placing stuff on hills. Most importantly crops - razorgrain on a hill looks so bad!
---
I had this happen to me a while ago. Im pretty sure i fast travelled to another location. Quit game. Went back in and it was OK.
---
It is "muzak" lol.   Works too!  I like it.
---
Yw
---
Eah it's always random and usually under the floor!
---
You can tame a scorchbeast, so it’s certainly an animal.    
---
Zealot is for the scorch, you can use anti-scorch receiver for them.   
---
It’s confusing but it says Scorch**beast**, right? 😉
---
I also didnt 100% follow, but what i got:
---
Shady organization wants to catch the sheepsquatch. They hire unstable genius*? van lowe to do it.  He builds a robot to attract it. It kills him and escapes. Shady organization doesn't like failure or loose ends. When van lowe doesn't show up for meeting they send wolfy to wack him and his handler bo-peep. Wolfy finds both are already dead. Wolfy finds out big scary robot monster is loose and dies trying to kill it. In order to do that they set up a beacon which happen to attract all them explody-bois, and the pylons to take down imposter shields. 
---
Something like that.
---
They’re saving power for you :) how kind
---
I'm actually a little scared to try it again so I'm gonna wait a bit before I do. I don't have the patience for it right now @\_\_\_@
---
I tend to bulk steel then sell it at a vendor. Doesn't get you much but its a steady cap supply
---
The t-shirts are already selling themselves.
---
I am not sure if you noticed but besthedia isn't doing a great job programming this game and there being massive bugs shouldn't exactly be shocking at this point.
---
You dare insult a legend of the game world?
---
And Butcher's Bounty

Still the best armor

Or assaulting patrons who bought junk. Had one do that tonight. He got a handful of Nuka grenades. Not my fault they tore down his walls in the process.
---
Ditto.
---
It’s just not relevant to the topic there are plenty others where you can go complain about your subject #letpeopleenjoythings
---
Your CAMP arrival location is a function of the location you came from and the position of the CAMP device. I can't say how but they're related
---
What? Where? How? What is this??? I need it.
---
No, no
---
Yea, I was kind of under the assumption that fallout was a post apocalyptic nuclear wafare rpg shooter INSTEAD we seem to be getting "BETHESDAS ONLINE FURRY FEATIVAL" with a 50$ reqard for whoever can take a hundred photos for a hundred days of a hundred things , fucking stupid . This shit has strayed so far from fallout used to be , it's upsetting
---
Dude...not cool
---
Nope, well maybe if they removed the atomic shop.
---
Luckily you can buy back your items for the same cost if you don't exit the machine.
---
His POV was that the player base was being split too far apart and that a fractured player base would shorten the life span of the game.
---
Happy to help mate. Good luck :)
---
My group kills the Queen constantly and we probably burn between 400 and 1k rounds depending on how many people we have.  If you have the right perks and the group can share it is cake to kill her and then gather flux afterwards if needed.  I'm sitting on about 90 stable violet at the moment. I just craft ultracite ammo as needed. If you stay and collect after the fight its easy.
---
Problems appear when they dupe weapons etc. that can't be stacked, as each item in the game has stats attached to the object.
---
All items have a quantity attribute btw, even the unstackable ones like weapons etc. it's just always set to 1.
---
Since you might be off killing mole miners to get black titanium for your excavator armor, try Blackwater Mine. If you clear it out and sell all the guns and gauntlets and glowing blood you get (you'll be over-encumbered for just a bit but you're right by the train station), you will pocket a fair bit of caps. Plus you'll get the black titanium and some aluminum from the other stuff you scrap off them.
---

---
He is a real life quiznos commercial thing.
---
Only bulk lead and aluminium, the rest doesn’t change weight, try and keep a steady collection of 300 of each materiel that you’ll need for repairs, scrap items you intend to to keep for decorations as you can always find them again later and usually in the same spots so make a note of that, if you can, find 2* Armour with +1 Strength and/or Deep Pocketed to carry things from your stash you won’t drop at death and can keep out of the way like named equipment and gunpowder if you use guns.
---
they are duping the best items, serums should be fine. A couple hundred caps vs. 25k per item isn't worth their cheating time
---
I love this idea! I am really holding out for Halloween event as it’s my favourite holiday. Maybe some cool new CAMP decor, outfits and weapons? Even recipes would be cool. Take my atoms!
---
If I remember correctly, Bethesda showed up at last year's Bridge Day.  It would be a great event, just remember to bring your power armor for the bridge jumping.

I like the music.  Just not the volume of it lol

Crystal is easy to farm. Take your excavator set and some acid to Lucky Hole Mine
---
No absolutely not this isnt a kids/toddlers game ffs grow up and suggest something useful.
---
Same for me. I can't get any of the shoot animals with syringer challenges to count
---
Ohhh, that makes sense. Yes, we need these at camps.
---
This got me the first time. Didn't understand why we failed, as I looted all the dry stick I could find and the bar didn't grow back.
---
Nice! Thank you so much.
---
You are?! God damn, another completely imbalanced challenge...
---
Awesome I didn't know these worked there Thanks

In the game's database

L80 SB and (L68) radscorpions - they have been the hardest to kill so far.

Mireluck quesns are second

L82 Melee fighter.

There is something very satisfying about taking down a legendary sheepsquatch with a switchblade :)
---
It's not ignorant, its assuming. I go to the palace of the winding path and have 0 issues spawning that event. I assumed you were talking about campfire tales or encryptid. Sorry for assuming, but I still have had 0 issues doing events. Especially not 3 days of issues.
---
I want to play with fallout plushies
---
Bc ya know? FALLOUT!
---
They changed it so you cannot tame a scorchbeast last patch, did they not? This is what I read. I didn't look into it, but I did see they de-animaled some other things like deathclaws and radscorpions. I'm not an expert, though. I'd have to go back to patch notes.
---
One of things that make me smile while i was grinding badges like soulless robot.
---
I guess so, I've got three badges now, and not one of the Possum challenges completed yet.
---
I finally found a nice place.   Always fast travel in on the flat ground.  Many times before my fast traveling home involved mountain climbing or scuba diving.
---
Wait Radscorpions are in the game?
---
Thanks. In regards to decorations, what do you mean exactly? You can use stashable items as moveable items/decorations via camp?
---
Looks very suspect. If you were a Duper, which seems to be the case here, you’d have to be pretty stupid to have them all on sale at once so anyone can see it and report it
---
I saw this at an unmarked Red Rocket south of Valley Galleria, I nearly bolted fearing it triggered a Sheepsquatch to spawn until I realised its been too long without being attacked while witnessing this encounter
---
Holy shit I want that!!! Take my upvote!!
---
Don't lock extractors leaving them unlocked removes the reason for someone to claim the workshop who just wants resources.
---
Agreed. Camp placement is still very frustrating (for lots of things)
---
Made the same mistake 3 times in a row lol
---
*finger claps with malicious intent*
---
I always try to help any lower levels I come across.  I'll drop some stimpaks, radaway, and I carry a couple extra treated marine wetsuits to drop for them, as well as anything I may have picked up that they could use.  When I started playing, higher levels were killing lower levels for their junk...I was level 5 and had a level 200+ keep hunting me down &amp; killing me.  I swore I wasn't going to be like that when I was a higher level!
---
I tried it with blanks and with modded barrels, no luck unfortunately.
---
Do you have to get a certain way through the backpack quests to start the campfire tales event?  Was looking out for it this weekend and never saw it.
---
How much does armored put carry weight down?
---
I have my camp at a lead ore resource, put an extractor on it, and every time I get back to camp I get 14 lead. 
---
Its not as much as when you're actually farming for it, but if you just need a bit to keep ammo up, its good enough. 
---
Use an interactive map to find such a location, like:  
---
[https://fo76map.com/](https://fo76map.com/)   
---
You can also do this with a lot of other resources, if you just want to get some while doing other stuff.
---
Yes, currently the impression is, you can tag items in your stash for display, for now in display cases in 2-3 weeks and hopefully after that manual placement like OCDecorator from Fallout 4
---
I had someones camp literally spawn on me while I was exploring. Ended up stuck in a wall with the camp owner nowhere nearby. Managed to get free somehow after a minute of jumping and wiggling about. It was still annoying that this sort of thing can happen though.
---
I perused a couple player vending machines over the weekend....
---
Ran across one in the forest...somewhere along the straight line between camden and top of the world.
---
Had small quantities of the flux you are seeking (and hardened mass) @ reasonable prices.  
---
Did not see the high-rad fluids, though.
---
Flux?  I'll grant it's annoying.  Whitesprings is nuked on maybe 1/10 servers at any given time.  After that your down to nuking the area you want plants from when needed.
---
If I buy a lot from a camp or even if the camp is really cool, and it's a reasonably low level player who doesn't already have it, I have offered to craft the owner a set of Shielded BOS Underarmor. This of course goes over much better with the really low level players who benefit the most from it
---
Unless you have perfectly flat ground, that might be an issue.  At least they daisy chain together.
---
The dupera aren't the ones crying.......
---
&gt; I'm not mad
---
*acts mad*
---
Same. I even completely the hunter challenge for killing a yao guai with the syringer. It counted for hunter, not for chemist lol
---
That's good for you and your customers. If I want another plan, not having the key, I have to server hop until I find both the doors open and the plan still there / respawned. So they are worth more for me, because I invested more of my time.
---
Normally I would just go get the key, but the hidden quest walkthroughs dissuaded me from doing it.
---
Note that the stat changes vary depending on what level the backpack itself is. The ones listed below are the changes for mods applied to a level 50 backpack.
---
* Armor plated: +91 damage resistance. -30 carry weight.
---
* Lead lined: +91 radiation resistance. -30 carry weight.
---
* Insulated: +91 energy resistance. -30 carry weight.
---
* High capacity:  +60 carry weight (stacks with the pre-existing bonus for a total carry wight bonus of +120). -60 to both energy and radiation resistance.
---
* Refrigerated: Slows down the degradation of perishable food items in your inventory. -30 carry weight.
---
Whoever this guy is you're describing, he sounds like a cool guy.
---
Have you tried taking out demo expert? It's not simply 60%.  It's 60% of the 25% of ezplosive. 5 points for like 15 damage can be used way better right now.
---
"Red Chinese Communist will FAIL"
---
Player vending is fun. I'm enjoying learning what sells and how to price my wares
---
But if it records your GT then I suppose it would stop people being dickheads to a certain extent for fear of getting reported and banned?
---
My mate has on the X.  I don't have them anywhere near as much on the s but the performance ATM is making it almost impossible to play.
---
Or, you can do it like me and exit the machine and then go "...wait, did that just say MAX?"
---
Thanks! Finally
---
🤫😂
---
The kids having fun don't be a c*nt
---
If they let us pay in caps, sure.
---
Brave theory, but still just theory without evidences.
---
Yes, this... why doesn't the music follow the music slider audio settings?  
---
Actually I have issues with all the audio in the menu being ultra super loud compared to the rest of the game, even when the master and sound volume is at max.  Anyone else have this?
---
i found out that singing Rupaul‘s „you betta work“ before launching the game helps sometimes
---
I did actually launch one there recently, but couldn’t find any violet flux anywhere. The most efficient way I’ve had luck with was killing the scorchbeast queen, but even that only grants 1 or 2.
---
I forgot to mention caps, a good way of getting them is super mutants. Mutants will often have a couple caps on them, and if you run places like huntersville or west tek, it can add up into the hundreds. They also drop a lot of assault rifles, which sell for quite a few caps at vendors if you can carry them
---
I have to admit I thought that this *might* be the case. Either that or they implemented a tracking system and wanted to test it out. 
---
Then I thought about past version control issues and figured it was just them screwing up again.
---
Thank you! I've only just recently come back, I didn't know about these sites. Much appreciated.
---
How about some "real" West Virginia events like "NASCAR Mondays?"  Everybody gorged on testosterone from watching car racing all weekend takes it out on the world in the early morning drive to work.  ;)
---
It's a Reddit feature known as flairs, if that helps
---
I bought it, it shows as known. But when I went to crafting, it doesn't show that I can craft the high cap mod. What gives?
---
It’s weird how things get overlooked when the patches are released logically at least the Yao Guai part should have worked.
---
One person has been banned
---
The meta players who buy all the duped junk then. I don't see them as any different. It's a two step process, there are people who dupe and the people who enable it. Both are equally guilty imo
---
I keep looking for a term for these people, Gaming Justice Trolls is perfect!  Thanks!
---
you've wasted 20 seconds of my life I used to read this worthless post...
---
Is this what you want your kids reading?
---
Can we not like.... Spread how it works?
---
Well I DO expect something nice for July 4th.
---
What the fuck are you on about ?
---
Very small rocks
---
I see what your saying and when it comes to water, general mats etc it’s not a prob but I only take a place and put an extractor out if I really really need the item it’s dispensing as I don’t care for p.v.p. I live in P.A too so I’m kinda reluctant to be sharing fusion cores with anyone passing through on a cap stash run lol
---
Which platform are you playing on?
---
Alot of mines have rad barrels a few feet from a shower.
---
Yes bulk materials will cut down on over all weight. I bulk the heaviest first. I tried (no internet atm) to stick to ammo that I use. When I am low in my inv. I have more just have to find a stash box to re-up. Sell off some of the material you don't use too often. Not all of it tho you will kick yourself for that. My camp has two water purifiers so I try to have space for the water they produce. Watch out on tatos they will take over your stash.
---
how do you know if I got kids?
---
Basic backpack have +60lbs (lvl50) all mods reduces this to half, only carry capacity incease this 2x.
---
Billings Homestead (workshop) has a ton of wild razorgrain that counts as razorgrain when you gather it.
---
If you do the Queen event jetpack plans are common as I've given away heaps over the months
---
Ok, thanks
---
It is? The wiki says it has no crafting use
---
I like it too!
---
But I would like more pictures of the stuff they’re selling, specially ingame pictures.
---
For the joke to work you should be forced to buy them in a bulk xD
---
When did I say it was anything but? Lol
---
Hey, I looked up the notes. I don't see anything about scorchbeasts so I don't know where the other guy I was reading got his info from. All it says is:
---
General: Deathclaws, Mirelurks, Mirelurk variants, and Radscorpions are no longer considered animals.
---
Dev Note: These creatures were incorrectly added to the Animals category, and already belonged to other creature categories, like Insects or Reptiles. This change should prevent inconsistencies and double dipping that could occur with Perk effects that target certain types of creatures.
---
Weird because obviously reptiles and insects are animals, too, but whatever, Bethesda. I honestly have no idea if scorchbeasts have their own category or what. Wouldn't surprise me.
---
The real sad part here is the mole head it a static spawn so should be worth nothing I guess people don't know wear to look
---
Buy low sell high. That's how economies work.
---
If you don't want people to flip your stuff when you sell it. Price it high.
---
If we know how we can more easily spot people doing it. List those names here. Show Beth and community.
---
That would be almost machiavellic:
---
- Introduce a duping mechanism that is fairly straightforward to use but requires caps.
---
- Let people use their caps and dupe at their leisure but tag the metadata on the duped items.
---
- Once enough caps have been removed from the economy patch the loophole and remove all the duped items.
---
Too 'Dr Evil' too be true?
---
Somebody has been up five days on Meth again.
---
To get caps, I normally head over to Fort Defiance and sell all the straight jackets that you can find there. Each straight jacket sells for 25 caps each without the Hard Bargain perk. With the perk maxed, you get 43 caps per jacket. You get around 14-15 jackets per run.
---
Yeah every gun type honestly needs 3 damage perk cards, 1 card for armor pen and another for chance to cripple limbs. The fact that not every weapon type is on a level playing field kinda sucks. My favorite way to play Fallout 4 was a pure sneak/Deliverer build. I loved that gameplay so much.
---
If getting ap in combat is important to you I'd seriously consider grim reapers sprint.
---
This is a better caps sink than the 10% tax.
---
I would jump down a ridge blasting &gt;Atom Bomb baby&lt; while firing my two shot fat man
---
I'll admit, it is very likely too "Dr Evil" to be true, but I love the idea
---
Yes! This!
---
I wanted to move a desk slightly under the stais to make the chair fit better next to the pillar. Then I couldn't replace it. Not even at the same place it originally was. I know that if I remove the entire second floor I could probably make it work, but then I'd have to redo all my wiring... Nope! Ended up not having aan office no more.
---
Is this still working for you? I grinded it for about 12 hours yesterday (with about 20+ completed) and didn't get a single badge. I've only managed one badge just before the hotfix a few days ago.
---
I think there should be a better flag than just the regular orange brotherhood of steel flag. I would absolutely buy that for festivals
---
If its clientside, then it would certanly be doable.
---
If you post those names here you will get banned from the "no witch hunts" rule so best not
---
So every bat that comes out of the fruit bat factory has a wingspan of exactly 5'7"?
---
I don't, it's a hypothetical about your current and/or possible future kids
---
You don't scrap ore. You have to go to a chemistry station and go to smelting. You have to craft scraps using ore and acid
---
Too effective for Beth.
---
So because 1 game is good all looter shooters are good? The "good" to bad ratio for this 'genre' is so far off its pretty sad that this is even a trend. I'd even argue that Borderlands is a parody of looty shooty because there is SOO many guns that you get.
---
Sorry yes, I meant smelt, not scrap.
---
But baby, I'm *Ginsberg meets Eric Draven*
---
Holy cow that's nuts. Been meaning to grab some ballistic fiber lately too. Guess I'll be heading over there lol.
---
Can't argue with that
---
This is why taking the ability to destroy people's bases is a bad idea.  Lots of terrible architects out there.
---
Fair I guess. I just worry that more people will try to dupe rather than report the dupers.
---
Well, there’s the upper cap limit so I can’t imagine this hypothetical duping mechanism could cost more than that.
---
The push to spend caps has really been instituted through the fact that all PA plans are now available through vendors. Want the perfect setup? Be prepared to spend almost all your 25k for mods. 
---
Now we have vendors, which are also stimulating the economy. Want to earn a quick buck? Hunt for PA parts and then upgrade them with your recently acquired plans. Don’t have enough stable flux? Gonna have to go on some nuke missions.
---
The way to eliminate undesirable behavior is to 1) make the results of that behavior less valuable (nerf the products of duping, etc) and 2) make the products of desirable behavior more valuable - legitimate mods of highly prized parts are now able to be sold in the player community. 3) open up new legitimate avenues to obtain valuable loot (introduce the purveyor)
---
It’s all actually quite interesting to see how societies evolve...  I wonder if the Code of Hammurabi started out as a nerf of privileged behavior to allow the expansion of the first world empire.
---
I've wasted more than minute already, I won't be wasting any more, EOT.
---
I don't keep a ton of stuff to sell, I only keep one machine to sell just about every bullet or ammo I find. I put each bit of ammo up for 1cap ea, no matter the type, and make a few k a day. I keep a second machine for spare free items like plans and recipes I already have, along with decent weapons I find with good mods. Surprisingly, people only tend to take one or two at a time, haven't had anyone clear the entire free machine yet. Still good people out there.
---
Yup. About 20 levels ago, got cornered by a pair of L68s in WS.
---
Fortunately, the exact center of the sulphur fountain gazebo is just out of range of their stingers, (and they would not come in). 
---
BTW, they also burrow like mole rats, and are faster than I could move.
---
Though I would never get out of that one.
---
Yeah, as you said, it’s also a great place to get ballistic fiber and plastic if you go to the top floor. Also if you’re lucky, the top floor can give you a magazine and a bobblehead.
---
Hope we find out more about this organization eventually
---
Nie przeklinaj!
---
Based on tracking around 3000 drops, the game seems to consider what you have in your inventory, in your stash and what have you picked up recently. For example, if you usually keep Assassin's and Vampire's items, the game will drop the effect more frequently. Note though that you still have to farm a lot for a specific item, but less than the uniform chance (1:200). So buy a crappy/cheap bloodied item and stash it, then keep farming.
---
And promoting a buy/sell in game stuff using real world currency smh
---
Sometimes I likea camp I visit but there is nothing I want to buy, I buy something up to 50c anyway and give a thumbs up. Closest to tipping I guess.
---
That's because it is.. Aside from the 4 riders it's all just overpriced reskins.
---
I heard the music on roblox a while ago. pretty sure its stock elevator music.
---
I think its just the basic event they do. But i ain’t sure though.
---
Ive got Mine hooked up on my upstairs bedroom terminal and i can trap all visitors Who use my benches and then take a nap ! :D
---
(If a terminal is hooked up to the Same Power grid  as a switch, you can hide the switch and remote controll it from a terminal, ofc the switch operates the door)
---
Fun!
---
What is EOT? End of term? Eating out Trump? Easternmost outer terrain?
---
Very nice. I know where I'm looking first today lol.
---
.... the concept of “tallest man” or “oldest person” isn’t foreign to you, is it? Does that mean every human is that tall or gets that old?
---
The kiddie cornet daily can reward badges (the other quest and event can too)
---
I've been digging it too! except I landed a mutant Slayer 😭 +30 vats 👍 +1 agi (meh) a while back and dug it out... actually been enjoying the hell out of it
---
I looked up what you were talking about and found a guy explaining the glitch then look in my session theirs people doing it. Put on my stealth boy and threw 2 grenades
---
True, just gotta keep an eye on the number at the bottom left. I only have one character and have only done a bit of farming so I can't afford to be wasteful. I hit 1000 today and i've only got one or two things left to sell after that. I just wish the armour pieces weren't awkward amounts like 3 and 24, I think I ended up losing 10 or so scrip when I hit the cap.
---
I bought it for 100 caps from someone's camp. Only need the x-01 helmet and then i will have the whole set.
---
Happy I could help out another survivor
---
I wish purveyor would sell something nice i just sold both of my level 5 2-star from when i was still level 10-15 (now 24 though).
---
Truth always gets down voted.
---
Exactly why I thought 5’7” was too specific.
---
In the end does it even matter? Caps are basically pointless once you get above level 60 everything you need you just stumbled upon. Probably even before that
---
On the other hand caps are now valuable again.   Before all good rolls were trade only.
---
Prime relievers are totally worth it. It's somewhere 20-50% stronger against all scorched, scorched beast and sbq. If ur weapon does 200 dmg, not it does 240-300 DMG per shot against them. That's huge. Add in addrealine + drugs+ low health build and u'll be like me and able to solo the sbq. For example my bloodied prime galting gun will 2 or 3 shot a regular scorched beast
---
Are fists weapons op then? I havent had an issue with Deathclaws since I got one at lvl 30.
---
Generally all people selling godly rolled items (or rare outfits) for 30k+ caps are suspected of duping. Recently there is a lot of posts on biggest subreddit regarding trading. They wants insane amounts of caps for items that were 'trade only' just week ago.
---
Costs way too much to smelt though. Had near 1k from mining lead at one point and just gave it away ha! I need all my acid for lead and gunpowder
---
As a founder of the association for the internationalisation of the word kurwa I find your comment saddening :(
---
"Wabbit" season!
---
My bets on arkos pharma. They let a sheepsquatch loose and needed it back?
---
They couldn’t have done the april 9 power armor deletion without some form of identification.
---
This has been said multiple times, but a simple IP ban will not hold back someone who's experienced in "getting IP banned". Long story short, they're bypassable. Having your IP spread on the Internet isn't that dangerous, according to my research. Doesn't show your 100% ultra accurate living location.
---
From my research.
---
Dupers should be permabanned. Hardware banned, but that could also be bypassed.
---
Idk why, but if i see a robot regardless the power and level i just go “YOU’RE F**KING DEAD”
---
Take the beam splitter off. Problem solved.
---
This. So frustrating to be locked inside...
---
I had to wait 3 days because I don't have many friends on 76, but met a super nice random chick that got her rads almost all the way up and then stood in a shallow stream while a lvl 6 scorched shot her till I could revive. yay random awesomeness
---
Yeah I know, but I mean legitimate changes and buffs.
---
the problem is the people supporting shit shit.
---
turning on pacifist mode will prevent you from inflicting harm from accidental hits....
---
We all have our opinions. Fallout 3 and New Vegas ARE much better games, and I would bet money that most people would agree with me on that. I'm not sure how you can ignore the dumpster fire that the game is and the incompetence that is being displayed from the developers but you do you I guess.
---
Would you like to trade me some caps for the plan???
---
Yeah, I always FT away from vendor if I spawn in the middle of the wall. Once I spawned inside closed house - I couldn't get out (will become Wanted), so the only way was to FT to another player.
---
I was wandering and had a lvl 84 ask me over an area chat if i could help him with the swimming badge.
---
Hitting the Daytripper again I see.
---
&gt; I am surprised by the amount of work being put into Fallout 76
---
Its an online game.  There is no way they would have treated it like a "fire and forget" one off purchase game -- they have to have budgeted several years of development.
---
Ok, maybe more time has been spent bug fixing than they originally intended, but the whole continuing new content thing was announced when the game was initially announced.
---
Well out of combat the only important thing is sprinting to get somewhere. Or jet pack.
---
So everyones concern should be in combat ap regen. Even if not using vats.
---
The issue i have with grim reapers is that its a chance on kill. Now granted adrenaline and gun foo are on kill also, but they are reliable (it will trigger) rather than just a chance. They also increase dps so my action points per kill are less.
---
There will be more down time to use vats but only 35% of the time after a kill. And then it depends how much ap you have left. If almost none its great, if its after the first kill its bad. 
---
At the same time, moving points from agi lowers my sneak and my total ap, thus reducing my ap regen as its fixed at 3%. So i look at it as a 50 - 50 if i want it or not.
---
The perk card system is a failure in my opinion. Should have just given us a talent tree. Its a great system there is no need to ignore it.
---
Thank you for your useful suggestion. I'm far past lvl 50, but thinking about newer players who have hard won battles against higher lvl enemies and deserve something useful to them.
---
Are the things extracted worth the resources used when building up the power, extractors and defences? In the time I was there I probably was worse off in the end, other than maybe the fiber optics I got from the junk extractor.
---
I'm going to hell.
---
Possibly, how much?
---
I'm certain that they are.  I've confirmed a few known locations, using a cell map that was made by another acquaintance of mine. Each record has both the cell and the more accurate XYZ coordinates.
---
For silver specifically, they give scrap (iron too, but we dont have a challenge to smelt iron, so oh well). 
---
Using the excavator suit on world veins seems to work best; for some reason it doesn’t seem to provide a bonus on deposits (the ones you can put extractors on), just on veins (the smaller “rocks” scattered all over)
---
100c?
---
Didn't they Nerf white night like months before repair kits?
---
Just because a kid is saying it's good doesn't mean we should ignore the blatant ass fucking Bethesdsa is doing to its customers.
---
The company flat out lied about a product they were selling. Why would anyone want to defend that? Especially since they dgaf about the consumer.
---
Im at school till 5 o'clock so I wont be able to trade till then, whats you gamer tag?
---
Indeed it is.
---
Yup and no point in wasting caps to head back. I built on Twin Lakes there is an easy close FT point and my floor plan is wide open and unlocked to prevent players from getting trapped.
---
Make and sell? Define "make and sell".
---
If you legit make 24k stimpaks, good on you buddy, but how do you intend on selling all of them? They'll cost a shitton, and again, a SHITTON to make, because didn't you need 1 blood pack for a normal stimpak?
---
The quotation marks make it seem like you're highly defending duping.
---
And a normal stimpak weighs 1 unit ingame. You'd only have 23.2k stimpaks left in your inventory after somehow making all those stimpaks, and storing them in a stash with nothing in it, on 1 character. You'd need multiple mules just to store all of them.
---
Lmao
---
I completely ignore assholes now that they don’t do slap damage and can’t wreck my base. Pacifist mode is forever on
---
&gt; Not to burst your bubble, but the economy is currently crashing 
---
Who gives a fuck?
---
You’re familiar with the concept of raiders in the post-apocalypse, no? Some people just want to watch the world burn.
---
It spawns often at Lady Janets Soft Serve down the road to the west from that place, or more rarely outside the train-station in Charleston. It has rare outfits and two rare plans for locks (Cuckoo clock and Nuka Cola clock). It also has clean outfit versions of certain outfits that normally always spawn as dirty. And, most importantly, it has the Hunter's Coat.
---
The only plans I've found in the world are for food recipes (I get tons of dupes) weapon mods and the occasional armor. Plans in player shops are more than I can afford. I did manage to get some plans from the non player vendors at the railways but their camp plans only provide furniture.
---
If you are on PS4 I have an extra one for you
---
The family is just waking up, I have to make some breakfast, maybe after I can get on.
---
Falling into semantics there
---
You assumed without information (my fault for not providing), ergo, my comment regarding ignorance
---
And yes, this has been the only event I have ever had trouble forcing a spawn...
---
Im at school till 3 so i cant hop on till 5, if I could please have your gamer tag as to reach you to do the trade if you want to then that would be awesome
---
Absolutely! I'll be on tonight thanks :)
---
Correct! A friend of min often hold it while I drop and rejoin the server to refresh the inventory, and after just a few quick jumps it drops dead by itself.
---
Whats your gamer tag
---
Misinformation always spreads without fact checking
---
You want to mention that keeping all 3 pylons active during Encryptid is important?  Because a lot of players seem to stand around like clueless dicks or even waste time shooting at the ISS while it's invunerable.
---
Yes of course. PS4 preowned copies deff work.
---
Got both bear/syringer challenges to pop with a modded pipe syringer last night.  Cant get the wolf/knife one tho..(xbone)
---
Yes. You get one chance.
---
haha, nice touch Bethesda :)
---
So I can reach you
---
You literally asked 6 days ago in this subreddit if duping still existed but who gives a fuck?
---
Yup, I'm still using my lvl 25 Bloodied handmade because it's the best legit drop for my sneak rifle build -- almost lvl 100
---
No..... he’s not.  It’s PS4. No codes.
---
The jet will make you jittery
---
My house is also wide open, everyone is welcome and people usually visit the house after checking VM. Now, when griefers can't destroy your camp, I see no reason to close the houses.
---
I see where you're coming from, but I don't know any raider who would use salt the earth tactics on food, water, ammo and supplies. This was pure dickery.
---
It only happens at night, I’m betting. Did it twice this weekend, it was just a normal event on the west side of the map.
---
Forest: Eye of Cthulhu. 
---
Ash Heap: Skeletron Prime.
---
Toxic Valley: The Twins.
---
Savage Divide: The Destroyer.
---
The Mire: Plantera.
---
Cranberry Bog: Moon Lord.
---
Just rip off some bosses, pfft, nobody'll notice. If they do, slightly change the models. 
---
This post is not hating on Fallout 76. Downvote me all you want, but I don't hate Fallout 76.
---
No. I actually came across every single tape someone dropped in the overseer cache in Flatwoods and took them all again. Still it didn’t finish it.
---
Npcs
---
I was in 2 groups that succeeded at the start.  Since then *every* attempt has been a failure.
---
(Of course one of them was a failure because I got the notification the event started, and I rushed to it... and I was *alone*.  And level 6.)
---
Dig through trash for additional broken prosnap deluxe cameras, fix them, then put the new lens on the new camera. Keep the old camera with your other lens.
---
Don't forget Butcher's Bounty!
---
The best thing I did today was accept the team invite of a random level 72 and kill a scorchbeast attacking their settlement.
---
Turns out he invited random people to team. Just to help with the scorchbeast. Didn't even add me.
---
I was returning for a quest and was confused as hell. It says I need a key card but I dont have it and cant find it.
---
Charming!!!
---
Awesome :) having good gear early on is such a difference!
---
Repair kits suck it's not P2W if I can repair my weapon to 200% without them. The nerfs were to bring balance to the game we're mostly better off with them. Except for demolition expert that needs to be changed to a 3 point perk post nerfs.
---
The game as a whole is awesome I've never played a game for 250+ hours it's very enjoyable and I haven't even done much with the new quest. Seriously I just started the Biv questline.
---
Youtubers farm views by bashing the game that's it don't believe the crap they put out.
---
I have 19000+ rounds for sale, 307, 44, 556, Shotgun and Fusion Cells. Have the Bandolier Perk and the Perk for Energy Weapon ammo reduction. Played since the BETA and have picked up everything and have made as hell of a lot, It is easy A.F. to have more, which I do and those are the only ones I sell. Going to be dropping 9000+ rounds of .38.....HAVE no Idea why I am picking that up.
---
If you're the conduit you should focus on protecting yourself.  Of course you need to get at least one hit on the ISS , but don't go rushing into the fight.
---
THIS.
---
Or do keep your doors locked if you're fucking with people lol
---
Exactly but even locked doors didn't stop griefers they just destroy a wall to get in. I never saw a point in locking doors.
---
In short - bullshit - even after nerf I repair 1-2 pieces every run (1hour of farming). I've already got 20+ improved repair kits and haven't used it even once, no one wants to buy it (I sell them for 50 caps at vendor machine), so really see no reason to but worse version form Atomic Shop (it only repairs to 100%, while improved, loot from game, repair to 150%).
---
You haven't gotten bored? Did you forget yet?  
---
Because this shit is so boring endgame. Don't get me wrong, this game is good, but it's boring endgame. Getting good legendaries is very difficult (and borderline impossible), PVP is a broken mess which I won't touch until it's playable without a full set of armor that reduces damage and stuff from other players, and even leveling a lower level character is painful.
---
I’d actually like to use stuffed bears and toy rockets to put at my camp
---
If you are on PS4 - 
---
  My camp sits on an acid extractor - I've been putting some in my vending machine.
---
Also have several Wendigo teeth in the machine - (which you probably know scrap to acid)
---
Camp is along a road, northish if the /bottom/ of top of the world ski slope, east of the golf course - 2 story built on a power transmission tower.  
---
Just moved there this weekend, so its a work in progress :)
---
That's a good solution
---
When you come to the miner miracles quest your going to need black titanium so you’ll either need to kill mole miners or put an extractor on the deposit at George junkyard so it really depends on your needs. Someone who uses automatic weapons will be looking for acid to make gunpowder and smelt the lead ore from lucky hole mine in order to craft the ammo they’re burning through during things like SBQ fights. Junk piles are good for passively acquiring screws and springs. For me I just use workshops for fusion cores, acid, and junk piles for screws very occasionally . Everyone will have a different build and different needs tbh but when it comes to those fusion cores and acid it’s worth the resources for me if I have to invest my own and workshops come with plenty of their own materials. If it’s written in green (screws, gears, springs etc) it’s not coming from your stuff, but if it’s written in white in the build menu it means you’ve exhausted the workshops materials and it’s coming from yours.
---
It's expensive to make, but not crazy. I have 5k 50 cal rounds ATM
---
Can I get a RobCo ball cap while we're at it?
---
Only works if you have the pin visible for the player.
---
I bought it and I think it's looks great. Replaced my BOS knight captain paint job with it, no regrets.
---
I love this idea!
---
Driveinkiller
---
Painting it counts as modding FYI
---
I grab everything I find, brake it down for components, bundle it, and sell it to bot vendors. I also sell all the drugs food,  alcohol, and explosives (I dont use them).
---
That I did. My issue I that my only interaction so far with other players in this game is this one shitty action. If he had taken over my base and used it I would have walked away with a hot head but also a lesson learned. Do you want all the new players coming into the game getting shit on and insulted and than have everyone say, oh well that's just the way it is. It's not a good way to start a good relationship with new players that might give your game longevity.
---
I'm not here to cry about pvp and change the game. I'm here to ask if this is kind of behavior is what I can expect from everyone else. If I could at least talk to other players somehow instead of just flailing my arms like an idiot maybe this would be a non issue.
---
Thx
---
&gt;I want to hide one in the walls and drive everyone crazy.
---
now why would a cap themed stash box drive everyone crazy if it was hidden in the walls, and not visible? an actual cap stash would trigger the perk fortune finder and be an annoyance
---
i know, i mean i want bethesda to fix there Database and give us endless storage space for stackable items. Stackable items cant cause lagg, you would need to hire a special programmer just to make your Database as worse as humanly possible to make it work like this :D
---
Yes, but it doesn't help if you found a good opportunity for a photo but don't have right lens
---
I saw this, and at the same spot on another server 2 legendary Sheepsquatches spawned.
---
I literally just now realized this is a Beatles reference
---
Aaaand you ruined it.
---
I lost all hope in them after they canned Prey 2 because "it didn't meet their quality standards".
---
Quality standards.
---
Bethesda.
---
Pick one.
---
At some point micro-managing inventory becomes a PITA and is no longer a fun aspect of the game but some demented food/garbage simulator. Though I see a loophole where people might store stuff in vending machines to keep fresh, it would be much easier and player friendly to not have stuff in vending machines spoil. Perhaps a way to avoid the loophole is to make it so that spoil-able items, once placed in the machine, cannot be removed by the owner, or if removed by the owner, immediately spoil.
---
Dumpster fire to you! I have been an AVID fallout fan since the beginning and as good as the previous fallouts were, they are greatly overrated by the majority of the fallout community.
---
Fallout 76 is FAR superior in just about every way. 76 is a living, breathing, ever evolving post apocalyptic playground... The previous fallouts were scripted story books with subpar story telling that existed in a stale world. 
---
Now, the stale world and robotic like scripted story might be your bag of tea, but please try to realize that not all like to remain in the past with archaic single player RPG's that are greatly overrated. 
---
Games evolve and its about damn time fallout did too
---
If he's bumping up into the weight limit though, I imagine he might have a ton of materials that could be bulked and sold, because he's probably not going to come close to using them all. OP, I usually bulk my materials, and sell anything over 10. (i.e. If I have 15 bulk steel, I'll sell 5.) All you need to bulk is plastic, and plenty of that can be found at Watoga High School.
---
Yup, but it only starts if someone goes to camp Adams at night, if none goes there it wont start by itself.
---
The fact that it is a fairly common item to spawn in containers and that the devs have 'weighed' it as a cosmetic may be proof that you are on the right track with your approach :)
---

Nuclear winter 🌨️🌨️🌨️
---
I supported it by buying it out of good faith but don't plan on making any additional ingame purchases just due to the way they've handled things and some of the actions they took .. in my eyes they acted manipulative and shady at times and it just feels as though they were not ready for an always online multiplayer game .. they are best at what they did; single player rpg with purchasable downloadable expansive content.
---
All of that being said yes there has been a lot of nerfs and they started the gateway drug to p2w .. convinience is lovely word art .. anyway there are some perks which you can use like "Fix it good" and "Weapon artisan" which further increase the duration in which your shit deteriorates and I don't even use gunsmith or white knight cause I think they're personally a waste of perk points better spent on damage etc. It's to be expected though in this new age survival bullshit where every 20 minutes or so the "content" is you repairing shit or eating etc.
---
Alsothe game is fun is what it boils down to, the styles/outfits right now in the game are 90% silly and stupid( looks like they originally intended to go pvp gta style run and gun lolli crap ) but there is a growing number of immersive content/styles being added that can keep you invested in a character .. at higher level right now it's very repetative and grindy but they intend to add in new areas and content .. it's kinda like old school ultima online right now .. they kinda make you make your own fun until there's some dungeons and direction.
---
And finally if I were you I'd recommend your friend try it, get it at the lowest cost he can if he/she's not into this type of survival shit but it's not like an mmo everyone is used to cause again BGS just doesn't have the mindset right now it's easier/more effective and promotes solo play in a multiplayer environment .. but it's still a fun game to play for an hour or 2 every so often just like most games.
---
My camp is close to vault 76 so it's just a run away if you do get stuck.
---
yeah, i hate that, why don't people check if someone is at their camps before login out, happen to me a dosent times :(
---
I always check that if i need to server hop...
---
A little shit hella grindy
---
Not only a duper but an idiot, as if anyone would pay those prices, and if they did he wOuld be at over max caps buying any decent quantity... at least have reasonable prices if you're going to dupe, I hope he gets banned
---
This thread has over 700 upvotes and no one has asked for a Comrade Chubs?
---
&gt; Fallout 3 and New Vegas ARE much better games, 
---
As you said, we all have our opinions, so I won't really talk about my agreements/disagreements on this one.
---
&gt;  I would bet money that most people would agree with me on that. 
---
You've also got nitpickers, and those who can't decide. Personally, the story from FO3 was my favorite of the FO games I've played. I never could get into NV, but I loved the Old World Blues DLC more than most games, mainly because those robots are too damn funny. I love FO4 for the settlement building option. I love FO76 for its open world, all the new things it adds, and the C.A.M.P. system. Overall, I cannot really say one game is better or a favorite than the other, because every game is so vastly different from the next.
---
&gt; I'm not sure how you can ignore the dumpster fire that the game is 
---
What? There were plenty of FO76 fuckups but a majority seemed unrelated to the game itself (e.g. canvas bag fiasco). What makes this a "dumpster fire" of a game? 
---
&gt; and the incompetence that is being displayed from the developers but you do you I guess.
---
How/why do you think these developers are "incompetent?". They've done plenty to right the game, added tons of new items and gameplay, and have been exceptional at keeping in touch with the community.
---
^(I realize you may just be a salty troll, but I'm bored at work all day so I'll entertain you.)
---
Up voting for visibility. This is a bummer.
---
Agreed.
---
No idea why down votes are incoming. They literally lied about their product!? Why defend liars and frauds? They knew what they were doing.
---
When you say workshop supplies is that what the extractor has or is it like a cache of sorts?
---
Also, I'm not sure but does junk inside buildings and such come back eventually sort of like it did in FO4? Or does it change based on the world you join? I'm not sure if it's gone because other players picked it up before me or it has some sort of cooldown period for the player.
---
There are some bad ass pipe rifle out there, .38 isn't as useless as you might think.. And not that heavy either if I recall
---
Agreed......So sayeth the Bubba, and it was law....and as such, is beyond contestation!
---
Was it a t shaped camp on ps4 lol might of been me
---
Are you trying to look smart with a Fallout 76 hate post? This is a new tactic.
---
The launch was abysmal, that's obvious. They really handled the launch just awfully. Nuka Rum, the bag, leaking private data. I've forgotten about these, but they handled the launch fucking awfully.
---
But.
---
Hypothetical scenario.
---
Scenario 1. You're reviewing 76. The launch was abysmal. You're so biased that you give the game a -11/10 rating, just because of the launch.
---
Scenario 2. You're reviewing a new upcoming game that you seriously like. Your friends like it, all the cool people in school like it. You preordered it, played the beta. Turns out, they were offering a package that had a new cool ingame weapon, a really pay to win one, and the launch goes fucking awfully. Fallout 76 level launch or worse. With your current logic, you should be hating on the game 24/7 now. The upcoming game. And never like it again. But you still like it. You ignore all the abysmal pay to win shit. You love the game. +17/10, flawless. game of the year, best game ever.
---
It's quite obvious you haven't played Fallout 76 at all. You seem like another one of those "NEW VEKAS IS BETER" people. 76 is quite polished, but still has problems. Legendary drops are awful, borderline promoting duping. Assasin/sentinel legendaries. Even the mobs that spawn when another player visits your camp.
---
I wonder if this post made any sense.
---
And US Government Supply Requisition holotapes summon a "Santa" cargobot with presents for all the nice vault dwellers instead of the usual loot for the naughty ones.
---
Ok then, next time I will stick to it until get sth. from it.. thx fellow wastelander.
---
I just want tougher enemies. I can solo a mirelurk queen and take it down stupidly fast, i really hope the vaults have actual badass enemies.
---
I re-read your post and realized yours was more about running different lenses on the fly, I for some reason thought this was dealing with the quest where you had to mod a camera. I will delete my response because it is not applicable. My apologies.
---
I don’t have doors, so no problem for my visitors.
---
Wow, you are uninformed.
---
@17, you probably havent found all the vendors yet - as you have observed, they are scattered about the countryside.  (They are also all together at WS).
---
Theres a couple of travelling vendors that carry a variety of plans. (Graham, for one).
---
Meantime, caps to acquire plans will come as you explore, do events, sell stuff to vendors, etc.  I dont think I had more than about 1k caps at any given time until I was beyond L45.   
---
You'll get there.
---
Better dead than red
---
I believe prime needs a buff. The ammo is very expensive. Too expensive.
---
Water filters MAY be useful, like, JUST out of the vault, but late-game, with more resources available than ever, you can shit out industrial water purifiers like candy.
---
"Locked doors only keep honest people out"
---
I’ll have to try that. I love my camp location but it’s a hot spot for enemy spawns and my turrets aren’t getting the job done.
---
My vending machine keeps going offline minutes after I leave because they keep destroying my generator. Might have to move some stuff around because it’s super annoying
---
I see your dilemma. I'm not sure how well the ap regenerating perks stack at higher levels. In my own experience I saw a much bigger difference using the well tuned effect from instruments and drinks for passive ap boosts and using the points saved elsewhere.
---
Gun Fu is a must if you have a high ap build tho. Especially since vats now remembers where you were aiming. You feel like John wick when you clear an area in an instant. So fun.
---
That’s one of the worst wiki articles I have seen. If you are going to write about an event for an encyclopedia one would think you would mention the date
---
I'm guessing because people found a way to dupe using it
---
I try to nuke the queen daily. I have a berserker's gatling plasma that goes 61 damage in a hazmat suit. It does decent damage when spraying the queen (landed) and chips health off rather worryingly noticeably. Can't say it's better than prime, as I haven't tested.
---
I would just like to be able to place them on a foundation. It doesnt make sense that they have to be placed on dirt considering they are already on a cement block.
---
For violet you want the forest SW of SBQ.  Primarily those little clumps of trees outside the forest.  They have upwards of a half dozen ferns each, quick to snag a hundred or so.  Also a fair bit of crimson in the area.
---
My bane was cyan, for that there is a little crop ~ 200m west of pumpkin patch that nets 100ish in a couple minutes.
---
Nah...It's my least favorite music in the entire Fallout franchise.     
---
Does anyone know if there's a way to mute that crap without actually shutting of my speakers/headphones?
---
Hey is that Jimmy Hoffa?
---
I knew the event could reward badges didn’t know about the daily’s
---
Even a Payday 2 immortal python all-gun skin would be useful and the community would rejoice.
---
Bethesda ruined pvp so this is whats happening. Don't worry I'm sure they'll nerf this soon too and it will officially be a childs game.
---
I've started repairing people's turrets if I visit their camps, and they haven't locked up everything or aren't charging ridiculous prices.
---
I don't give a shit about the "economy" of buying and selling duped items.  I do give a shit about morons running around zapping everything at events with a horrible scrriiiit noise.
---
Stay crouched in sneak mode. If you stand you fail. Swim or crouch. Had the same problem until I googled and it worked.
---
I keep my front door locked so people stop leaving it open.
---
It wouldn't let me scrap over 150,it simply rejected the transaction. I have to buy all my stuff back and then figure out piece by piece to get the number dead on 150.
---
You only see the pump head, the water is drawn up from the ground.
---
I like dropping a brotherhood recon rifle lvl 1 and some .308.  Comes with a supressor and night vision scope.  For a lvl 1 its a pretty cool weapon to start with!
---
Beach boys is still there. I also would love new music unfortunately its not easy to just add new songs because of licensing. 
---
I day dream often about a in game radio station you can "take over" like a workshop that allowed you to upload your own songs and let any wastlander tune in and listen.
---
But Todd doesn't want fun, he wants *drama*. He clearly doesn't have teenagers in his house - those of us that do definitely don't need more drama.
---
I haven't done the quest yet but I was able to load a "Broken Prosnap Camera" into my Vending Machine yesterday.
---
Why share this? Spreading it?
---
Stop posting it
---
By the way -- fucking stellar work.
---
Damn, the one time someone should’ve a PSA.
---
haha I actually emailed Bethesda requesting it to be actually made because its so cool!
---
Lego does Avengers and other Marvel movieverse sets though and those literally involve interstellar war and millions of people getting killed off...
---
I've done it on first try without watching any YT clips with hefty time left?!?! I'm also on PC. I just got in the water, and moved right and then from one buoy to another (the closest one to another), ignoring all mirelurks. I've only changed 3 perk cards (action boy 3 and Lone Wanderer 4, both for AP refresh, and aquaboy to get no rads during swimming). Actually none challenges require running (for athlete) or swimming took me more than one try.
---
They nerfed one perk related to armor degradation months before repair kits. Was it related? Possibly, but it was just one of the numerous durability perks. They also increased durability on energy weapons and some heavy guns as well. 
---
I’m as wary of repair kits as anyone, but so far they haven’t done any of the nefarious things many were concerned about. Time will tell, but so far, no big deal. 
---
As for it being dead...anyone who plays the game can attest to the opposite. Servers are always full, there are clearly thousands of instances running...there’s nothing dead about it. Bethesda has announced a full first year of new content, the first leg of which is wrapping up now. They’ve stated they have more lined up for several years. It’s not going anywhere. 
---
It’s far from perfect, but the YouTube rage bait has been way over the top since the beginning, even more so now that the game is in much better shape.
---
Which involves the economy because everyone is getting these “scrriiiiit” noise weapons for 5-7k....
---
What a legend
---
yeah I've read the same thing and pretty sure I've done my best to stay crouched on the shallower bits around that particular buoy. 
---
it does definitely seem way more sensitive in that area compared to the others. there are other areas where I can stand and sprint and it doesn't fail me, but at that last one I try my hardest to crouch in the deepest spot and still can't do it.
---
Amazing. Guy hates dupers, then shows everyone how to dupe. GG
---
I gotta say some peeps are just lazy pleebs! No I am not gonna fuck up my camp just to place vending machines.
---
Since I have the best looking and most classy camp in Appalachia, I do not want to rearrange my camp so that the lazy dont have to take a few seconds to find a vending machine.
---
If you dont want to go to where I want MY vending machines, then move on to someone elses camp.
---
My machines are pretty easy to find and although they might not be as convenient as being in the same place as a mail box, they are still rather easy to locate and it blows my mind how many players ask me where they are.
---
Also, my stance has nothing to do with wanting players to see my whole camp, it's just where I want my machines because they look best there.
---
I’ve been playing since beta and have never had a mutation 😆
---
Put the GD description on the inspect! I don’t wanna go decipher government records and play the game!
---
Sorry man. Only thing I could think of.
---
Well, it'd be better than having those bags in the ocean I guess.
---
Tin foil hat theory bethesda made fallout 76 have microtransactions because Todd Howard is a reptillian and has to feed on small children which is quite expensive.
---
we dont really know who this Todd guy really is. Todd shows up out of nowhere and releases skyrim that makes a ton of money. This money is used to steal children why? so he can eat them. 
---
snakes eat one rat about one every week the size of snake to rat is comparable to the size of Todd Howard to a small child coincidence? Todd doesn't understand how things work and will say they just work this is because his reptile brain does not understand how video games work and thinks they are witchcraft and they can do anything so long as he says they can. Bethesda makes games by having Todd make up a game then atempting as best as they can replicating what he says because his lizard brain is good at developing RPGs. 
---
now that I have proven that Todd is a reptilian let me get to what he eats and that is children but kids cost money so they made skyrim, then they made dlc for skyrim, then they rereleased skyrim but one problem everybody owned skyrim so they made fallout 4, then rereleased skyrim. but nobody was buying their games and the dead horse they beat in the break room had already been half eaten by todd and used as a nest for his offspring. fearing for their lives they took the old spaghetti out of the break room fridge and used it to conjure a spaghetti demon who using dark magic binded fallout 4 with netcode from quake pro creating 76. The dark pact had been sealed and Tom from accounting had been sacrificed in return they had a new game and a way to satiate Todds hunger. They had to do more to keep this new game from being bought only once by consumers. Using their dark knowledge of the arkane they added the atomic shop a way to generate revenue so they could keep Todd from eating them all. Thats why we haven't seen alot of Todd recently hes too busy raising his offspring using our offspring.
---
Uranium fever too
---
Without knowing why they had to log out there's no way of knowing. Maybe their game crashed. You just really never know.
---
150 per day...1000 cumulative.
---
No worries, appreciate the response
---
I'm not sure, hopefully it gets fix in this upcoming patch.
---
You could put a prime receiver on that and it would melt her even faster. It'd just take ultracite plasma cores then. My buddy has a bloodied one that did a bunch of damage before he put the prime on it. Now it's just better.
---
I like the idea, because when I was a level 40ish I used basically only melees even tho my person is an all-around build (that uses power armor) and multiple times I was helping level 20s-25s clear places out and accidentally hit them. Lets just say I had 1000 more caps than I started with at the end of the week.
---
Netherlands, specifically, afaik.
---
Considering I worked in the video game business for over 5 years and personally know someone who was part of the development of fallout 3... I think you are the uninformed
---
Was that recently?
---
That would be perfect. I’d like that, too.
---
Not a bad idea - I also know that the hood of the red car in front of Whitespring is a spawn point. I could have him check both and hop again...
---
you don't need tourist anymore to get a camera, check you MISC tab, maybe you've already collected one, as it's now a random drop.
---
I felt like I was on crack reading this
---
I am only level 30 but il give my opinion. Never have any bugs apart from occasionally spawning inside the foundations when fast traveling to a player camp. The story is actually very good if you look and listen for it, it's just presented in a different way to the other games. Gunplay is fairly well done and quests are ok but can be a bit repetitive. The player community is generally friendly although I play solo mostly. Hope that helps
---
'Night' seems to vary a bit (or there's fuzz involved in the start time), but any time starting around 10:30 that you walk or fast travel into the zone, the event will pop up.
---
FYI, I haven't seen anything worth visiting for as far as drops (all 1-star in my experience), but you can get possum badges as a reward, along with the other event-specific things.  I'm up to 6 or so badges after 34875938 completions :P  (Yes, I tend to farm these things heavily when they first come out)
---
The broken prosnap is a just a piece of scrappable junk unfortunately. After you complete the camera quest, you can start to find a new type of broken camera called “broken prosnap deluxe camera” which is considered a miscellaneous item and doesn’t weigh anything
---
Server hop till you get it I i7at stay in the camp and Server hop
---
&gt;I had over 7000 fusion cells for sale. someone just happened to buy some, it popped up that they purchased over 7000 cells, and all of a sudden there's no more fusion cells in my shop, and I've only received around 2000 caps?
---
Your video doesn't show any of that. It's been reported that there's a bug where it shows an incorrect today when someone buys part of a stack. With that in mind, your video shows that you had 1k caps, someone bought *some unknown number* of cells, and then you have 3k caps. We don't know how many cells you had before and after it what they were priced at. Maybe you did get shitted, but we certainly can't tell by the video. If it happens consistently, as you claim, it's super easy to prove. Make another video, showing not only your starting caps, but how many and at what price you are selling, then have done one buy some, and show your caps after, and also how many are left in your store. Until then, the most likely explanation is that they didn't buy as many as you thought.
---
There shouldnt be negative consequences to this
---
Thanks mate. Xbox though ha! I kinda like the yao guai method because you also get a bunch of springs too, but I may move my camp so I can get an extractor built. I'll check your spot out :)
---
Yesterday evening I've finished all the archer and athlete challenges, swimming was my first try two days ago. So yes, quite recently.
---
You mean [this](https://www.thinkgeek.com/product/kkor/)?
---
Agreed. I spent a lot of time in Fallout 4 building camps and got some decent stuff created. 
---
I cringe when thinking of modifying my camps because of SO many little things that don't work. Stuff like: Item turns green but placing it does nothing. Items appear too close or too far when trying to place them. Game refused to build an upper floor and complained of intersecting object but there were none. Same problem with placing foundations, though again no intersecting objects. Stupid workarounds to get power in a building instead of offering a pass-through wall connector.  
---
Bethesda, its obvious that people spend massive amounts of time crafting camps, please focus efforts on making the editor work faster and more reliably!
---
One last thing: IMO Atom prices for most store items are way too high. I would actually spend real world money to buy customized items, but I'm not going to spend a few dollars just to get, say, a nice looking chair. If you drop prices to something more reasonable, I'll start spending $.
---
I was wondering if that was a factor. The guns a pile of trash without it, though ha
---
You know raiders, personally? 
---
Raiders can be dicks in a variety of different ways. Not all are longsighted enough to think about future replenishment (and that’s not even an issue in this game)
---
Literally raiders are the lazy and the assholes of humanity. And all the variety that that entails.
---
You meet a raider in-game (like that guy), they aren’t role-playing. They’re just being themselves.
---
Ahh. Bummer. Guess that one my son found in Uncanny Caverns was the wrong one also. Thanks!
---
I did it without crouching or sprinting
---
yea i noticed that vats remembering when i came back to the game, i was giddy as a schoolboy :) i might go 3 into addrenaline and 3 into gun fu... not 100% on that. ill have to do some math first. (the min max bug got me)
---
with the tuned and drinks i think i agree, havent tested anything yet, just theorycrafting. what annoys me is the +50 ap regen when well hydrated with rejuvinated.... +50 what? per second, per minute, 50%, 50% over a certain amount of time? why does well tuned say 25% but hydrated just 50? if it was 50 ap per second, its the best thing ever, i would regain my ap in 7.7 seconds....in combat.... testing needs to be done when i get home, there goes 2 hours :D
---
Something something patrolling mojave wishing for nuclear winter
---
Yea, I'm starting to think that from reading the comments... 5 points to stop your gun breaking also seems like a waste though ha!
---
Or glowing fungus instead of coal at the cooking station. Green Thumb helps a lot more with that one, and since Bleach Dogwood is junk, you can stock up on it, then gather a bunch of glowing fungus near Flatwoods before crafting. I started a new character this patch, and I don't have the purifier plans yet. Most of my boiled water is going for healing salves and disease cures, but I do filter some.
---
Speaking of which, I’m seriously worried that the Nuclear Winter update is going to the introduction of a Battle Royale game mode. 
---
Anyone else think this could be the case?
---
Before the patch that combined all the 7 (200c each) vendors it was hard to get caps, I had to fast travel all over the place and maybe get some caps cause I didn’t know the vendor cap reset time. 
---
Now that I know caps reset after 20 hrs I used those hours to grind materials to get my daily limit in one visit. I get all my steel, wood, and plastic from my kills’ weapons.
---
I understand I just know I don't like pvp and I don't really need workshops for much of anything except maybe the occasional fusion core and if I find the extractor locked when I come through I don't pick the lock I take the workshop lol I help defend workshops all the time so I feel like it's okay to pick through extractors once an a while
---
Is it confirmed they drop from meat bags and guano piles? The two I’ve found so far just came from random chests; I did pursue meat bags and guano piles for a bit and had no luck with them.
---
All they have to do is take a count of the weapons which were duped, and the total amount between players and nerf the highest duped op weapons, after they patch the method.  Then release new weapons into the game.  Problem is every time they add a patch new exploits become available and you see another huge wave and server issues
---
You on Xbox? If so you want some ammo? I had my lvl30 Fixer setup for .38 found a lvl50 and now using the 45 in it, so not using the .38 anymore.
---
I had no Idea the coat was this hard to get. I saw someone had it on this sub and thought “oh that’s cool, so where do I get it?” and after finding out, I got on, and the bot was there. I thought he was always there, and not a rare find. I guess I just got lucky lol. I hope you get the coat soon, it is truly awesome.
---
I spawned into a guys locked camp and he started shooting me, probably out of instinct.  I yelled at him to open the door and walked out.
---
Hmm. Would it say “camera?” Because I just don’t see anything there.
---
And have the rare items actually drop
---
Hm interesting! Maybe I'm just managing to constantly fuck it up some how.
---
Thanks for replying
---
could just be team deathmatch with some very light battle royal traits like shrinking boundaries
---
How does a ~~canvas~~ nylon bag sound?
---
I think it's a good idea on the server side as well since people build tons of purifiers in their camps, now it can be more simple to run the loop to count it, I believe part of their backend already did things like this already though, but the frontend might provide slightly improves to it as well, just for such thing they might like to do it while doing the rewrite though, since it also related to the wall/foundation snapping code, which is super low function and hard to use in general, it just too core to the system, and if you stack a new thing onto it, others broken, anyway, it's a good idea xD
---
It would say like Broken ProSnap Deluxe camera or something of that sort
---
Don't remember the exact name, but i think it's named: Broken ProSnap Camera Deluxe.
---
PSA if you lock more than single water purifier, and more than one room, your camp aint cool at all.
---
Locking up one room I'm able to understand. I have elaborate electrical setup I don't want tampered with, hence about 2 floor tiles out of 30+ are locked in my camp. More is rude isolationism and artistic self-censorship.
---
2 things here, and I don't quite understand.
---
Duping, yeah probably.  Not a question.  But, when my stash is full, I can't list even 1 item without cleaning it out some.  I can't imagine how you could list that much when your stash is overfilled.
---
(not looking for the method, just pointing that out)
---
Well, I think this is the first time they've tried pvp in an elder scrolls/fallout game right? I'm sure balancing is needed. Also I didn't complain about pvp, I knew it was a risk going into it. My rant was about my interaction with a a shitty player, and apparently it can bring out shitty comments, like yours.
---
The dupers did Bethesdas work for them, only duping op weapons in the weight of thousands, now Bethesda knows exactly what needs to nerfed..
---
  Unless all the stuff you have came from in game sources - looting dead enemies, event/quest rewards, bought from in game faction vendors, etc.
---
Somehow I doubt anyone duping high end stuff is giving it away....so a when a   
---
 random gives you a low level item, I tend to think odds are that item is OK as well.
---
It’s just how it is.. but things are getting better with every generation that speaks out and changes their behavior in small ways.
---
PS4 you get a real disk.
---
I play 76 regularly. If you need someone to help you, I’d be more than happy to do so.
---
Uhhh... was it on Xbox..? Totally could’ve been me😂 but I don’t have any high value weapons in the machine so couldn’t be me lol
---
I don't know, I've been sprinting all the way (that's why I needed AP refresh perks), swim towards the buoy and turn when heard the sound of touching it. Really don't know what you can do wrong?!?
---
With every sale of Skyrim, the tear in reality that will free actual dragons grows larger, in just a few short years Elder Scrolls 6 will release in literal fire, dragons soaring through the air destroying all humanity has built as Todd stands on the tallest mountain on earth, gazing down upon the death of man, a small smile on his face
---
Didn’t know. This makes no sense. 
---
Food have been laying around for 25 years anyway until suddenly we pick it up and it becomes moldy haha
---
Wish their name showed up in this screenshot so we could report them. Did you report the duper? It’s the right thing to do
---
Is this really a good game for little kids? Are little kids a thing for a community of a game like this?
---
Same problem.  Quest was triggered early, my husband's camp is right by the Pioneer Scouts, revived an ally- now I can't do the bug parts or the cleanup.  I had the bugs bot come up ONCE after the game crashed, but it disappeared again when I fast traveled.  
---
Submitted a ticket and got this response: " We are aware and investigating an issue where "The Tadpole: Herpetologist Challenge" may not complete after creating the Frog Habitat."
---
Unhelpful.  I emailed back but nothing yet.  All they have to REALLY do is put those robots in the terminal with Biv so we can at least finish and move on.  I don't *need* all the badges really.  Just the backpack and ability to be a possum scout.
---
Hemlock holes maintenance. 3 acid deposits, plus crystal and gold.
---
I had a lvl 251 ass hat who was cross bowing everything in my camp and myself. Just annoyed me. So I built a ledge off my camp over the cliffside and pretended to sit on my couch, once he came over hopping around like a fucking rabbit trying to instigate me I logged out. Fall to your doom you dumb bastard. Then I joined back in to same world with a friend and we open mic laughed at him while he was trying to talk shit. It’s hard to hear you talk over the sound of laughter
---
I want the paint spattered pack handmade skin from fallout 4
---
Happened to me. No action for a bit and logged off. As I was logging off in that 5 second cooldown I heard footsteps. To late......
---
Tell him "it's better than watching the news"
---
What do you play on? It lets you build up to 10 turrets since one of the updates.. something doesn't sound right.
---
&gt;  game size too big for the discs these days
---
The disks for the PS4 are blu-rays, ~50Gb if they're double layer.
---
Where do you get these small individual letters? I’ve only seen those decorations that spell ammo, guns, loot etc.
---
Neither do I! Not many people seem to have same issue. After all my tries I would have thought I would stumble upon the right way.
---
Bro how many times u gonna keep reposting this
---
This is helpful.  I tried to do as many things as possible in one area before fast traveling, but it would have been nice to have this to look at
---
It took me awhile to notice this too! I mentioned it to the husband and he had never searched for extra meat or ammo.
---
Maybe it’s a craftable item I learned automatically and I just need to find a broken camera.
---
&gt;i am checking my inventory. 
---
Cool, so just update the thread with a new video, that shows the inventory levels and price before and after someone buys, and your caps before and after, and we can do the math and see for ourselves that you are right.
---
To inspect at player venders, player must be around.
---
How about yearly events like Birthday, with some sweet ingame goodies from Bethesda \^\^
---
With the junk in buildings as far as I know it’s both a timer and 1st come 1st serve so for example if you pick up a desk fan it will re-appear for you personally after a set time in that same location but if another player has been there first it won’t be there for you. If the set respawn time has elapsed then joining another world will let you pick it up if your there 1st. I play in the mornings and every morning I walk past a barn with buckets, a microscope rat poison and a few other things, every day I loot everything but if I happen to log in of an evening and go in there everything I took in the morning is missing until the next morning.
---
Workshop Materials: they are only visible in the workshop build mode and not what you find in the extractors or as junk items, basically when you open the build menu and go to build something e.g a concrete foundation the top right of the build menu will show the amount of concrete needed in green text next to a green number, when it’s green it means it’s coming from the workshops own internal budget automatically. Every workshop has a bunch of building materials in its build menu budget but if for example you placed dozens of turrets the workshop budget might not have enough gears so then you would see the text turn white and the number of gears shown would be your personal supply of gears whether you have them on you or in your stash box and that’s when you have to decide if the return is worth the investment. But basically when your in the build menu if the ingredients to build the item are in green text it’s costing you nothing.
---
Im hoping there is something huge on the road for July 4th because it would make very little sense not to do something for the occasion
---
Your joke raises fair points—duping causes some problems but solves others.   Bethesda never has made their loot drop system viable (even with the Purveyor) and did not have an effective caps sink so inflation was already destroying the in-game economy.
---
Little kids play everything man. You can’t escape it.
---
Yeah, Betheseda is going to have to address this. The whole idea with the vending machine was to put the items in it and go about your business.
---
✔️
---
Why does it matter ? lol you've sold it so what happens next shouldn't matter. My highest price items are 25 caps and if people choose to sell them higher it's up to them , and if someone chooses to pay a higher price from that player that's also an individual choice. If someone buys from me at 25 caps and then sells the item for 300 I couldn't care any less
---
Maybe it just a craftable item I learned automatically and need to find a broken camera to apply the mod. Anybody know of a sure spawn location for broken cameras?
---
&gt;  Oh my god was it ever so much worse before, took like a half hour just to hit em all,
---
Half an hour?  You mean you *weren't* overloaded?
---
The battered Fedora. I collected mutant bones from West Tech
---
I have been farming possum badges for the entire weekend, and I finally got the 8 I needed to buy the plans for the High-Capacity mod. However, I went to purchase it, and when I went to learn it in my inventory, it said "known." Now, I'm a bit confused and VERY terrified that I wasted my Possum badges on a plan I already knew, but I don't believe it to be possible to get the plan by any other means. So now I'm confused and scared. So a message to all those farming for a backpack mod plan: check if you somehow unlocked it prior to buying it, so at least my questions may be put to rest, and you don't waste a couple days of your life.
---
Completely agree.
---
I was able to complete this solo, just stand in the fire circle, use adrenaline and gun fu and go to town.  When the fire gets to halfway on the bar just throw in more kindling. It may also help I use an instigating handmade so I can nail everything in one shot quickly.  It's fun solo, but the drop rate in this event sucks.
---
I reached the cap limit a day before player vending. Then I spent all my caps in a frenzy buying spree. Now I have 12 3* legendary heavy weapons, and three 3*** melee I am very happy with!
---
RNG hates me :-/ I’ve run camp adams about 6 times and the other 2 dailies 3-4 times each. No plans, and only 1 possum badge. /sigh
---
I might have a spare one but I am not sure. I have to check when I get home. Are ypu on PC?
---
A games endgame is what YOU want it to be. Not everyone is obsessed with collecting legendary gear, some people just play a game because they think it's FUN instead of turning it into a grindy job just so they can deal bigger numbers. And if you're going to bitch about armor effects in pvp at least stay up to date, they've already started nerfing assassin and sentinel gear.
---
Right. If a vending player wants to lock an area, they can lock an upper floor, where other players will be very unlikely to accidentally reach during loading.
---
Aesthetics?
---
Chems are too easy to get and way too heavy to carry around in bulk. They barely even sell when they're free.
---
if you are on PC i believe i have a broken one saved in my stash.  yours for zero caps.
---
Ur best bet is getting gunsmith and slapping a forceful stock on it to increase the conditioning on it
---
Jet is a hell of a drug.
---
Rats. PS4. Thanks though. :)
---
Most player vendors I've been to, either have a bare-bones set-up with a single terminal, or they have this nice elaborate set-up where you can only access the vendor area of their C.A.M.P., their personal area is locked. 
---
To be honest, I have nothing but good things to say about player vending - but this is a good shout-out to anyone who was maybe unaware they were locking players out.
---
Not by me, just repeating what others have posted.
---
I have found four so far: one in a footlocker, one in a deathclaw nest, one 'inside' a Gulper and today one 'inside' a SM Behemoth.
---
Ii see, so it's like an inaccessible budget, something only used for that purpose. So, say in this instance I used most of it to build up the workshop and it gets destroyed, does that budget get restored at any time?
---
Place pink flamingos at random locations, slowly, one by one, over a long period of time.
---
I appreciate the serious look at the financial aspect - and also am disappointed that it doesn’t sound feasible. It’s so hard to look at ALL the merch on the market and hear that the one silly item I want is not worthwhile. 
---
As I think about it, I guess I don’t see niche embroidered patches being sold, just general ones. Bethesda should get in with the supplier of Boy &amp; Girl Scout patches. Make it a promotional point :)
---
A whole video for something that can be said in two sentences with maybe two images to make it exactly clear.
---
Not broken. Not play to win
---
That's what happens? Cause I've walked into areas where all the ghouls/scorched just fall over dead... Figured it was the server just saving me time and ammo.
---
I always check in case the fusion one is unlocked tbh lol
---
that's actually not an issue I found even if im solo.
---
The issue is when you spawn in and a Scorhbeast is in the mix :/
---
Actually not, I don’t sell the berets. And I mean everyone needs caps, I’m not an exclusion, but I also want to create a fun and friendly game environment. Though, I guess, as it was mentioned above, people don’t really care about that apparently
---
The event “Leader of the Pack” which spawns in the forest, can give at least 3 legendaries (last time I checked) they are low level maybe level 5-15.
---
Darn, I didn't put the stock on but I will, and I had max gunsmith
---
Cheers man. I just server hop for yao guai for acid. A bit tedious, but can get like 3 to 400 acid and springs from an hour of doing that ha!
---
Still waiting on my C.A.M.P. train horn
---
You said exactly how I feel. Worst fallout playlist ever.
---
I need more super sledge skins!
---
Not yet. Though it is slated in a future update
---
Yeah I gave up on the hydrated buff after getting the speed demon mutation so I'm really not sure how effective it is. If you're min-maxing are you considering a bloodied build? It's the biggest ap boosts I can think of.
---
It helps to be in a team. 3 is good, 4 is cake
---
&gt;Scoutmaster here
---
&gt;non Scouts may knot get it, lol
---
References check out from my experience.
---
I've done this on five different characters. You only to need to swim from the center bouy to the far right one, the rest of the time you can just run through shallow water and jump over obstacles. Shouldn't really take more than two minutes.
---
I don't get the event there anymore
---
I actually would hate this tbh, snapping walls and other objects I get, even tho they become extremely hard to place in certain circumstances and also impossible to place in others. If I wanted for instance to place a purifier close to another but not snap, the snap distance might keep sucking it to the other item and there's almost no way around that, forcing me to place it farther away than I would normally intend. I'm pretty sure items like that don't snap for a reason in the first place.
---
Oh and using a max weapon artisan when u repair it, but other than that the conditioning on it dies very fast
---
I'd really appreciate a bad dad joke bot for a DJ   
---
"Next. Up. The. Beach. Bots. Ha. Ha. Ha."
---
It be cool if you could link Spotify or yeah even have someone DJ since we exist within the wasteland. It give us a voice and we could even recruit to factions. Secondly it be cool if we did have a radio station that broadcast for help. That way people around you learn about others they could aid and get XP and it bring people together. As much as I like exploring and discovering things I would like to see someone from time to time.
---
Well yeah, everything helps in a team.
---
Using a chair, bed, instrument or interactable station also does the trick. So have a quick glance around and see if you can reach anything.
---
Every time I run Free Range the event completes if the brahmin are still alive, before the Sheepsquatch spawns.
---
&gt;Don't sell/buy the perk magazines.  They dont count for the atom badges
---
But do they count for the "read 20 magazines" trophy?
---
Yup same but 5 cores last me along time so I don't go to them often probably like once a month tbh
---
Breach and clear gets me around 50 lead ore maybe a little less
---
This is amazing !
---
There's a spot in Sutton between the railroad tracks and guardrail where you absolutely can't get out ... the PA trick has saved me many a time
---
If anyone gets one for Xbox my IGN is KN1F3RJord and I would love to buy one or something
---
so I am going for my third bagde and it's the hunter, what food do I need to make for it and here can I find it?
---
If you're on XBox what's your GT and play time?  I'll be there.  Calmex is the best.
---
Tell him he should not believe everything he sees/hears/reads on the web, that reddit/youtube etc, only account for a tin percentage of players, that for every one person whining, there are hundreds/thousands of others who are quite happily playing.
---
I hit upvote like 20+ times just to make myself feel better.
---
The path I tried most was going immediately to the close right, then going for far right. I get dinged just before the far right buoy where it goes from deep water (swimming) to standing depth. Is this the same order for you? 
---
Did you never have an issue?
---
There were a good number of console dupers that were banned.
---
Play Fortnite then
---
Traveling Pharmacy is worth the perk points if your build is Chem heavy.
---
I have done that quest a lot since it came out and I havent failed it yet.
---
I've been leaving my pin as a riddle.. At least leaving the numbers scattered a bit.
---
As long as it's canvas  
---
(I'm taking the piss, for whoever can't take a joke)
---
Just reminds me of that ‘stop having fun’ meme.
---
If you’re personally enjoying the game then who cares what others think
---
Okay, thanks!
---
as an aspiring drug dealer myself I've only sold very few chems @20-30 caps each .. stimmys/radaway and the other pharmaceuticals not so much .. but medx physco and the variations there in sell rather slowly doe .. I guess it's just too easy to get narcotics nowadays with all these degenerates runnin around
---
There are pages scattered around the camps, totally makes sense we'd get a book. Would be helpful for people first starting the quest line as well, vs the first week of trial and error figuring things out/constantly going into your challenges page to check progress; it could keep track of everything
---
I know this is written by Artificial Intelligence Machine that will beat whatever argument that I am going to say. So I am just going to say that I agree with you :p
---
It's much easier if you have at least 3 players. I join evertime I see this pop up.
---
wish you could turn it off, I don't mind it but I know of many youtbuers who have streamed the game and out them up as videos and lost all monitisation since it's copyrighted
---
Think I'll try that forceful stock, because I'm having this issue too.... I've heard the beam splitter makes it wear quicker too. That true? Not taking it off, like, because the guns trash without it ha!
---
How do you have bloodied and 2 shot? 
---
Just saying.
---
Drugs are bad mmmmkay
---
Thank you for your answer thanto13 !
---
with the nuclear winter expansion that's going to happen I hope that means there will be snow on the ski slopes once more.  That being said, I think a winter olympic style event would be pretty dang cool.
---
I honestly think that it’s just a bug that we can’t inspect the items of other players. We were able to before, but we can’t now. Haven’t been able to for a while.
---
Bethesda should just remove the option to lock doors, it has never made any sense at all, even before immune camps.
---
there isn't sure spawns - not for dead tourists nor for broken camera, all is RNG.
---
or place any foundations.
---
You wouldn’t happen to remember the mod would you
---
See, THAT makes sense for a locked room.. But I never see the reason for people who get all these fancy decorations, mostly just for show.. and then lock their base.
---
But most things you can muscle through or just be patient. For this one it makes a considerable difference
---
One piece of Chameleon Armor helps.  Squat in game to squat IRL.
---
&gt;brotherhood recon rifle lvl 1 
---
The Overseer boxes are instanced, arent they? Or do you even mean the normal blue stashboxes you can build at your camp?
---
I have my camp set up in the Mire, I wanted a swamp base with a good amount of water and a steep drop off so I could wall up one side against various enemies. Didnt account for the fact that every time someone fast travels to me, they spawn inside the lake and have to swim to my camp. 
---
But at least I'm not locking doors 🤷‍♂️
---
Wait.. a couple of behemoths? Like actual behemoths? I know the one in the lake but I didn’t know they could spawn at nuke zones? Done WS a lot of times in my day &amp; never seen one.. I think it’d be awesome to see them more it would require people in nuke zones to do something together instead of racing each other in PA for enemy spawns lmfao
---
[Yeah I did an essay on this](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bo3agw/expanding_on_americanair88s_idea_of_world_bosses/)
---
I say we add some of the most liked music from NV and FO3. I personally love to see, we’ll hear, Johnny Guitar or a Frank Sinatra song added.
---
I’m not too sure about other attachments on it, haven’t really tried messing with them too much. And yeah I’m definitely not using it without beam splitter
---
Personal favorites: Heart of the Swamp, One Violent Night, Uranium Fever
---
I've had it on PS4 a few times too normally in the mountains. I don't use chems but weirded me out when I first saw it
---
Can confirm, I made a new character for the first time since launch (i.e. my second character).
---
I made so many atoms just building my first C.A.M.P. and just playing through the game. I think I made over 400 by level 13.
---
Good question, I think it’s only replenished after a certain time to its original values once the owner has left. I’ve claimed an unowned workshop but there have been a previous owners generators turrets etc still there and there hasn’t been many materials left in the budget so that makes me suspect there’s a timer at work. The previous owner must have left the game or been disconnected. You can make repairs but that would have to come from the remaining materials in the build menu.
---
I’m always looking for new people to play with! My IGN is Grimmcowz248
---
It's the Matrix. Nothing real.
---
I'd be happy if snapping was possible on edges of all items. They already account for collisions.
---
I imagine this being implemented as a toggle in the build menu would be useful.
---
I don't think anyone tried to destroy the game. It that on it's own.
---
Not me, I don't think they should release a stuffed animal plushie, I think they should release patches that fucking work, content that can be completed (looking at you fake Stimpak Diffuser) and solo and ones that fix the bugs they keep ignoring, but thanks for asking.
---
I’m up for helping out with whatever GT KnowledgeHound heavy gun medic lvl ~175
---
Depends on if it was used to weigh food or chems.
---
Whatever SOUP this kid’s been eating, I want some.
---
i do want this. but there's been many threads about it already, and the format of this one breaks reddits basic rules (asking for upbotes)
---
Gatling Gun, .50 Cal need skins, and the Automatic Grenade Launcher needs skins
---
A lot of the “upgrade” stuff in this game isn’t. 
---
Like ALL of the recipes, no motivation to ever do anything beyond the base recipes for any food. Ultracite maybe on one weapon for fighting the queen, but it’s a complete waste for anything else. 
---
It seems they balanced the game around all of the base stuff, and then didn’t want any of the upgrades to get OP, so they aren’t worth anything. 3x the ingredients for a 10% boost. Maybe they should have balanced around some mid-tier upgrade level, and made it a bitch to survive at anything lower, and made the highest things a real boost, but a pain to obtain.
---
Just add some musical instruments and sit AFK while playing them. Just make sure you’re back every 10 or so minutes so you won’t get kicked.
---
It could've been my weird blast zone that spawned it. Once I got to the side entrance of WS the robots were fighting one, and then one popped up by Solomon's Lake(?) while I was harvesting flux. I went back before leaving and two level 91 glowing deathclaws had started fighting the robots in the same spot the behemoth was.
---
i was considering that mutation, decided against it, the 20% reload is nice.
---
when it comes to builds, the only legendary rifle i got was the healing one on vats crit. i got every mele weapon under the sun with all sorts of good effects. so ill be happy to just get anything, and maybe a chance with the legendary vendor on thursday.
---
and im happy to see more legendary enemies drop ranged weapons (i rarely saw one when i played before, seems more abundant now. like a ghoul would only drop mele weapons before.)
---
but if i get a bloodied rifle id be very happy, especially since i plan on getting the adrenal reaction mutation and im generally around the 80% health mark when i play and only use rad away when it gets to about 60% so they would fit nicely.
---
now im not familiar with an exact bloodied build... i assume it goes with using nerd rage and such.... while i want to min max, im not that much of a risk taker :)
---
I failed it when they all got killed by the 'squatch
---
The organization wasn't actually after the Sheepsquatch. Just their unstable genius. I believe they were actually trying to do some sort of takeover (maybe mining?), it wasn't really clear. The way the organization works is pretty spy-like. The main players are broken up as follows: 
---
1. Black Sheep/Van Lowe (I forgot his name too) was the source. He was some sort of robotic genius, which the organization found valuable. To provide him incentive to work for them, they provided him resources to feed his obsessive quest for the Sheepsquatch. The problem was it was getting expensive, and he was so focused on the Sheepsquatch, he never accomplished what they wanted.
---
2. Bo Peep was his Handler, managing the source to get information/work, and making requests from "HQ" for resources to make the source happy to keep him working. It seems she pushed to keep Black Sheep as a source, and the superiors were displeased with her handling of him.
---
3. Wolf was a Cleaner. There was a mess that could out the organization, and he was sent in to deal with it. He found Bo Peep killed at the meet up, and Black Sheep killed by his "Sheepsquatch." Unfortunately for him, that also meant he had to deal with the Imposter Sheepsquatch. Can't have people finding that and asking questions. So he got a recall code. Since the Imposter Sheepsquatch had it's Assaultron programming completely overidden, this was the only way to draw it in. Unfortunately it also had the effect of drawing every RobCo bot in the area.
---
Some people like the hamster wheel. Just like FF14 the endgame is just a skinners box rinse and repeat every update.
---
Yup, exactly this, I watched it happen at Charleston Stn
---
That's me, heavy chem user with 3 points in Traveling Pharmacy and hundreds of chems I will never use.
---
I bought a hunter's long coat out of a player's shop for 400 caps yesterday heh heh
---
Sorry, PC!
---
yes, just wipe everything duped, as if it never happened
---
I wonder if the budget wont get restored if I reclaim it too early.
---
Ah ok. I don’t have that equipped so it wasn’t an issue for me. But that makes sense why it would be a pain.
---
Main reason I'm not selling any of my 3\* stuff. I don't want to have to be hanging around my camp in the off chance that next guy will actually buy one of them. Have a couple nice 1\* weapons for sale and the rest are just plans and apparel. Hopefully this next update fixes that issue. I don't want to scrip them and it would be nice to not have to always post on the marketplace every time I want to sell some 3\*'s.
---
evolution isn't always perfect fam it's just efficient. in this case efficiency was the quick buck.
---
Sheepsquatch ate my beans
---
I've kept up with the game for a good while. I genuinely enjoyed the game on launch and quickly racked up about 100 hours early on. I think I uninstalled right before the first TSE nerf (not because of that, just a point of reference). Yesterday I installed again. I'm not ready to say the game is 'back to life' just yet. However, this is a great foundation to build on. Vending alone was enough for me to give it a second look. I can't help but wonder what the game would have been like with this kind of player economy on day 1. It's such a perfect concept for the game.
---
...Follow the white rabbit
---
I feel like they missed out on monthers day with a mama dolche's  mission
---
maybe you should have made sure who you're buying from is reputable...
---
idk how the F76 markets are set up, but the ones I've been in there are reputation systems/checks in place, and they work rather well
---
Thank you, thats awesome!
---
My doors don’t need a pin to exit, just one to enter. So anyone “accidentally” moving into a locked area while spawning can get out.
---
I have pressure pads that open the doors automatically for exiting.
---
The only thing that could be considered “pay-to-win” is the weapon repair kits. Nothing else is snake to give anyone an advantage, you are able to just repair some gear on the fly. 
---
No perks are broken that are for armor and such. I have my skill that makes armor degrade less. I don’t even remember the last time I actually had to repair my armor. My weapons are another story. It seems that I have to repair them more often, but that’s because I’ve been running solo and using more ammo.
---
Don't know if this was the case when you replied. . . But I know for a fact that as of this morning via chem workstation, I crafted 2 w/o first having a frog. I noticed when I go into build mode it won't let me place it, because it states I'm missing a frog. So hopefully once I go get the frog it allows me to place, and registers for the challenge. Alot of people appear to be having problems with this one.
---
It's been brought up a lot, and still a "maybe down the road" idea. 
---
The only "train" content is the rail enthusiast badge which includes things like blowing the whistle on the Harper's ferry loco and visiting all the stations, which is easily done, just toss on marathoner perk, pick a station and fly down the rails between them
---
That was my first thought too, put them up at 500 caps per, and only take them out when you need them.  Free fridge!
---
I'd like to think Bethesda thought that through before putting up vendors, but something tells me it was a coincidence.
---
He could have been carrying it
---
And cap collector.
---
Man, theres something this game gives that you cant get out of the other Fallout games. I loved 3, NV and 4. But being able to just wander the wasteland killing everything that walks or flies is just a dream come true. It's a way better survival game than Rust or Scum turned out to be.
---
 I've got mine with keypads outside, extra switch inside
---
If you are running starched genes 3 you should look at gaining more mutations. There is almost no downside to a lot of them.
---
I'd also start replacing your armour with the unyielding parts to boost the effect of your bloodied ability
---
Stim packs are my most consistent seller.  I sellout and charge 9 to 10 caps.  It's likely your location.  I'm built near a free fast travel point so it's easy to get to.
---
&gt;Only bulk lead and aluminium, the rest doesn’t change weight
---
I know it wastes plastic but I bulk everything. It's just easier for inventory management. I also sell the excess bulked junk.
---
Encryptid Event will supply you with revive opportunities for daaaaaayyyyyys!
---
That’s just a frog jar, the habitat is when you catch a frog in it and place it in the world
---
 And all the nuked flora turn into Christmas cookies!
---
Gt KnowledgeHound always happy to lend a hand. Heavy gun medic level ~175
---
Yeah, it is pretty tough when soloing or duoing, especially if the other player starts looting the house and not shooting anything. Also the Brahmin block shots so you have reposition constantly. I'd suggest waiting for 4-5 people with the event there.
---
I could solo the BBQ shack - Beckwith Farm route as only a few Wolves, a couple of bloodbugs, one Yao Guai and one Sheepsquatch showed up.
---
I have 85 improved repair kits and haven’t spent a dime ,.. not p2w
---
Dont feel guilty for changing the color of someone's lights lol. Every time I shop at someone's camp, if they have a terminal to change the color of their lights I'm on it just to mess with them.
---
May I direct you to anthem?
---
Was just sitting in a chair at my camp with some guys looking through my vending machines, checking reddit on my phone and got a call of nature. When I came back, it was back to the launcher. So yeah, people aren't always just logging out by themselves.
---
Endangerol or however its spelled.
---
Only failed once for me and it seemed because I ran over land, so stay in the water as much as possible. I went from left and then middle, then right, but stayed in the water although I did run thru some shallow water.
---
Jesus.. only time I’ve seen a deathclaw in a nuke was the queen.. sounds like a fun experience still
---
Don't worry about it mannn, its grooooovy.  Pass it this way mannnnn.
---
Cool post, Todd...
---
Instead of free nukes, the Fourth of July and/or New Years should just implement a quest to unlock firework displays.
---
Camp doors can be locked
---
I agree. If it was a forced snap, it might be worse than what we have now.  I think an optional snap-to could be ideal, if they could get the user interface right, but I doubt it's a high priority on their to do list.
---
I have been working moving my camp module around to resolve this issue but it is very tricky.  Continuous testing after unsticking people from the floor I ended up with them stuck in a riverbank...
---
Do these things autoscrap?  If so then I screwed up big-time last night.  I found one in a junk node then did a "scrap all" when I swung by my camp, and this post just made me think of it.
---
Not sure, I’ve never reclaimed one if it’s taken, I just claim one, dip in and out to pick up what I’m extracting and then if someone comes along to claim it I leave them to it and don’t go back lol, I’m really not into the whole PvP thing, someone on the sub will probably know though.
---
is that a possium badge?
---
They patched back in duping, gave us some crap grinding to do, re-skinned a deathclaw and upped it's HP. 
---
I'll give you the vending though - makes it easier to find camps now....... Orbital strike inbound!!
---
But few people will look for that number.  Instead, they will assume they're locked in.  Try putting lettering up saying "look for a pin" if you're trying to make it like a room escape.
---
Sure I could see that if people were arguing over energy vs ballistics???
---
But getting rid of 5% of the player based to keep 95% of the players much longer?  Thats a win.
---
&gt; One guy makes a comment about how I bet he would like fallout 3 and New Vegas even better which are the games the so called fallout fans point to when they trash 76.
---
People always use the glitches this game had at launch as an excuse to trash it and say, "We can't allow developers to set the bar so low and then praise them for fixing a broken product later."
---
What these people seem to conveniently forget is how buggy New Vegas was when it was released; yet it has become the golden child of the Fallout universe. If the bar was set low, it was done a long time ago when NV was first released but fans were willing to ignore all the bugs and glitches.
---
A little refresher can be viewed here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FllGpRS8Mx4  (my personal favorite is at the 2:48 mark when the player elects to murder the sleeping guards but instead curls up next to them for a little cuddling haha)
---
It is also interesting to read in the comments how many people defend the glitches, claiming they make the game more fun and that the game is "so perfect that even its flaws serve as a good addition."
---
:
---
No, Xbox. Remember where you got them?
---
I can confirm that ONLY high level people were at our last one, and all the drops were around 5-25 in item level, with one legendary at about level 15 (that poor little one star never stood a chance).
---
Submit a ticket. They handle them all the time. You will get em. Also save them till you a few lvls in the game as i got around 600 more from starter quests.
---
I still haven't eatned a badge doing that. :[
---
This sounds like a fundamental architecture issue where the contents of the stash are not available on the server unless the owner is within some range of it. It might be very hard to very easy to fix.
---
What’s the deal man how come you’re just ignoring all my questions?
---
Yup, I'm on it right now
---
&gt; Just join an Encrypted event
---
You say that like there are Encrypted events happening non-stop.  I see maybe one a week.
---
it would be cool.. but it may not be too useful
---
Time to build near rocks
---
I always drop something to let them know someone got in.

*Breaking news: Appalachia Survivor found dead in own base. Couldn't figure out code for keyed door" I just need to leave it over the door, I'd forget the code LOL
---
SOUP!
---
i find it rather easy to do almost solo. assuming no one pops up until the end.
---
Oh, so that explains why I could check a weapon the other day. Thought that was odd.
---
Always reminds me of the "Bewitched" theme... and DAMN I had such a crush on Elizabeth Montgomery! ;\^)
---
Knot a problem.  We have 8 hours at the next campout where we won't be doing much.  
---
Well, I won't (evil grin).  
---
btw...congrats on the Eagle!  
---
I had a Scout ask me once if we liked torturing y'all with knots.  We don't.  And we have to practice them too.
---
We also know the looks we are going to get when we mention them, but we want you to get your ranks and merit badges.  Y'all work hard at stuff that isn't always fun, and we really do appreciate the work you put in.  
---
YiS.
---
It would, it would be fast travel for survial
---
It's a bug. For some reason you just learn it when you have it in your inventory. I have a question for you buddy. Did you get your badges from the event or challenges? I've been farming the event but after getting 2 I have run it around 15 times with no possum badge rewarded. Am I just getting shitty luck?
---
I am so glad I don’t have this game. When the community gets excited about a pet rock, you know Bethesda has really delivered a dud.
---
World's smallest violin plays in background
---
It’s easier if you do the one in the forest region that finishes up at aaronholt farm/homestead, it’s just 1 bear, 1 squatch with dogs, wolves, ghouls and insects of a lower level
---
When i did play this, I'd only like this idea if it was a toggleable feature, as sometimes it was more pleasant for appearance sake to place near, but on a slight rotation, and snap to sometimes is a bit to magnetic in those measurements.
---
Needless to say, I left west Virginia for more destroyed pasters in the Boston Commonwealth again...
---
Yeah, but the vending machine ones are available immediately there's no need to arrange a meet up with someone to get them.
---
I'd say browsing other machines, 100 is absolutely *not* the norm for the player vendors.
---
No sorry. As i said i don't even know if I have them, might even confuse them for something else
---
It's bugged, you technically received 2 copies. 1 learned immediately and 1 item.
---
Add me my GT is BethesdaDaily am only lvl 30 though
---
This is some gourmet shit
---
Well then, at least I can find comfort in knowing that bethesda made a choice to evolve in the direction that pleases me. I can continue to enjoy the newest and ever evolving fallout and you can keep playing the stagnant, never to evolve older fallouts. 
---
You are happy and I am happy! End of conversation 
---
Also, I'm not your fam so please try to refrain from using trendy slang in the attempt to appear hip ;)
---
on reddit they usually sell for 100-250, don’t buy serums from the vendors
---
It's you striking fear in their evil hearts.  :D
---
I've received 1 from the fire event.
---
Download the xbox app to your phone. You can message people through it. Way easier than the xbox keyboard.
---
&gt;  I think most people are looking for undervalued items right now.
---
Or you've overvalued your items.
---
Things are worth what people are willing to pay for them.
---
I bought serums from an AFK mule someone set up near the Overseer's CAMP for 700 caps each. I feel pretty ripped off now after hearing that some people I play with have a serum dealer who sells at 250 caps, so bye bye 2100 caps. But yours was the worst trade deal I've heard off, possibly ever.
---
Then a middle solution is to switch 1 or 2 points to luck of the drae and let the gun repair itself a bit.  Rank 3 was bugged and never triggered but maybe beth patched it.
---
I agree.  This patch added a lot of fun.
---
I did until I learned it was copyrighted. I got a claim on a livestream because I was in the atomic shop for a minute and I guess I didn’t talk enough. Since then I’ve been trying to find a way to disable it
---
the i just took a huge L cause that was all the caps i got. looks like i’m waking through appalachia for a while:/
---
On the topic of serums. What will happen if I will drink speed demon serum, while already having this mutation? Can I even do that?
---
I have no clue why you even to lock houses now, your stuff cannot be destroyed in PVE anymore, I only look 3 out of my 4 purifies, 3 are in the back and one in front so people can get water, all my crafting benches are outside as well as a little hut with a bed and a piano, but if they wanna go inside the house they are welcome to.
---
If people won't buy maybe it's because your prices are too high?
---
Prime hunting rifles are even better after last patch since they significantly buffed the prime receiver, where beforehand it did the same damage as hardened.
---
I keep having problems with my camp. I think it has something to do with the stairs platform. I have a hard time building walls and roofs that's connected to it.. platform PC. I have an Alienware 51 less than a year old and my internet speed is top-notch so it's probably something on your guys end .
---
Going rate on reddit is 250-350.
---
Wilson!
---
Report this person to Bethesda. It’s not fair for players to do this stuff. They ruin the game for the rest us.
---
My highest priced thing is 500 caps... for a 3 star robot chest that’s max level and fully repaired.
---
Easiest option is to use the letters and state:
---
Contact me on Reddit
---
User = xxxxxxxx
---
200-300 caps for the high majority I've seen, most vendors are fair just don't be afraid to shop around a bit.  I got the serum plans to craft my own for 1,500 caps. So far I haven't found any other plans for price compare in shops but I felt that was reasonable.
---
"dosent" 
---
Is this a r/BoneAppleTea moment or did you just mix up your words?
---
i had the marsupial mutation before and didn’t have starched genes and i accidentally got rid of it so i needed to get it back. should’ve gone to reddit first. rip
---
Then why are you even here?
---
i've had one of those, l99 glowing deathclaw in the scorthed earth. Was it alone ?  No, ... it put out a party invite to all and sundrie, and they had me for din dins. and they STILL have all my loot. oh look ....he's got hardend mass....
---
AND he wants it back......NNNooooooo.
---
and if the queen comes back,  she's getting it as well........
---
Pipe weapons double dip
---
well to start with it's just as good as fallout 4
---
and also I'm on Xbox one and have a better time than using a mouse
---
sKale!
---
You can delete photos. Under the menu category, there is a photo category that you can either view or delete unwanted photos.
---
really bitter that you can't grief people's camps anymore, eh?
---
Water filters are useless. Same with wood armor. The early-game pacing is very strange. You skip water filters and wood armor all together and go straight to purified water and leather armor.
---
Prime receiver ammo is simply too expensive to craft. It should be just taking that existing ammo type + ultracite. 
---
Also, regular scorchbeasts should drop stable flux. Give us a reason to bother killing them.
---
With a little bit of polish, a lot of the existing events could be that good.
---
Yes it was in-game yesterday but I just left it to keep travelling weight down.  I would've kept it if know it was important soooooooo maybe Bethesda would like to flag those precious items as well with a diamond icon thingy to suggest hey this is important.
---
Finally, some good fucking food!
---
Gotta love Owen
---
I lost Scaly Skin like that once.
---
Why are you even on this subreddit then?
---
Ok thanks
---
How would they allow you to upload your songs &amp; avoid copyright issues😂 this is a great idea but quite literally would never happen
---
they already have that, and it is to each train station. safe arrival not guaranteed
---
It's really bad, somehow worse than fallout 4. Vats is pretty much mandatory.
---
That is way undermarket for a recipe.
---
Took me a few months to realise this, assumed it worked like it did in FO4 where it just spawned more ammo in a container but nope. Wasn't until I started using Butcher's Bounty that I twigged it worked the same way.
---
kill them first then press the buzzer, I did it first go once I killed them since they don't respawn
---
This poster hit all the high points. Some small additions.
---
* The cleaner was himself causing problems, by being overly sketchy and attracting cops. (Who he killed).
---
*The sheep squatch's program was overridden due to a verbal miscommunication. A bloody accident.
---
Hell i can remember when 3 came out and it supposedly "ruined fallout."  Then NV was a buggy mess at launch and it was declared a failure.  Yet somehow the bros give "Brotherhood of Steel" a pass because bethesda didnt make it and it isnt in first person.  In short, i will keep my own council on what games to play.
---
I got my crossbow plans off of Graham, was about 300 caps I think. I also think that I found the plans at Camp Venture, up in the shooting range near the helipad. Hope this helps!
---
I sprinted and if worked for me
---
"to the \*LEFT" when you're coming out of the stair well"  :)
---
i was so upset and had to jump around like a non-mutated idiot till i got it again
---
I paid 600 caps a piece for mine, and I'm fine with it.
---
Seasoned you meant
---
I get that...but I have been selling items since December. I am pretty decent at valuating an item based on my experience over 5 months plus others who I discuss pricing with when I am unsure.
---
Most decent (bloodied, vampire, furious, AA, instigating) 1* weapons go for 1k caps. Always have. Some with a popular base go for more. I don't think I have a single item over 6k in my vendor and most are 1k-3k.
---
I set up my garage door and vending machines powered through a switch inside my shop. When I'm getting ready to leave for the day or just want to turn off the VM marker on the map, I hit the switch. Then I have a back-door which I can lock, though haven't lately.   Though I think I had someone turn off things for me the other day... but other than that time, it was worked well.
---
When I built my camp I had my alt FT to the camp multiple times to get an idea of the spawn points and that helped me set it up to avoid anyone getting stuck or traveling in without any idea where to find my shop entrance.  I agree - if I FT into a place and either can't get anywhere because I'm stuck or just don't see any vending machines nearby, I typically leave and don't come back.
---
Is it corn and fertilizer ?
---
oof you’re right ty. i’ll edit that now
---
Right. Not for tourists but, just the deluxe camera.
---

---
Oh I already see the turbo AMERICA event for the fourth. Tons of explosions. Confetti fucking everywhere. Red = Dead
---
I think he referred to not having to go in there and delete them every time since photos take a lot of challenge space now. Just choosing wether they get saved or not is what I think he meant
---
I swim straight ahead to buoy in middle then go right through the shallow water/swim. Then it's nearly all running round the other buoys to complete a circuit. 
---
Clear out the mobs first if they give you problems.
---
I jump and sprint most of the time and the event has never failed.
---
You can add more mutations. Be sure Starched Genes is not active when you drink it.
---
I sell all mine 500c. No more no less.
---
This...and actually finding them in the Pioneer camp and mostly in red tool boxes
---
From what ive seen from streamers, its not instanced.
---
Honestly id take a break for a day and come back to it.
---
i get what your saying, but no I want to play and not sit in my camp to see if someone ever shows up
---
I've been known to quit to the menu and server hop for extra carry weight on the Excavator
---
I took a break for 6 days, just tried 2 different servers.
---
I'm not aware of any event that gives possum badges, I believe that only challenges award them. I could be wrong, and it would make more sense due to their being many more items to purchase than the badge challenges would allow, but I don't think Campfire Tales or any other event they added awards them. I just did the challenges for my badges, as there were just BARELY enough possible ones to get the 8 needed for the plan I wanted.
---
I'm on-board with this. I had just a few suggestions about Fasnacht to make it more engaging as well. I'm from rural Nebraska and I've been to a number of German and Czech festivals. They are really a great time with good food and entertainment. Assuming 76 is still kicking next spring, I'd like for Beth to turn the festival atmosphere up to 11. Make it so the party/social atmosphere remains even between parades. I think vendors selling treats and maybe a designated "bar" area would keep Helvetia jumping even when the parade isn't active. You can still make the recipes unlock, of course, but it would be neat to have been able to buy the donuts and sausage from a vendor, plus a special kind of booze or something. And clothing! Such beautiful clothing at these things. The masks were kind of a flop because the good ones weren't dropping so next year add some cool clothing to the unlock pool.
---
I am in a similar situation to the one you are describing. I like to run a relatively high health bloodied build, the boosts even at half health are too good to pass up and in bad situations you can fall back on getting stronger as you take damage. Almost like a berserker mode haha. It's not the most effective way to use it but i find that after you reach a high enough damage output then it doesn't really matter how hard you are hitting most enemies.
---
What I mean is what will happen if I will drink a serum which gives a mutation that I already have. Will it have any effect? I ask because I already have all of the mutations that I want but still need to drink one serum for that possum challenge.
---
Wasn't the deathclaw at the substation just outside watoga tameable? I thought it once was
---
I've been keeping my eye out for pets as well, only things I've found were a mole rat and a yao guai, but again like nearly everything in the game it's random
---
They should just expand it to (almost) every critter in the game--I wouldn't mind giving the poor doggo above the Harper's tunnel a home (and make the doghouses craftable camp items as well)
---
&gt; I sell clothes and accessories 
---
I read this in the ghoul voice version of Hank Hill
---
https://youtu.be/iGVBzoS_Q1U
---
Fast forward to about 1:10
---
Yep, and it's even worse when you're out of stock!
---
Splitter is actually really good for it, as I think it causes LOTD to proc more, and it shreds enemies at medium range. Also, if you've done enough SBQs the improved repair kits are extremely useful for keeping the weapon going for longer.
---
Honestly flying through the air with marsupial and splashing down next to the buoys worked for me. Finished with almost 4min left and they grabbed easily by proximity. Did this last night. Best of luck getting this figured out, I thought it was overly easy so idk why its so different between us....
---
I'm launching 76 from steam without any problems. That's weird.
---
Thank you! I was damned near close to having a panic attack thinking of the possibility that I wasted all of my badges. This bug is scarier than anything I've come across in the game so far lmao
---
Oh wow, I'm very guilty of this.  Have been setting up camp near Whitesprings and going off galavanting across map.  I kept fuming over the "bug" that wouldn't let me see item perks not knowing it was just us (the vendors) not being around.
---
can you only buy the plans from MODUS, or can you find them?
---
What if a variation of cicadas appeared as the bug army? It would explain their sudden appearance and their mass numbers.
---
What if the aliens themselves turned into ghouls, and you had to fight your way through a crashed spaceship full of them.
---
Yeah it seems like a good idea, but you get a second one, things get saucy, and then you've got a house full of pebbles.
---
I don't think it's that bad on PS4 personally I use vats for ghouls and bugs but shoot normally for everything else
---
With all the people stopping by the Raider vendor for the newly available plans, I have plenty visitors, they just don't buy my things!
---
You think?
---
I got the impression from the previous updates that they've downgraded this a bit to being things like Bobblehead stands and magazine racks, rather than completely arbitrary object placement.
---
Hello,I've got all the serums available in Ps4 and the price that I sell them in the vendor machine is 200 caps.
---
I've seen them in a range between 250 to 1500 caps,i think the prices are so high but that's my opinion and of course everyone can sell them with the price that they think convenient.
---
I leave my camp open, but I do have all the doors wired up to keypad switches with the codes fastened to the wall so people can get in and out. 
---
Garage is the power armour station, vending machine is outside to the left of the door, ground floor is the workshop and power plant, upstairs are the living quarters and guest balcony with the instruments and jukebox.
---
See, now I feel bad about the lock on my port-a-potty at Chez Stomper...
---
Anybody know if luck increases chances of finding things?
---
I have a high luck character and I have *so many chems* from Pharna Farma
---
I did not know this
---
Got stuck under a camp last night jist fast traveled to the same camp and spawned outside i guess that its just because it isn't loaded in
---
Wall triangles and roofs are buggy AF floating/intesecting always
---
Tinfoil hat time: Beth also intentionally brought back the 3/4 enclave vendors are busy fix, unintentionally fixed modus' creepy smile bug that's been present since the first time they "fixed" said vendors, then immediately turned the creepy smiles BACK ON D:
---
Maybe color coding them by badge would be helpful? Like make the railway ones green, gardening blue etc.
---
Or it might be too much work.
---
Still this is helpful, thanks. Upvoted!
---
I noticed this too. I managed to sell my amazing Bloodied Shishkabob due to player diligence tho. They messaged me and asked if I could tell them the other 2 legendary traits, so I just teleported back to my base so he could check it and I make a hefty sum of caps!   
---
Summary: Don't be afraid to message and ask a player to pop back. Its a free TP so if I'm not busy I will come back to let you brows.
---
I once fought the queen when her health was glitched while she was locked in at T-pose. I still have nightmares...
---
Set a target number on each type (in your mind) of junks that you felt it's enough(like keep 200 steels, 100 acid, 150 plastics or something for me), bulk the rest and sell it
---
&gt;cicadas 
---
fine idea
---
Just have them on a schedule and marked on the map where they are at that exact second
---
I ran across a Sheepsquatch the other day and though it took me some time, I was able to take it down. It had 5 mysterious quills on it.
---
Anything interactable works.  It's also a way in to a closed base if something's close to a window.
---
For single-player it will suffice, but in PvP it is not good.
---
You used to be able to get them from SBQ.  But not anymore.
---
Thank you for the info. Placing low lvl purifiers on dirt is easy enough. I have no idea why crafting water filters is even an option.
---
as much as i hate "to the person who" posts,
---
fuck these people to the max. it's literally just piece of shit trolls. I've had it happen several times. they look me in the fucking eye and kill the robot, then go on to teabag the corpse.
---
you're a fucking asshole and a piece of shit if you do shit like this.
---
Found one in Fort Defiance the other day.  I stupidly forgot to screen shot it.  I think it was added with the recent hotfix
---
yea i’m not tryin to see all my pictures of mineral deposits when i load in lmao
---
I wouldnt say it's brought it back to life since the game crashes and disconnects almost constantly, its a shit tier GaaS model and is a pretty sad looty shooty.
---
But, this subreddit is a circle jerk, so carry on.
---
Camp Venture, New Gorge West, and Sunnytop Ski Lanes are your 3 locations that you need to do courses at. You'll know you're in right locations when you see yellow flags indicating the course, and of course the box with the button that starts the "event".
---
You can pretty much only get them from modus however there is an extremely rare chance of getting then from the scorched queen.
---
Imagine you’re a new player and you walk out of Vault 76, only to be killed by a fucking sentient eye with teeth.
---
I saw this near Flatwoods between the lookout spot and the place you can use requisition tapes (words are hard and I'll think of it later.) I've also seen fresh grave, crashed satellite, and a few others. Love random encounter spots. :)
---
It's a cute idea but I cannot see Bethesda clawing-back duped items from non-dup owners. There's no way to tell which buyers knew-or-should-have-known from the buyers who were duped.
---
If I sell a serum to a venderbot with grape mentats, sweet roll, hard bargain 3 I’m getting almost 600 caps, it used to be that you couldn’t sell them serums but once the combined pool of caps went to 1400 it then became possible so while the average price was around 250 caps from traders for a long time some of us like myself won’t put a serum in our machines for less that we can get for it from a venderbot so I would say anyone buying a serum for less than 600 is getting a bargain but over 1000 is a little expensive.
---
There are always cargotbots doing circles front of the bridge near the Mothman museum.
---
last time i checked serum plans from modus was like the max 25000 caps
---
I finally decided to clean up my camp wiring and use the "through wall" conduit instead of sending it through a doorway.  After 10 minutes of fiddling with it to get it as close to the corner of the room as possible, then another 5 minutes trying to get another piece of conduit to attach to it so I could feed it power, I spent a good 15 minutes jumping up and down outside trying to get the wire to place on it.  Yes I tried both directions, the through wall connection point wasn't selectable at all for a starting point and I eventually got it to be the end point.
---
PITA but it looks much nicer now.
---
AFAIK you can only buy them from MODUS now.
---
They used to be a rare drop from SBQ however the devs said it was removed from that levelled list.
---
Said that drills were supposedly removed from the legendary levelled list yet here we are, still getting drilled so... who knows.
---
your comment is about as smart as a pet rock.
---
I got 2 from the campfire event and 2 from the dailies. Haven't done any possum challenges. Guess I'm just having shit luck because a daily cap of 4 doesn't seem logical.
---
It's bugged. I've been getting random "workshop under attack!" Messages this week, although I mostly just get those showing up on my load screens.
---
Another one I've come across is having the code pieces not work; they don't show their usual "legendary" style animation when I pick one up, nor do the code boards in the bunker seem to be working at all, but that might just be me
---
There's also a set event that literally kills all the NPC's and then they respawn. It was implemented as a bug fix for Whitesprings filling up with bots :P
---
that’s a perfect price and i play on ps4 so it’s even more perfect🙌🏻
---
I would buy a cute Mothman plushie so quickly. Probably the other cryptids too, because I'm halfway between collector and hoarder when it comes to merch.
---
If you drink the same serum as you already have the mutation for it will suppress the negative effects of the mutation for 1 hour
---
That is the exact cost they are a little less if you have the perk card to lower the prices but still up there.
---
I sell for 500 as I can get 483 caps if I sell them to a vendor.
---
Anytime a workshop needs defending or can be taken it is broadcast accross the whole server. IDK about the other stuff....
---
yeah this happens, but there are also people out there that just plain suck and do it to be pricks.
---
New Vegas is my favorite game ever. I couldn’t finish it because it got so laggy and unstable that I finally got tired of having to restart it 3 or 4 times cause it would crash every 2 minutes so I could get 30 minutes of play before it got so laggy I needed to restart and do the prices over again. Yeah, I’m very tolerant of janky games if I otherwise like them but that finally got to make it unplayable. 
---
And anyways I don’t understand why they used 76 being very broken as an excuse to trash it. If you like bethesda games it should not have been surprising. Though it seemed those who trashed that part  the loudest mostly were people who already hated bethesda games and hated how bad they ran and were happy to see people call bethesda out on it (because they complained about how bethesda fans let bethesda get away with it before that point). Those people would be face palming how accepting I am that I expect the game to be buggy. For me buggyness is an annoyance but if it’s not game breaking and the game is otherwise fun it’s just not a priority. 
---
Anyways, I’m one of those fans who will loudly talk about the superiority of NV. I really do prefer fallout to be an rpg. I don’t like the direction bethesda in general is going with fallout but I still enjoy 4 and 76. Survival mode in 4 made up for a lot of the loss of rpg (not that I don’t want to see it come back) and I just see 76 as kinda separate and its own thing as it is an mp game. And in the end while I prefer more rpg in my fallout that doesn’t mean I can’t enjoy a fallout game that is weak in rpg to no rpg for its other strengths. And I personally think people forget that bethesda does do some stuff well and new Vegas would honestly not be my favorite game without what bethesda brought to fallout.
---
I didn't say it did? But you're making a problem where there is none, a problem with two peoples' game data being mixed up doesnt suddenly mean they're leaking credit card info
---
see, that's just EVIL.. I bet you stock it with one ply too...
---
Oh OK cool thank you.
---
With Hard Bargain 3 and Unyielding gear I get 10 caps per Stimpak at the NPC vendors. Maybe just do that?
---
I found out best way to do it is to pick things you do anyways like I do a good bit of crafting and photos so I just take pictures with my camera of animals as I see them and craft low lvl armors for new people and hand them out
---
I actually cleared 2 challenges so far and am working on melting down metals for metalworking
---
yikes:/
---
If they have the big brick windows, you can jump out through them.
---
The youtube comments are so cute lol everyones acting so kind (I assume it must be his friends and family). Is this the internet?
---
Welcome.  To.  *CAPTAIN KID'SSSH*.
---
That definitely was a Richard move.
---
Looks like you are correct, recent changes restrict you to just one now, but because mine were built pre-patch I can still keep them..but it won't let me place any more...both still fire though
---
That's the wrong event. Path to enlightenment is the Landview Lighthouse event.
---
I've never come across it, honestly. They did add in a few more random encounters with the patch though
---
I find novelty items always go pretty well I sell a lot of funny costume pieces that go pretty quick and am working on expanding that into different markets of things I can craft or make myself
---
Reddit only houses a small percentage of the player base, the majority probably doesn't even know Mr.squeeze even exists.
---
The broken ones are to allow people to replace ones that they sold or lost on accident.
---
What about the people who get BE Lasers that happened to be duped, give their whole inventory for one in a trade, then poof. It’s gone. Everything they gave up for trade is gone, and their shiny new gun is gone too. Doesn’t seem fair to me.
---
Well, damn. Didn't know that it was possible to get them from the event. Makes it a hell of a lot easier knowing this! Although, it would make sense if they were scarce in these events, or if there was a cap for how many you can earn each day, as the challenges are hell to complete, while Campfire Tales is piss easy. Still, it's nice knowing that this is a possible way to earn them!
---
Did you even read it? Like the second sentence says it’s the third Saturday every October.
---
But who's to say you didn't drill down through your foundation? If I can make a nuclear reactor for power, I can probably drill through a foundation into the dirt below. lol
---
I wish caps were useless, I am level 100 and I am scraping for caps because I get shit legendaries (farmed over 300 in a week) and I have no time. 
---
Only reason I was able to farm over 300 legendaries in a week was because I had leave but that’s only about 11k caps at most if nobody buys my legendaries.
---
When I server hop at Camp Adams, I get it in at least one out of every three hops. I've also seen it regularly when I stay on the same server. I've found it's not worth my time to wait for.   
---
Also keep your expectations reasonable. It's a nice little short event, but you very rarely get possum badges. I've done it 20 times and only gotten one badge from it (and another badge from the daily bug hunt).
---
Because the communities are so toxic I don’t think any online mp games are fit for kids. But the fallout 76 community is a lot less toxic at least. As for the game itself I see no reason it is any worse for kids than COD and it is far preferable than GTA (a game I really do think should not be played by kids at least until they are a teen at least *and* have a good grasp of good morals).
---
How?
---
This! I screwed up the other day and broke into a player’s camp just so I could deposit my junk in a stash box and reduce carry weight. I’m pretty new to player interaction as I haven’t had as much time to play and am still pretty new (just got 76 hours reward). Obviously, this ticked off the player who owned the camp and I became wanted even without stealing. I get it. Breaking and entering‘s a crime. But this guy then proceeded to chase and shoot at me, so I had no choice but to beat him to death with a Death Tambo. Then I robbed him out of habit. It wasn’t very nice, but I figured if I was going to be hunted down anyway, I should at least benefit from it. A higher level player sniped me in one shot, and that was the end of my spree. But it all could have been avoided.
---
There should be a sorry emote and players should have the option to accept your apology and cancel the bounty at their discretion. They don’t have to, but it’d be nice to be forgiven.
---
That’s my understanding as well display cases not object placement
---
What about a giant mechanical skull with 4 different limb devices?
---
Somebody mentioned it was coming to the cash shop weeks ago. May have been speculation based on datamined content, though.... I have no source; just bad recollection.
---
I'd like to see the scaling on these events adjusted around player level, not just (apparently) number.  A trickle of Charred Feral Ghouls every minute is boring.  But when you have multiple players involved, the horde that often results is pretty fun.  This applies to Census Violence, Bots on Parade, AWOL Armaments, and a few others.
---
Free Range doesn't change, for example, and it's a fun event to try doing by yourself.
---
I'm saying we should scrap that, just causes spawn camping, with this you have a more lore friendly and fun way to travel and if people know it's more work to fast travel they will camp less as less people will use it. a slight easier version can be in adventure as a practice
---
I just want a faster option to get dirty water when my camp isn't near water. Purified water isn't very useful anyway.
---
The return of Rockington! (Jontron)
---
Or, move aspects of your camp that trap people. I'm tired of ending up in foundations, or stuck behind your vendor while you spam the confusion emote. It's the one argument I have for removing pvp damage to CAMPS.
---
For electrician where did you take a picture of a generator? It won't do it for me on mine at my base
---
I didn't get around to moving my camp to a more accessible location and adding a vending machine until....Saturday night.
---
I dont FT, so just checked out the camps I have walked by in my travels.  
---
Bought a few things, but nothing major.  
---
Since I have been turning in many of my low level legendaries for scrip, I have a wide variety of mats, ammo, and QoL staples in my machine, but only a couple of weapons.
---
I can add to my stash from any Red Rocket, etc - and items in the stash stock the vending machine - the ability to add items to the vending machine whenever you can access your stash would be of benefit.
---
That you as a seller have to be online is another aspect - especially for casual players or those that for whatever reason, are not on for extended amounts of time.
---
Huh? I did this the day after it launched and I sure didn't crouch - i had marsupial and was jumping and running and doing all sorts of bullshit. Didn't have a single problem. (Just to stress - I'm not disagreeing with you, just surprised other people have had such radically different experiences).
---
200Caps +10%  
---
220Caps
---
 The horrible noise drives me away from the mediocre products. If they've added anything interesting I have to mute it pretty quick to shop in peace.
---
i get ya. thats prety much how i feel. dont have the time now days to invest into grinding out the perfect gear like i did in WoW back in the day. but i can do something with the things that come with levels and now with the player vending. perks and mutations.
---
if i get an instigating hunting rifle, ill stick with rifleman for a while, but i can take commando perks for when i get a decent combat rifle or handmade.
---
i can start collecting unyielding gear for when the time comes. till then id prefer chameleon powered or agi +1 with the be harder to detect minor modifier on a 3 star.
---
honestly i was hoping that the legendary vendor would let us add or reroll an effect, rather than just selecting armor, mele, or ranged... 1, 2 or 3 star. or maybe let us select a weapon or armor subtype, like leather, combat... or rifle, pistol etc... but it is what it is.
---
Weird, iv done the quest about 7-8 times and not seen that
---
I charge 500 for the less desirable ones like egg head and eagle eyes, but Healing Factor, Speed demon and Marsupial there is a 100 cap surcharge, so I charge 600 for them.  I sell a good amount.
---
Try pressure plates, that way the door closes behind you
---
Sorry to disagree, but I'm going to want to complete more possum badges than tadpole badges, so I'd hate to see one-fewer possum badge.   
---
As for tadpole badges, it's just a mater of fixing the bugs, and many of them will be fine. There's just so many bugged challenges right now!
---
I've been lucky as I age. I take a raging piss at 7am on the dot. A nice bowel movement at 9. My only wish is that I could wake up before 11.
---
The second I say I like fo76 anywhere they always jump to "BuT yOu WoUlD LiKe 3 oR nV oR 4 BeTtEr" or "YoU ProBaBly HaVnt PlAyed ThE OtHeR FaLlOuTs" ***I have played all of those games***
---
Try server hoppin it might spawn you at your last checkpoint letting you do the other part of the quest. I’ve had to do it some much
---
it's also rng - few days ago I've checked to misc tab and found 3 broken cameras there - I must have looted them from the world - either from enemies or containers.
---
Well I have a random encounter map so ill check that place out tonight. Anything is better thannothing at this stage!
---
You didn't take a Yao Guai??!! How come?
---
As much as I like a pooch, I need something that can also do some mobile defence. I managed to snag a snallygaster once, and noticed that it hangs around near the camp deployment item at all times, even teleporting through walls to do so.
---
With my current camp, I have a good place to put it so that it essentially can provide further support to the full base
---
Will you be on later today (after 6:00pm EST)? PSN name?
---
Well I never met any of them then. I mean after ban wave hit everyone that I knew duped was still playing like normal but then again Im sure only a few went to severe extremes like duping ultracite ammo, they did dupe 300k plus of ultricate scrap though and didn't get banned.
---
That's one of the things I loved about the previous PC fallouts (and f4 for console too); All the bonus stations I could add in
---
There's only one such mod for 76 so far, and while it's an improvement, id love to see more!
---
The handmade
---
yep, that is annoying. I've been using the checklist for google drive on my phone but mostly just taking pictures of every animal, robot and location
---
Yeah but only at CAMP/workshops.
---
&gt; maybe you should have made sure who you're buying from is reputable...
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; idk how the F76 markets are set up, but the ones I've been in there are reputation systems/checks in place, and they work rather well
---
The going rate on reddit was 200c however since the vendor cap limit update you can now sell them to the vendor bots for 440-500c so i would expect player vending to have them at 500c but it really shouldn't be more than that
---
Did you ever get an answer to this question? No luck finding the code, keep wasting the cards.
---
You lose the extra weight when you jump out of the armor or die.  Only way to get it back is to log back in while wearing the armor.
---
And if you look in the pipboy, class freak doesn't reduce the extra drain from moving
---
I never thought about that because everytime I spawn a few meters away from my house but maybe other people spawn inside.
---
Electronic Arts.
---
I bought it out of a player's vending machine and it did the same thing.
---
i wasn’t an eagle scout, just a first class and it’s probably why i love this dlc so much, the atomics fan badge reminded me of the nuclear science merit badge i actually got, there should be more real life boy scout type badges like, rifle shooting and american history (some sort of pre war history museum?) they did a good job on nailing the merit badges though. i just wish you could show them on the pioneer scout uniform, show off what you’ve done and stuff
---
When you buy plans from him (one set for you, other for resale on second encounter), there is little sense of finding him - most people already have the plans, so I don't even bother.
---
People charge random prices it seems. Last night the cheapest I saw was 450 and I sell mine for 199. I figure a large majority of the player base isn’t on the sub Reddits and done know the “averages” things sell for.
---
I didn't know this. Thanks
---
Race on our bhramin
---
Only use perks directly related too damage especially on a bloodied build
---
The way its done is stupidly easy lol. How BGS allowed it to happen is beyond me
---
I don't have anything to compare it to really. I always use VATS.
---
Not sure what rng means. I don’t see any mention of cameras, broken or otherwise, in my misc. I already completed this quest with my other character, but I stumbled upon a tourist purely by accident. Lol.
---
It's still pretty good, combining it with spamming med items you are still hard as fuck to kill outside of VATs
---
THE MARKET PRICE FOR MUTATION SERUMS IS 200 CAPS
---
Marsupial and adrenal reaction are a little more expensive, you can charge 250-300
---
What drives me bonkers is I would totally buy mutation recipes, whose price is 3500 caps, but no one sells them.
---
😅 well I managed to figure it out awhile ago
---
I was shooting Scorched in a barrel last night.
---
Ah thanks. I was mostly going to do it for the possum badge and I want to do it at least once.
---
Jumping between the steel beams, some of the seemingly too steep ones work as stairs too. Marsupial, goat legs, and bird bones helped too.
---
it supposedly progresses faster if moving over when not moving, at least that's the idea I got about it
---
Maybe they meant bloodied explosive? I have a bloodied nonexplosive level 35 gauss that can deal 624.
---
Handmade. Check out:
---
https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html
---
Now unless you get a legendary combat rifle that fits your build perfectly.... its generally the handmade. I spent the last 3 days on this site comparing builds and rifles.
---
But have a go and compare some things you are considering.
---
I sell marsupial, speed demon, talons, plague walker, bird bones and adrenaline in my machine. They go from 333 to 444 depending on my flux supply.
---
If you gave them out to players who didn't already find the corpse, then how would they justify the quest that comes with the camera? After all, the quest revolves around the holotape and note you find on the corpse of the tourist, and it's your job to finish their Bucket List. But if a person was given the camera by another player, then the quest wouldn't make any sense. Besides, the broken cameras are Miscellaneous items and don't weigh anything, so it's whatever.
---
I need some survivability perks in my opinion! And I’m also going to basically be one shoting everything so I don’t think I need more dmg personally but let me know what you think!
---
If you have a full set of unyielding so you max out charisma it costs about 17500 but yeah, super expensive
---
I don’t think we can stress the handmade enough
---
Well hopefully we can have this issue resolved soon.
---
lol I am glad I found someone who understands how simple this is to create a code to do it. But yea a simple line of code to look through all players stash box weights and add to a list if above 800 to be banned isn't hard for someone barely starting out in programming.
---
How is the lens? I'm not too fussed with the backpack mods so was thinking about getting it.
---
Try spamming the interract button. Sometimes it works.
---
hm you can do that now yeah
---
The last time I saw the lemonade vendor, I bought the plans and sold them in my vending machine for 150 or 200 caps (I don't recall) and they sold within an hour or two. It's anecdotal, but it seems there's some interest.
---
/r/fo76bazaar
---
I really only play pve and am able to do fine with chameleon! Yes there is a big benefit to having unyielding but it won’t help me that much! I’m not going to use vats unless I absolutely need to do I don’t think I need buffed stats!
---
Edit: but yes I will use more mutations! Which do you recommend!
---
That's a good idea!
---
Fasnacht in july!
---
On this weapon it's going to be a mat whore.  With a higher degradation rate of other weapons, plus adding in explosive makes it even faster (I have a two shot so it's even faster!)
---
Best thing to do is slap the forceful stock on it and stock pile plastic and crystals or farm SBQs.   
---
I've found I only use the laser rifle as kind of a back up or if I really need to use it.
---
But Class Freak reduces that.
---
&gt;They drop deathclaw hands, not hide. If you can any find evidence of the existence of hide, please let me know. 
---
I've gotten three Deathclaw Hides over the last four days. 
---
None were from killing Deathclaws mind you, although I've only killed one or two. They were all found in the environment, in containers or on top of tables.
---
The most dangerous part is the sheepsquatch but not him himself. It's the 3 sting wings that spawn AFTER squatch appears. Someone needs to protect the cows.
---
This group of replies is proof that Fallout 76 is not just being played by little kids. Lol. I Love it.
---
I don’t blame you lol. Most of my stuff is pretty cheap. Majority of plans are 30 caps except for jet packs that I sell at a flat 1500. Then ammo is only 1 cap per, and flux I sell for 50 caps.
---
Well, then the delivery of the quest would either be really weird, or it wouldn't happen at all, since the whole point of the quest is reliant on the player finding the tourist corpse and finishing the Bucket List found on their body.
---
Hopefully we get one with each seasonal DLC, so with Nuclear winter we might get a midsummer celebration, with the Wastelanders DLC we could get Halloween and with whatever DLC comes next after that we could get a proper Christmas and New Years celebrations.
---
Pretty sure the roadmap says 13th.
---
It definitely takes a lot more than walking would. IMO the thirst, hunger, and spoil hit you take from fast traveling is way more costly than the measly 20 something caps.
---
Duped items break faster
---
This is what needs to happen in my opinion. All they need is to have the armor pen apply to them and they will be as viable as ballistics. No need to create more perk card swapping.
---
I feel the same way. Also almost every night I’m running into the same people I met/ bought from the night before. It’s really cool to see familiar faces too
---
Oooo or these bosses are the baseline result of dropping nukes in other specific areas such as how we trigger the SBQ event by dropping a nuke on fissure prime. Rather than these regional bosses just existing already they have to be specifically triggered a la nuke hence why they are giant-sized and/or significantly different from the other creatures/enemies (Because giant-sized, even more mutated/scorched versions of Super Mutant Behemoths or an Abomination-like Scorched ghoul would be pretty sweet as well) we encounter in those various regions giving us more reason and variety to our nuke drops instead of just bouncing back and forth between Fissure Prime and Whitesprings.
---
Next time I see this.. I'm dropping an orbital beacon.
---
the answer is to not play this broken "game"
---
I'm a lvl 51 noob myself (I own too many games) and came across a lvl 15 yesterday. 
---
I crafted him a souped up 99 dmg hunting rifle and some leather armor.
---
He spammed the shit out of the heart emote after.
---
Honestly, I don't care if the game gets boring once I finish the main quest. I have gotten tons of hours out of it so I got my money's worth. And while I usually prefer SP games I have to admit the benefit of it being MP and them having to continually support it is it keeps getting new features to have fun with.
---
500 caps for  a 3 star piece of armor.  Might consider it -- that's 24 scrip for 500 caps, or about 21 caps per scrip.
---
That's probably worth it (to me).
---
But then again, the iron law of the market is that if it isn't selling, it's too expensive.
---
Not sure if sarcastic, but I do like this these days as I've been burning through ultracite fast from producing and selling serums. Scorchedbeasts are a treat from that perspective.
---
To me the most annoying are still morerats because they slip through base defenses and immediately go for food crops then get blown up by my rocket turrets. The rocket turret is effective but I think it's doing more collateral damage to my own property than the molerats. But then the rocket turrets are also awesome at sniping super mutants and scorched humans before they get close.
---
I've got several grenade plans (I don't think plasma was one, but not 100% sure).  No idea where I got them.  I put them up for sale, but don't know if they were drops or rewards, or how rare or useful they are, so pricing then is a crapshoot.
---
We need to find a way to make a list of what things are vendor (now), and what things are drop from various things (events, holidays, container-only, etc.)
---
Anti-Armor Faster Firerate - Handmade or Combat Rifle
---
I tried some chems too and nobody was buying.
---
And try building something atop of it. The security will love you
---
I have my garden of crops built within the back of my base, I left a section with no foundation for this. I rather random players not touch my crops, and so I lock my door beyond my main entrance where I keep all crafting stations and the vending machines available for everyone. I also have my switch back in the locked area that turns on and off my marker on the map for the VMs and also my garage door.
---
Top right corner of the map I've had my best luck. Got a deathclaw near the Vertibot crash site, not at it, but closer to the fissure site. Got my sloth on the road under a train track bridge near a spot with a bunch of vile ticks.
---
This needs to happen!
---
Ik i sold 10k fushion cells and only got 3.5k
---
Trade them in for scrip and your always get a 3 star when the vendor comes
---
Scrip and atoms are the only thing worth anything now
---
Take the perk off
---
Ah, but the market has changed.  The buyers are no longer the same people.
---
Drifter outfit.
---
That makes way too much sense!
---
Ok will do thank you
---
If you really want to get them angry, walk around with your cell phone on. Someone will eventually come track you down and make you turn it off.
---
I tried but will try again thank you
---
You’re right about me not giving opinions on stuff, but that was partly because I was getting an onslaught of messages calling me both a shill and hater and it was exhausting at the time. Although, I definitely gave my opinions on duping in that it was bad. Perhaps in the first video I didn’t (??) but over my several videos on duping in the game I was pretty clear in how bad it was for the community and how poorly Bethesda handled it initially. 
---
I’m also wondering how you think my content could improve further? You describe it as still being fairly low quality, but what about it makes you feel that way?
---
Is it that bad? I don’t really notice these things, what should I be looking out for?
---
This only applies if your camp isn’t self elevated.
---
Which one? I unequipped all INT perk cards beside gunsmith and it still gave me over conditioned weapon - bug?
---
You have been visited by "DEEZ NUTZ" on Mon 13 May.
---
Could you spell out the acronym please?
---
Know what you mean and no, it’s not currently in game
---
That's the thing, the enemy spawn comes exactly with the player fast traveling in, when I first saw this it looked like a player was attacking my base with a pack of trained wolves.
---
Sure
---
It sadly is
---
Could be worse. When I was just messing around with it, I have a couple random pictures of close up rocks and half walls from my camp. They're basically the equivalent of when someone doesn't know what they're doing and they hit the button and flash themselves in the face when looking in the lens.
---
I mean a tech reason.
---
Thank you.
---
1. Harpers Ferry. The building with the hole in the wall in front of you when you spawn in has display cases that spawn plans. One on each floor.
---
2. Camp Venture. The central part where the scorched are. Each building has a plan spawn. Look on the rusty metal shelves.
---
Thx for the heads up😊
---
Well, damn. I'm level 130 and have yet to get Marsupial or Bird Bones (or any good mutations, for that matter). Mutations for me are so rare, I only get like one every 20 levels and it's usually Herd Mentality or Egghead or some BS like that.
---
I totally agree with you. While it's nice that we have a use for unwanted legendary stuff it's a bit too random to be useful imo. I'd like to be able to craft the perfect weapon rather then pray to the rng god's.
---
I have three vendors in my CAMP, and all three are priced set in a "roleplaying" manner. In short.. they don't make sense. Some stuff that should be cheap isn't.... and some that should be super expensive, is rock bottom cheap.
---
Ya survivability would relate to damage output, but canibal using perks for carry weight things like that that aren’t related to combat are a waste.
---
At the end of the day it’s your character don’t let y opinion budge you on how you play but I like as much effectiveness in combat at possible
---
Yes, I could sell them to the vendor, but I have enough other things to sell already. Also, robots don't ~~get addicted~~ appreciate my fine products, not good for my business!
---
You can alse use E if your pc. This works for me sometimes
---
It would be even better if we could build ten and use just one to collect all that water (in Fallout 4 you can use console commands to make the water production higher than the game intended. This way you can have one purifier instead of 10 cluttering up the settlment). Not suggesting we get the use of console commands, just saying that if you have built 10 it's a shame we have to PUT UP 10, can't we just have the water collected from 10 all go to just one
---
Immersion be damned I want this!
---
Top tier weapons and explosive lazers i tried to sell mine and its no good now
---
Indoor garden.
---
Itll end eventually and the market will level out just like the first big wave. Some people are saying that Bethesda planned this on purpose to shake up the current market. No evidence actually points to that but people can draw conclusions.
---
It's a random quest item for finding the missing camper.  Only shows if it is needed.  Completed the event 5 times and only saw it once.
---
I wouldn't hate building in this game so much if I hadn't used mods and console commands in Fallout 4. I like being able to put things where I want to put them or at least some semblence. Even vanilla building in 4 is better than 76 and I understand WHY things are so wonky but I hate it. I don't even bother to build. I use pre-existing structures to lighten the stress lol
---
The going rate on Reddit might be 200 Caps, but you're standing in front of *my* vending machine and you can have it *right now*, so I think that's worth something.  If I can go down to a vendor and sell them for 480 Caps, I'm not going to let them go for significantly less than that, not just because I want the Caps, but because I don't want you to go and pocket the 280 caps I could have made.
---
So, I sell them for 450 apiece.  I don't have trouble selling the Marsupials.  Twisted Muscles was always kind of niche.  The lack of Adrenal Reaction sales kind of surprises me though.
---
Its funny cause... its not just players either. Mobs spawn in the house or in the foundation. Watched a deathclaw go around in circles in one guys place. I couldnt kill it though, every time I was able to target he would turn and I would lose target.
---
I believe it's a bug, you learn the recipe automatically and get to keep a copy. Trading the copy to someone else makes them learn it too
---
People are scum and will do anything in order to cheat, even if it takes more effort than actually doing it the correct way
---
Mine has more damage while aiming lol
---
This information is wrong buddy you aren’t being scammed you just need a disk on console this isn’t PC
---
hopefully you reported all that in detail to the devs
---
You've clearly never known the joy of owning a pet rock
---
Maybe, but I am already selling the item for less than a days dole of caps. It takes me more time to find a decent item to sell than to raise the caps to buy it. So I won't be lowering my prices too much.
---
Valid point, hadn't thought of that. But worse case scenario they harvest a bit and it grows back
---
You can always buy serums that grant you the desired mutation, people tend to sell them in their camps for just a couple of hundred caps, then you just lock them in with the perk and you are golden.
---
Got a mr fuzzy for 1000 caps yesterday 
---
Some bos plans for 500
---
Some legendary 3 stars for under 1000 caps 
---
I’m liking this lol
---
How do you know why lunch boxes never happened? Perhaps it didn’t happen literally because of the backlash. There is 0 proof of that, but it’s not like I was just making shit up around the lunch boxes. They existed in the game, they were seemingly planned at some point, but never ended up getting added.
---
The most recent BR rumors stem from voice files available online. My video is irrelevant to it outside of the fact other people aren’t going to want to listen to hours or voice files. What I’m saying is if you think it’s untrustful since I’m the source I would encourage you to listen to the 330 files yourself and come to your own opinion. Maybe it ends up being nothing or very different from what it looks like, but I don’t think the current evidence lends itself to that.
---
Two pet-rocks doing the horizontal landslide.
---
But... think of all of the debris on the tracks, like all of the destroyed boxcars. It would take a long time to clear all that.
---
I will be picking up 2* range weapons till I get some weapons worth a fudge
---
How many 1\* Wood will you get when you pick the 2\* or 3\* armor roll?
---
Hi i know it coud be a dump question but will bethesda delet all the duped weappns in the next patch becouse i will wait for it ... I don't want to buy duped weapons 😭
---
If food spoils then how can I wander into a random farm house and find a pumpkin pie just sitting on the table. Shouldn't all unprocessed food have been spoiled prior to us entering the world? :)
---
Do the drop tables/rates ever get updates in the patches?   Are they still super rare,  i've been doing all the mire events I see,  with no luck,  yet...
---
No one said you needed to be here. So if it is a circle jerk you remain involved.
---
Yeah I've been trying to take this into account. I tend to play for long sessions after work so I'll take breaks and leave my character snoozing or chilling with an instrument in my camp.
---
Intelligence itself also contributes to condition.
---
Dude, I heard there is a really fast way to fix prices. Like ludicrously fast. I've been using this exploit pretty much since launch. If you fast travel to a vendor bot, then turn off the game and never play it again, you will not have wasted any more of your life on that pile of garbage.
---
Weapon artisan, with high intelligence when you craft a crossbow it'll be over 100 anyway, as long as you don't have weapon artisan it will only repair to 100% after that
---
If you have the kills and just need to repair crossbows, just make the lowest level and bash things, they break in no time
---
Edit: also they only need a tiny bit of condition missing and it still counts as repairing
---
Fire!!!!
---
Been doing that,  he’s never had the coat though which has become mildly annoying.
---
but I'm having fun though
---
The owner's spawn point and a visitor's are different from each other. The camp machine is a pain in the ass to figure out its spawning rhythm.
---
welcome back! they've been making changes with each patch to reduce the vectors that griefers can use. now essentially, if you have pacifist mode on and you don't shoot back, there's (nearly) no way for people to kill you. there's probably some loophole they will eventually discover but hopefully Bethesda will then fix that in the next patch.
---
my guess is griefers will just get bored and quit, if they really wanted a fair fight they would move to Survival mode instead of Adventure mode. but they don't want a fair fight.
---
I think it will give you the item with the stars you pick. The choice of 23 Legendary effects will be interesting
---
You can’t be this stupid 😂
---
It is really hard to compare 3 and NV to 76 because 76 really is its own beast. Two are SP games and one is an MP game, that difference alone means you're trying to compare apples and oranges. And 76 isn't trying to be an rp game (though ironically if they ever give us private servers some one could set up a strict rp community that would make it more roleplaying focused than an SP game could be in the first place).
---
I prefer my fallouts have more RPG. NV was my favorite game. I just see 76 as being apart from the other fallotus (so I don't even rate it with the other fallouts to be honest). What I felt about NV and other fallouts doesn't ruin how much fun I'm having in 76 \*shrug\*.
---
But looking at it from some one who is mostly playing it SP,  while I prefer my fallouts have strong RPG, one thing I'll say about 76 is it is bethesda focusing more on their strengths. Bethesda does actually do decent story writing, just not in where people usually look for it in Fallout games. Their writing is great in the little side stories and snippets you find that paint a picture of the pre apocalpyse world. Except with 76 now you are getting a picture of what happened right after the apocalypse when people first tried to rebuild as well as the story of the area before the bombs hit. And they do a great job with story as a reward for exploration (Something they got weak in 4 and was a complaint of mine but seem to have improved again in 76).
---
Personally, I think a world where there aren't NPCs fits Bethesda's strengths perfectly.
---
And honestly I think you're missing that Bethesda has kept working on it and they have introduced a lot of good stuff to the game (yes, they did a lot of missteps at launch). Granted I'm not a fan of them going back on their cosmetic only MTs promise (trust me I've ranted a lot on that and Bethesda now won't be getting any more money from this game from me cause of that), but other than that I think they've been doing pretty good lately.
---
Also... if you are going to complain about how unstable it was at launch, it's a fucking Bethesda game. What the hell did you expect? If you liked their previous games it seems a bit hypocritical to all the sudden decide that's something to dislike them over now. Hell, Bethesda has done a better job of continiously working on fixing bugs on this game than they have on their previous games (true, it's cause it is an mp game and they plan on it running for a long time because they want that microtransaction money to keep rolling. But that doesn't change the fact that they honestly have done more bug fixing and will continue supporting 76 where as they only do some for their previous games before moving on).
---
I might of wasted my caps on xbox looking for group someone sold me a whole assasin sent set for 16k 😰😰😰
---
Thanks for the congrats, and thanks carrying on the tradition. I'm sure it's frustrating, and I know you don't get the thanks you deserve. As a scout, you don't really recognize the benefit until much later. I was basically done after I made Eagle. Never tried for palms. Took about 5 years before I realized that I had gained alot from my time in Souting. Personally, I love the fact that, even at 27, the taught line hitch is one the most beneficial skills that I have. It never ceases to amaze me how much people rely on tensioning equipment.
---
If it’s properly done and balanced I would definitely play it. If being the key word.
---
Diversify your portfolio.  You can't rely on government regulation, or bailouts. Live free or die...
---
i only recently learned (was told by other kind folks) that i could learn how to make these -- use the terminal to the right of the door at Defiance, if you're unsure what we're talking about. i had never used that until well over level 100 heh. but yeah, what a great weapon for people to start out with!
---
I’m on PS4 also been looking for something like this for a while.
---
[uhm](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4VcAAHw7mZY/maxresdefault.jpg)
---
What's this product they lied about? The bag?
---
Don't paper bags despawn if no one is in the area after a short while? Or was that changed with a patch?
---
my priority will be a ranged weapon..
---
I'll admit, I just love getting compliments about my CAMP. I worked hard on it, put in literal hours, and it's nice that people are seeing it. Granted, I tried to make it very easy to find my vending machines and people don't get stuck since my building is suspended in the air and uses two foundation blocks. I had to sacrifice a bit on the look of my CAMP because people were having to jump onto my platform instead of using the stairs, which you can't do without marsupial, so that kinda sucked.
---
One guarantees legendary for scrips. Tones of aid and badges. This evet i pure gold for grinders.
---
RNG is random generated numbers, but in this game means just random.
---
the loot that the game gives you from the Overseer's cache is instanced, but what players put in there is visible to other players (as far as i understand it). it has a size limit though, e.g. it seems i can put in 5 pieces of leather armor and a weapon but when i try to put in more i get a message 'Loot Bag is full'
---
10% of 220 is 22.
---
I've been farming that area a while. Usually walking down the road, killing the wendigos from the trees and hoping there's an encounter.
---
I usually go as far as the crash site, as the further one is too close to the fissure and whatever spawns there has to get past a Scorchbeast and the scorched so a tall order
---
I agree that this sub gets crazy with this stuff, but don’t you agree this is a bit different? We know for a fact a new game mode is on the way, there are hundreds of voice lines around a game mode, the purpose of the vault in question is a survival of the fittest. I personally think it’s a bummer that people will invariably just write this mode off since it will be dubbed just another BR. From what I’ve seen and heard it seems like it’ll be really cool and I’m excited for it.
---
cool
---
Done. Thx!
---
I think you \*either\* get something cool (like a recipe or pemmican or whatever) \*or\* you get a badge.
---
thank you, i do what i can. now i need to find a home for a lvl50 PA set i made :)
---
We're still looking into this, In the meantime, if you are on PC can you validate your game files and tell me if that fixed it?
---
I tested this with my alt. Was scared to disconnect the wiring and not be able to run it again, but you are right it worked and have the wall back in. Thanks!
---
Same here, makes it super easy. Good share.
---
Looking for a 3 star Legendary Ranged weapon, actually more than one for different situations.
---
Have the exact opposite problem :)
---
350
---
I've just played a lot in this weekend and in like 10h the game only crashed once! Thank you!  
---
Later i'll try to disable it to see if it is crashing less because of fixes on the latest patch or if it is the SpeedStep (or both)
---
I'll be at 1000 Scrip by Wednesday and plan to throw all of it into the Mystery option.
---
I have everything I really need as far as armor and weapons, I just want to see what crazy 3 star rolls I can get.
---
go to the palace of the winding wind, there is a archery area where u can find a crossbow with low durability that's where I got mine since I keep crafting over dur crossbows &gt;.&lt;
---
Most definitely agree they nailed merit badges. The "grindy" nature of some of the challenges really represents the  depth of knowledge required by the real deal, IMO.
---
And yes yes yes to the display. Even if I can't have it on my uniform, give me a board or something for my CAMP. I'd happily set up a little PSA corner.
---
I honestly don't know.  I've been scrapping Legendaries I don't need because, well, I don't have the space for them anyway.  But in terms of actually playing the Murmrgh slot machine, the likelihood of meaningful advancements to my character is so small now that I think I'm inevitably going to be disappointed by it, if only because you have absolutely no control over the effects, or even the *what* in anything more than the vaguest armor/gun/melee sense.
---
You can get better repair kits off Queen. 
---
You won’t change his mind though. The launch for this game was terrible, and anyone who was turned off will stoop to every excuse to not play it or think it’s bad. It’s how it is.
---
Something good for people who are unarmed spec
---
That’d be great, I hate when I put two directly next to each other and one is inevitably placed higher or lower than the other.
---
Bethesda is stepping up just enough to keep us interested, just in time too because i was about to bail. Things are looking up/ wasn't sure if Beth was going to pull support and just let the game die or not lol. It sure seemed like it for a hot minute but now it's becoming quite lively and busy
---
It puts you pretty close to where you originally put down your camp, like within 2 steps. I had a friend help figure out the exact position players spawn in, but it only takes a few minutes waiting at your camp if you have vending set up, someone will show up.
---
I basically built my entrance around the player spawn, so they are outside, built platforms in front of them and put 3 vending right there, so they see them right away.
---
I think if a player puts the vending somewhere too difficult to find, players quickly give up. I spawned at my buddies camp and he had a multi story base with his vending far below where it spawns you, in a very hard to find location- basically not in or outside of any of his building, but on the ground next to the water.
---
The quicker they can find vending the more likely you'll make a sale. I don't want to spend 5 minutes searching for your vending machines, put it right next to where players spawn.
---
Still, that's if I can find the Serum at their camp (which for me doesn't always seem to be the case), and I also need to use the perk card to keep it, which takes up half of my precious 4 points of luck that I could use Level 3 of Bloody Mess with instead of. Actually, I've come to the realization that mutations aren't that viable for me and my character.
---
That, or I'm just a lazy bastard.
---
Still, thanks for taking the time to reply! Maybe when I make a new character, I'll base it more around the use of mutations.
---
complains about aimbot.........in a game with vats 🤔
---
Love that you consider census violence to be a good event. I never see anyone else doing it.
---
No! Don't do this! Painstakingly lining up these bastards is 80% of my game at the moment!
---
Don't deprive me of this simple pleasure/acute pain!
---
I got a 1* rolling pin from the SBQ last night.
---
Yeah, not the easiest. I think I had gotten lucky with those two as I didn't have to server hop a ton for them. I also no longer have a pet since my slith never came along to my new CAMP location and haven't found anything I've wanted to tame since then. Maybe they've made that more difficult since my last one.
---
true, but it happens very often :/
---
See my edit.
---
glad to find another kind soul. i'm lucky i guess, i don't recall anyone specifically targeting me like this, but i've been running with a group who has been quite vehemently anti-griefer. if we find anyone doing shady things we go after them. thankfully, the game is slowly eliminating the ways you can be a jerk in Adventure mode.
---
Sooo..
---
How is your Norwegian ?   :D
---
I say that cause it always has a Legendary enemy
---
I am an unbelievable coward, and have exceptionally poor decision-making when I'm under stress. I'm nearly certain that as soon as  someone offed me (a very likely outcome, since I'm a 50 year old man with stroke damage in my WASD hand) I'd make it my life's quest to "make him pay", losing thousands of caps in the process. I just wouldn't know when to cut my losses. Hell, I was in survival with a new character and died 6 times trying to retrieve my loot bag which had 3 steel in it.
---
No, it's not about time Fallout did too. I want more single player fallouts that do that (and I like 76 but I honestly find your post just as obnoxious as the guy hating on 76). It's an RPG and it is what made it so popular in the first place. Just because you don't care for RPG as much doesn't mean that Fallout needs to evolve to meet what you want. Maybe you should be playing other games that more fit your needs rather than saying a series should change what it is to fit what you want. This is like going to COD and saying I don't like FPS and want more RPG... you should evolve to be an RPG. It's ok that a game series isn't what you want and caters to fans that like it for what it is. Really. That's not evolution for it to change what type game it is. 
---
76 is an offshoot and I'm fine with that. I really do enjoy the game. But yes, I'll be pissed if Bethesda decides to stop even bothering with single player Fallouts in favor of just doing more like 76.
---
Because Pumpkin Pies are magical, thats why.
---
(Couldn't come up with a better reason, and didn't wanna openly admit that you're right. Which you are.)
---
A 2nd person
---
Yes (If we don't include the state of the game at launch as it was released as a 'finished product').
---
They only reversed their decision on the bag after a law firm started proceedings against them for false advertising.
---
I had that happen too when I disconnected. I had to have to put all 120 items back in and re-price them....
---
that's cool! wow i would love some help when that happens. i put my CAMP near lucky hole &amp; defiance, and sometimes i get one or two SB's from Line in the Sand flying out over my camp. glad you jumped in to help!
---
finally I will now be able to go the dks on my cranberry bog only ultimate ironman
---
MORE REASONS TO DROP NUKES. NUKE THE WHALES!!!!
---
I'm not sure if the chameleon effect stacks with each other so you may be better with one piece and other effects for the rest.
---
I use them all except twisted muscles, talons and herbivore. I believe the negative effects of the others are mostly negligible with the right perks. The only one that has a noticeable downside imo is speed demon which will make you thirsty more.
---
Check your maths....you are not calculating 10% of 220....you are calculating 110% of 200 = 220
---
200 = reddit price for serums
---
10% = FO76 tax
---
200 x 110% = 220Caps
---
Same. Cannot do it. One of the easiest challenges too. Fack.
---
I've had them since Patch 9 went live and have been wondering if others are also having this issue, so I'm glad to see your post. I've tried changing various display settings, but nothing in my control seems to affect the dashes.
---
YES! awesome. when i pick up lvl5 or 10 weapons from scorched i like to mod them up and drop them for people.it makes such a difference in the beginning. thanks for helping :)
---
You have to buy the plans for the individual letters, I found mine at a player vender. 😊
---
Do you think Bethesda will ever give us the option to re-roll our items? I have a 3 Star Legendary Bloodied Power Fist but I want Swing speed instead of power attack.
---
That would things more interesting.
---
RC
---
Bloodied, explosive, weight reduction (or 2*) flamer or bloodied, Explosive/faster fire rate, -15% reload .50.
---
No, they do despawn eventually. But they can linger quite a while. But I still drop a Bobby pin it makes me feel better, and the despawning is also a reason I leave close doors open and vice versa just to confuse!
---
I've only met a few who I knew were major dupers. I didn't catch either dupers name so I have no idea if they were banned but one of them said all his friends were banned for having over 100K inventory. He felt he was safe as he was under that limit. 
---
He was very polite and stopped one shot blasting the bosses at Uranium Fever when I asked him to stop.
---
O.o
---
I'm going to keep that calculator in mind.
---
Yeah, no idea what it looks like, but I'm interested. How much?
---
Value =/=  level and rarity
---
Multi star items can’t currently be checked unless the owner is nearby.
---
If you’re selling,  for instance, a two shot prime handmade and it’s only 1* then there’s no need to worry as you can see all the legendary perks.
---
The trolls never stood a chance, Bethesda destroyed this game in ways that no consumer ever could lol.
---
The "market" was getting out of hand, literally last night I paid 37k caps for some unyeilding armor, good stuff for sure, but it's nuts that prices have flown so high it takes a total of 5-6 characters to complete a transaction.
---
It works with other things that die but not a vertibot because it removes its presence as a valid object in the world when it blows up.
---
Yes this one really irritated me.  I have played the game 100% solo thus far and love it.    
---
I'm not about to change that now.   I guess no backpack for me unless Bethesda hears the complaints and provides a path for solo players to complete the quest.
---
ohhhhhhhhhh
---
Yeah I was browsing through all sorts of assassin's this and bloodied that wondering, well, I can't inspect it so I have no idea what the other two stars are.
---
Fast travel between train stations should be free.
---
If its one of the locations of "that" map out there about locations for the cameras, then yes... Tbh I dont remember all the locations name's
---
Oh okay, yeah I figured the spawn location was determined, not random. 
---
Unrelated, but I found out you can move the C.A.M.P. object after it is placed, but that shouldn't impact the spawn location unless you replaced the whole thing. 
---
I totally agree with the "finding the vendor" part. It's ultra convenient  when you spawn right in front of the terminal - and it will have a direct impact on sales.
---
You'll want Adrenal Reaction. Also you really need Unyielding gear.
---
Acknowledging that Survival is a thing (and Nuclear Winter will eventually be), I still think of 76 as a predominantly "solo" adventure game, and when I see players cheat, dupe, and in many cases pay real money for these things, it baffles me.  It's like pay-to-win Fallout 4, or bloody Solitaire.  I don't see the point.
---
Lol good job wasting your orbital strikes.
---
Combination wrenches, tin cans, and rat poison are three good lead sources just off the top of my head.
---
That is part of the coveted SBQ regalia along with the magnificent Armor of The Woods.
---
No, throwing your loyalty behind a mediocre game to the point that you can't stand anyone making fun of it means you do
---
oooh smart
---
I used to do the same thing, together with a note that read ”IOU TP”.
---
Thank you everyone. He is now in the game. Good work all!
---
The 10% that is paid is based on the sale price. If you sell something at 220caps ten percent of 220 is 22.
---
Adrenal.
---
I gave mine as a welcome back gift to a friend coming back to the game, with a 3* tse Gatling and a few other things.. poor guy didn't make it past level 70 before him and his friends gave up. Trying to set him up for success!
---
Agreed. And one of the great things I like about atomic shop skins is that it's hard to drop them, they don't show on the menu to scrap, scrip, and sell.
---
i've dropped a bag outside of 76 when i see someone inside and waited around chameleon for them to come out. yeah it's probably creepy but i want to make sure the bag doesn't disappear if i leave that tile (or does being in 76 count as that tile being occupied?) 
---
one of my favorites is to pick up military fatigues every time i'm dropping off technical data for the BoS at Camp Venture, mod them with resistant lining and put that in the bag for the new player. some resistant underarmor for baseline DR is something i didn't even think about until i got up there in levels, having it at the start (plus the couple of SPECIAL boosts) would have been awesome!
---
Lights and turrets take up large amounts of camp budget.
---
My tip jar has a frog in it.  His name is prince and he's a noisy little bugger.  Especially when you get his jar next to his brother's jar....also named prince.  My character is not very original when it comes to naming frogs apparently.
---
This would fit well with my cat, bunny and sheepsquastch plushes on top of my vending machines.
---
I can get up to 52 when in a group while using hard bargain and magnetic personality. I also have 9 charisma, so that might help.
---
My vending machine sells shielded marine wetsuits which i craft and all 3 bos plans, heavy leather plans, heavy combat plans that i buy/hop from grafton station. Single plans can only be displayed but i promptly restock because players accidentally buy multiple plans lately. I saw a camp at whitespring station selling 3 star explosive weaponS one was a aae handmade 25,000 caps and 3 players guarding the camp heavily. I think they pooled their best stock to world hop vendor which is cool.
---
Just you know remove all the random decor
---
Awww I know that feeling. I keep trying to entice my BETA buddy back and he's like "NO! It's boring as HELL, I can't even!"  *le sigh*
---
It's not currently in the game, but it has been established that it's an *outfit*, not actual new armor.
---
Taking drugs can make you thirsty also
---
nooooooooooo
---
Happened to my group yesterday; we had a group of 7 and was trying to let everyone have their turn at the vendor when some griefer walked up and shot it dead. I imagine it’s just sad, lonely people who do this kind of thing.
---
How much you want for it? Gave mine to a friend returning to the game yesterday, but think it could be cool if we can show up matching as we clear out the wasteland!
---
Ps4? I have a spare
---
World bosses would be great, especially if they were leveled in a way that people would still want to kill the forest and toxic valley ones after level 50. I love the forest but I just don't have much reason to go back there on my high level characters other than for just exploring and getting scrap (to be clear I still like doing just that but higher incentives are always better)
---
I want a 🐈
---
Constantly. 
---
I've spent a lot of time this weekend fine tuning where my camp is and making sure nobody will get spawn stuck when traveling there. 
---
We need fast travel mats badly.
---
You licked the frog you were supposed to capture in the jar didn't you?
---
I've got indoor garden, lead extractor, and water purifier. Unlocked all the time. It's very rare for me to come back from wandering and not find them all at max capacity or harvestable. I know people are taking them, but they replenish before I get back. 
---
That being said folks, if you help yourself to a brahmin steak at my place, for the love of Jeebus please go outside, harvest some razorgrain and donate one damned steel to repair my brahmin pen.
---
*cries in stack of 60 compacting to one quest item in beta*
---
Can get for 17500 each with buffs
---
Lots of people trash on new games, then in a couple of years some say "it actually wasn't that bad", sometimes followed by "it was a great game!"
---
We are still in the first stage sadly.
---
Water Filters and some Serums.
---
There is something up with workshops these days I think. I was wandering about Watoga direction yesterday, minding my own, when suddenly I get a random legendary shotgun reward for clearing out a workshop, Tyler Fields I think it was. 
---
Had me baffled. I had walked past it earlier, but I didnt do anything, just walked past on my way somewhere. Not even through it. I never even knew you could get legendary items from clearing workshops! 
---
I've had the odd defend while never owning a workshop too. 
---
There was a similar thing with events too, a notification about doing one that is the other side of the map. (Not talking about the ones that actually notify you such as Encryptid, just normal ones).
---
The are two different responder bots. The merchant will have a brahmin and two eyebots
---
what?!?!?! Oh crap!
---
Remember to either scrap or use stuff in your storage
---
Different kind of data leak lol. They mean that data is popping up where it really shouldn’t, which indicates serious coding issues. Not personal information being spread without consent.
---
Yeah, it would be nice if our brahmin scale with our level, it doesn't have to be 3* Legendary Brahmin, but even like lvl 50+ would be great. Or even if it spawned level the same as enemies in that location, a lvl 3 brahim doesn't last long against lvl 68 enemies.
---
Although the brahmin is incredibly cheap to replace, and with butchers bounty I get some ribsteak out of it at least.
---
so extremely sucky
---
That would be a fun mutation. The ability to eat junk and scrap items.
---
Yea fair point on the repair kits. I agree that datamined info should be taken with a grain of salt, but the thing that peaks my interest on this is how it was 1. just added 2. lines up perfectly with leaks. 
---
I really just want to see a discussion around the voice files and what they mean. I think since there are so many and they mixed up most people are going to listen to them which is hampering that. Maybe it ends up being unused and irrelevant, but I really enjoy the speculation part and they give a lot to speculate about.
---
Bash things with it. Rips through condition super quick.
---
I agree it was getting out of hand but player vending was taking care of this in my opinion.
---
Oh
---
Just delete the photos 
---
Or fill up your photo gallery with photos you do want. You can then just take the random photo of the dead creature or whatever. It will warn you your gallery is full, but ignore it. The picture will still register for the challenge.
---
&gt;  people can kill the bitch.
---
Technically she's an ewe, not a bitch.
---
[it’s a skirt ](https://imgur.com/gallery/xmltSpo)
---
This was best answer for me thank you
---
I would love it if with future seasonal events they added a permanent change to the town. Like if for Fasnacht we got a new building that remained after the parade. Small things that make veteran players feel special for living through
---
I’m pretty sure it’s an atomic shop outfit coming up.
---
Man I glad for thing like Reddit ....either I'm too fucking blowed or I'm really dumb this morning. Couldn't figure out why it wasn't working til I opened the holotape. Bless y'all lmao
---
Don't think so
---
Exactly. I was mid-transaction when I heard him "pop" and I was suddenly out of the trade menu. My first thought was "what asshole did this?" I looked around, but there was no evidence of anyone anywhere.
---
They only banned people last time to fix server stability.
---
Go to the stream in whitesprings behind the golf club where the radstags spawn there’s a shallow stream get a friend to use a granade on himself.
---
Go and revive , quack surgeon works as well !!!
---
Not really though, people put stuff in their machine for asinine prices because there's no way to haggle them. That being said, I do like the player vendoring, I have been able to save my legendary stash and have nearly filled my scrip just by buying cheap junk legendaries from the machines.
---
I have that! Why do think that I need unyielding gear? I’ve never really thought about it!
---
Edit: and chameleon gear does stack
---
Ya this is bad real bad
---
Handmade is best, however if you have tons of .45 ammo lying around, use The fixer. In stealth is foes decent damage and unless you don't have a god roll handmade, it is usable.
---
I would believe you would have a hard time giving them away. I find so many chems in the world. There everywhere. First stop for the days cap out is all the chems in the aid tab.
---
I remain to keep people checked into reality
---
I'm glad to hear that
---
Thanks man, I'll try it. It only repairs it 100% though, doesn't it? That will probs give me an extra 10 shots ha!
---
I've watched this happen with 4 on the Fallout subreddit.  Gone from hated to rather liked now.
---
76 is going to be great when 5 comes out.
---
Yeah, that might look better on my female main char. 1000 caps?
---
yep come take it psn: wr_horst

If you wanna send me over a list then I can try it. The format is this

The ones you can't craft are the ones that sell good good for me, like psychotats, calmex and super stims (I know you can craft these but they're a pain in the ass). They sell more fluently than the other chems that are easy to farm.
---
If you mean the drifter outfit that's like the one Shank wears in fo4, I'm pretty sure it can be found just lying around in various places. I think there's one pretty consistently in the penitentiary (in a open locker in the showers section). Also, maybe one of the vendors in Whitesprings.

I have a dedicated Aid character with a bit of everything, and really cheap prices, on Xbox.
---
Sales started out great in the beginning, but quickly tailed off, I believe this is due mainly to everyone spending all their caps during the first couple of days after Player vending got started.
---
I also have dedicated Vendor Characters for Plans, Weapons, Armor (GT= More Medieval), and a 3\* only character (Medieval Mr Ed), All Shops are near the Overseer's Camp, and I alternate between them every hour or so.
---
During the first night of Player Vending  I sold over 17k in Plans, in less than an hour, but have only done about 5k since then, and my Plan prices are 50%-70% of list price for all but the really rare ones.
---
I dropped 9k on a gun just on the offchance it might also have explo on it (couldnt inspect it due to the bug obviously).    
---
    
---
It didnt.   
---
Grinding back all that cash gives me something to do, and its still a pretty decent gun. So its not the end of the world, just a bit annoying that bugs like this arent caught in the usually flawless Bethesda testing process /s
---
That worked then, but you have to remove the items from stash before selling it. You wouldn't be able to put that much weight back in once you take it out.
---
If you eat the scale, do you still have to worry about your weight for a short period of time after?
---
I feel like the possum ones will be the REAL challenge haha
---
Where is this event? And how is it triggered? I’ve never even heard of this event before, sounds interesting
---
I thought taxes wouldn't be a thing in a post apocalyptic world.. Man Bethesda sucks now.
---
After excess turrets, lights and neon signs have been scrapped should you still be struggling with budget posters, potted plants and things that require no interaction like a bed, workbench, hero statue, mothman statue, instruments etc don’t take up  much budget but anything you interact with will so they should be next on your hit list
---
No as it will be falsely advertised and customers will recieve a low quality product.
---
For the vertibot use any workshop with a landing pad get close to it and use a signal granade , as soon as it goes airborne it should be close enough to take a easy picture
---
I was talking about daylight. You’re including nighttime. 6 hours is generally half the day.
---
damn it....been losing out on a couple of CAPS each time
---
I am selling everything and buying as much gold as possible. Should have never left the gold standard!
---
I bought mine for 300 and thought that was a steal, but the value of the cap keeps changing so drastically that I don't know what a good price is anymore.
---
Hi,yes I'll be online but there's a problem.
---
I'm from Spain and between You and I there's 9 hours difference.
---
If You don't mind to wait until Friday when I'm online until late and I'll be glad to sell U any Serum you want.
---
Psn LosXorbos
---
I doubt it.
---
When I complain about the inability to do this, it's not to say "Oh, they should have done it this way."  Because I know they want to preserve randomness and prevent players from being able to obtain their perfect loadouts on-demand, because it would defeat a large part of the game.  It's more that Murmrgh's complete randomness does nothing for me.  It's just another way of acquiring a spin on the same slot machine that already has a very, very low chance of paying out for me.
---
That one caught me off guard. I shot him in the face before I could think to drop a piece of junk; good to know there's more interaction available. 
---
Have you found the injured level 1 supermutant yet? He's a hoot. Surrounded by dead supermutants riddled with sheepsquatch quills, he's limping along moaning "why a sheep...why?"
---
ah ok so posters that you can turn on and off take up a lot of budget? I have a bunch of those I could get rid of
---
How much do you want?
---
Could be. I might have missed an update to this. It would suck though if you can place things like that to make it more homie
---
My earlier math was fine, I just realised that October coming before November means it would be less. My bad. No need to be a douche.
---
I could use both better armour and weapons so it’s the bargain mystery pick for me lol
---
Lol. Yep I forgot about the 10% all together. Dang it.
---
You were right about that one actually, my bad.
---
The key part is *if* they leave it out of the blast zone. Can't tell you how many times I've seen some genius nuke the train station *and even the mine* while leaving out the Golfclub area.
---
Wait, so you're saying I can earn Possum badges doing this event multiple times? AKA I don't have to grind my soul away trying to earn the badges through those awful challenges some of which do not register properly?! PLEASE tell me this is what you meant!
---
They should make this a feature for when you take to many chems XD
---
sales*
---
Yeah its horrible, last night trying to do the Campfire Stories event, i couldnt hit anything that was flying with melee through VATS, i would get 0% every time
---
i actually found myself getting upset at the game, so I just turned it of for the night, no use raising my blood pressure over a video game
---
 /u/Ladydevann could look into this?
---
I've found the tourist on Highland Marsh, by the spot where the Mirelurk Queen spawns (beware!). Near an skeleton and the "Mirelurk Research" note. [https://imgur.com/gallery/UYmLDNd](https://imgur.com/gallery/UYmLDNd)
---
Something SUPER patriotic go go MURICA event.
---
I hope they don't pull a google doodle and just ignore it or like "here's a black ladies 146th birthday that you've never heard of"
---
I'll take your buddy who left a beer on my bed any day of the week.
---
As I said above, you can still join as an Honorary Night! For now, until we get more members, we are mainly on PC.
---
The problem is so many of the repeatable events give chems as rewards.  I have hundreds of stimpacks from Forgotten Knowledge and then got over a hundred more this weekend from farming Campfire Tales.  I have the stimpack recipe and have never even made one.
---
Any i see at 200 i buy and resell for 400. Easy money.
---
Comes with the fertilizer resource item
---
It'll be up in the mountains, yeah. I do like that it spawns you inside the mine, though.
---
Why were you such an Avid fan if they were "scripted story books with subpar story telling that existed in a stale world"
---
It was that "stale" world, and the vault dweller's lonely place in it that launched fallout. The whole point of the post apocalyptic cannon is isolation. Fallout used to live in a space that reflected that, like other works such as the last of us, I am legend, or world war z. Making it mmo breaks that for me and others killing the point of the franchise.
---
Of course, each to their own. Glad you enjoy it.
---
Then I'd need to log in every time I start the game as stated above.
---
It spawns at Camp Adams. Its on a timer from what I have seen.  Just hop servers till you find it or keep an eye on Camp Adam's for the event.
---
🙄
---
I really wish we could just buy mods and then put them on weapons and amour we want, rng just pisses me off
---
2.5k
---
yeah i hate it, my melee character is basically useless now
---
Will have a look, thanks friend!
---
Camp Adams, in the Forest! After 9:30 at night it triggers if you arrive.
---
Melee does not suck, it just takes time to level up, and ya, you die a lot in earlier levels while you learn the ropes.  there was a time I coudn't handle a group of 4 L6 scorched.  
---
I'd get killed, repeatedly.  
---
But now, I dont even think twice about going soloing against a mob of L62 scorched....with a switchblade.  
---
For a melee build, work toward maxing your strength, and getting a fast or medium speed weapon.  (Fast weapons usually have lower damage per hit, but can do more damage than a slower weapon in the same time frame.)
---
The swing speed perks (martial arist, I think), help a lot.
---
When I was your level, machete and fire axe were my primary weapons.
---
As you level up, you'll get better weapons - 
---
I'm now a L82 melee (have never used Vats), and have been through at least 8 different "primary/favorite" weapons as I have progressed though the levels.
---
Have a friend of mine thats a L100 melee and usually uses a death tambo.
---
My weapon of choice at the moment is a vampire switchbade for ground based critters.
---
It does about 100 dmg per hit, but runs 2-3 hits/second.  My AA Grognak axe does 180, but only gets one hit in the same time frame the switchblade does 3 hits....
---
Depends who you’re asking.  What’s the full stats on it? I’m looking for one
---
500
---
Have an updoot for all the extras I missed early on in game. I hope new players see this post.
---
Ironically 4th star is mods you put on your weapon, currently only 4th star is bonus damage for scorched enemies while reducing damage to normal enemies.
---
I think if you use the crossbow to melee it’ll break faster?
---
It devalues everything but it also lowers the costs it’s kind of a good thing rn two weeks ago you needed 5 characters with max caps just to buy a good weapon or armor set. It’s good that the markets deflating a little bit especially since player vending just came out. Dupers are a problem and they shouldn’t be doing it but they do help the economy, or hurt it enough to where caps actually have value
---
Honestly are you all women ? Cus you are confusing af . 
---
You complain about Duping and then turn around and complain about the rng .
---
You complain about the economy crashing and then turn around and complain about god gear costing 25k+(duping would lower prices) 
---
You say we don’t care where we go to eat and then complain that I chose the titty bar with good wings 
---
MAKE UP YOUR MIND !!!!
---
Has anyone tamed a deathclaw or mirelurk since the last patch, when they no longer became “animals”.
---
My friend’s died yesterday for no reason...
---
YES! Something that wanders in certain areas (esp those rarely visited) that you could hunt would be awesome
---
I only buy psychotats at around 10 ea. And only if low &lt; 50. That, ballistic bock, and daytripper are used at queen (daytripper sells at whitesprings, so if you can beat that maybe). If there was a way to refrigerate the vendor, scorchbeast livers/charred livers and iguana soup. The way it is now, the food spoils too quick in vending machine.
---
Thank you! Will check it out :)
---
Unfortunately yes, I had to scrap my mr pebbles to put some more things in my vending machine, the paintings are next to no budget though so you don’t have to go completely minamilist with bare walls so there is that. The Brahmin had to go too which is a real shame, I miss the moo-ing lol
---
It feels like something that was made before CAMP purifiers were a thing and then werent updated to be better. They're a pain to make for very little payoff, even with two chances to be doubled by Super Duper.
---
I’m not hungry.
---
now then.....If you sell something for 111 caps, does the system round the exact profit of 99.9 caps up or down?
---
(90% of 111 = 99.9) so do you get 100 caps or 99 caps?
---
I have a zealots Gatling plasma and I’m debating on priming it to get that sweet double stack against scorchbeasts and the queen
---
Am i leggaly allowed to kill insult bot then ?
---
It's the difference between a regular sniper build and a Bloodied sniper build :)
---
The next time you run across a piece of Unyielding try soaking up some rads and put the piece on and look at your special stats. You'll understand after that! I use 4 Unyielding piece's and one chameleon. With maxed out stealth and escape artist it's more then enough.
---
I call them "poprockers" or "Crackle crackle respawn" in Survival.
---
I really want us to start calling explosive weapons poprocks.  And getting killed by one is "getting poprocked."
---
I’ve been selling cigarette packs and cartons.  People need a break from the hard shit from time to time.  I’ve been cleaning up.  Plus, these are tax free!
---
Medics gear has some odd, niche appeal.  I don't know what it is, but if you have the time to deal with a player trade, you might propose it and see if you get any takers.
---
noooooo not the brahmin
---
Scorchbeats are in fact encompasses  under the hunter’s prefix. So you are correct
---
Honestly they need to get a proper system in place to give each item a unique ID number. Auto delete any items that shows up with duplicate ID's and ban the account that created it. Wouldn't solve the currently available dupes but it would prevent any new ones from occurring or getting circulated around
---
I agree with this. The amount of hard bargain and aqua boy cards I have, I could open an underwater megastore
---
Most of them are trade only I haven’t seen anyone selling refrigerator but I’ve seen a few heavy ones selling I got mine for 5k but I knew the guy they’re easily the most valuable plans in the game rn though
---
Is it 1 star?
---
People get really mad and confused if you use a stealth boy and pop into a chair and buy their "seed" item before they all have a chance to sit down. I ruined some days last night ;)  This is especially funny when they are using area chat to coordinate and none of them end up with the item (don't worry, i destroyed what I took by jumping into a certain glowing green pit to make it impossible to retrieve). Best caps  I have ever spent.  
---
You really shouldn't give specifics though. Hope this is fixed quick. We can all thank DemonAsylum for making this public like every other dupe glitch. Have tried to get his sponsors to drop his YT channel but the "official energy drink of esports"  just ignores my messages because apparently, they condone cheating.
---
I just primed my LMG for the ammo crafting yield alone. Got a decent amount of flux so I figured why not. It’s insane how little .308 you craft normally
---
Something would be nice. There isn't really much use for 10 Aquaboy/Aquagirl cards. Interestingly some of my duplicate perk cards seem to have been de-duped somewhere along the way, but it's still a bit ridiculous.
---
Instigating hunting rifle for when I want to reach out and touch someone at a long distance.
---
Agree on ores being trash tier. Workshops were so much better in beta when ore veins would give scraps instead of ores.
---
No idea on the tickets. There are a few Misc items that seem to have no use, such as the Atomic Roller Ball.
---
They're annoying if they don't land. If they land, they're easy prey to take out.
---
Melee build though.
---
PS4.
---
The build menu says 5/10 placed, i have 5 physical turrets, but the error says build limit exceeded when i try to place the sixth turret.
---
ugh i hated this quest, i also had it fail repeatedly, my teammate however successfully completed it on her first try
---
finally i got it to finish after like 10 tries, i took a different route and it finally worked
---
Well when you're right you're right.
---
I have a lot of low-level cards that I used before I got all the perks I wanted that just sit there and it bugs me 😂
---
Scrip it
---
Bethesda ain’t pulling any of this.
---
There have been 3 banwaves in game history.
---
The first, to prevent (failure) , the second, to stop (Partial Success that turned to failure), and the third (suicide)
---
The first was back in the early stages (early December), banning exploiters preemptively to try to control the spread, but the glitches were too obvious and too easy for the common person to do. 
---
The second was the one people know. 900 hours guy, all that stuff. They were sloppy, and Bethesda prioritized item number, and the real dupes went under the radar. It was here that we realized that they can DETECT items being created in the server, but they have no idea what item value is. They banned for ammo, not guns. They succeeded in getting rid of the big fish who duped everything, but the small time dupes persisted.
---
The third one was the (Insert German nonsense here) event ban. This one was sloppy. What happened first was a hiccup (idk for sure but everyone got unbanned) in Bethesda servers that resulted in a mass un-ban of all the dupers. They then transferred their stuff to new accounts (unaffected by earlier wipes, just account locked). Bethesda then dished out the bans 2 days later, but the damage was done. All the dupes were back, undoing all of the action done in the Second wave. 
---
MODUS dupe happened right after, and another dupe after that. They have taken no corrective action since the third wave, because they know they can’t, they have lost the fight.
---
The best thing they can do to counter dupes right now is to change the meta drastically, which they can hopefully do if they introduce balance changes with the new vendor coming out.
---
Personally, I think the economy in this game is pointless, and it’s hard to care about it.
---
Yep! It's amazing how many players I've met yet never seen come back, not even once.. Bethesda definitely has it's work cut out for them to get more than a fragment of it's players back!
---
I've got one friend who still plays since shortly after beta, one who's been wrongfully banned for a long time, and one I really miss and want to play with who won't even respond to party invites if they see me playing fallout!
---
Dick.
---
That skin was super cool but absolutely killed my frame rate when I pulled the gun out so I had to take it off
---
[Here ya go.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bm33a5/anyone_else_having_their_server_disconnect_a_lot/emvadyd/)  This is just one comment.  I can't find the other comment about a video on YouTube explaining the new exploit.
---
No only the paints
---
I'm now picturing mothman wearing a granny wig, glasses and a shawl ala the big bad wolf
---
Mothman is waaaaaaaay cuter than that bunch of stiches.  
---
Mothman plushie? Mothman plushie!
---
You should lower it a bit.  I was going to buy it but I fast traveled in so i was short on caps. Dammit man.
---
Leveling can be tough if that's what you're focused on. I know early on I was eager to get more perk cards, level up perks, increase my SPECIAL stats. and to be able to use these awesome higher-level weapons and armor i found! (i finished the BoS quests at level 46 and it gave me a set of PA i couldn't use until level 50, lol). keep doing your thing, enjoy yourself, the levels will come.
---
if you want to get your XP to inch up faster, try to always be well-rested, and craft cranberry-based dishes, they all increase your rate of XP gain somewhat (cranberry juice is 2%, cranberry cobbler is 5%, cranberry relish is 10%!) i find cobbler to be the best-fit since you just need cranberries and wood to make it. diseased cranberries are easy to find in the bog (used to make juice) non-diseased ones are a bit tougher, you can find them in the sundew groves and at Aaronholt Homestead up north in the forest (regular cranberries are for cobbler and relish). usually i just grab a few diseased ones every time i FT to Watoga station (in the fields to the south) and make juice from them.
---
I honestly wish this was a book so I could put that on the cover as a review. I'm more flattered than I should be maybe, but any writing making people feel like they're on drugs is pretty cool
---
If you run a crit commando build and play with a team they are useful. Otherwise vampires is usually better for running solo.
---
It’s only 1 Star, and I was only able to partially mod it so I was just planning to sell for 175. (PS4, The_Hexadecimals.)
---
Oof, and only a lvl 35. Just gonna scrip it, I think.
---
I only have the 'fridge' one and no, it does not.
---
Yeah just 1 Star.
---
Also, could the enemies at least have to spawn outside our camp build zone? I have enemies spawning right next to me when a player fast travels in.
---
I have a lawn flamingos, a scarecrow, and few crops which all seem to be prioritized by the enemy over the vending machines though, I have not lost a vending machine yet.
---
I get out of build mode, then back in and then I try to connect the opposite direction. If I tried generator to turret, I will go turret to generator. Seems to have always worked. Though I have noticed an uptick in the amount of jumping during build mode. 
---
Now if we could just type the price instead of using the slider on the vending machines. I have a keyboard, let me use it.
---
yep, me too. my hunting rifles make for a boring slog when they're in the air, but when they land it's hammer time and they don't last long. :)
---
He has the coat? At what percentage will it be there?
---
thanks man, I finally finished the weekly bc of this :) got both squirrel and rabbit there
---
Oh lemme just loot this Ghoul corpse on top of the sleeping bag in the White Springs golf club kitchen...oh..f..no wait DON'T LAY DOWN fucking damn it..no shit here they all come. Fuck noo! Clickclickclick get up you idiot damn it
---
I made a few changes to my camp this weekend to try and address some of the spawning issues and here are a few things I learned. I am built on a cliff edge, so it can be interesting sometimes for some players.  Moving my C.A.M.P. workbench around seemed to help with alot of these issues, but didn't alleviate it for all. Most visitors spawn in the open areas in front or to the side of my base.  Some were spawning inside my house.  I have my garage door switch on the inside and was leaving it open, but some were closing it and running outside.  I then had to remove the lock from my other door, because (go figure) some players couldn't figure out how to flip a switch to open the garage door.  Some were spawning in between 2 of my patio foundations and could not get unstuck even after I removed them. One solution to get unstuck is to get into or out of your PA if that option is available. This mostly happened to team members who tried to fast travel to me directly and not to my base.  If they travel to you, make sure sure you are some distance away before they travel.  I have had to rethink my privacy issues to accommodate this whole vendor trading thing, but overall everyone has been just as accommodating towards me.  Maybe the level 70 who spent over 4k caps in my vendor machines and then was promptly killed when he walked about 100 yards (91.44 meters) away along the cliff edge right into the Yao Guai spawn point wasn't too happy, but Hey, you can't please everyone.
---
100 yards is 91.44 meters
---
I wish my intelligence was artificial but it's so damn real that I can taste it
---
The gun says bullets explode if that is one of the effects underneath it
---
I thought about this too.... for example, notice how things like "repair kits" are non transferable...said said weapon was repaired with a kit prior to duping, it could theoretical encode the players information into that weapon and allow some sort of tracking....just my thought, have nothing to prove it.
---
Same generator that I used for the build a generator at camp
---
My solution is simple. Permanent bans to everyone duping, and not just account bans  but IP, and MAC bans. Make it VERY clear that cheating will not be acceptable.
---
waaaaaahhhhh!!!!!
---
Screw off commie!
---
It's really frustrating. I know several players who were wrongfully banned. One had to buy another account in order to play. I feel bad for them. My buddy though, I KNOW he'd love survival mode if we'd team up and all but he won't try it. Sadness.
---
I agree, but pull The Beach Boys. It doesn’t fit the timeline or genre of the music style that is Fallout!
---
You'll have them same feeling here for the most part (if you felt that way about Fallout 4) but the game isn't built around high speed action so it's not really an issue depending on your load out/play style.
---
Yeah, my camp has always had metal walls, it was the roof which got detroyed, and then my decontamination shower and many exposed interior items.
---
Why do you waste time destroying camps? What do you get from it?
---
Some of the most popular will certainly be Two Shot, Anti-Armor, Bloodied, Explosive, Faster Fire Rate, 40% Faster Swing Speed, 90% Reduced Weight.
---
Faster Reload speed, +1 Strength (melee), Weapon Weights Reduced (Armor), instigating are all popular as well. Then of course Vanguards, Assassins (Armor mostly), Unyielding, Bolstering, Cavalier, and Sentinel. 
---
Might have missed a few but those are most of the top tier effects that people look for
---
Agreed. 
---
Have events where we protect the stations, and random "the messenger" style events where we guide a junk clearing train. Obviously won't work with some stations that connect via broken bridges. 
---
Once repaired and maintained, fast travel to the station is free until the defend event is failed.
---
I'm inclined towards Murmrgh's mystery pick because it basically only costs 25 scrip. But really all I need right now is a bloodied heavy that's better than my lvl 40 bloodied gatling. So probably I'll be looking for three star ranged weapons.
---
The problem with pistol builds is every pistol perk is inside of agility, more perks then you can even pick and then you lock yourself out of most good agility perks because you run out of room. The only pistol perk outside of agility is perception and it is terrible, 3 perception for 30% range and better scoped aiming. Idk if you can even go pistols without going into a luck/crit build to lean on and when you do the perception perk becomes even less useful.  Stealth pistols build isn’t really a thing as the best pistols in the game are all revolvers that can’t have silencers, also you dont have room for pistol perks and stealth perks bc agility again. I wish the reload perk in luck got a buff, or that there was some pistol reload speed buff, even with speed demon and crits every 2-3 shots my DPS against large enemies is bad and a single missed shot hurts you bad. Idk still my favorite gun type bc of the role play and theme but you definitely have to work harder then most weapon builds just to keep up. The plus side is there are far less people playing pistol builds then anything else so my friends think of me when they see a pistol drop.
---
Love my Prime 50cal, great gun, good damage, not that hard to get a lot of ammo if you do some farming now and then.
---
If they only knew, lol. This picture speaks volumes.
---
Anti-armor and explosive are my favorites. I run a pistol build and my anti-armor .44 is my go-to when something tough appears.
---
Edit: ooh also reduced ap cost for pistols
---
Rule 7
---
I spawned skewered inside the supports of a wooden shack foundation....cleanly split in two and unable to move.
---
Well it to vendor bots. I keep shelf stable food and sell all of the cooked food for caps. Helps keep a tidy income coming in.
---
That's it. That's the subreddit.
---
It's something that used to be a lot more prevalent back in the day. I miss forum signatures, haha.

---
Does heart of the swamp guarantee a legendary?
---
just as long aa they don't make it out of canvas....
---
The legendaries should remain in that machine for for a certain amount of time (and hour or two or so) for people to change their mind and such.
---
I just chased two guys out of the building, trying to place the under arrest. They seems unimpressed by my efforts.
---
Yesterday, I got visited by the insular bit. About 1 minute later, Grahm and Chally the moo moo walked by. I felt like I won the lottery!
---
i see them on average around 200
---
Lmbo!
---
Just asked an old friend who duped and quit to try with vending and he was able to sell 712 of his mini nukes in new vending units so I can confirm vending as he did while broadcasting mixer.
---
Noted and edited.  I will try to be more inclusive to those who use the metric system in the future.
---
Please god. I have a semi-circle of a dozen of them and they look like absolute hell.
---
I was once holding him up for someone, next thing I know I didn't do anything, I'm still there waiting, the dude loads, the bot dies, and he starts calling me names for killing him.
---
I don’t want it that badly.
---
the option to turn the snap on or off would work for a lot of the camp items and would be a nice quailty of life improvement
---
Make the grenade launcher useful as a small portable firework launcher, with customizable color firework shells (i.e you use certain colored plants for a different color firework).  You can also expand this to missile launchers for bigger effects. 
---
Heck, bring in the settlement firework mortar from f4 while we're at it.
---
There's tons of other things we can do; handheld sparklers, throwable snap pops that are harmless but can lure mobs' attention away, etc

yeah i spend far too much time trying to line them up

Nope, sadly.

Every time you reload the Gatling before using the full core the old core enters your inventory with the shots remaining. Plasma Gatling selects cores by max shots first, so near the end, you could have 20+ cores with 20-30 shots because you hit reload before fully using up the current plasma core. After a fight, I recommend you either A: Drop your mostly spent cores or B: Have a Primes one and use those cores to create ultracite plasma cores giving those half spent cores a new life and possibly a superduper extra one.
---
I would wish that would work but what would stop someone from creating a 2nd account using a different IP to dupe and then transfer the ill gotten gains to main? Also if you state just ban the main too then you could using duping to get random players banned, go to random train stations and drop atomic item plans and random players would use them without hesitation.
---
This bug has been there for several months while Bethesda does not even know how to solve it.
---
They condone making money, as long as he is bringing in the views, they don't care what his content is.
---
yes i hate that pump so much
---
I have tried "scan and repair" and it didn't help me actually.
---
Yup, but I don't think that there's another way, and logging in isn't that big of a problem IMO.
---
I've started playing it a lot more lately, everything is good except weapon repairs - can you not repair anything without buying repair kits?  I'm a little lost on that one
---
This is wonderful.
---
Is there a similar thing for the tadpole ones?
---
They’re using the engine from fo4 which was single player(who cares if you dupe?) so it’s exploits everywhere for things like this
---
have you tried starting it from the personal terminal?
---
That I wasn't aware of, certainly explains the randomness.
---
I'm pretty sure it's just any food with radstag, Yao guai, or wolf meat. Nothing fancy. There's a hanging radstag in Flatwoods next to the water pump area that'll do.
---
Wait does the artillery actually do something?
---
you are too kind :) i am just a humble glue farmer who likes to build things but i don't have room to keep them all so i share :D
---
Found 2 at ... Ft Defiance? I think - not the asylum, the one thats deeper in the Mire with the cargobot pad....
---
Some of the ladies in our discord wanted multi queen runs so we did that.
---
Why do people even lock their doors in the first place? It’s not like they keep out enemies, who will just shoot or attack the door anyway, and it prevents us CAMP explorers from seeing into your nifty CAMP! This one guy had a three story CAMP with a steeple with stairs leading up to it, and I was incredibly curious as to what was in the steeple, but upon getting in via the workbench glitch, all the interior doors were locked too!
---
The resource collectors at Tyler’s gave me scrap, not ore :(
---
Hey I also only have #3-5, it gives me pause when I read things like this!
---
Still recruiting. If so I would like to team up with your gang
---
That is a great idea, forgot giving each item a unique ID or even original owner founder tag like pokemon. Love this idea but afraid servers couldn't handle it, they had so many problems with currently and even back with 400 stash limit with SBQ crashes and now its still occurs and losted 3 SBQ rewards yesterday during a SBQ farm. Also mind if I add this to main topic and credit you?
---
I wouldn't call the disconnects/crashes constant, but we are clearly dealing with a duping problem at the moment, and dupers don't think twice about crashing servers because that's just the kind of people they are.
---
i routinely drop in at the vault or flatwoods with gifts and gear for low lvl.players. Weapons, Armor, chems, etc. I had high lvl players help me early on. i have been paying it forward since i have gotten high enough to help.
---
Ahhh not so much anymore, with all the new updates and nerfs to survival we got bored with the mode. Appreciate the interest though!
---
I use an mesh upper floor walkway around the top of my building, 1 heavy laser turret on each corner, as they stick out from the building they are able to shoot down around the building better. 1 missile turret on top of the roof for longer range threats.
---
My camp not only has random spawns it seems to be a path where 3 high level super mutants, scorched or robots walk though. These 5 guns seem to fend off well, I've never lost my fusion generator, I only lose crops and the fence around my garden.
---
PSA: Bethesda, you should release an update for once where shit isn't broken from jump.
---
I agree the nerf really caters to one play style.
---
I’m thinking they’ll probably hit us with it at E3.
---
ur welcome :)
---
Now the picture is more clear, I have never seen this vendor. Will try that location next time. Thx mate
---
Not yet, there will be a second sheet sometime this week, I hope.
---
An excellent idea, always liked it to get rare items but the core problem isn't that dupers are duping but the odds of getting proper legendaries is absolute garbage and will continue to be even with new mole vender since how it works was already datamined showing its entire armor or weapon list you competing with, I wonder how many legendary 3 star wood pieces I will get before I get proper armor lol.
---
Yeah its just not profitable to hunt anymore :(
---
Makes sense I had a feeling they would be 5k and up thank you
---
Thanks for the response man. Wasn't expecting it.
---
In terms of content, you may have misread or I didn't state clearly enough. My apologies if that's the case.
---
Your content lately is considerably better than your early fo76 days. It's the reason why I still keep watching as I mentioned. The fact that you do more work than just reiterate and react to the top sub posts is a good thing. Case in point, listening and verifying those audio files from one of your decent datamine/spoiler vids with the orange crates, though there are a few other examples.
---
It's not so much the content I have an issue with lately. The thing that bothers me are those moments (more early fo76 than later) where you choose to withhold an opinion on an issue. It's never really stated why (though I guess you've alluded to it now) but it give me the impression that you care more about your Youtube revenue stream than taking a stand on whether something controversial is right or wrong. Feeds into the "shill" narrative.
---
I get that you're a content creator and I don't begrudge you for wanting to earn revenue for your content. Content creators that hold a position and clearly state their case, whether or not I agree, I respect more and will watch and listen to more than someone who doesn't. People like MrMatty and Cohhcarnage in my opinion are prime examples of this. I watch youtubers for their perspectives and opinions. News and data I can get from reddit or news sites.
---
If your content is going to be about news and controversies, I don't think you can dodge giving an opinion or taking a stance. That's what it really comes down to for me. Otherwise, it looks like you're just in it for the money.
---
That's my opinion anyhow. Hope that is helpful in some way.
---
Music rights can be very expensive so unless you are looking for public domain stuff this will likely never happen
---
Oh didn't know that.
---
Did the option to pick the frog up in the wild show for you? With glass jar in inventory?
---
I got the frog habitat to work, saw people online saying it is bugged, explained this detail to them, and they replied saying it worked. 
---
People are trying to build the habitat without securing their frog first!
---
SantaDeathclaus, all winter long!
---
Yeah the rng in this game sucks it feels like it’s gotten worse too
---
I've just build a secondary door wall with a 1x1 room with my  vender unit in. Easy done and seperate from my base (which is always open) I don't mind fold using my things and enjoying. Y camp. Seems a shame to hide it
---
And how about perk loadouts for quick swaps to a scavaging or crafting/selling build
---
Im glad you addressed this, I was wondering if the max photos limit might be causing the pics not to count. Take my upvote, for science
---
You can generalize everythibg as bad when the franchise that started it is good. Thats my point. It isnt a parody it invented the genre all together
---
I'd love seasonal events like that... I was actually hoping for that these past holidays. Halloween, Winter's Solstice (Krampus boss?), Independence Day, and some other regional or even Fallout fictional holidays would be very fun and enjoyable. It also gives us something to rotate regularly in terms of "world event" content that we can play parallel to the regular content update stuff.
---
It’s the Bysshe Company. In a holotape or two they mention Bysshe, as does the recall terminal. But since Bysshe is a natural gas company, I’m pretty sure that’s just a cover for a government agency of some sort?
---
I can't click because I'm at work, but I saw someone fighting a bunch of glowing ones that were crawling last night at Whitespring.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/wQUqO8a.png](https://i.imgur.com/wQUqO8a.png) no knocking, just run xD
---
I for one and IMHO have no issue with vendor the way it is. So no to 1a,1b and go with 2a, and 2b. People say they don't want a pay to win game (and most don't even have a clue what a real P2W is) but think they should be able to buy outside of the way the game is (buggy as hell or not) just shows how pampered and out of touch "gamers " are. Didn't have this issues back in the day, the greed we hate on dev's now is because "gamers" want a game to be everything, then get upset that the mark is missed because its not possible to make and the dev still fill the money bags they are working for. So yeah wipe the duped items you not supposed to have gotten them that way in the 1st place, you took the risk... if you don't get that I don't want to be "grouped with" you so quit, but then its up to Big B to do #3... end of issue.
---
LOL 😁
---
Yeah, it sends in a volley of shells blasting whatever is around the smoke grenade. I like it because it blows up different parts around the smoke grenade, not just the target.
---
Yeah np it’ll probably be 20k and up though I was good friends w the guy that sold me mine. If you just hold the plan you learn it though
---
It has seemed to slow down a little bit. If others are like me, they started focusing on the pioneer quests/challenges. 
---
I still get pretty steady traffic mostly. I do offer a little bit of everything, which when I see other camps on the map with a bit of everything I'm more likely to check those out and camps near each other, which is why a few of my friends set up shops really close to each other.
---
I haven't tried, but I always have both sets of cards on so not sure if your saying they are bugged?
---
You would be correct in that, if you look at the stealth nerfs from less legendaries or even complete removal from locations in Watoga you see our odds of find sweet new gear have been decreased and thats just the ones we know and they want to extend the grind while they develop more content.
---
It's so awesome to see other people helping out! This is not a zero sum game, (in Adventure) it's not Us-vs-Them, it's Us-vs-the Environment and the more people, the more capable they are, the better for all of us!
---
Yeah got a ghoul and a super mutant swimming in the ground 2 days ago 😂 also a glowing dog that was completely under the ground in front of my base.
---
Well aren't you super.
---
Well I just want any decent sized beast to patrol the grounds lol.
---
Three foundations around the base stacked with Turrets and a beast on the inside. Who's gonna cause trouble in there? lol
---
It’s, for the first time since launch, just starting to normalize. It was grossly inflated before. No weapon should cost more than the max cap limit. Loving seeing 3* weapons for under 1k now.
---
The person you responded to, you basically told them they're wrong, when you're response was also partially wrong (which made them feel stupid). And you call me a douche for correcting you like you did them?
---
I did that event plenty of times and had absolutely no revive opportunities.
---
Yeah so I’m not saying duping is right but it is really helpful if you know someone or just happen to run into them if they sell things for cheap
---
I found a spot that spawns brahmin right outside my camp every time, right by a stream
---
found him in a ditch in cranberry bog. bought the lemonade and the plans.......still have the word MUG above me.
---
Go to Middle Mountain Cabins east of the Whitesprings Train Station (about 4 to 5 caps fast travel cost).  There's a crossbow in the middle cabin.  It's up against the wall to the left of the leftmost nightstand.  It's usually low lvl and not maxed condition.  Watch out for the enemies there.  They can be pretty tough.
---
After that go someplace low lvl and bash enemies to death to wear down the condition to repair again.
---
That guy gots it and you got it too
---
You sold at the right time!
---
Wow...  well I can't even return to the game because I keep getting the "Disconnected from Server" message. I wonder if Bethesda does this to people who talk trash about them and its there way of punishing us?  Been off for 2 days with no end in sight and Bethesda's website says to wait 24 hours and they are aware of the problem! Really!!!
---
Sorry that the game devs decided to give us things to do in this game that take longer than 1 minute to complete.  Everyone was complaining about new content being so quick to complete.  I've done 6 of the possum badge challenges already.  They're not that tedious..
---
Yeah i kinda figured that would be most likely as I was typing the post, but it’d be nice to get some confirmation!
---
 I have about the same data here as you. Chems are way to easy to find as you already know.  I could almost always cap out my 1400 for the day on drugs alone.   I took all my chems out of my vendor except Stimpaks that were selling well for 10 caps.  I also sold Berry Mentats and Grape Mentats for as low as 15 and as high as 30.  Left them at 25 and they were all gone by the end of the day.  Ammo didn't do so well for me except for 5.56,  which I don't use.  I wish they would make a quantity for option because 1 cap per shell is too much for most calibers.
---
The sheepsquatch is a miniboss IMO, the imposter is a boss, I'd like to see a scorched power armor user
---
u/ladydevann
---
Can you pass this along to dev team? This is a big one and would be a huge improvement for those of us not camping near a body of water.
---
I found an acid node in the forest, and built on a nearby power transmission tower....
---
And yes, I have acid in my vending machine.
---
Are you sneaking at all? Headshots count as automatic crit.
---
To jump in, once you’ve played with marsupial/speed demon/bird bones you will never be able to play without mutations again. Fair warning.
---
Ad Victorium, brother!
---
Sold ! add me to the PSN Magness1993,
---
Right. Bethesda just disables your character for criticizing their game, that's the funniest shit I've read all day.
---
can't see your build because it's blocked on my work comp, but I invested in Glow Sight or whatever, the perception perk that does 60% extra damage to glowing enemies
---
Honestly on the whole opinion thing a lot of time I just hoped it wouldn't matter. I even still try to format videos in a way that you get the raw facts first, then my opinion (if at all). I see a lot of other people being really unobjective around controversies and I have been trying really hard to be not like that lately. I think trying to do this has made me more timid around giving my opinion where my real goal is for people to just conclude their own thing based on what the facts say 
---
Since I have realized that not giving my opinion is also a really bad idea in the sense that it almost hides my inevitable bias. Either way thanks for the feedback man, I really appreciate the response
---
Conformed. I never trash talk the company and I can play whenever I want.
---
This idea sound like the Ark Play as Dino mod :D
---
I loved this mod and it would be awesome in Fallout 76
---
Makes me think of this Scorchbeast I saw the other day 
---
https://youtu.be/TO6oJJXFEmU
---
Forgive my ignorance, but, what’s up with these challenges? I’ve completed 3 or 4 of the possum challenges and, as far as I can tell, got no reward for them. Do you have to complete every single one of them before you get anything?
---
Have they fixed it so the pets don't attack anyone who comes to your CAMP? With player vending, I do worry about getting another
---
Thats true but i had tons of fun with sticks as a kid and they didnt cost 60$ and were bug free
---
You may have head the death aura too.
---
It's happened to me in Watoga and inside Whitespring and The Whitespring Bunker.
---
There are many new quests and events I realy like the way the game is going.
---
So.  If she weighs the same as a duck... Shes made of wood.
---
I server hopped for an hour and found it eventually, but for some reason, it wouldn't let me trade or shop with it. Why is this?
---
It’s definitely very hard by yourself. If you’re looking to solo, I’d suggest doing the Forest version; I’ve solo’d that by myself a few times. The Savage Divide and Mire versions pretty much require you to have some ludicrously OP weaponry (like TSE’s) to solo, or a team.
---
Yeah. I wish there were a better way to track things. I think making them quests would be too much because then we'd get quest trackers telling us where to go, and that's not as much fun. I've seen some other suggests as their own Challenge category or a haolotape. But like you, I'm just gonna have to create a list on my phone as a checklist to keep track easier of what I need to do. Otherwise I'm pulling up the map constantly.
---
I've sold over 10 of them for 500, also sold a lot of the t51 Nuka Paint for 350. They sell fast. I think the price seems fair, probably could raise it but I check the site everyday and get a free one of each.
---
Best comment yet! Was looking for these kind of responses. Yea I honestly would be ok with a wipe of all duped items, only thing though I don't think Bethesda would do it as it would hurt player base and the money maker is the atomic shop and not in caps or tradeable weapons.
---
Ah don't let one guy ruin it for you. There's a lot of helpful people in here. He might have thought you were a veteran leveling a alt or something. If it's obvious like wearing the responder stuff, that's not the norm. Maybe the norm when the game came out.
---
You can repair at any crafting station. The repair kits are optional and let you repair anywhere.
---
you don't have any mutations, for one, which I can tell because you don't have starched genes. You're also using a lot of perks that only have any effect if you don't wear power armor, so those are all just wasted. If you're trying to be a rifleman character why do you have so many points in strength and so few points in perception???? Why don't you have any VATS perks? If I were you I'd try to move six points or so into agility and max out sneak and covert operator, you'd be surprised how much of a different that makes, and also add three points to perception and get concentrated fire. I mean your build looks like you are trying to NOT wear power armor, so why not use vats. If you are going for a PA build get rid of ironclad and white knight.
---
You can free up a lot of perks by getting rid of all your junk, getting rid of pack rat, get rid of strong back, get rid of junk shield. You're asking for trouble hauling all your junk around anyway.
---
Yea, I could do that, I was just upset that my time and all those resources were wasted by just destroying all of it. If I had known I wouldn't have been flagged for pvp outside of that range I'd have hung back but I still wonder if this guy would have still destroyed everything.
---
Personally I don’t know how it’s possible to keep seeing the same folks over and over again on different servers like I have been. Aren’t there like a gazillion people playing this game? What are the odds? :)
---
What kind of fire? I'm intrigued.
---
Okay guess I'll get more caps and hey that's pretty cool tho
---
Wait what?
---
Are you on Xbox?
---
(looking at your other posts it seems you just enjoy saying crappy things to people, but i'll give you a serious answer)
---
i don't often toot my own horn. what i hoped to do with this post was inspire other people to do nice things, to demonstrate the good feeling that it gives you. does it look like bragging? sure. feel free to criticize me when you see me do it more than once or twice.
---
All my perk cards are set for a bloodied build plus adrenal, which without the gun being bloodied still effects its dps
---
I run bloodied almost exclusively without using a single bloodied weapon. Just sayin.
---
From one side there are lack of choices in F76, from the other good luck roleplaying freely in a single-player game.
---
I agree, previous entries were much more satisfying when it comes to making decisions and see their frutition. But for me (few passes of F1, few dozen passes of F2, two passes of F3, 3 passes of NV because its awesome, 250 hours and not finished F4 because WTF no nonterrible ending despite me being a god?) F76 scratches certain itches no official Fallout scratched yet, and all I wanted was to have a thinking opponents in that setting.
---
F76 was criricised not for what it was but for what people wanted it to be, and the bar was set infinitely high, expecting a game by which scale WoW would be medium-sized, or expecting a game with on/off multiplayer mode, neither of which F76 is.
---
So much for free speech!
---
So I'm guessing Melee weapons used for bashing enemies with your fist? I have some that I use that are anti armored (deathclaw gauntlet and power fist)
---
Yes I am
---
This is the only circumstance that slap damage was actually good.
---
yes! but with variations of the face (happy, sad, mad, etc)
---
My Mirelurk Hunter pet is still there. I think they are still tameable, just moved from Animal Friend to Wasteland Whisperer.
---
Yeah... I have one CAMP I'm super proud of, I put a lot of effort into making it as creepy as possible, lots of little touches as you walk through it, and it gets darker and creepier as you go deeper into it.
---
I like to hang out nearby and creep on people as they explore it.
---
I've found that, when the first (there are three in total, I never power the 2nd and 3rd) vendor is 'full-time" powered... players "beam in", check the first machine, and "beam up", never exploring any further.
---
If I leave them off... the interaction with my CAMP is 100% different. They explore the outside... they tend to enter with weapons drawn, they check every room... they explore deeper, checking all my little signs on the walls, and personalization to the vending machines.
---
If I floor switch the main machine... it can appear on the map only sometimes, and maybe that will pique someone's interest enough to come exploring.
---
You must be one of those super DUPErs...
---
Lol, or use your phone to transmit your own signals
---
Ok I won’t be on for awile but I’ve got a heavy plan I’ll let you learn if you need it and ik a guy who is gonna let me learn the refrigerator so whenever he gets it I’ll msg you and let you learn it too. Just don’t steal them😂 GT defnoteagle9563
---
I know it's going to be a vampire's plastic spoon but who cares!
---
If I don't find any by then I'll let you know. Thanks for the offer!
---
It’s still just an endless grind to get higher level and it’s still just as boring
---
Really no rogue spiders or woodlouses? That is odd.
---
Sure, if you want to exaggerate the number, when in reality like I said, it's 35% of an *actual day*. You know nothing about this person. 6.7 hours a day is 46.9 hours a week, is it unhealthy if they work that much?
---
I know gamers with full time jobs that have long gaming sessions on their days off, and play for a few hours each night after work. Hell, a few parents that likely could pull off similar hours and just sleep a little less than the average adult.
---
Bottom line is you decided "it's unhealthy" or "a lot" then intentionally use math to try to exaggerate how much they play, by saying "over half a day".
---
My best friend makes $80 an hour, mostly by paying other people to do work, a lot of business owners have very limited hours they have to work. He's a great dad and probably spends easily this much time gaming.
---
Who are you to decide what's "a lot"? Lol.
---
Yes they have, as I visited a camp in Whitesprings the other day with a docile Deathclaw. The name is in red but it didn't do anything but prowl
---
Id not considered a Mirelurk family actually. Between both smaller variants they are pretty tanky and deadly.
---
Plus its by water for it too :)
---
Unfortunately I had the wrong item. The one in Uncanny Caverns is not the quest one.
---
That is interesting. As far as I knew they were tied to a character. Was this before the patch?
---
Try a bloodied heavy build. My bloody 50 cal does 300 damage a shot with nerd rage and adrenal reaction procs and I can see her health drop while I'm the only one shooting at her.
---
Yeah I was trying to repair at my base camp but was only getting the option to get repair kits from atom store, weird.
---
Yeah that is the way I see it, but the truth be told, if you read the "gaming editorials" this game has been hurt more because of these things and the #3 is something Big B done MANY times, so in this one case if they did act in this way, IMHO I'd bet on a gain and not a loss. But if Big B did anything that mirrors "common sense" then we'd not be on here now lol
---
I’ll try using wasteland whisperer and animal friend together. 
---
In the past I was able to tame a mirelurk hunter, king and a deathclaw using Animal Friend.
---
Now those creatures only show as pacify using that card. Didn’t know wasteland whisperer could tame them now.
---
I always just flip it out with whatever, like when I find a caps stash I trade it out for caps collector and then switch back. And whenever I craft I switch it out for super duper.
---
But yeah, being able to have it permanently switched out with, say, mysterious savior would make sense in my bloodied build.
---
they know youv'e got hardend mass. thats it, your just dead, twice. they even wait for me to go home , and jump me there, twice.   every time  .....moan gripe whine.
---
exc/armour tho....even lev 50 aint that great and you can easly pick up better. did the same thing last night. loads of h/mass, snuck out the zone and swapped armour to exc.
---
jumped by 6 m/kings ...dead in seconds................and again when I came back. no loot.
---
edit  lone wanderer makes a huge difference as does tank killer
---
Oh. Oh well. It's easy to avoid dupes anyway if you're a purist. Just don't buy that stuff.
---
sorry, laughing, shaking head, look at this thing, begone thot.
---
all needed
---
Just had this happen to me, fast traveled to a players camp, *every single door* was locked.
---
All of them, the exterior doors, the interior doors, every room had a lock, like seriously? This dude had locks everywhere, it was like three doors to get into his room, another handful to get to side rooms.
---
I like how you immediately jumped to a conspiracy.
---
They absolutely should, along with a bunch of the other unique 76 stuff.
---
I started my Fallout experience as a 5 y/o kid playing demo of Fallout 1. I have no regrets, good life, good job, loved one, lots of friends and interests.
---
You see young kids in online game? Reward them for being nice and helpful and condemn them for being rude, but try not to throw them away. You are in position to be an example which will be looked to in a specific way unlike parents cant (the cool highlevel guy), and you can use it to make people nicer, even if thats influence is tiny, its either that or yet another young troll.
---
That’s not how free speech works.
---
Absolutely. Ban and take those who sell their assets for real money to court. Make an example out of the top offenders and the rest will cry in their closets. Delete all the duped contents too. Honestly if the game has issue and people can just walk in and buy a single item multiple times, it’s Bethesda’s problem. But if those people turn around and make a profit in real world money, or if they destabilize the servers in order to create glitch for the duping, they broke the law and user agreement. Perma ban is the easiest way out for them. 
---
No player will quit when their duped ‘god tiers’ got wiped. That’s the least to worry about. It’s like saying someone will commit suicide if his counterfeit money is seized. Won’t happen. Banning and deleting is the only solution.
---
Oh my gosh! I never even made the correlation. These little challenges are EXACTLY like that dang Wasteland Survival guide.
---
I have previously spawned on a world which couldn’t place my CAMP only to get stuck on a huge tower with turrets everywhere.
---
Quite tempted to fuck shit up to get out but of course not the players fault
---
True. It's bad optics though if someone with that tagline has a financial relationship with someone who has 100% cheating videos though. Surely they MUST see that.
---
the music is great, but it being 3 times louder than the main screen music is why I hate it
---
The legendary vendor works like this; you pick the type of item you want; melee, gun, armor, and then the amount of stars. Then every other part is random. You might get a 3 star stalkers double blocker pool cue. You might got a 2 star bloody explosive western revolver. You might get a nocturnal wood chest piece.
---
Hmm, have to tried rebuilding/moving your base from scratch? Deleting all of your turrets? Also, what's fixed issues for friends and I, delete your save data- everything important is saved server side, you won't lose anything.. but who knows what they've saved in the past?
---
For a long time I had a water purifier that was bugged under my stored tab, taking up build space.. didn't go away until they patched it *and* I moved.
---
Worst case scenario open a ticket, maybe it's a bug effecting other players or your budget in a bigger way.. hope it helps!
---
Just tried and yeah it still isn’t working for me.
---
YES! The amount of times I have forgotten to switch back all my cards is a little upsetting tbh
---
strange how we are able to build a fast travel mat and radios in workshops but not in our own camp
---
Sure,no problem.
---
Your welcome.
---
That's kinda funny... yesterday, my "seat-of-the-pants-o-meter" was telling me that I seemed to be getting thirsty way faster than usual...
---
but I am beginning to think that I was just way more focused on what I was doing, and lost track of time.
---
If becoming a higher level is what you care about....?!?  The fun part of the game is doing the grind. The events, the nuke zones. The questlines and challenges... that’s all the stuff that makes it a GAME.
---
Oh, good! Def gonna get me a good boi
---
Yes...that is why the plan has been selling for 25k all weekend. Once people found this out it's gone a bit crazy.
---
You get badges for each one your complete that can then be spent at the appropriate vending machine at the Pioneer Scout Camp.
---
If you are on PS4 I'd love to borrow it later today.
---
I've received one badge in about 20+ times running the event, and I think that badge came from the first time. If it does drop badges, the reward rate is very low.
---
The 3 star can be tricky to get to. You have to go up, around, up, around again. I get lost looking for him every time but he is definitely there. Same with the legendary in the medical center.
---
Now I think about it just before this happened I got a survival quest completion and a 3 star legendary Gatling gun and I was in adventure
---
The plans are bugged as soon as any player touches it they learn and dont need to lose the plan you can pass it around all you wish
---
You killed him right?  Why?  Because fuck him that’s why!
---
I wish I could say it just dropped dead, but I saw that bullet blow his casing off lol it was honestly a level 12 who didn't know better.
---
Well rather than swap around I decided to equip both maxed cards before even attempting this. Less hassle in the heat of the moment. I know there have been swaps on what tames what, but with both on its moot :)
---
Yea I don't blame you for feeling that way with bs drop rates, I bought a 10mm TSE from someone who had 5 of them and they had exact same 3 star, been playing this game from day 1 with a pistol build and barely got a proper 10mm this month with that buy and thats with me farming Whitesprings ghouls for legendaries and playing this literally every day and only found about 4 of them to be 10mm lol, its just symptom of another problem and thats poor drop rates. You remember the drop rates for fashnact event for the masks the robots wore lol, literally ran that event every hour and server hopped to get even more runs per hour and never found a single one they wore till this recent duping exploit and I finally saw the Old Man Winter mask now. Ok with drop rates of cosmetic items but when you stop me from getting proper legendaries I need for bullet sponges then you ruin the players experience.
---
the kind that will burn my enemies into a cheez crisp
---
It looks like a stealth bomber lol
---
It's too new of a feature to expect people to think to look before logging out. Months of just exiting the game without a care in the world means it's going to be a while before people get into a new habit of checking. 
---
All we can do is raise awareness and hope people catch on.
---
Pretty cool huh.....
---
You can farm enough violet flux to make about 15-20 pure after each queen fight.
---
My role-playing hunter/trapper/leatherworker character crafts variations of low level hunting rifles, and sells them for dirt cheap in his vending machine.
---
I would like legendary effects for power armor.
---
zealots, assassins, mutant's, vanguard, regenerating
---
My guess is that its equal to GWS3...  most things cap at 90%, so that's why they say it doesn't stack with GWS.  I've started running GWS3 in place of One Gun Army on my heavy gunner and just swapping back to OGA for big fights.  Planning on trying out the refrigeration mod on my bloodied character since he can already carry a lot more weight from Unyielding armor and Radicool boosts to STR.
---
I really haven't figured out the water filter thing but 3 times already someone has purchased my water filter plan out of my machine, mind you i'm selling it for just 5 caps.
---
Locking the doors when there's no real need to do so is the player's fault. Just leave it unlocked.
---
You mean you cant stand anyone liking, like how your whinging right now.
---
Uhhhh.... shit.
---
Could I borrow the plan? I can pay
---
I used to leave a chair on either side of the large brick windows, so people could teleport though but enemies couldn't get in.
---
I can kill the sheepsquatch with ease, the hard part is keeping the brahmin alive.
---
I'm not sorry to say this but there is no obligation to sit around and wait.
---
If I want to log off, I'm going to log off.
---
Ty for fossil! And where did you get pemmican recipe?
---
I have sugar,spices, and the flour
---
Oohhh I will hit this up tonight. Thank you
---
Mostly and more important is do you want to even be playing with the FOOL that would quit for doing something lazy and stupid? So more good gamers would say WOW Big B is doing the REAL  gamers justice, maybe I should see why?
---
Camp Venture? Really? Is it a serverwide timed spawn? I just searched there, and I was the first person there (everything was locked up still), and not a single plan :-/
---
i think 500 is a baseline, but i got luck y last night and a player was selling them for only 250 each!
---
I think any form of medium sized pet will be worth it. If your camp is located and built well with defences, they can mop up enemies your turrets struggle with
---
Lol mildly disgruntled
---
How do you not have legendary armor?
---
Oh k so there's no specific food with all 3 I must cook
---
It’s really backwards when the game wants you to DESTROY and REMAKE mods every time you switch between accessories. Utter garbage game design. Please just make them very hard to make for the first time, like 100 lbs aluminum for a lens, but then allow us to freely switch between them. Same with weapon sights and muzzle attachments.
---
Get this man a tinfoil hat.
---
Could see play as a new build - "were-claw" or something. Maybe a new mutation that hulks you out as a deathclaw once per some set timer.
---
Really.....  never duped.  Actually, I really don't even know how to do it?  Funny how a "minority of people just automatically assume" everyone is duping because a technical issue comes up.
---
Thanks I appreciate it!
---
hi Im on Ps4, what is your psn id? i'd love to check out your selection as I want to try out eagle eyes mutation
---
Have one....
---
Are you using both Animal Friend and Wasteland Whisperer maxed?
---
There has been a change around in what tames what so having both will render this point moot.
---
Then again im looking to tame so might be incorrect when I find something!
---
This 👍
---
Yea totally agree, everyone I met that threaten to leave game if they had duped items wiped is more often then not wouldn't leave the game, a few would but odds are they will come back eventually and hope Bethesda understands that.
---
AA - receiver changes don't benefit the 25% of TS, so damage wise they end up pretty much around the same level.  You lose accuracy with TS and have increased weapon wear as well.  AA &gt; TS Lever.
---
Or, if you want to lock doors, lock the second floor where other players aren't likely to spawn.
---
plus you get a bounty for picking it
---
You made my day with this
---
If you are using VATS go AA, if using iron sights / scope I would do TS.
---
Agreed.  Actually, half the time I'm in Survival and I come across another player during an event or at their camp they don't attack me on sight if my gun isn't out.   In that case I wave, I leave them items if they are are below level 15 or so, and then I run for it.
---
It's really hard to convince someone that the game is in a better place when you've still got do much media saying the opposite.. and I tried to get my buddy to create a new PSN account, it should be no problem.. but they burned him and he's determined to never play any of their games again.
---
They seriously need to be more careful about bans, they should have implemented a way to track items, make them unique.. a 100% way to track dupers, so they can always make sure they're banning the right people, every time. No matter what.
---
Hopefully we can eventually get our friends back in the game! As big as they're making out the fall updates to be, I'm really hoping it's enough to bring most players back!
---
\^This one right here. Read it. I was genuinely confused what you were going for with that build - no melee stuff, really anemic non-auto rifle skills (why one point each of rifleman, expert rifleman, and master rifleman?). Nearly useless in the field cards filling your intelligence - why have a bonus for energy ammo when you're only carrying ballistic rifle perks, and permanently mounted chemist/hacker just seem like something a new player would do because they've got no other cards. 
---
Shift points from strength to perception and beef up those rifleman perks at a bare minimum if you're planning on playing that two-shot handmade on non-auto.
---
Yeah theres not always something there, but server hop and you will find them. I spent a couple of hours hopping those two places yesterday and got legs arms and chest. Good luck.
---
Precise and fast answer! Have my upvote und use it for a good purpose!
---
Yea but if this guy is saying he got bored so I think he is like me and doesn’t want to grind like that because it gets repetitive and boring. Some people might like that sort of game but I don’t, I got to level 90 and its getting really easy and boring I have over 100 stimpacks so death doesn’t occur very often so there is not much of a challenge. I already beat most of the main quests and there is really nothing left to do. I’m not saying that he can’t play I’m just saying that if he is like me he won’t wanna play.
---
There’s a way to spam the collect button. I think you take a drink and then hit collect as fast as you can while it’s pouring. You’ll know it’s working if your rads go up a bunch
---
Hmmm...maybe it's the typical character level who visit?  I tend to get low level character traffic.  By the time you are high level, you accumulate more than you can use (why I regularly restock my vending machine).  No one buys the radaway or radx, so I just leave them in a paper bag for people to take.
---
Yes, this has been a bug this week. Many of us got one just by playing the game normally.
---
grape mentats seem to be my best selling chem
---
Ran into that in Whitespring yesterday myself. So weird.
---
Yeah I had this happen last night, luckily I just fast travelled to the same camp (0 caps) and it put me outside the house.
---
It used to work so that you needed only Animal Friend, might have to check out with both of them at this point.
---
That's a food build, you use a lot of weight reduction perks instead of damage increase perks
---
Eh free legendary right?
---
it would be a good third game mode
---
How come?
---
Bethesda while you are at it can you let us setup RL Pioneer scout chapters please?
---
My Choo Choo wants to have some fashion!
---
Totally. And an “oops, sorry” emote.
---
Yep you have to mine them by hand unfortunately
---
95% of my playtime is out of PA. I dont run in PA except in a Nuke Zones. I also dont want to use Vats or have to Stealth thats just not my Play-style.
---
They released a [roadmap](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019) for 2019, a few months back.  The first section, Wild Appalachia, is almost finished.
---
I ran the event on and off all weekend - can't count how many times.  Certainly quicker than doing the challenges, but not remotely 'quick'.
---
On pc.
---
The one I got from that random workshop thing wasnt the gatling (I got that a few days ago). This was just some reward for clearing out the place (which I hadn't done). Wasnt a great weapon, but all rubbish legendaries gratefully received so I can turn it into scrip!
---
I'm always right, sometimes the universe is wrong.
---
Yea defo try it with both. That way you know your covered no matter what
---
hopefully, they have learned with the mess that was the rare mask drop chance and will actually make the drop chances realistic in the next event
---
The second shot in TS is wildly inaccurate while using VATS (just how it has been working), AA is still fully accurate in VATS. TS still does great damage so if not using VATS it may be the weapon of choice.
---
Tons of aid, very very few badges.  Might get a few caps from duplicate recipes, I've been selling off my spares at about 50 caps per.
---
Yeah, but if it has a primary perk (exterminators, mutants, two shot, nocturnal, etc), explosive will be pushed down to the second slot, which doesn't show up in a basic list view of items.
---
That doesn't mean that this game isn't fun to others, especially when most bugs are squashed and it can be found for half that price pretty much any time. They've greatly improved upon the game, the legendary vendor and player vending are great examples of that!
---
All that's coming is greatness, and you'd be a fool to contradict that without at least giving it a chance!
---
Or.. go back to your sticks if they're all that.
---
You're jealous there's no other logical reason
---
Ooo I know the place, if I ever decide to move it will be there or the place that spawns the cats lol
---
Can’t wait till Thursday for the purveyor update
---
Ive seen it a few times all over the place, must be a bug after the update.
---
A 1\* L20 vampire machete was me weapon of choice for about 25 levels.
---
One was given to me by a high level, the 2nd was a drop in the golf club house.
---
Paying it forward, gace the 2nd on to a lower level chracter.
---
Switched over to a non legendary L45 cultist blade for a bunch more levels.  
---
Now thats being replaced by a 1\* vampire switchblade...L45 or 50, I forget which.
---
Msg me on Xbox
---
Tell me about it. Still haven't received a single Tadpole or Possum token from this event or the dailies. Took 5 tries just to get the S'Mores recipe! Now that I have it, I'm making extras and selling them for a cap in my vendor station. :)
---
Because there are more people saying you're wrong and you're probably not looking through everything.
---
Only 150-350, that's the general trade prices on the trade sites. Higher than that is a ripoff imho.
---
Shouldn't we be more pushing for Bethesda into fixing this problem than putting it onto the sellers to sort out a workaround?
---
I would have to say AA over TS. I had the same question with Gatling lasers and even without as many mods on the AA, it still came out on top.
---
Except you CAN'T drop it now... It pops up a warning saying *"You cannot drop this item. If you do it will be destroyed, but you will receive the plans to make a new one."*
---
However, yes, after reading the thread I came to the same conclusion; it's valuable in the event of having ones equipped with specific lenses. 
---
Still... Shame I fixed up 6 or 7 to gift to newbs, only to end up with that message when trying to drop it. I'm less tore up over the wasted materials (can't "scrap" them at any workbenches either) than I am about not being able to drop a nice new ProSnap Deluxe for a low level player. Giving stuff to folk just... makes me happy \*shrug\* Even if they might be the alt of a lvl 332 character :P *(Though, I do look at the accountname first, as I opted not to gift a bunch of stuff to a lvl 1 called "L00TB0X" lol)*
---
It’s a lot more kid friendly then fo1/2
---
It’s basically a re-skinned Skyrim with camps
---
I have a power switch for my camp that turns off the vending machines in a locked room next to the generator but I’ve never seen anyone spawn in that room
---
Hey dumbass, the 1st amendment which governs free speech just means that the government cannot do anything to infringe upon that right. Companies and private organizations can do whatever the hell they want.
---
Again that is why #3 is so important. Big B has dropped on the ball, and this is NOT the first time. But IMHO the worst. There is a 3.5gb player mod which is a patch to FO4, because of the bugs... but you make a ONLINE game that you basically copied and pasted from FO4 and NEVER fixed the 3.5gb worth of bugs for the single player game yourself!!! We all really can't complain at all knowing that this game was not something that the "fan base" ever even asked for, so I am glad that it's as good as it is, and that Big B even is at least doing something, which is WAY better than what they are known to do for most of their stuff.
---
Drop by Toxic Larry's in the Savage Divide if you're server hopping (or just whenever you log on), it spawns 3 Snallygasters for around 20 acid total.  If not server hopping, check it out every half hour or so for their respawn.  Take Hemlock Holes workshop, 3 acid nodes there so 30 every half hour. Park your camp on an acid node, another 10 every half hour.  That's around 100 to 120 acid per hour for doing very little.  Between all of those, even after mining Lucky Hole I still have plenty of acid leftover.
---
That would be cool
---
It would also be cool to see what other items are going for and the prices. So you can undercut prices.
---
Yeah, well, I wasn't born just to pay taxes either yet here we are....
---
I bought it how do I equip it? (New player)
---
Not Remotely the same context.
---
I’d take what you can get than.
---
Quite possibly but karma will prob catch up with him eventually, one day he might bite off more than he can chew at a workshop, you never know
---
It should, but does it?
---
&gt; **Telltale sign that the gaming justice trolls failed at destroying fallout 76.** 
---
Oof. Too soon. RIP Telltale games.
---
Wish we could have the food we harvest off them could be grilled.
---
Shishkabob, flamer, fire modified weapons, and explosive weapons.
---
I'm of the mind that there was only ever one real fix for 'challenge' and it would have been having survival be the only mode in the game. Not exactly as it exists now, nor exactly like it was at launch either. That said, I don't think the 76 community at large is clamoring for more challenge, and that's 100% fine. I'm happy that the majority of the community wants this game to be more like casual single player Skyrim than say Rust and got exactly that. 
---
I enjoy the game a lot, even with the lack of challenge, but I do wish there was another way. I'm just kind of holding out for private servers and mods to be the only real fix for it. Unless Bethesda has a stroke of genius and somehow makes Survival mode better/work.
---
It's actually a bigger issue of any "auto stim" functionality - whether from armor or perk - not detecting if the stim can actually do anything at all. You'll see the issue you describe if you rad up to a certain point (like you might for a Bloodied build) and equip auto-stim armor or the Born Survivor perk - you'll watch stimpaks burn all day long even though they cannot possibly restore a single point of health anymore than if you were at 100%.
---
Clearly the logic needs to be changed to trigger not based on your true maximum health (based on Endurance, etc.) but to instead trigger based on "available" maximum health. That might be 19% if your radded up, or zero if you're downed. If you're at 0/0, your at "100%" health, so no autostim.
---
Not, trying to be a dick, but, when was it normal?
---
Duping fucked it all up by December 1rst.
---
You're missing out, I have every mutation except for empath, it makes you something like a demigod!
---
The game is very easy once you reach end game.  
---
I always play on the hardest difficulty when playing games, but I don't consider this more of a casual game to play socially with my brother and friend.
---
There is that little track gocart thing near Top Of The World station. Stick a few on clear sections of track, and let us ride it a ways when we find one.
---
"I'm" making a problem? Thats hilarious. And that wasn't what I said. My only point was that they manage to fuck it up before, somehow. Of course you aren't getting credit card details from trading in game. I hope O.O
---
It usually goes for 5-7k
---
I'd really love to know what I've been selling things for...I never remember what I've got in the list, much less what I listed it for (after it sold).
---
Hard to jot down notes when people go on a buying spree in the middle of SBQ or some other event where I kinda need to pay attention to the screen.
---
Also, have the random card generator check if you already have max cards, and quit giving them to you.  
---
You can select more, if you wish, as this is useful. Just stop forcing it on me. Oh, hooray. Another Commando card for my melee tank. Now I have 5. Just what I was hoping to get.
---
Hi, my Psn is LosXorbos.
---
I'll be online in 2 hours more or less.
---
It wouldn't generate caps you Muppet, you would put some in and they could be taken by other players
---
That's why I removed the two star items and only keep the one stars in there. Weapons like bloodied and instigating doesn't need 2nd or 3rd star to be great, those are just icing on the cake. Same with unyielding armors. If you have an awesome zealot's piece that has cavalier listed as the third star, people won't see it.
---
I agree. But it’s never been like this put a post up selling my handmade and they’ll do 6k... aae 25% less vats 6k is crazy
---
I'm not even joking. My friend did the math. Bloody/Fire Rate/Reload Speed Gat Plas would be the highest sustained DPS in the entire game if it worked with Stabilized. RN that's 50 cal, i believe
---
ouch
---
That should be the next thing the legendary vendor exchanges!
---
Build up points with old perk cards for new ones!
---
If you're on PC I'll let you blueprint two purifiers I have on a rug, they fit perfectly and can be placed anywhere :)
---
http://imgur.com/JnoFetF
---
Oh I do, but that doesn’t do anything now. In 3 days it will though
---
For levers always AA no matter what, for Handmades it becomes debatable.
---
Levers do not have armor penetrating magazine mods, the AA is the only way to get AP without perks.
---
Handmades have significant AP mags, meaning that they wouldn’t benefit as much from AA because AP stacks multiplicatively—AA is still hugely significant and comparable/slightly greater than TS—however if we’re just talking weapons without AP mags, the Lever benefits hugely from AA and should be chosen over TS 100% of the time here
---
Just jump in Adventure mode. People are genrally nice, and the game guides you well to get started. 
---
Start in prime time, and there will likely be people waiting outside the vault to help you get started.
---
I would love to see this implemented so we could legit track what is happening to stacks of items sold under 10c. Regarding big ammo sales, I’ve noticed we are getting totally screwed out of caps. Some say it’s a visual bug but I’m unable to accurate test and track this. A log would help.
---
That's part of why I said it. I figured if they're letting us exchange legendary items now, why not perk cards?
---
The 3 1* Rifleman Perks allow for 30% Total Damage increase. If i increased only one of those to 3* i would only get 20% total.
---
The High Intelligence is so can Run Gunsmith and Weapon Artisan, or Armorer and Fix it Good, or all three science perks when doing my crafting or repairs. My leading shot is an 3* (Instigating, Double Damage if at Full Health) Gauss so i have a few cells from that. I guess i could slim it down a point and move elsewhere.
---
Servers may be regionalized, so you're more likely to get attached to the same set of (X) servers being served up in your area (X will vary).
---
Well I can see just doing one point each of rifleman. Marginal benefit is low after that.
---
Perhaps not, it doesn't show anything different in the mutation description like it does the other mutations.
---
Question whats  IMHO?
---
Yes, unfortunately there are others like us. I have them on my main gaming rig and across all characters, but they don't appear on my gaming laptop; both systems have Nvidia GPU's and are running the latest Nvidia drivers.
---
There’s not tho 😐 it’s empty lol everyone is scattered all over map
---
the built in price is a good starting point.   MSRP, as it were.  
---
Most items in my machine are slightly less than that, b/c I'm more interested in clearing space than I am making huge profit.
---
The most expensive thing in my machine is a High Speed Shredding Minigun, and thats priced just over 500c.
---
It's not impossible, i've done the event a lot of time and i can even solo it. You just need to use your brain and above average equipment. And also some perks are important, imo.
---
I know you will downvote my like you did with many posts here, but this is the truth. The event is not impossible, it's not even difficult. Take it or leave it.
---
I made a similar post to this ... you can tag them, but its vague.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bnof9w/more_descriptive_challenge_completion/
---
He will have 2-3 out if a pool of 20 outfits each time his inventory refreshes. Completely random.
---
Well you asked what you're doing wrong. Not using vats or stealth is what you're doing wrong. And wasting perks so you can haul junk around.
---
Haha that would be pretty fun to watch happen from your camp. It definitely enhances the RP element to it. I actually like that things spawn in with the layer as now it results in a lot of short team up battles. I always end up fighting SBs by myself and it takes a lot of bullets and stims. Taking one down with another player was so much more fun, especially since their base was on the edge of a huge cliff and from a 3rd person perspective looked incredible.
---
This is not the weight glitch you are looking for, move along.
---
Seems the newest dupe is cap related and requires a group of players working together to make it profitable and only a few are being created at a time. Saw this particular scheme going on this past weekend.  The items are all rare, Legacy or for the meta builds.  The duper players run around very actively promoting these items at a really low price.  They have 3 or 4 with the exact same Legendary effects with slightly different mods. I suppose it's fooling some into thinking they aren't duped because they have different player applied mods.  They get their caps, go back. dupe some more up, rinse and repeat.  Adds up to alot after a few hrs.
---
It's an M rated game
---
The issue is that the recent dupe put a ton of explosive handmades on the market and the mechanism of the dupe puts pressure on the dupers to sell fast and cheap. Thus certain weapons have taken a nose dive in value. What platform are you on and how much are you looking for?
---
really?  I bought the plan out of a vending machine for 2100 ... lucky me
---
Man thank you so much and same I'm at work so I won't be on till later and don't worry I'm not stupid enough to do that at the end of the day it's a game I want to enjoy it and the only thing you gain from that is getting blacklisted and shunned I mean I would much much rather be a good member of the community and have the perks such as this one where we help each other I need something next time maybe I can give you something either way thanks my GT is kronokingk
---
Just remember this game is basically made from FO4, a game that has a 3.5gb player mod of that SINGLE PLAYER game, that patches bugs that Big B had not. That said Big B makes this game, on the still known 3.5gb buggy game and make it ONLINE, when the "fan base" are and have been asking for FO5. So we are all crazy to be playing this lol, so yeah the BIG issue is #3 by far. But at least this time Big B is doing something, we can hope they do more. But the damage needs to be undone as best and as hardcore as it can be done. Bad RNG is at least something that is a thing for all games so again its I play this I let them known I hate it, but I hope they "fix it"
---
Totally agree! What I’ve had to do many times now is try to use a chair, music instrument, workbench, etc. to phase out of their locked bases. But that only works if they’ve set something up outside of a window. Alternatively, you can place your PA on the outside if there’s a window and phase out of their locked camp that way. But even better, STOP LOCKING YOUR DOORS!!
---
Why downvote this post? lol
---
PSA: Not all fedoras seem to work. I had two types, and only one worked when picking up bones.
---
I will update tonight with list.
---
find graham.  He sells the plan - cheap.
---
Oh right lol.
---
Well it would make sense. But then again, the legendarys are physical items that are carried in your inventory but the perk cards are not.
---
I imagine it would be a separate mechanic and machine after all. Then again we have a nice shiny personal computer we could benefit from added functions
---
the post does not say how to tag them. Can you enlighten us?
---
I don't use rifles. But I guess this would work better than what you have. It's also suited for power armor usage and can hold loads of cores for the power armor. And if you use the rest of the points you can max out Str and turn it into a melee character.
---

In my humble op... lol
---
This would also make up for the cooldown they added to participating in events.. world bosses always made sense to me, give us new interesting fights!
---
Have u ever heard about the upcoming legendary player system?
---
That will solve this problem

I got crazy lucky. Yesterday was my first time getting on since the pioneer update and I managed to connect with a player to get my swimmer badge and on my second time accidentally triggering the campfire event I got my s’mores. The real task is going to be finding all those ingredients. 
---
I’m so bad at cooking in this game.
---
Edit: selling s’mores is an amazing idea!!!
---
OP how many times did you fast travel during this period? How active were you during this time? What was your perk loadout?
---
There are a bunch of other variables that need to be considered.
---
The Kings make great pets, and they are probably the strongest tameable creature. Unfortunately tameable ones are super hard to find. Took me forever to get one, but he survived for an exceptionally long stretch (compared to my other pets). Unfortunately another player eventually got him. I couldn’t find another, so I had to settle for a Hunter, which is the next best thing.
---
Also, I live in the mire, so it just seems appropriate to have one, since that’s where they lurk apparently.
---
Bethesda didn't make NV either, that was Obsidian.
---
For all the work and effort involved I'm a lil disappointed that there are negatives/tradeoffs to the mods. I just think if we work for it then that's the effort to get it. -60 to energy and rad resistance one is esp. yecky to me.
---
Maybe OP can test that as well. 😅
---
It's bad on pvp servers as well. They lock them as trap bases. You see a vendor in survival. Travel there and get stuck in a base with turrets that kill you. And since they took away damaging camps unless you hit the camps owner you cant bust down things to escape and just get wrecked. That's bullshit to me.
---
Usually a hefty bounty and loads of hysterical nonsense over area chat. #RAIDERLIFE
---
Or at least explain this, it's the dumbest choice they could make, if there's a technical reason why- we deserve to know!
---
The problem is the limited range most players have for deploying the smoke grenade since most players do not put three points into the grenade range perk.  It would be nice if the grenade launcher could shoot a smoke grenade a long distance so you could stand by your artillery piece and target something that is not within the minimum artillery range.
---
I did hear about it from the 2019 roadmap, but not in depth. If that solves this problem that'll be great
---
If you highlight the challenge there is an option to track it.  Look at the bottom of the screen to determine what button it is for your platform.
---
Last night I gooified the Scorched Queen Beast. I really needed a ‘Sorry’ or ‘Ups’ emote.
---
Yeah I do get that but I use the flux for serums. I get better stuff from selling serums than I ever do from the Queen's shitty loot pool. I'll just stick to my bloody nom explosive 50cal. She works just fine without a prime receiver I guess. Who knows, maybe one day.
---
F76 doesn't really scratch any itches for me. I really want another Fallout with strong RPG... hell, just something along the quality levels of Far Harbor even would be great from Bethesda (I don't expect them to be like Obsidian, obsidian had more a focus on RPG where as Bethesda has more a focus on freedom of play).
---
But I kinda see it as seperate from the other Fallout games and I enjoy it a lot for what it is (and every update seems to make it better). And it does do one thing really well that I've always loved in bethesda (and honestly even obsidian's fallout cause they did a good job with this too) fallouts, the whole finding snippets of the past and piecing together a story from what you find (Fallout 4 honestly was really weak in this regard and one of the reasons I said they got worse even compared to their own game 3. For me I enjoy 4 more than 3 mainly because the gunplay is better and survival mode was really good, it did what hardcore was trying to do in NV but did it much better).
---
And 76's story is very coherant with every piece adding something (even from pre bombs to post bombs.... they all paint a very unified picture). Hell, in a way that's something I thought NV did better than other Bethesda Fallouts (every faction ahd a story but it all contributed to one main story telling about the whole world. All the little side stories actually contributed to painting a picture about the story of the overall area). And that's something else 76 shares with NV that I like, the story seems more about the world and your character is just an excuse to influence the story/find the story. The story doesn't revolve around you. Personally I think that is a better way to do an RPG where you want to give the player freedom to be who he or she wants to be. Because you then don't have to dictate who their character  is, but their character gets to influence the story. Granted Bethesda was forced since this is an MP game and they can't revolve it around any one player, but I think it's a better approach to story writing for these type of games anyways. I think that's one of the problems with 3 and 4, they are trying to revolve around it being a story about your character.
---
Plus honestly, I really loved the survival mode in 4 almost enough to make up for the weak RPG and enough for me to say I liked it better overall than 3. And 76 is all about that survival game play ;).
---
The same sort of scrip system they're using for Legendaries could be modified to fit perk cards. Sell to the vendor for 1 scrip per point cost, exchange some multiple of scrip for a random card of a specific point cost, in a specific SPECIAL stat.
---
So little do you know about large companies.   You really have no idea what companies do.  And after they are caught they settle without admitting any guilt.
---
Though I would add Zealot's and Hunter's for certain weapons to that list.
---
Those prefixes are good for the SBQ fight, and generally fending off Sierra Bravos.
---
Hello, I make serums I usually price them at 200-300 for people who buy them just to sell, but when people are looking for that specific mutation I do charge them more lol (it’s a free market;) but yeah you did overpay.
---
Cant you read? As i said you can have fun with literally anything. But you cant use "well people can have fun with it" as an excuse for selling shit in a box for 60$ and then saying "oh but some people got it for free 2 weeks later"
---
It shows how little they care for you as a customer. All they want is your money and if thats fine with you then so be it
---
It's not the destination (higher levels, best guns) but the journey.  This is not your game if you crave instant gratification.
---
you also don't have travelling pharmacy maxxed out and you don't have any thru hiker at all. So yeah you're going to have carry weight issues.
---
It's going to be exactly like getting a drop, except you get to pick it its melee/ranged/armor and the amount of stars. Other than that it's totally random
---
Do you have to stabilize the flux for the ammo?
---
25k. Xbox 1 
---
Ima hold it until it settles cause it’s a great handmade I just don’t need one that good so I thought maybe caps would be worth it but not for 6
---
thanks. That will be a godsend!
---
My mules only carry 1500 lbs and they get hungry and thirsty so quickly. This guy is probably permanently stationed at a buffet table.
---
light hearted reply-
---
be carefull what you wish for, you might just get it.
---
get killed............page 1, lesson 1.......level one.......now thats survival mode.
---
get what you mean tho. get killed, spawn &amp; repeat. no actual danger apart from some junk. would req some brain storming to come up with something viable,and still keep the game playable. like possibly lose a level as you say. mind you, getting clobbered, puts my back up, "oh really ! ,  you just wait there ". "I'll be back."
---
1500 lbs is 681.0 kg
---
For some things from the Atom Shop you are actually automatically being given the plan to craft them and others you get the actual item.  I think I had to craft mine at an armor workbench under the headgear items list then I could go into my apparel list and select it to actually wear it.
---
Yeah those "Camera challenges" are ridiculous every day, asking you to take picture of other players without a way to communicate in game xD
---
This functionality was already incorporated into the checklist I made:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bm8k6q/i\_made\_an\_interactive\_checklist\_for\_all\_pioneer/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bm8k6q/i_made_an_interactive_checklist_for_all_pioneer/)
---
The list can be filtered according to badge/challenge type/etc. by clicking the arrows on each of the column headers, so you can set it to only show crafting challenges, or to show everything but exploration ones, etc.
---
I'm not trying to self-promote, just... y'know. Yeah.
---
I was hoping for this at launch with the ability to share Charisma and other Perks within a faction, plus controlling the tunes and having nonsense to say over the in-game radio.
---
That's why you MAC ban. That bans the device, not just the modem. This being said, it won't completely stop the whales with several PCs, or systems, but it'll put a big dent in them.
---
what crates, photo?
---
Ive been running with 3* Thru Hiker for a few days now but am trying to slim down my Food/Meds and getting annoyed with all the Ballistic Fiber im going through. Stims are my only weight sink for meds hence why I'm running TP at all.
---
Good to know!! That event rarely pops anymore so I figured it would take forever.
---
Doubt it. I'm no duper, but I guarantee all of the end game gear I have bought off here is duped... especially my be handmade and unyielding sent set and have never ran gunsmith and have only experienced this issue with the laser.
---
Grind baby grind!!!  West Tec is a great place to do this....
---
okay thanks for letting me know!  it was just confusing and i guess i stand corrected.  i’ll hold onto the mod just in case anything bad happens.
---
Ah! Thank you!
---
I would gladly pay for a subscription service if it meant we gained music rights on the radio. I would also pay for the production of more original music that fit the theme that Bethesda could use for all their fallout games going forward.
---
Bethesda I want to give you more money for more music, please help!
---
I'm god tier PvPer. Most of assassin/sentinel sets wielders I consider meat. I have stored in my stash, across my mules, all interesting PvP sets: ass/sent, ass/cav, uny/sent, weightless/sent. I have three decked-out, fully equipped characters.
---
My current main PvP character, the sneaky auto-sniper, uses armor with following perks: regenerating, assassin, chameleon, unyielding (2), ap refresh (2, want it to be 3, kinda lazy upgrading cuz it works), harder to detect while sneaking (3), cavalier (2). By common understanding, it has no sense, and I gathered it for less than 20k total. 
---
The thesis that the PvP is unplayable without full set of ass/sent or ass/cav is false. Its lack of knowledge of how different builds work and how to apply pressure against them that makes PvP unplayable, not lack of items.
---
It's getting even more grindier and heavily luck based...... :( daily challenges used to be simple and fun... not anymore.
---
Probably 60 times as in 60 damage ticks. Makes sense. Good to know.
---
Lead belly, I eat and drink all shit, intestines included.
---
So there’s that.
---
Sooooo....what's your question?
---
Fingers crossed :D
---
The recent Patch 9 made many creatures like those untamable (FYI it’s mentioned in the Perks section of patch notes)...
---
Wrong platform for me.
---
You are definitely looking for a pre dupe price. You won't get that right now. Price is probably 8-12k for that weapon right now, so 6k is still a low-ball.
---
I just hate that when you play solo and you die, (unless an event) you can only respawn in one location that's possibly on the other end of the map! That's twice the loading time!!! Plus, I get anxiety of someone stealing my junk! T\_T
---
I list them at 500 caps, because I can get that from a vendor. If you're cool I might take 100 caps off in a direct trade, but they're 500 in the machine.
---
The reason is to stop people from buying them all up and then reselling them to vendors for the 500 caps price.
---
Someone had a machine full of serum for 350 ea. I could have bought them all just to resell for the 150 cap gain, but I politely didn't lol
---
I learned that the hard way when I switched to a bloodied build. About 50 Stims disappeared without me realizing cause the volume was turned down, I didn’t realize they were constantly activating.
---
I agree.
---
There’s one south of Morgantown, and one near a relay tower by flatwoods. The full text was datamined a month or two ago.
---
I concur. Even now that I've been playing for a few weeks without Pharma Farma equipped, I still find enough of all the chems where I am able to: A) Have enough for my own day to day needs (with a couple in my Stash), B) Sell to the Bots for a fat sack of caps C) Give away a bunch to the low level players I come across (I don't assume they're into drugs, so this is just RadAway, RadX and Stimpacks).
---
The only hard-stuff I keep on me are 3 of: Bufftats, Psychobuff, Psychotats, X-Cell  
---
Non hard stuff are: 4x Grape Mentats, and however many Disease Cure/Antibiotics I come across (I have about 2 and 8, ATM *\[again, even w/o Farma perk I still find enough!\])*
---
Honestly, my original purpose for the hard stuff was simply their +STR for additional carry weight to get me to a vendor. These days I've got Excavator's +100 to help, which I can't wait for them to fix the Calibrated Shocks not applying, then it'll be +200! Otherwise I pop a Psycho-- during Imposter Sheepsquatch since she's a hard hitting birch! It's like having an oak tree fall on you. *(git it? tree puns? ba-a-a-ahaha* *^(\[sheep pun FTW!\])**)*
---
Therefore, my suggestion is: If you're only selling what you find... and you really want to sell to *people*, not the bots (where you'd make more)... then I'd say whatever you prices are right now, halve them. People will buy them out of convenience then. Or move to the lowbie zone, since they'll feel more comfortable being in their zone, and can afford that price.  
---
*However*, there are then the specific meds that are required to make certain other things, so if people are making their own and need those... they may be worth keeping at a slightly higher price.
---
thanks for responding everyone.  i was able to mod the backpack to 120 carry weight.  i hadn’t realized that carrying the plan meant you learnt it without having to read the note for it.  i stand corrected.
---
Quest*
---
How did you even get that much scrip this quickly? That must be at least 10-20 very well equipped weapons etc.
---
oh yeah those crates.
---
They are super easy to get just server hop to do campfire event and you go a chance to a possum coin when you complete it.I have only did one passum badge and i was able to buy the backpack mod
---
Weapon artisan does you no good in combat, only when repairing weapons. Same with armorer and fix it good. I don't run gunsmith at all in the field, and still only have to repair my primary rifle once every two or three days; specialty rifles go a week or more.
---
Chemist is worth zero when you're running, and hacker one is close to useless. If you don't have the time to swap to a hacker card, you're under too much pressure to be hacking anyway. I guess I can see the batteries included with the Gauss rifle; I liked mine until I realized that between the rifle and ammo (even with 3\* batteries included) I was carrying 50 lbs total just to use one weapon. 
---
Around your level, I slimmed down to three star handmade and lever action (plus The Fixer) so I only carry two kinds of ammo, both very lightweight (.45 and 5.56). [This was my rifle build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=bc4667a&amp;d=sb2s01sa2p02pd2pk2pl2e00c72cr0i12s12s72lu2l71sg2lk1eh2la2a03c40&amp;w=c30a80a72ei0lt2ep1e60ea1i30ia0i50ik0ii0l02lp1l62p10s52lj2c02lb0sw1s91sc0pa0p80p90pm0p70p30el0eq0e70e80ci0c52cj0cf0c90ij2ic4if2i44i80ie0iq2i71io0at1a40a60ac0aa0lm2lq0ar2si1im1in1l92cv2&amp;n=Leeroy%20Jenkins&amp;m=019if6c) back when I was still carrying a gauss rifle. Far from perfect, but no problem with Colonel Gutsys (shoot for the thrusters), assaultrons (take out the legs), or melee mutants (put shooting muties between you and them and keep ducking in and out of melee range so they keep switching between shooting and melee, then backpedal like crazy when you're down to just the melee muties).
---
50 lbs is 22.7 kg
---
Yes I would love to have a snap on/off option!
---
  I want to login every day because I really like this game... and I have a ton of incomplete quests/missions....but IRL has other ideas of what to do with my time, so I don't get to play every day.
---
Getting caps, scrip, atoms, etc. are not primary goals - earning them is passive result of whatever I accomplish during play sessions.
---
No question, simply an announcement of plans available for sale
---
We don't see things equally and thats good people have various perspectives and preferences. You are an awesome person to discuss stuff with. I now want to play even more Fallout xD
---
Ok, that didn't work so well, but it was informative. For anyone curious, the possum rewards are not tradeable it seems. :-( Also good to finally have an answer to [my earlier question](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bnptwk/what_exactly_are_the_cosmetic_possum_badge/): you don't get plans to craft the item, just a singular item you can do nothing with except to equip or stash it.
---
last week was better than this week
---
is there any perks or anything that might help speed it up a little
---
[Here you go!](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bn33ul/is_this_worth_buying_or_coming_back_to_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)
---
I'm sure that whoever programmed the machines doesn't play the game. I'm also sure they'll fix this soon.
---
Better than ever. If you are a fun of fallout and especially fallout 4, then fo76 is great right now, and it's only will be getting better with every new update.  
---
Also if you are on PC, check out mods on nexusmods, they really enhance gameplay by 1000%.
---
This isn't true.  You can drink them fine with the card equipped.
---
You could have a mechanic of some sort to pop the bosses.  Like the first quest you can do when you join the pioneer scouts collecting the mutating sludge or whatever the hell its called.  People collect enough and you spawn a boss.  Something the makes people work together would seem the best way to go about it.
---
So what I do is buy like one bullet or something to alert the owner that someone is in their shop, and hopefully they come back so I can inspect the 2 or 3 star I'm looking at...
---
They are masterclass at hype. Country roooooads
---
Thank you! Sorry for clogging your feed!
---
Not true on PC at least.
---
Where players spawn is half way between its original location and the only other location I have ever put it.
---
I spawn at the edge of the build area to the north every single time.
---
No-one has ever spawned at the C.A.M.P. machine, nor at any of its previous locations.
---
Loadouts would be ideal. I'd even settle for outright just being able to destroy extra perk cards. I'm literally never going to use my 3 copies of Super Duper 1 when i already have Super Duper 3
---
Would you care to sell them?
---
I plan the build based on mutations it will need, and 2 points of starched genes.  
---
A bloodied build is good. A bloodied build with Adrenal Reaction is amazing. Regeneration is also nice, but not a game changer.
---
Both these would be nice. They'd get my atom points for these for sure.
---
Just do it :)
---
I'm usually on 9-midnight (central time) if you see me online I'll help you out.
---
I'm thegunguyinc on PS4
---
I wish, but they won't. With my RNG luck I'm sure I'll get 10 Anti-Armor laser rifles in a row from the Purveyor. Talk about useless. :-P
---
Wait I have one possum badge but it says it requires 8? What's the deal?
---
Hell, I just want to be able to put down my CAMP without getting a "selected item is floating" message!
---
Take chems, like psycho to help defeat mutants but other than that not that I know.
---
I would, but first I have to pass it around my friends group.
---
You have to log into the computers then wait wait wait for your number to be called
---
It’s all good, it just gets asked a million times. But that post should have all the answers you’re looking for.
---
Right on!
---
I will def be sure to check that out mate. Thank you!
---
Wow, you must be the luckiest person I've ever met. I should build a shrine to your glory!
---
Nobody uses prime receivers, hardened does the same damage, no flux stuff needed. Bethesda really needs to buff the supposedly 'end game' weapon and ammo so that people will grind harder. 
---
Same with 'assassins' junk, people dump them as soon as they pick them up. 10% does literally nothing when all players are wearing magic armors. Even +50% does very little. Players are wearing the best armors in game, not super mutants.
---
Go right ahead, hopefully we will see some solutions soon
---
I would like to, honestly I would. But I've got dozens of 2-3\* legendary weapons and armor for sale at my CAMP (and dozens more on my person waiting for an open slot in the machine) and I refuse to be tied to my CAMP because Bethesda can't be bothered to have the 'inspect' button work correctly.
---
Yes, I get irritated too when I see a nice 3\* combat armor or whatever when I'm out and I don't feel like shelling out a few thousand caps on something I don't know everything about. But that's not that player's fault -- that's Bethesda's fault for not enabling what I would think would be a basic function of player vending (and one that I thought they had fixed with the robo vendors).
---
And honestly the more I think about it the more I believe it might be an intentional choice to slow down the player vending economy to keep too many caps from changing hands too quickly. I mean it could be an oversight, sure. But they can't honestly not know inspecting items is a crucial part of buying high end legendary loots.
---
crops take a lot of budget so save some by removing as many as you can.  
---
Also anything in the "defence" category take a lot of budget.
---
OK thank you :)
---
Yeah honestly I'd just like to destroy the extras. Is that too much to ask?
---
damn, Gram was in Doddy Sods while I had it yesterday, he even helped my defend it.
---
You really think those disconnects are because of duping? The method everyone is using is tied to vendors and doesn't crash the game. 
---
Touch wood I've not had any in weeks, so it's either system or platform specific as most complaints seem to be Xbox &amp; PC players.
---
I don't deny there's a lot of duping going on, as I've seen vendors selling obvious duped stuff, and I know someone that does it. I guarantee everyone has something duped, and I just don't think these dupers are the evil bogeyman they're portrayed to be. I don't understand why everyone gets so hysterical about them.
---
A market flooded with duped god rolls, makes for a cheaper market in my opinion and gives you a chance to use them.
---
Bethesda just doesn't àlike it because they keep messing the game up with each patch they release. If the game wasn't so buggy and poorly cobbled together then duping would've disappeared months ago.
---
I love this game, but we should be able to criticise it lol.
---
another light hearted comment :- "hey ,look, some guy, actually, went and did it".
---
we thought no-one would be daft enough to try it.
---
I'm sure the devs do things like this for amusement
---
I do then when it is the bot wont let me interact
---
I agree on the server load issues, that may be an issue on tracking them
---
Tourists do spawn in specific locations.
---
LMAO!!!!
---
Agreed, but it takes all kinds, ya know?
---
This is why I leave my vendor on my front porch.
---
Nope. I destroyed my entire second floor to try to put my kitchen back, it was there previously but I remodeled and didn’t like it so I tried putting it back. Whether you put the stove or the stairs first it says the two items are “colliding”. Weird part it’s just the swirling stove, I can put the fake one and other things under it no problem.
---
Not true, I've got a variety of explosive weapons, every one says it's explosive in the description while the prefix describes the primary effect- you just have no way of knowing what the third effect is.
---
If the description describes the prefix then it isn't explosive.
---
so, if you deactivate your Vending machines, what happens?
---
So Nukashine is a free method for travel?  Is there nothing unique about the places it takes you?
---
That would be cool also. I was thinking of an addition of a laser homing device, where we could “paint the target” and initiate a strike. They can even make it a new brotherhood of steel mission. Send a satellite into space type of mission and he reward is the attachment or laser device.But I’m down with a grenade launcher addition.
---
Well I know it sucks but you do have voice chat to communicate so you can't really say that
---
literally all of your comments on this sub have been some variation of "this game is SHIT. I ditched it ages ago!". Literally circlejerking
---
Understandable...
---
Your camp doesn’t show up on the map
---
The Artillery can go from the Auto shop near Vault 76 all the way to Collision course. Its a good range. Just got to get your camp in the right position.
---
I actually noticed people spawning in my house early on and keep my doors open in adventure mode now.
---
I would buy a whole bunch for heavy weapons but Bethesda says we're too busy making pajamas and camp decors.
---
I'd be ok with ghouls, robots, supermutants and maybe sentient death claws since those are all cannon and all but one have been playable characters in past games.
---
ah, That makes sense actually LOL..
---
&gt; This makes the game not fun and looses a bunch of content if they want this game to be anything 
---
You realize they built this game for people to play as multiplayer role-playing shooter, not an economics simulator, right? I'm having a blast interacting with people in my camp, and the hoarder in me is placated knowing all those legendaries crowding my stash can be converted to something of value.
---
May not be fun for you, but declaring the game "not anything" because it doesn't cater to a niche group focused on one tiny aspect of the game seems kind of preposterous. It'd be like saying the game is no fun because they introduced more recipes with the scouting expansion and now no one's buying your iguana on a stick.
---
The Watoga guys sell the scopes fairly often
---
I've never been curious enough to check the weight differentials, but maybe some food spoils into heavier spoiled meat/fruit/vegies?
---
Do you have any recommendations for camp placement?
---
It doesn't matter where the vendor machine is. The spawn point could be inside of your locked house, like mine is. All of my vendors are outside, but when players fast travel to my camp, they spawn inside my house.
---
If there's any technical reason it can't be implemented, we could suggest a doorbell to let us know we're wanted at our camp. I can't imagine this design choice was made without some sort of technical limitation.
---
Thanks man, heading there now.
---
Where are you looking for?
---
Put on the military uniform and helmet that you used when you originally did the tests. If you don't still have it, get another one by getting the voucher.
---
Yeah. Power User you can double duration of cores, but vats still eats them. I spend so little time in power armor that my focus when answering questions is always on the non-power armor side ;)
---
I don't know why this hasn't been implemented yet for power armor. I know some require being built but why not make it where it's randomly dropped.
---
They buried the repair deeper in the menus. Im on PC so you have to press space to access the bench for repairs, then Hit T then R I think. I cant remember but its one step further past the repair kits. You might have to inspect it then repair. It's annoying, and I'm not sure why they didnt keep it the way it was.
---
Ok I'll try that
---
you must kick off either the BOS or possibly the ENCLAVE quest line from the start.
---
BOS prerequisit is abby's bunker. nothing will kick in otherwise. been there, done that.
---
worked for me. If you have already - keep trying.
---
It should be worth noting that the combat and radium rifles are superior to the handmade for vats builds. The AP costs are low enough that you typically deal more damage than the handmade before running out of AP.
---
There is one to be found there in a cold dead hand.  Think about who might have such a card and where they might be (it is more obvious if you visited an airport as a passenger or worked at one).
---
And I'll upvote every time I see it. 🤣
---
Now that’s news I can use! Have an Ever Upward vote.
---
They use way too much budget for that.  Perhaps u/mpstr1nger and they'll recognize it's Reddit if they use it? Or on PSN just "msg me if needed"
---
You online? I'll help you out
---
I got locked into someone's home once. Luckily I did the help emote and they were home and got ride of the door.
---
Implying creatures aren’t already agro on you ?
---
I gave up the dailies long ago because of this, don't like being forced to use a stupid camera to get atoms.
---
I'm not a 100% sure when it happened but I'm fairly sure it happened before last week's update.
---
If you find a TSE handmade for 1k and are on PS4 I'll happily buy it from you plus the middle man fee.
---
Edit: Not being rude, I've just literally been after one for a bit now and cant find one. Several TSE guns that go for 8k+ but not what I'm wanting.
---
I’m pretty sure addictions don’t go away on their own. They used to vanish on death but I believe the last patch fixed that. Only way to remove them is addictol or the deathclaw? Radscorpion? Omelette.
---
Yup.
---
I assume that's sarcastic. That would be the worst run of luck ever.
---
Every time I have had issues building camp I exit the mode and then re-enter and that tends to resolve the glitch. 
---
    Sometimes I’ve had to server hop when I’ve had items locked up floating in mid air.  I always have issues using the sturdy iron steel frame staircase. If I ever need to move a wall or anything that’s attached to it it locks me out of that whole section of the building. So I stopped using them.
---
Does renaming the item display the name to people you're selling to? Maybe I'll try this today, see if it makes a difference.
---
Other good perks, bloody mess, tenderizer, nerd rage, serendipity. Also adrenal and twisted muscles help.
---
Deathclaw hide is obtainable, its just not obtainable from deathclaws, its only obtainable from random loot, if you view one of my recent posts from about 2 or 3 days ago, youll see a post i made about deathclaw hide
---
How do you envision that working?
---
Yeah, but its easier to do that in the Forest because the enemies are much lower level, therefore you can kill them much faster.
---
Please don't get me wrong, I do give away lots of items and have always supported lower level folks. I've actually heeded someone else's advice and dedicated one vending machine to giveaways and freebies. And usually the first person to show up after I restocked it will empty it out again, but you won't see me complaining about that.
---
What can you learn from this episode? Price the Tattered Mole Head between 100 and 200 next time, and the flippers will think twice if it's worth it, but the person who has been looking for it (but doesn't know how to google the location ;-)) will STILL be tremendously happy about the cheap price. Everybody wins.
---
I'm on Xbox friend. But I'll look out on the market and PM if i see one
---
Some things degrade into heavier things. Did you store raw flux? It degrades into inert flux at 1lb/per
---
Unlike you, I don't worship money or rich people. At this point I'm assuming you cannot conceive of any other way to think about money and that jealousy is where your gears get stuck.
---
They disapear fast even for 150caps.
---
I'm in a fairly decent location, so I'm not too worried about security. I just like them
---
&gt;&gt;**Perks**
---
&gt;&gt;- **Adrenaline:** Fixed a visual issue that could cause weapon damage to update incorrectly in the Pip-Boy.
---
&gt;&gt;- **Animal Friend:** Deathclaws, Mega Sloths, Mirelurks, and Scorchbeasts can no longer be pacified by Animal Friend.
---
&gt;&gt;- **Animal Friend:** Mutant Hounds can now be pacified by Animal Friend.
---
&gt;&gt;- **Class Freak:** Now correctly suppresses the Grounded Mutation’s negative effects.
---
&gt;&gt;- **Marathoner:** Updated the description text to indicate that Marathoner has no effect while wearing Power Armor.
---
&gt;&gt;- **Strange in Numbers:** Now behaves more consistently when players and their mutated teammates are far away from each other.
---
&gt;&gt;- **Weight Reduction Perks:** Item weight displays now refresh correctly when equipping and unequipping weight perks, like Pack Rat.
---
&gt;&gt;- **Wasteland Whisperer:** Grahm can no longer be pacified by Wasteland Whisperer.
---
&gt;&gt;- **Wasteland Whisperer:** Mega Sloths, Snallygasters, and Wendigos can no longer be pacified by Wasteland Whisperer.
---
&gt;&gt;- **Wasteland Whisperer:** Mirelurks and Mirelurk Hunters can now be pacified by Wasteland Whisperer.
---
Honestly I don't see that written anywhere, just that they changed how some of the perks work. This is either a random glitch or a change that honestly doesn't make any sense.
---
If someone drops a nuke later im down to pop rad x and get naked!
---
Yeah I've spawned in the bldg trapped a few times lol. Or at least use one of those brick wall windows we can jump out of. 😂
---
*sir its an honest mistake i accidentally broke into his house, murdered and then robbed him*
---
That must be it. I had some yellowcake flux that I couldn’t use and might have stored it.
---
I do most my fighting at the golf course all the way to robot city. I forgot the name it’s on the east end of the map
---
Yeah you’re right, definitely will think twice now about giving away stuff. Thanks for respectful messages, they are rare here under this post:)
---
Frustrating as hell to me that I hoarded all these 3 star legendaries for months waiting for the legendary vendor to come out and now it turns out you can only turn in like three a day. Ugh! I was like yay, I'll turn in all my legendaries and/or sell all my stuff and then I'll have like 180 carry weight and can have whatever perks I want! Sad trombone.
---
Yes please! Maybe a way to trade them in for something. A special kind of perk card perhaps.
---
I don't buy from other players, outside of supplies every once and a while, but as a developer you have to consider things like this as you respond to the situation
---
I don't think it's broken at all, likely just some limitation they haven't figured a way around yet. Remember, this was delayed multiple times, but I'd rather have this feature now than later. 
---
I've sold plenty, and players message me when I'm not nearby and they're interested in something. They could add a doorbell for now, and those features would work perfectly together.
---
And I have my HC and armor plated backpack already. Made this comment before I knew you didn't actually have to do the badges, so who's sorry now lol
---
I like turning all of their lights off one by one lol
---
Sometimes it is hidden under another item that spawns close by.
---
When I'm feeling out the market, I'll put up 1 to see how things go.  Unfortunately, as I'm not willing to put my camp in the middle of a road next door to a popular train station, I don't get a lot of traffic so I'm probably wasting my time :P
---
Luckily, they just have to go upstairs, off my balcony and around the front of the house.
---
Reminds me, I need to lock my Lead Processor then...
---
You just got to change the context so they understand like
---
I bought a some lettuce, it had e coli, I died but at least I wasn't hungry.
---
In other words having fun doesn't make you able to get away with a bugging mess of a trash heap, lvl 203 and still play but damn the constant crashes at SBQs and even worse spending 2k caps to crash at Impostor sheepsquash.
---
Reddit I'm ready to be smashed by negative karma by fanboys now.
---
Seriously, lmfao...
---
Yes, the locations are fixed, but it's spawn is random and sometimes require server hopping.
---
If they take more than 5 minutes. I just log off. I do check my camp before I leave on the map,but if your on the way. Sorry time to close for the day.
---
That sounds good man. But I just want them outta my way. :)
---
But that's why some people build on cliffs.
---
I have a 350 damage super sledge, I can kill the sheepsquatch easily, but they kill the brahmin in so few hits. It's probably because I'm trying to solo the Mire one.
---
What I understand is that 50cal is extremely suitable for prime receivers but makes other weapons less suitable, such as a shotgun. Thank you.
---
 Do events, some are very good others alright. Grind the highest level mobs you can find.
---
 That's why Nuke events at The Whitespring are so popular, Legendaries for sure but XP can be huge when you put down a horde of ghouls.
---
 Harper's Ferry underground is good practice. ;)
---
I spent a lot of time in PA because melee build and emergency protocols. But once I got a bloodied deathclaw gauntlet to drop I completely switched up my playstyle. Actually got me super excited about the game again.
---
Laser and plasma are actually not bad anymore. I got a bloody/ffr as a drop a few weeks ago on my heavy build and I love it.
---
Can't you read? It's been *a long time* since you could call this game "shit in a box", even longer since it cost $60. You clearly have no idea what this game is like now, or else you'd have a better comment than "but I can play with sticks!"😂😘
---
I sent a guy a message the first day to find out what the other 2 stars were on a gauss rifle he was selling. Glad i did because nobody wants bash damage
---
&gt; For example look at all the cooking recipes!
---
For real. I'd be a lot more inclined to make the "fancy" recipes if they were actually worth a damn. Why use 2 bloatfly meat, 2 glowing fungus, and 2 salt to make bloatfly loaf for 60hp and +3 rad resist when I could simply cook the 2 baked bloatfly and consume them for 50hp?
---
The only one that seems like it be worth the effort is the scorchbeast stew, but good fucking luck collecting all the different SB organs before some of them start to spoil.
---
What if I'm a slave trader?!
---
Why would I downvote you? I wasn't saying it was super hard, I was asking how better to keep the brahmin alive.
---
I agree the laser painter would be ideal.
---
I'm with you. I picked it back up for the latest updates, and there was some genuinely good stuff there, but the manufactured tedium stopped me from sticking with it for long after I finished the pioneer scouts stuff.
---
hm ok I do have a crapton of crops from when I was farming Biv's alcohol recipes. Yeah those have zero sentimental value for me, I'll get rid of them. Well, most of them anyway, I still need spare adhesive now and again.
---
 Don't forget Glowing Steak for 10% melee. ;)
---
Wow, a gamestop employee waving away a sale? Sounds fake, tbh
---
Sometimes there's a server disconnect and there's really nothing we can do about that. I however do check my camp or at least return to my camp before I sign out.
---
Equip and unequip demolition expert. If the damage changes its explosive
---
Sleep until well rested before every outing.
---
Get a friend to play with you and get the Inspirational perk card in Charisma. 
---
Make sure you get a shot into every enemy when play with a group. Even one. Machine guns and Tesla riles are good for this.
---
Kill lots of big things like high level super mutants. 
---
Do every event on the map. 
---
Cook constantly. (You can pick up dirty water very quickly from a river rather than using the hand pump and there's plenty of wood south of Vault 76 on the way to and in the lumbar yard.)
---
Thank you very much
---
Love your system and it looks good. Thanks for the info.
---
I have a ton of junk weapons I was saving for the legendary vendor when I heard it was coming. I’m at 219 and that was mostly low level one stars that I got rid of for room in my stash. It’s not really that hard.
---
They aren't and will ignore you to attack someone else if they want I personally had to chase down deathclaws trying to kill my friends several times
---
Haven't run into it myself, and all my ammo goes for 1c.
---
Yeah it sucks that the person(s) are random spawned. I know online someone posted all the locations where the person spawns. I found my person in Watoga a while back. 
---
The best thing to do is to, if you find the person tell your friend to join your game so that you both can get the quest. I did this with my brother and it helped tons. 
---
Good luck on finding them! I know it's a pain. :(
---
Owen! He was from the adaptive controller commercial for Xbox! This kids resolve and upbeat attitude is just infectious. He’s such a good kid and i hope he does great things.
---
Tighten them up?
---
Not likely, this feature has been delayed multiple times, I think it was originally supposed to come out in April? I'd much rather this feature be in game now and a fix in the future, it truly sucks if I could have been selling everything else for months..
---
I'll take it like it is and be glad, players message me when they need me anyways, someone added me last night so they could jump on an alt and buy my serum. It isn't hard.
---
Yeah, scorchbeast drops are regular disappointing, it would be nice if they had a bunch of hardened mass, glowing mass and HRF outside of a nukezone.
---
Sure thing gobhoblin47
---
I definitely think there will be some *small* Easter eggs relating their current franchises together...
---
But this is just **crazy**.
---
There have been undecayed bodies since day one...
---
I remember those days. "Lol look it's oblivion with guns" "super mutants are just reskinned orcs wtf" "yeah game is just about big explosions and body parts its not an actual fallout game"
---
Lol i just made a new character and didnt realize they redid the morgantown airport so i ended up lost for a bit inside it trying to get upstairs
---
Hey thank you what events would you say are the good ones
---
Not a dealer but I think I have 10 yellow and 10 florescent to sell if that's any use to you.
---
I too have noticed some wierdness.
---
Hm maybe you still get the 90% but the +caps popup on the screen shows the wrong value.
---
As yourself how much you use. More than two of each plants' worth? Scrap whatever you're not regularly using. If you suddenly need more, there are farms all over the map with tons of whatever you might want. A few caps to fast travel and bam. 100 razorgrain right next to a stream where you can spam all the dirty water you can carry, and you've got what you need for a few dozen bottles of beer.
---
I know I had over 1800 rounds of 5.56 and when I checked my vending machine they were gone and I got very little caps out of it. I did see the sale come up on my screen any amount was way off.
---
Get a Tesla rifle and shoot it as fast as you can.
---
What I have done to learn the mods, every visit to the enclave I buy a cheap gauss (350-400c) and scrap it and now have all mods unlocked. I don't believe I've seen any mods for sale other than the scopes, could be they added some with patch 9.
---
edit: Just checked my stash and I do have a few mods, barrels, receivers, stocks so I guess they did add them, don't know where I got them but they are out there. They are a one time use unlike learned craftable mods
---
No. There isn't a good way. 
---
You could compare the mods you know to a reference, such as from the thread I'll link here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ag37qe/fallout\_76\_all\_plans\_recipes\_weapons\_weapon\_mods/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ag37qe/fallout_76_all_plans_recipes_weapons_weapon_mods/)
---
I used to do this but I've had too many people demanding more items. "Give me stimpacks" wasn't all that unusual.
---
I did this the other day to someone and they were nice enough to come. Turns out none of his 40 some 3stars we're what I was looking for. But I asked him if he'd cut me a deal on his 9.5k .308 ammo and bought it all for 6.5k so he didn't waste his time.
---
Take off gunsmith, and go around bashing enemies, youll bring down that durability without needing ammo
---
I see this year after year in call of duty. People shit on ww2 when it came out and kept on glorifying bo4, now everybody is leaving bo4 to play ww2 again. Its subreddit is blowing up recently. IW was received horrendously on launch, now I'm hearing from the zombies community that IW zombies was some of the best in the series
---
Hey would this work with just inviting people in the server I join to join my team. my friends don't want to get this game because they are sheep.
---
&gt; bloggers
---
*BOI*
---
Same here, but there are no nasty surprises for my visitors upon despawn, anyway. Also, don't crouch while shopping.
---
It’s rather limited purpose though and not general utility.  You could say Troubleshooters for silo runs but these are mostly one trick ponies.
---
I think we need a sorry button for any reason you might need it as well as a laugh emote too. There have plenty of times where I could've used both in the same situation. So I'm for this!
---
 The Enclave events are pretty easy. 
---
 Avoid heart of The Swamp its not worth the reward when the Mirelurk Queen shows up. She would be OK by herself but she is just the end of much trash. 
---
 Any Grafton Event is cake. ;)
---
it’s 20%.
---
I love helping new players! It's more rewarding than completing quests.
---
I would also love that as my new C.A.M.P is built next to a ship
---

You can't message people on PC though.
---
You dont like scrolling past 3 woodchuckers?
---
New duping method out right now.  Cap based, doesn't crash the server, won't create too many items at once.  It requires 3-4 players to make it feasible though.  They are offering them at insanely low prices and won't have more than 3-4 in their machines or inventory at a time.  They change the mods so it alters the descriptive adjectives in the title, but Legendary effects are the same of course.  Saw a lot of this going on this weekend.
---
When you have 4 separate Rad Resistance cards... NO! I'm a Bloodied build FFS!
---
I made a spotify station that's a mix of speak easy music, a few songs from fo76 and fo4 and some blue grass because it is appalachia afterall.  Beware 'friendly' locals when you hear banjo music in survival.
---
Nope. Get used to mystery cause very little info is just given to you for free. 
---
You should just find a list of mods on the web and track it manually.
---
Nice, thank you :)
---
Deaf People? Mute People? Throat Cancer? I'm sure there is other things Im' not thinking of that cause loss of voice. Social Anxiety? People who don't have a Mic? People who can't afford a Mic? People who have mics but are broken and are looking to or waiting for them to be replaced?Having only one form of reliable communication in your game, with a limited emote system is poor planning or they don't believe that the categories I described are a big enough portion of their user base to be concerned with.
---
I use the text chat mod and I've become a lot more social and active with the in game community. I attempt to rally people to events, I trade more, provide help to those with questions or concerns, help those out having trouble completeing in game challenges and has made the game much more enjoyable for myself.
---
I would also recommend checking out Mark Brown on Youtube and his Game Makers Toolkit series, and more specifically the episodes talking about designing games for people with disabilities, super interesting.
---
thank you, i did read further in that post and i see you in a very different time zone as i am  (im in north america)
---
ill try to look for you when i am online and maybe we can connect if we get lucky!
---
thank you
---
You are going to get trash items from the purveyor. Be prepared to scrap items you just bought from her.
---
If you team up with the person you're taking the photo with and both run rad sponge you can do it. Or without rad sponge you can take turns to just edge into the rad zone then run out. It's easier on console where you can text chat.
---
Finding Grahm is gonna be an absolute pain.
---
&gt; Or move to the lowbie zone, since they'll feel more comfortable being in their zone, and can afford that price.
---
Camp location is an excellent point that's being overlooked in all this. When player vending came out I was camped on the ridge SE of Whitesprings (close to Solomon's Pond), and I almost never sold chems because almost everyone that visited my camp was level 40+ and had plenty of their own. I recently relocated to the hillside SE of vault 76, and now they're selling faster than I can restock them.
---
Ah I see what you mean now
---
Weren't the originals also rated M? In fallout 1, you can potentially see a prostitute taken hostage and having her head blown off (or rather arm, based on the sprites in that game). In fallout 2 you can become a porn star, kill children with a minigun, commit genocide, lead a mentally unstable person into blowing himself up, and become a slaver
---
Usually asking on area chat that you’re there for scrapping gets them to whip out a low-damage tesla tagging rifle to help others loot share.  
---
Bringing a team helps out the chances of beating them to the punch for a hit, though.  
---
If someone’s being a d-bag and won’t listen, just wreck all the starred enemies that come out for yourself, if you’re able. Fug em!
---
I think the challenges are trying to push people towards certain in game behaviors, or getting players out of their comfort zone/rut to try new things they might like if they only try them.
---
It's a good game design philosophy that everyone hates.
---
I bet it's really salty around there! 😁
---
That's good to hear I may have to reinstall and try it out again
---
OMG YES YES AMAZING YES
---
Many thanks
---
Hahahahaha
---
oh no that's awkward. i have to say this is the first instance where they knew it was me doing it/could interact with me. all previous acts of kindness were anonymous to them.
---
i do try to help with chems and stuff in my vending machine, i always have 10 radaway/rad-x/stims available. i had to make them 1 cap each because i first put like 50 in there for free and one player took them all. :/ 
---
sorry you had a bad experience with it, if you choose to do your own thing, it's totally understandable.
---
Connect a switch to your vending machines and turn them off before you log off.
---
Now, I'm not saying everyone should do this, but I have it as a convenience option for myself really. I don't want to log off and interrupt a potential sale.
---
Here's a prediction: the designed gameplay mechanics are going to be even more fiddly and less interesting. Lots of +1 / -1 stuff that renders decisions about as interesting as choosing between 3 shades of beige.
---
Just pick all their doors and leave them all open. Have your friend take the bounty.
---
That definitly a good idea!
---
The same.
---
Shite
---
That's good
---
I want some of what OP is smoking
---
While we're asking for C.A.M.P. improvements, let us place "junk" objects in the world, *sans* paper bag! I want my teddy collection on my bed, and to set out that dorky cottage teapot!
---
Rarely pops up because when it does, people potato out.  Either no sacrifices themselves or if they do no one fucking shoots the sheep wannabe (Also bastards just steal your goodies in your bag)
---
Anti-armor pierces ballistic damage reduction. It doesn't change an enemy's energy resistance, so it's a terrible legendary effect for energy weapons.
---
If you honestly think it's a trash heap, stop playing. If you're still playing, figure out if it's possibly you. What platform are you on? I came back and was having freezing issues, turned out deleting my game save fixed all my issues..
---
Haven't had a single server crash in over a week, two long sessions started performing badly and it shortly popped up with a server restarting message, which I imagine solved most issues. Kicked from server once, but like in the past, turns out server didn't crash, my friends were still in game.
---
Supposedly there's a dupe out again that crashes servers, I think that's far more likely to be the cause, or maybe something else.. but my experience has been pretty solid since coming back.
---
If u go place u so protectron tiny figures
---
I found one at Kelly monument and Philippi Cemetery
---
It appears they fixed it, my quest is reactivated
---
The Cooking is mostly for satisfying the hunger, with a few exceptions that gives great bonuses. Because food bonuses stacks it would be OP if not kept low. But I would really like a freezer for food that takes some effort to cook up. Often it spoils before a opportunity arises where I could benefit the bonus so it's not worth the effort. With freezers food could also become trade items.
---
As McPigery said, server hopping is the only way.  If two of you are both looking for it, I'd search separately, and if one of you finds it, invite the other to that sever, that's doubling your odds.
---
Also, for fastest results (I think), go to the Whitespring Hotel entrance, and look for the corpse on the hood of the red car.  It's *right* at the spawn point, so you can maximize your searching.
---
Try serving hopping and just going between the civil war battlefield and colonel Kelly statue each time before you leave, I did it last night and it ended up working for me
---
Interesting. I had to work this weekend, so hadn't had a chance to read anything.
---
Power armor build.
---
It was worse in December and January. People literally giving away TSE's.
---
Is there a reason to lock a door as it is now? I guess to protected costly repairs on certain items?
---
You post is misleading and your conclusions worthless.
---
Deathmatch is not Battle Royal assuming it is part of NW content.
---
Nuclear Winter will include PVE content (i.e. vaults).
---
Concluding that will kill a game makes you one more naysayer reaching bogus a conclusion.
---
Hahahah i spent a long time thinking up that name, I want people to chuckle when they come to my base.  Last base was named Camp Buttdick
---
I just tried to find the vendor and got the Pied Piper instead.  Never seen that one.
---
It's pretty terrible. After spending a few hundred caps bouncing around looking for him, I gave up and just server hopped at the water park until he spawned. Best way I found to cycle quickly, because nobody is ever there and the spawn is right next to the fast travel location.
---
I offer every new player I find some free stuff, including some complimentary Vintage Nukashine.
---
I don’t know if it affects perk card packs or not, but I did notice the other night that when choosing a new perk, it won’t show you perks that you already have which only have one level (the various hacker and pick lock perks, good doggy, etc.).
---
I already own one because I server hopped for hours once the update came out but for all these new player that come and wanna get one the tourist aren’t where where they should be like with the bucket list quest I remember after a few hours of the release articles were saying the location yet I go to them and  the damn tourist isn’t there like okay we server hope again i wish bethesda would at least let us sell the broken ones we find so new players or players that have lost theirs have a chance to get it because I would sell all my prosnap for free if possible
---
Bethesda is gonna see this post and sell it for 600 atoms now.
---
Yeah I was hoping to hold a copy to learn it before they fix it
---
My prediction - it will use an evolution of the same game engine, and Bethesda will still be relying on the mod community to fix bugs that have been there since Fallout 4 if not earlier.
---
I carve enough pumpkins with my Bowie Knife stabbing enemies IN THE FACE!  \\ O.o /\`
---
Thought it was the sacrificial blade mod for the machete, adds bleeding and poison damage. Didn’t know if one for the cultist blade exists but I’d like to get my hands on it if it does as I have a nice instigating cultist blade.
---
Which is unfortunate, someone else suggested using letters to spell out your username here, like u/wheeldog
---
It's something until they can fix it. I'd still rather have the feature and make some sales than not at all. I tend to check to see if anyone is at my camp every 15 minutes or when I'm between doing stuff.
---
The S'mores recipe for this latest update really takes the cake tbh. It has something like 15 core ingredients to ultimately become one item
---
The death penalty is a bad joke. There is nothing that actually causes fear of dying in the current system. We should fear death.
---
Ya, wish they would drop the cost on it. I like running it but it's awful spendy.
---
I think they ment, they only did 1 possum challenge and did event the rest
---
And its a pita on ps4.
---
Thanks I’ll check the place with my friends to see if it’s there thanks for the tip
---
Yeah bad design is the player's fault as usual
---
Isn’t that a skit from a comedian? I can’t remember his name, but I think the skit was called “The Salt &amp; Spoon diner.”
---
Or give us the ability to **hide** perk cards at the very least.
---
What do you do 90% of the time ?  Farm legendaries why farm them when you can get a duped one for 4k caps. After you complete quests there’s no reason to play this game except farm legendaries or tweak your build. 
---
I love this game the environment is perfect and tweaking characters is fun and yes I overstated by saying none, but today there is 90% less content in the game than 4 days ago and that’s just the truth
---
John Mulaney.
---
Unarmed, plus 3 one handed gladiator, plus incer, meat hooks are pretty op
---
Unarmed is generally more damaging to begin with, plus it has its very own mutation  (Talons), so I think it evens out.
---
I wouldn't even want Expert/Master Iron Fist.  I consider that a distinguishing factor in favor of Unarmed, that you can spend 3 SPECIAL points and have your damage maxed out for Unarmed-specific weapons.
---
Doesn’t even work anymore. Sacrificial mod used to give the 4th star and when I attached it yesterday it didn’t add it.
---
Well there’s hope then
---
It depends on if there are roofs or not to crouch on for me. WS I'm in hazmat, queen I'm in PA
---
Yeah I'm just gonna grind it out. Shouldn't take too long. Just persistence.
---
Well all they have to do is hover over my camp icon to see my name... I figure if someone wants something bad enough they will find me on the map
---
I like the sniper rifle over the lever because of that. The penetrating mag is 40% aa. A b sniper is a lot of fun to play if you're looking to one shot.

I think people only see the damage is higher on the lever, and even the dragon (but at least the dragon has ridiculous numbers to make up for it). The handmade is a lot of fun and has the tuned receiver if you want to shoot as fast as you want semi auto. It's not a one hit weapon but neither is the lever, it has a lot more ammo and built in aa.
---
I own one from when the cameras were released I server hopped for hours that day it just for my friend we’re going off the list that I found online but I’m not a very high character but I will check white springs so thanks for the tip
---
Unarmed is the most powerful of all of the melee classes. You’re doing just fine. Talons is your Unarmed perk. Take a nuka-shine and be happy with where you are
---
Wait... how do you run Carnivore AND Herbivore? Cuz I don't know if that would enable you to eat both, neither or cancel each other out to no effect.
---
&gt;"Take a Camera Picture of a Player in a Nuked Region while you're both Naked"? 
---
Time for some Children of Atom roleplay! No, honestly, this might be fun to try out if a friend with  a headset happens to be up for it, but otherwise I won't bother, as so often with these dailies recently.
---
I have already mentally written off 20 unobtainable atoms per day, so I've kinda just accepted that Bethesda has gotten stingier with free handouts. :-(
---
I'm always happy whenever I can match up conditions for getting the &lt;Level up while...&gt; with a single level-up, but even that might be too much of a chore for just 10 more atoms.
---
I also never really stealth in a team because there is usually so much going on. And I just wear all heavy leather and some no fall damage stuff.
---
I’m using knuckles and one handed dosent work with it
---
I dont see how it is expensive. All the materials you need are free throughout the world. I'm sitting on 9k ultracite .50 with 90 violet to spare, 9k ultracite .308 with 60 fluorescent to spare, and ultracite plasma cores are the easiest to craft.  If you can jack up your int you can get about 350 shots in one U plasma core.
---
Stealth imo doesn't work well in nuke zones. I stealth sniper main but have a few melee perks to help out on the queen.
---
Cranberry cooked items (there's a few) and I believe well rested give experience boosts. Grind wherever there's supermutants, ghouls, or if you have a nice build scorched beast. I go to cran bog with my vampire gatling and computer targeting missile launcher and take them out relatively fast. Killed 6 of them in 15 minutes and was leveling ok, but only did that because my grinding locations were all cleared out
---
haha classic!
---
Regardless of how you spin it, there are objectively broken features in the update, yet again. 
---
3 (4?) of the badges
---
Vendor item inspection
---
Swimming ghouls at whitespring 
---
Etc.
---
Willingness to play through it is irrelevant to the fact each update breaks something different. 
---
I do agree though, I'd rather have vending now and just ignore anything that I'd need to inspect. My original comment was jokingly antagonistic: actually  expecting fully working games or patches from Bethesda would be an exercise in futility (and if they did try to delay patches to bug fix we'd likely still be where the game was in November).
---
*hiss*
---
Yea I guess it only works on meathooks
---
I heard that Iron Fist has a secret bonus stagger effect so maybe its better than one of the 1h or 2h cards.
---
Also there is a dedicated mutation for unarmed, Talons. I would suggest getting that along with other good mutations.
---
Indeed. I think that it only really fits in Fallout 76 though, just has that kind of vibe to it, ya know?
---
How much you need and at what price you looking to pay?
---
I took a pic of a dead cricket on xbox and worked fine.  I've had other pics not register and then if I did again in a new session worked fine.
---
I did the same thing, took 3 attempts but found the dead woman at the civil war cemetery.
---
Definitely makes up for the bugs I've encountered this far. Def enjoying it!
---
Ah ok,from North America to,during the week it's not going to be posible cause I work and I'm only online 2/3 hours per day.
---
But in the weekend I'm conected more hours,so if you find it buy it,if U don't find it and you don't mind to wait until the weekend  I'll have it for U.
---
Thanks and I'll see you in Appalachia
---
Does a stalker's melee hit through walls? Wondering, never tried.
---
The cameras have also now been placed in world containers and on enemies. I found 4 cameras yesterday and none of them were on tourist. Most of them came out of tool boxes. Give it a shot!
---
I have yet to find a tourist with a camera to this day.
---
Interested too
---
Forgot about that, so technically I have every one except for herbivore and empath. My bad.
---
Yeah I know. Too crazy too crazy to be true, but I wanted to get my prediction out there before someone else.
---
I was in my stash last night when a player bought 60 rounds I had of fusion cells and it popped they bought them and I got +6 caps to my inventory. I logged out and back in. Same cap total. I have all my characters sell them the ammo they don't use so it's the primary item in my machines, probably sold close to 6k to 8k over the last week and just noticed yesterday so I don't know if it started Tuesday, Thursday, or Friday.
---
I love unarmed, so much fun slicing and dicing  with deathclaw handsm
---
I swear you can currently do that
---
As someone who tries to regularly keep stable flux in my vendor inventory, I thank you.
---
I will be Clayface and roleplay as someone who didn't find this post hilarious
---
Had the same problem with foxes yesterday. But today it worked with the first try.
---
So far that's the only part of the Chemist that is glitched.
---
I believe I saw it on one of the vendors in whitesprings last night - pretty sure it was the protectron next to the mr handy in the hunting shop but i'm not 100% sure
---
Don't worry that's why we're getting a team death match or battle royal mode soon.  This will be the fallout you know and love soon enough.......  Jokes aside fallout always been a little quirky I just hope we can get some serious lore soon and some meaningful quests.  The scouts was a joke imo and this game could use something in the sense of world bosses.  Sooner rather than later.
---
On PS4 buddy.  This is day 2 and still disconnected from server.
---
Yeeeeees
---
I started jumping between several locations but didnt like the cap costs.
---
I just server hopped at the water park to finally get mine, but it still took close to an hour.
---
I'm just vaping some Phsycobuff. It's good for what ails you.
---
They appear pinned on your map, not on the player HUD.  Also when pinned to the map, details aren't displayed, just the top level category.  You do get notifications when you complete one of the challenge items but no details about which one.  You still have to drill down under challenges to see the specific details of each line item.
---
I don't know if it's still the case, but I had heard at one point that a player in Power Armor counts as "naked" for that challenge.
---
Don't smoke the kanawha kush period lmao. Our catfish have levels of chemicals that aren't safe to eat. The Mercury level in the kanawha river is frightening
---
I hit 1000 scrip this morning. (Well, actually passed it, because I was in a stash-clearing frenzy and didn't notice the warnings while the vendor was still showing script to hand out) I've got a full set of 3\* armor currently plus another five pieces sitting in stash and a bunch of one to three star weapons and armor; tomorrow I'm going to buy 5 3\* armor pieces and see if any are worth subbing in for my current equipment, leaving me with 500 scrip. Then I'll sell back whatever 5 I didn't keep (new or used) for 24 scrip apiece (so 120 scrip back toward the daily 150) as well as other random legendaries still cluttering my stash. Then I'll repeat the process - 500 in, 150 out. That'll leave me with 300. So three more pieces, 72 back plus whatever else I can sell up to 150, etc.
---
Honestly don't know what my endgame is in all this. I suspect once I have a "matched" set - all combat, all marines, something I'll shift to weapons. Ranged first, then melee.
---
True. But for the smores you need 2 razor grain flours each and that's 8 razor grain so what total of 24?    Need 3 to consume
---
I have seen it spawn at R&amp;G train station on occasion.
---
Yeah there are plenty of similar bodies at the morgantown airport.
---
Feel free to add me.
---
Psn:Panmand
---
Well, i got only one upgrade, the High Capacity one.
---
Pro:
---
Increase from 60 to 120
---
Con:
---
Decrease Energy and Rad Resistance.
---
That sounds impossible!
---
He spawns at the sunshine meadows workshop after you do the defense twice I think
---
Honestly I dont know.  I finished that a while back.  Been playing since release.  I would say if you see a cheap one at a vendor, try it?
---
As long as they let us dupe planets, all is going to be well. ;-)
---
Or just... Don't shoot people...
---
Hold up.......I mean hold up.
---
I run deathclaw gauntlet, allot. 
---
I also like powerfist and mole miner gauntlet but have crap rolls currently. 
---
When I use my deathclaw gauntlet I use the 3 1 handed melee perks.
---
ARE WE SAYING THEY DON'T WORK FOR MY GAUNTLET?
---
Also duping is done currently with vendor duplication glitch that was patched prior. Secondly bad reply to tell me to stop playing because I think its bad, literally every smoker or drinker knows its bad to do those habits but they do it anyways, humans don't always do whats logical and at the end of the day Im a fallout/skyrim fanboy who still plays Blades and Fallout 76 because I love fallout series and skyrim series despite literally every bug from fallout 4 being copied over to fallout 76 on day 1. And doubt its me when my entire team gets kicked sometimes while we farm 3 SBQs in a row and it around 20 runs per weekend, got Xbox X and 30 Mbps internet service and party stays connected to teamates the whole time and only game crashes or we all get kicked.
---
I’ve never seen anyone from Beth really address the issues that have fallen apon melee connection. This would be awesome, but a long shot.
---
I still help ppl but as much as I used to
---
They should definitely at least give us a plan for decoration item.
---
I get that every time someone buys ammo. They'll buy 500 and I get like 45 caps. I dont really mind since I'm a melee build but it's kinda dumb
---
Our group does things like this regularly. One of our players likes to dress in a postal outfit and deliver plans to random people in flatwoods. So don't run from the post woman.
---
Then go play with sticks man. Why make a pointless comment
---
Really not sure why we dont have camp fast travel mats yet, considering they work for workshops
---
I'm pretty sure he just wanders the map in a certain path so I'd have to figure out what his specific path is and then walk around the entire map until I find him and then follow him until he's walked into a workshop, it's insane
---
Does it make the backpack look different or is it just a stat boost?
---
You seem nice.
---
I use knuckles and if you inspect your weapon before and after it does not change the damage on the knuckles. Maybe the same for deathclaw tho
---
no thats wrong if you look at the description under the gun 3d display it says bullets explode I own a multiple tse and they all do that
---
I don't believe there's a way to completely eliminate duping, you can only hope to contain it by limiting the occurrences and reducing the number of duped items in the game. I have a few ideas, all of which will likely be seen as controversial or extreme--I would expect to compromise on any of them--but hear the concepts out. 
---
**1.** **Set Traps to Instill Fear**
---
Implement specific, limited time, exploitable scenarios designed to catch dupers in the act. Monitor for the activity and if it’s repeated by the same players more than “X” number of times, wipe their inventories instantly. 
---
No emails, no warnings, no coddling. Every item, all caps, scrip, badges etc. Your character and CAMP still exist, but have nothing. Word will travel quickly and people *will* stop doing it. Once this happens frequently, and with each new trap, players will become wary and take fewer risks to find exploits in the first place.  
---
It's a nuclear option. You hope it never happens, but it's a serious deterrent.
---
**2. Leveled Stash Capacity**
---
Make storing duped items as difficult as possible. Start off with a 200 lb. stash capacity (just a number, any substantial reduction for early levels could be effective) and increase incrementally with each level up to the max capacity. This should be countered with an increase to the max stash capacity, earned by leveling up. There’s no point in duping hundreds or thousands of items it there’s no place to easily put them. 
---
**3. Reduced Max Carry Weight**
---
Currently, you can hold 1500 lbs. over your max carry weight, which is insane. It’s almost two full stashes. There’s no legitimate gameplay reason to allow that beyond an apparent fear of upsetting hoarders. Unfortunately, that also makes it easy for dupers to dump their ill-gotten goods on level 2, fresh faced and soon to be over-encumbered mules. 
---
Max carry weight should be 50% over capacity, reduced to two tiers:
---
Up to 25% over carry weight you use AP to run and cannot sprint or fast travel. (As it is now)
---
25 to 50% over carry weight increases hunger and thirst by 100%—basically, let go of some stuff or get to a Stash box quickly, you’re gonna die. If you want a mule to live in that range you can, but it's gonna take some work. 
---
To put that in perspective, a character with 300 lbs. of carry capacity would have a soft max of 375 and a hard max of 450. A Power Armor, high strength, calibrated shocks character with a 450 capacity would have a soft max of 562.5 and a hard max of 675. 
---
Those numbers—for both Stash and character weight—might sound like a massive, unreasonable reduction, but I don’t believe so. Outside of a handful of  fringe situations, anyone actively playing the game and leveling their character operates within those parameters already. It may require the occasional extra trip to a stash box, but I don't think it would make much of an impact for day to day gameplay.
---
I know that there are lots of players with mule characters that store only legitimate items, and yes, this would make that difficult. I don't have an answer to that problem. *I* don't perceive it as a huge issue, especially with legendary item scrapping, but I recognize that may just be my perspective. Any ideas to balance it would be constructive. 
---
Changes to weight strategy should be publicized early, with multiple messages on the home screen, giving players ample time to accommodate. The entrapment concept should be announced, but with few, if any details. Just give a fair warning.
---
I just told you, he spawns at that workshop after 1 or 2 defenses completed, its how I used to find him
---
I've tamed a deathclaw since the last patch, I just had to have a level 3 Wasteland whisperer perk card. So it's still possible to tame them.
---
oh ok that gives me hope! thank you for your reply
---
Curious about the refrigerator mod
---
I tame animals. I collect outfits. I learn plans and recipes. I hone my strategies. I interact with other players. I work on making my CAMP more aesthetically pleasant. 
---
Complete the quests? You have all the Pioneer Scout badges already? And you've completed all the challenges?
---
We all play the game for different reasons, but yours strike me as the most joyless and uninspiring possible. I guess that's why I'm enjoying myself with it and you're demanding it change.
---
No, they look exactly the same, im using the skin available on Atom store
---
Electrician is 60 ticks (be conduit for all 3 and that's 3 times as fast). It's easy if you aren't the level 30's that think they can tank the impostor...
---
Kinda like the camera tourists. Hmmm...
---
Not
---
Here is my prediction:  Starfield will pull a RDR and have both a single player and multi-player mode. 76 was used to expand the engine and gain real life data on mechanics and human behavior to tune the multi-player aspect while also making money.  
---
Multi-player is very popular now, and not just because the suits want to push "live services" &lt;/jimsterling&gt;.  A significant portion of players find social aspects of gaming the most engaging.
---
sounds good, thank you, ill try and find you this weekend!  ill send friend request after work today
---
Nope!
---
What’s the name of the playlist?
---
The word cool doesn’t exist to me, I use EPIC
---
Ballistic defense is awesome! I think it’s the best one, +90DR +30 weight
---
You dont understand.  It will ALWAYS say bullets explode for area damage above the weapon info box if it is explosive no matter how many stars it has or what the prefix is.  Even if they are not at their camp it will still say the first star and right below that but above the box it will say "Bullets explode for area damage".  You will never have to guess.
---
I've never seen anybody mention a reliable way to spawn him in before, I'd be shocked if this were true
---
My only issue with player vending is that it has made the robot vendors completely unnecessary.
---
For the first few days of player vending, I would check to see if they had anything good, but they don't anymore.
---
Legendary items are now the sole domain of player vending.
---
While this can be good because the prices are better for the most part, it's limited the selection.
---
Instead of people selling them off to vendors, which we could grab even when the player left the server, now we can only get these things from other players while they are online.
---
It has limited our available pool of *purchased* legendaries.
---
Don't get me wrong, I like getting serums for 300c.  But I would like to see some sort of auction house/offline player store to take the market availability where it was prior to vending.
---
You might right.
---
I was able to get the bones with the battered fedora.
---
Had mine at 2k, no dice.  Lowered it to 500 yesterday, we'll see.  Good Luck
---
All I want is to have that music playing when people enter my store
---
ok thank you ill try again after work
---
i did restart my ps4 a few times and that didnt work, maybe today it will work!
---
I think it’s meaning something like “Bruh, come on...”. You’re showing your age with “bloggers”. Nobody in any significant numbers blogs about video games. Or anything anymore, really. They vlog.
---
Glad you are having fun. My husband and I do also. Wondering what kind of time your wife is having since she wasn’t mentioned.
---

---
Lmao ok man, I literally just told you how, but I guess its easier to complain lol
---
Thank you I'll be sure to do that I'm running a malee home brew kind of build I guess so for scorched beasts I'd need someone else who can do some damage with a gun but thank you so much I'll be sure to craft cranberry cooked stuff :)
---
I don't start it anymore because I keep on getting disconnected in the middle of it haha
---
SBQs are another matter; silo runs and nuke zones are great for mats :D
---
I did see one and buy and read it, but I didn't see anywhere that shows my progress towards the trophy, so I don't know if it counted, or how far I am towards it, or if I have in fact read enough, but the trophy is bugged. It's one of like two trophies I have left, because I never went out of my way looking for them, just assumed it would be one of those get it eventually just by playing deals.
---
Middle Mountain cabins, the middle cabin has a crossbow leaning up against the wall inside that's between 50% and 80% repair. Grab it, repair it, server hop, repeat as necessary.
---
I've taken to farming them and selling them unrepaired in my vending machines, along with stuff like chef's hats and swimwear. They sell like hotcakes.
---
It’s a bug. I’m sure it’s been reported about a trillion times now. 🤷‍♀️
---
‘Tis bs for sure. They will probably need to add ammo bulking to fix it. Let’s hope that happens.
---
I noticed that. I also noticed it lies when you are selecting perk cards. It may say you have 1, or 2, when you actually have a max set PLUS that 1 or 2 point card. Bastards.
---
Post-apacalyptic memes.
---
The easiest is of course white springs.  Molotov cocktails, throw them at a group so you get a hit on each enemy and someone else or the bots can finish them off.  Just don't set the bots on fire.  They don't like that.
---
everybody is backpacking up
---
Yeah, it's not like it's hard to get purified water.
---
Why add in a more complicated way?
---
They are probably focusing on duper bitches first, but a few of those challenges are bugged
---
In the meantime, I use the universally understood gesture of taking off all my clothing, marsupial jump to the roof, then rapidly crouching and un crouching.
---
Depends on how many people are there but Whitesprings works. Just go in a pattern and you should be able to kill dozens of higher level ghouls, and they should respawn relatively quickly. Also if a nuke is there even better. You should get a few legendarys too for your trouble.
---
Same for me, PC with Nvidia GPU/drivers. I'm thinking there is some settings file that is responsible for the dashes appearing in the interface, but who knows. Hopefully Bethesda will address it eventually. Until then, we are the Brotherhood of Dashes. It's not the worst bug...not as annoying as taking photos of critters and not getting credit so I can advance my Order of the Tadpole Mammalogist challenge...
---
I don't want to deal with someone dinging because they want to annoy me
---
You are the luckiest person in the whole Fallout universe.  Just sayin'.
---
I really don't know why they are going so hard on the camera, I can't stand it.  Give me new quests  / monsters / areas / useful items.  I don't want to walk around taking pictures of the shitty graphics they never seem to really update from game to game.  I'm still not seeing the "16x the detail" anywhere I go...
---
I interpreted this as Deathclaws, Mega Sloths, etc could no longer be pacified. If they could, I would have expected the patch notes to say something like “Deathclaws now require Wasteland Whisperer to be pacified”.  I’m sure the correction in some animal classifications with this patch also played a part in this.
---
You can put your username &amp; password in the custom.ini
---
In plain text. In an unsecured location.
---
I don't recommend this. But it will work.
---
Frankly, it's a username &amp; password...its a minor annoyance. I did lol at the screen shot though, sadly fitting for this game at times.
---
Never knew that! Good job mine is mostly junk😅
---
Its from a previous patch, it was done to stop certain duping methods. Apparently its back. Just us one of the other terminals.
---
Archer was really easy. Bash with the crossbow. Athlete was pretty simple too. Otherwise I've treated the scout challenges kinda passively. I've never seen campfire tales and don't really need the backpack. I like having tasks that take a while.
---
The going rate is around 5k i believe, that cool?  If you are interested I will be home around 6 to 6:30pm EST.  Let me know and we can meet up.
---
My first pic of Grahm, ever, was at Sunshine Meadows. He wanders right past it.
---
Seriously, I encounter that guy so much.
---
I just take the workshop that makes unirradiated food and sit there fo a bit racking it up.  I have over 100 salisbury steaks in my stash.
---
Get low?  Repeat.
---
I meant the prices at player vendors. They seem pretty high on ultracite ammo. 
---
But hey. If they sell they sell
---
I leveled up fast by questing and events
---
I still don’t have the camera and I’ve been looking for a while.
---
Me being skeptical about a very obscure way of spawning a mob doesn't really equate to me complaining
---
I saw it once all weekend.  Failed it too
---
Gotcha only positive comments on fallout 76 or else. I love how this game is just an asset flip and most of the bugs from fallout 4 were copied over.
---
So you need both equipped now? Or just Wasteland Whisperer?
---
Her and I have played maybe 4 hours together (work schedule conflict). She likes it a lot! Not much into the building as I am, but finding things she really loves.
---
Yeah something similar to the GTA brief menu. I think thats what it was called
---
Graham passes through my shop alot. I'm posted out right in front of one of his spawns.
---
Edit: just realized you said workshop not camp. That sucks.
---
There's a specific one in each wing you can use. As mentioned above, it's an anti-duping measure.  They did this as a hasty fix in a previous patch.  When they reintroduced that method, they once again used this as a hasty fix.
---
I'm sure there's broken stuff, any time you go from a limited amount of players testing to a live server, there's going to be stuff that's broken. As long as they fix it promptly, I think we can do our best to understand. And you're right, they could have gone even more conservative and we'd be stuck with no new content.
---
Bash Bethesda as you want, the new kids on the block (bioware) are proving what *truly broken* means.. while Bethesda delayed and delayed new content, they kept pecking away at bugs, improved their communication, kept working on new content.. and did a relatively good job keeping all those wheels turning, even though they got constantly blasted with negativity and toxicity.
---
Bioware on the other hand has had about half as long as Bethesda, hasn't addressed some of the most basic bugs, and gone pretty much completely radio silent about what's coming, what players should expect.. removed their roadmap.. pretty much the opposite of what any professional company should do.
---
So yeah, Bugthesda has their flaws, but they've done a relatively decent job recovering and having the building blocks towards becoming a great game- you really need to look at bioware and all their missteps to see how much worse it could have gone, and still be going.
---
I think that seeing examples of bioware and Bethesda will change how players look at games as a service in the future.. we all hope for better from AAA developers, but outside the single player experience.. no company has had a smooth game come out in a long time, unless it was a sequel (like division 2).
---
Makes me wonder what the next generation can expect.. I think I'm more forgiving, considering the quality of games we had 20 years ago was barely better than doom 2. Perhaps the development process hasn't caught up with what's possible technology wise, perhaps theirs too much possibility to come up with simple ideas than implement them. Who knows.
---
This would be an excellent addition.
---
Your build is good. Serendipity is by far the best defensive perk, but you may want to swap in Blocker in STR, just to protect from ghoul swarms and suprise mutant sledge hits.
---
Naw, I've gotten 3 (out of the vendor, not spawns) and have a contest going with some of my team members.  One guy got 5 in about 4 days.  (I think he cheated by adding some from spawn points, but I'll let him slide since it's all for trash talking rights.)
---
I played Borderlands listening to Claptrap spout maymays. The vending machine is like Bach.
---
I'd love a fire engine skin for my Excavator set.
---
I wish it would come with a water canon mod tho for crowd control.
---
I did not read, but i agree!!!!
---
Hell yeah lol
---
I've never seen a Behemoth
---
"best" power armor is relative, methinks.
---
I have ful sets of T45, 51, 60, and Excavator.  While the others have more DR/RR/ER,
---
 I spend my time in Excavator because for the time being, I need the extra carry weight it provides.
---
Extra ore from mining is a bonus.
---
Apparently it seems like you can still tame them with Wasteland Whisperer (It used to work with Animal Friend), still have to test it out though.
---
Definitely, but I think it's going to increase sever load quite a bit.  
---
It's something to do with the players database entry only being loaded into the cell they are currently in, this would need a different copy of it to be held where the player camp is too.
---
Does it count bleed out?  Otherwise it's still tagging in a dozen odd times.   :(
---
So when someone calls your comment useless you just put words in their mouth? Interesting defense mechanism I guess. Like the op of the comment chain said, if your having fun with those sticks then I can’t knock ya.

We're definitely getting there !

ah so they all have the same wares ?

Honestly, doesn't bother me at all.  It's a pleasingly janky noise.

I’ve seen one at this lake in the Savage Divide, can’t remember the name but I believe it’s a guaranteed spawn if someone on the server hasn’t killed it

I'm actually a sweet roll vendor and people buy my shit up

Ok,I'll be in Appalachia

So you're trying to tell me that playing Fallout at a young age didnt lead to a lifelong Jet addiction? How preposterous

Top of the World train station and the Raider vendor at the very north of the savage divide. Got my plans a few days ago at top of the world
---
Yes, but only one works at any given time.
---
Has anyone been able to Shoot a Wolf with a Syringer for the chemist challenge? I have shot the Yao Guai and Radstag and they have successful checked off my list, but nothing so far for the wolf. I’ve probably shot 20-30 wolves so far ranging from level 10 Vicious Wolf, Legendary Pack Leader, level 30 Feral Wolves and level 50 Glowing wolves.
---
I don’t carry stimpacks

Fallout 76 is ten ten ten
---
Ten out of ten
---
Ten ten
---
It went down recently or hotfix?
---
If you don't mind saying where is your camp located? I'm considering just finding him then following till he goes into a workshop area.
---
Ugh this may seem like a small bug to bethesda stand point but it’s frustrating how many badges are bugged at this point just bullsh*t
---
I use the Xbox app on my phone to message folks faster than the onscreen keyboard.
---
Pffft, keep your TSE’s. I’ve got the awesome legendary drop “DRILL”. And we all know named weapons rock hardest, right?

---
The event is kinda based around healing so... I would say that you are not equipped for the event and therefore are a burden and not a help.
---
Vampire gun
---
The easiest one I have ever done was with 3 people. We each took a pylon. One person spammed it with a cryolator while the other two took it down. &lt;5 minutes total.
---
 re: doo doo, first, you have to stop swearing.
---
HAHAHA.
---
Second, yes, the game completely sucks, about as much as it doesn't - so I'd say, 50% completely and utterly blows.
---
It only lasts 10 minutes with a 3 hour cool down. The odds of getting from hopping are even lower now than when it first dropped.
---
I saw it once last week.
---
Water filter would be relevant if there was a "filtered handpump" that could be built using it.  Get tired of constant diseases grabbing water for cooking.
---
Hotfix. The method was using the whitesprings waiter's and the they made the waiters inaccessible.
---
I laughed inappropriately
---
I had both on at the same time. But i'd imagine it would work with just Wasteland whisperer by its self.
---
For the starter, it's not really worth the Cap investment.
---
For everyone else, it forces you to drop everything and go, and I can't be bothered if I'm in the middle of something else.
---
yup i got the Stings and things to finally trigger but i can't get the operation tidy to trigger no matter what i do , and of course i wont ever get the frog jar unloackable even if we can progress past this :(
---
I appreciate it. My buddy and I are sneak builds we creep and take all the pylons the sqautch doesn’t even move from its spawn point, we both give it one sneak power attack each and its dead 45 seconds is our fastest.
---
I'm just on the city limits of flatwoods, right by the motel on the same road as the overseers camp. I've been there for about a week now and I've seen him serveral times.
---
[I will always picture this.](https://youtu.be/H47ow4_Cmk0)

Under the sink - left of the oven
---
There are still 2 empty starts behind 3*** legendary's.... Time to activate the other 2*
---
Bethesda never fails to deliver broken updates and game mechanisms.
---
It really is such an easy boss fight. Which is why I get so frustrated when everything goes to hell in a hand basket
---
Shame when I first went to WS I loved how I would get served when sitting at table.
---
Yeah, thats a good idea too
---
Any idea where I can find an high level one, like an albino for example? Or just the same spots as usual?
---
Well, that works if he’s vulnerable right? Otherwise you are probably shooting eyebombs and killing people.
---
Cool, thanks for sharing.
---
and this is the responce I got which makes me feel better about them at least not giving me the normal canned responce they gave you 
---
Thank you for contacting the Bethesda Customer Support Team and your patience in waiting for assistance. My name is Daniel and I'll be happy to assist you today.
---
I understand you were able to start the quest "The Order of the Tadpole" before this quest was official available. Now that the quest is available you are unable to complete it due to it being bugged out. I understand how frustrating it can be when things aren't working as intended.
---
I am escalating your ticket to a specialized team to ensure you receive the best possible resolution of your issue.  Thank you for your patience while they review your request, they should be reaching out to you shortly.
---
If you have any further questions or information regarding this issue, please respond directly to this ticket to ensure the proper team is able to see your response.
---
Warm Regards,

---
Does carrying all three pylons at once count three ticks per second?
---
Np good luck
---
It shows up randomly at Raider vendors now.  Don't forget the one inside Whitesprings as well as Sutton Station.
---
Damn, I've been on a couple hours a day almost every day and I think I'm still at like 500 or something
---
I know a lot of videos and article tell the location of the camera if you haven’t tried those yet if
---
it was possible i would give you one of the 3 broken ones just I have randomly looted so can have one but I wish all the luck on finding one
---
The table just needs to be expanded to account for &gt;1 legendary affects on a weapon.  This is not intensive, especially compared to what was allowed at launch in terms of in-game anythings, vs. what's allowed now.  Stashes, camp sizes, etc. have raised significantly, as just one example.
---
I thought this was just me! Scared me the first time it happened lol everytime I moved the ghoul moved. I think mine was legendary too
---
As someone who only has 3 points in endurance and recieved a total of like 15 Endurance perk cards from the packs. Please. Please make this a thing.
---
On a similar note, I spawned at one camp where the only exit was through a decon arch. Going through wiped away my mutations.
---
Now, I know...
---
Im sure this was done to combat the rampant earning of atoms, poor Bethesda needs to get people to pay for atoms somehow.
---
Yes. But not yet. Bethesda needs a way to track items and revert duped weapons. Wipe them and the original from the server and revert trades associated with the duped weapons.
---
After my first few tries, I find myself not caring about the legendary. But the 400 steel and a few hundred fusion cells from the bots is totally worth warping over. I normally grab a pylon then run circles around the camp spamming my Tesla into the gutsys.
---
Yeah survivability with a gun is totally different mate. If this was fo4 id be fine melee start to finish cause you have access to clothing that increases str, boobleheads and magazines to increase special, and blitz vats. Melee in fo76 is mediocre. Not to mention specials are severely limited. Theres even an rng element on perk cards and certain cards locked behind level requirements.
---
This is the most restrictive FO game ever. Im not trying to rush, or anything. But i should be able to kill enemies half my level and weaker in 1 hit. Instead i have to hide in corners and try to kill 1 v 1 and have enemies come to me because i cant kill 1 guy in the open without being shot to death.
---
I like how when I got here this had a downvote. Seriously? Why not just answer the question. Personally I just get caps by making sure to get all the daily caps from vendors and i also get caps while collecting things to sell to npc vendors (I run west tek and the building just to the north) both places are super mutants
---
Water filters are pretty useless, but ultracite receivers aren't. It's like scorched killer but actually useful. Great against the SBQ, but also scorchbeasts in general. On weapons like the gauss rifle or crossbow it's also the only way to boost your damage
---
Usually you can see the second star's information (major modifiers; things like Explosive, +25% fire rate, etc.) on the long-form description on the menu. Example, a TSE would have a "Two Shot" prefix and "Bullets explode for area damage" description.
---
This is more important on armor pieces, where its minor modifiers (the third star, things like Sentinel, Cavalier, weight reduction, etc.) are arguably more important than its major modifiers (the +1 SPECIAL stat, Poisoner, Powered)
---
With stealth maxed out you can hide even on power armor. The crouching perk makes it so enemies lose sight of you, allowing you to go into caution and get the stealth bonus damage. In queen events I run around with a shotgun and explosive gatling gun and don't bother much with stealth.
---
Eat ten scrap steel, shit out a few screws half an hour later
---
I'd be down for that
---
Thanks for the Silver!
---
You cant pvp during a event so not killing people, and I’m shooting me anything red, so the food build can grab pylons, it’s not my fault you don’t bring enough stims to keep yourself alive
---
Your "test" is a baseline, it is not what happens in real FO76 life, perk cards and such. The fact that so many have experienced the same issue is hard to ignore and that is a fact.
---
100% agreed. I want to feel like I'm making an impact somehow or at least feel like I'm deeply involved with a quest
---
Sounds like the bewitched theme tune from years ago. Same as whitespring I think
---
Power to the vending machines only controls if you show up on the map. The vending machines are always active.
---
Yes yes, of course, good for you buddy.
---
There is a plan for a pool cue I found in yesterday at the vendor below wavy Williards I believe
---
skyrim 4 will come, relax
---
Radstags are everywhere up north to the east of the water park.
---
A Yao guai spawns at both Phillipi cemetery and dolly sods camp.
---
I found the wolves doing the Leader of the Pack event in the north west part of the map around the Ferris wheel.
---
I’m pretty sure you’re forced out of crouch when interacting. I know you are for hacking terminals...
---
I was at whitesprings yesterday and high level players wrecked my biz so i had to leave.  I guess I will have to swallow my pride and do this on adventure mode.  Was trying to stay on survival during the whole process.  Jumping on adventure mode feels kinda cheap ,but getting ganked all the time by high level players and losing my shit is also getting old lol.
---
I assure the trophy isn't bugged.  If you have the perk with the book detector enable it.  It's called bilbophile or something like that.  The magazines aren't hard to find.  If you're on ps4 let me know
---
Go to sleep before you do any hunting . You'll gain  temporarily xp bonus when you are well rested .
---
Go to sleep as soon as you get in your or your friends camp
---
I have the Yao GUI done I need the wolf,Fox,radstag,and squirrel
---
Prison has a level 3, two level 2, and 1 level one. Abby's bunker has a level 0. Lighthouse has a level 0. Missile Silo has a bunch of level 2 and 3. Thats where I did mine.
---
We still have 4* and 5* effects in the files that are not available, hopefully coming soon with nuclear winter and/or the vault dungeons. I'm really looking forward to incendiary and plasma infused
---
Alright man thanks
---
I have found about 10 of these this past week and you can't give then away or sell them 🤔
---
I always end up having to hold all three pylons. Honestly, I've stopped showing up for them, because that's too much damned work versus all the people that run around in a panic. You ought to know how the event works by now.
---
I'm not sure but reading the comments on a couple of similar threads gives me the impression that people seem to think the weapon has to be broken. If so, that's not the case - I had some rinky dink 1 star leg crossbow in my inventory and used it for the archery badge. Was in sutton or something shooting level 5-16 super mutants with it. After clearing out 10 or so I would repair the weapon even though it had almost no damage and it counted toward the requirements.
---
I agree, but duping ruins servers. Pretty important also
---
How can someone be so kind with that PS4 name LOL.
---
I just gave you recipe on how to arm yourself cheaply so that you wouldn't be undergeared in PvP. The thing with people who can't git gud is that they refuse to listen.
---
Quite the excellent service. Very kind of you. :)
---
As far as I know, no matter the level of the creature you tame, it will become level 21 after reaching your camp. 
---
Personally, I think the best place for taming stuff is where the train tracks cross the road right in front of Treetops, in the mire. Good luck.
---
Edit- I forgot to mention, I don't believe you can tame albino deathclaws
---
This sub is kind of an echo chamber. Expect to be downvoted if you hate on the game. Most of us agree that the hatetrain was composed mostly of brainlets who blindly hated on the game.
---
You're kind of doing that.
---
Heck, even I'm getting downvoted for something because of my own post about boring endgame. I can't be bothered to understand why, but just throw it in the trophy case and be done with it.
---
Go to r/fallout if you need an echo chamber that hates Fallout 76. This is the wrong chamber, bud.
---
No you have to run Iron Fist, it is the perk card for Unarmed. Deathclaw Gauntlets, Knuckles, Power Fist, Mole Miner Gauntlet, ect all benefit from it. The meat hook is interesting that it is affected by both unarmed and 1h perks. Weapon Artist, and Incisor also affect unarmed.
---
Cool....  I'd buy them all but I'm on PS4
---
Few workshops he passes, you could kite an enemy then Grahm chases it and you lure it into the workshop, Grahm kills enemy then you snap a pic. If this sounds ridiculous thats because it is and shouldn't require so much work, if you plan on doing it make sure you get the pic of Grahms routes and Im sure he passes the junk heap near workshop to east.
---
I have several Dedicated Vendor Characters, and sales were through the roof on Tuesday night, fair on Wednesday, and Flat by Thursday.
---
I suspect the biggest issue is players simply running out of caps. and some getting tired of not being able to inspect Items at most Vendors.
---
Another issue is the cost of travelling around to all the vendors, prices are slowly normalizing for the most part, although some players are so obviously clueless about item values it's comical, on Tuesday Night I purchased an Explosive 3\* Plasma Rifle for 150 caps, but I also found many players trying to sell things for extremely inflated prices as well.
---
Join me behind the keyboard
---
I was in survival and whitesprings is not friendly to low level players lol.  Guess I will have to do this in adventure mode.
---
No. But you have a chance to come towards the light here. Combat Knives are the bomb and you have perks for them. ;)
---
Squirrels you can find outside of the whitesprings bunker. You can find foxes at the BBQ shack where open range begins.
---
I would LOVE to see community challenges/mechanics implemented!
---
It definitely lead to lifelong Fallout addiction thats for sure, it made me stay away from anything amphetamine related when it started circulating around
---
The lumber yard in the NW should be pretty easy for a dungeon crawl.  Also, if you're a ranger, Grafton Days is easy from the shed with the fusion generator if you're ranged.  Protest March can be easy for ranged as well if you find the right spot.
---
It's still an issue. Rule of thumb: if the marker isn't in cranberry bog, it's not working right.
---
I've tried to search locations it usually spawns at while the marker is skewed since you can still enter the Uranium fever event by getting close to the mine. No dice. But then, I'm not real familiar with the know spawn locations.
---
&gt; just wreck all the starred enemies that come out for yourself, if you’re able. Fug em!
---
Thats what I do. Ask them nicely once. If they don't respond, get in their way a lot while you destroy the legendaries. If you refuse to be civil, then civility is out the window.
---
My build is a power armor tank. 15 strength, 1 perception, 12 endurance, 1 charisma, 15 intelligence, 1 agility, 10 luck. The game insists I take perception, charisma, and agility cards instead of ones I can use 🤷‍♂️
---
24 hours to do this and it's worth 20 atoms, there's no way they aren't intentionally making these harder as time goes on so people give up on actually finishing these challenges, the casual player might not even have a camera at this point
---
Foxes usually spawn around Fred’s BBQ Shack and squirrels can usually be found traveling from Overseers camp to Flatwoods. Be looking on the sides of the roads for them.
---
Blocker and lone wanderer perks are typically enough to survive any nuke zone. I just use the hazmat suit.
---
Stealth is the superior way to play guns. We can increase our damage 2.5-3.5x (3.75x if you use the glitch) depending on time of day. The sneak attack perks add more damage than the damage perks do. The only issue with stealth is the inability to retain sneak attack damage in SBQ fights. You lose a lot of damage output. Any situation where there is in fighting between enemies or enemies attacking other PCs, you can lose out in terms of damage. It seems proximity and some hidden enmity mechanic determines whether or not you get sneak attacks for these boss events. When sneak does manage to activate, I witness visible chunks chip off of the Queen's health bar.
---
I do this but sometimes I get lazy lol.
---
Are you on PS4? I’ll use it!
---
Mind if I ask whats main prize? and Yea thats insane amount of tokens needed if they weight so much,
---
Or, and apologies if this has been suggested, put your vendor and your rolling garage door on the same switch. 
---
Door's open, shop's open. 
---
Door's closed, stay off my lawn!
---
So, does the tourist move if one person finds it?
---
I've got an exterminators explosive reduced weight LMG and the list view just tells me it's does 30% extra damage to one group, it's not until I inspect the gun that I see the explosive and weight reduction perks.
---
System?  If ps4 I’ll buy it for 500 caps and gift it to my low level cousin
---
As much as I love my country I am not sure going super patriotic in the fallout world is a good idea, I mean look at what they did to the place.
---
Haha. Welcome to the sheep killer crew! Yes I've made friends and teamed up with new people in the game. Some will be shy but no harm sending a friend request and a friendly gesture to someone about your level. Geting a mic and using in game audio helps break the ice.
---
Edit: I'm on PC so sorry we won't be able to!
---
Ah ok cool and thank you
---
I think it's pretty fun to have challenging challenges. I just don't like it when it involves other people. Let me take a picture  in my underwear of a deathclaw in a nuked area. That might be fun. But as soon as it involves other people Im not even going to try. How big is the chance to find other people running around in underwear, or are willing to pose for me?
---
I actually know quite a few high lvls who barely got it recently and only because I server hoped for them to get the guy to spawn. But yea really not liking these challenges.
---
What is that robot you search for?
---
I know about all of them.
---
Carry weight  basic bag have +60lbs (lvl50)
---
All mods will reduce this by half. (30lbs)
---
Carry capacity mod increase it double. (120lbs)
---
Effects (i dont remember names sorry for not being 100%correct)
---
Carry capacity bag have -60rad rezistance and -60energy rezistance, but gives carry-check upper.
---
Lead. - gives +90rad rezist
---
Insulated- gives +90 energy rezist
---
Armored - gives +90 all rezist
---
Refridgator - reduces spoling speed of food by 60%, don't stack with perk something in salt (which reduces it by 90%)
---
Yes! I need a proper emote to use with people who try to initiate pvp with me and follow me around the map hitting me
---
Charleston station. There is another spawn up near top of the world but I don't know exactly where that one is.
---
I think (just my best guess) this is just a delay between the server and your system. Your system loads in the enemies, then the servers tells it, "oh, those are all dead", and your system "kills" them.
---
Or, more specifically, switches their status from "alive" to "dead" and so they go through their death animations.
---
It makes running the silos a walk in the park when it triggers and destroys all the turrets.
---
It's like a shiny pokemon, you don't believe in it until you find it
---
idk where exactly it spawns by soft serve but I recall people saying it's past a whitesprings bus
---
Think they’re after the one that appears near Charleston Station... but that’s a guess...
---
I know, I’m with you on that. My pet peeve it the grenade guys or people shooting the water with explosive rounds or jumping in front of me..... lol
---
I can confirm that it does not. Last night I got a card pack and got another Hacker card, I've had all three already for a very long time now.
---
You're downvoted because you have 0 proof, not because people are Bethesda fanboys. You think it's good for the game to spread unverified rumors?
---
If its on PC I take it.
---
Easy for Turkey Boss, just copy giant chicken from Skyrim and bam they ready to create the event.
---
I'll tell you this.
---
In no fucking way am I touching PvP. Period.
---
Sorry! i forgot to put that im on XBOX, just edited it in, my bad!
---
search the sub.  Someone posted a map of all the nuked flora.
---
Eat some cement then shit a brick.

That's worth a punt, I usually rename armour in my inventory so I can see what the spec is quickly, wonder if it transfers to the buyers view.
---
That sucks but I'll be sure to invite some people next time I'm on thanks :)
---
The one with the long hunters coat, whatever it’s called. This is driving me up a wall.
---
And thank you!
---
Yes, it is just past the bus. sometimes it's a bunch of ghouls, mutants, or a couple of different bots can spawn there.
---
Just a picture of the whole Wavy Wave mural/artwork at the bottom end of the wave pool worked for me, good luck..! 👍🏻
---
Just don't say its because its broken because its only your perspective on it thats broken mate
---
That's good to know, I stayed away from this challenge set, because I wasn't sure. That would be pretty expensive doing it 60 times, I imagine. Thank you
---
I hope they add 4th of July event but they got their hands full with future content coming up soon so I won't blame them if we don't get one, new battle royale mode coming soon and Im not looking forward to it.
---
That event has made the 76 community look like a bunch of aholes and idiots. Ive stopped even attempting this event because of how amazingly bad,lazy or stupid most players are. Nobody will be a conduit ive seen minutes go by with no pylon activated and about 10 players in the event. Ive been a conduit for all 3 need to be revived and nobody saves me and ill wait the entire countdown for help die and upon respawning get "another players taken your loot" people need cloth and bone shards more than a vulnerable squatch?
---

Partway down that amazing post, maps for all or individual flux locations.  Pick from there.

&gt; pacifichero45 I'll add you but i won't be able to be on then.  I'm mostl;y available thur-sun, depending on my shifts.

Grahm walks through Wade airport pretty often.  Just have to catch him.
---
No problem :)
---
\*catlike typing detected\*

Good thought, but still think it could be more grindy ("challenging").
---
Take a camera picture of a player who is naked,  but wearing a tinfoil hat, eating another player, who is naked but wearing BottleCap sunglasses, next to a live Imposter Sheepsquatch, a Noxious Sheepsquatch corpse, a Scorchbeast Queen corpse, a Sentry Bot, and a live Wise Mothman, during a radstorm at night in front of Vault 76.
---
Coming next week to a daily challenge near you.
---
When you snap the picture is the camera showing the location you're aiming at?
---
That's commie talk.
---
Help me. I'm old. Shooting eyebombs?
---
It definitely start later than 6pm, I think it’s more like 9pm. And not once per night, there’s a global cooldown (not sure how long)
---
Seasonal Events suck. Hear me out.
---
- These require the same amount of work on the dev as a quest but lose out on impact because of the limited time availability. An event is replay-ability beyond just the time frame it exists. A quest, maybe be done once, but can be replayed on a new character. there's a point of diminishing returns on working on a item only for it to exist for one month.
---
- These limited time offers also are disingenuous because it propogates daily login and emphasize FOMO as a tool for profit. Daily log ins in turn become a chore rather than playing for fun. It's like a limited time event in the Atom store. They know you can't afford the blackbird skin so early in the games life, so it's almost indicative that purchasing atoms with real money is the only way to have gotten those skins.
---
- These limited time event also have a hard time bringing in new people or old people because now they've already "missed out". There's no incentive for long term "hey come back and check this out". Thing's like a high difficulty vault raid or back packs that exist beyond a month are what draw people in. New content that dies out is for the existing player base.
---
So what do we do? We look at why/how Fasnacht was *really* fun.
---
It wasn't fun because it was limited. It was fun because it was slow-paced, brought everyone together, and had a rare reward with other collectibles. 
---
I mention slow pace only because the impostor sheepsquatch does the last two but isn't as highly regarded. albeit, I prefer the impostor event for it's difficulty.
---
The rare items were what kept people going back and even server hopping. Had the event only contained a white wolf fedora as the reward, a player wouldn't have done it more than once. With the combination of different common masks, recipes, and rare masks, players kept coming back trying to get the elusive old man winter and other rare masks.
---
Well drink a vintage  nukashine .... You'll be awake ....
---
I finally hit level 50, and it kinda ticked me off that I never once looked forward to a perk pack after level 10
---
If you're going for a stealth rifle, you're basically support. I carry an Endangerol syringer and pop the queen everytime it lands to help reduce 25% of it's damage resistance for 2 minutes while all the melee and heavy gunners whale it down and it works great! In queen battles, Im usually am in a hasmat suit (unless i can get away with it and not be inside the zone) and in sneak mode to get maximum damage; away from the battle, picking away at surrounding creatures and popping the queen here and there. Very low key for me since i run a full bloodied build. Im a glass cannon, if I get hit once or twice, im done for! (I run a full unyielding WWR armor only) Haha! I dont really team up with people but I aim to not be spotted or die and im always successful! =D I get a lot of xp picking away at every creature and I dont die! I'm happy! But the syringer most definitely helps! That's the best weapon i can bring to the queen. As long as you have the big guns and the fistacuffs doing most of the damage, you can sit back, conserve ammo and get as much XP as possible Haha! That's my experience =P
---
Yeah every time I turn on the Pip-Boy radio that shit sounds like it’s blaring in my ear, regardless of my volume settings
---
they appear to stack. Once i did all 3 and had to IV the Stimpacks i was draining HP so fast
---
I dont understand how players are racking up this many hours! What keeps you coming back to the game every single day? I'm genuinely interested to know. It doesnt seem to hold my interest for anymore than a few hours a week, if that. And the controversies arent helping
---
I wish
---
Would love it as it would help to make proper tanks in this game while damage dealers are protected.
---
Hmm, it could be that I've seen very few undesirable first trait weapons that were explosive compared to anti armor/two shot/furious/mutants that all show explosive in the description.. maybe most junk them. I know mutant Slayer showed explosive.. I figured they all did.
---
Perhaps there's an exception to the rule, kind of like how sentinel only shows as the prefix when it's assassin's, when otherwise it always shows the 3rd trait in the description and you won't see it unless you inspect it.
---
Does renaming the item change what it's called when it's sold? Just curious if anyone has tried..
---
Wow yeah that’s kind of fucked up, I wonder if people get copyrighted from use of the Pip-Boy radio too.
---
If they percieve it as different, they believe it is different, so it's not a lie to them (but it's still pushing an idea with no basis). People are just underestimating how much food and water some actions take because they do slightly different things each time. This thread pops up literally every day, if even one of them were true there would have been proof of even one instance of this since beta.  
---
For the same reasons witnesses can be unreliable even if they are honest, I don't trust random players testimony over actual proof. Especially in a game like this that is ripe with people who want to make excuses for duping, bobblehead stacking etc.
---
Lol, I do I bring plenty. But I’m getting some insight into the people that show up and I appreciate it.
---
I lock my doors because I'm anal about them being left open (don't want my pet cat topiary to escape) but I have stairs to my roof and it's a short drop to my front door, so nobody is trapped.
---
What new enemies
---
Yeah all I’ve gotten so far are ghouls mutants and eyebots.
---
Shall be added to my playlist, thank you kind sir
---
I don't like or use stuff that is only effective against specific enemies.
---
If an item has some seriously good second or third effects I'll ignore that crap first effect and stick it in my vending machines. If not it's into the scrapper.
---
4 actually...
---
I feel ya.
---
I haven't had one drop,  but was lucky enough to find one inside a paper bag in Whitesprings a while back. Not max level but it suited my needs for a while. 
---
I'm looking for a Handmade at the moment myself.
---
Yup and its same for other devices used to play it like PS4 and PC. Going to be a hard one.
---
We need online shopping from our personal terminals. 😂😂
---
That’s what I’m saying, but I’m glad I made this post. I’m learning that people have different reasons for showing up.
---
All of the music in Fallout 76 is overwhelmingly loud to me
---
But you can control where you spawn to an extent. Did some testing the other day at my camp. Pretty much all I did was move the C.A.M.P machine thing around and looked where I spawned each time. Basically just fast traveled to vault 76 and back. How you move the camp machine is very small movements. I tried larger moves in order to narrow down where I wanted and I ended up further away than where I was at. After that I just did very small changes and have it down to spawning within a 5ft area. After that I watched where other players spawned when they came to my camp and it was pretty spot on to where I was spawning after doing the fast travel stuff. This took only a couple minutes to do and I now don't even have to worry about spawning some where dumb when I travel to my own camp.
---
I would suggest take lvl 1 of each slugger (regular, expert, master) instead of rank 3 of any certain one. It will give you +30% instead of just 15%. And then slowly start ranking them each up. Adrenaline is good, as is bloody mess. 
---
I personally run rank 2 of each slugger card, martial artist, incisor, bloody mess if I remember to swap out super duper, rank 2 adrenaline, rank 5 makeshift warrior. Plus twisted muscles and talons mutations, along with others though the others are not necessary (try to avoid mutations that affect strength such as bird bones unless you run class freak rank 3). I do not run tenderizer as I have not figured out how to work it into my build.
---
Nerd rage is only good if you run a low health/bloodied build, as it only adds damage when your health is low. Same with adrenal reaction (mutation). Good for if you run a bloodied build, but not if you like high health.
---
I actually am having the same issue, I can't add to my Vending Machine or even my Fermenter. I keep getting the message my Workshop Budget has been exceeded. This better be a bug, because telling us that things in Vendor and Fermenter take up not only stash buy build space is a double whammy and wrong. And I am not deleting items in my build because I love my base.
---
I have a pretty lame build for a level 130. I've only done 2 of these and was dead within about 5 seconds of taking a pylon the one time I did it. 
---
The main problem I see is that people have moved on from this event. Heck, it's hard to get people to show up to kill a queen sometimes.
---
I’ve done the campfire tales about a dozen times, never gotten a single badge. I got a badge from stings and things, but nothing else besides the challenges.
---
I have a 2 star bloofied 50 limb damage max level hunting rifle
---
I often see Grahm in the Red Rocket megastop. There are a ton of old cars in the road, so it messes with his pathing and he gets stuck for a while
---
Don’t know why you got downvoted, Elizabeth Montgomery will always be my crush
---
It isn't about the engine. That's just a canard.
---
I also don't count 76 as a failure or a bad game, it has an addictive game loop. 
---
It is a looter, open world, exploration, survival game, base builder with lots of lore, story and quests. The concept of 76 was so huge that it was guaranteed to have bugs. I pre-ordered it knowing that it was going to be buggy at first but for a one game buy in I get to live in a Fallout world till at least Fallout 5 comes out, and probably longer. 10 years of gaming in a Bethesda Fallout world for the price of a game and a couple of skins here or there, for sure count me in.
---
The difference between Anthem and 76 is that when 76 came out there was a clear vision and commitment to where it was going. I am positive that almost all of the DLC was planned out pre-launch as they are hitting events and content drops that are too coordinated to be ad-hoc.
---
But there’s a daily limit of 1400, not enough for a single recall card
---
Weird cause its definitely the camp module. When shopping if u tp to a camp and they never moved it, you literally spawn on top of the camp.
---
100 damage seems a little low for a semi auto handmade. AA won't show up as a benefit in the weapon card. Are you using a hardened receiver? Do you have bloodied mess (luck perk)? How much are you reducing health for adrenal reaction?
---
Oh yeah that’s tons of fun.  Nothing like not being able to see to make it fun.
---
It's hit and miss whether something gets marked, but it does work.  I haven't yet figure out what it takes to get a mark to stick.
---
You *can't* see the mark when scoped, which is kind of pointless, but that may be by design (can't say why that would be though).
---
Darn those possum badges. 😂😂
---
Travel to huntersville turn around and theres a BOS cemetary with wolves like 20 feet from you.
---
Oh yes!
---
I bought both and regret neither. 
---
Anthem was fun while it lasted but BioWare doesn’t seem to now what to do and doesn’t care to figure it out when it comes to new content. They made a half assed attempt at fixing it and then just sort of gave up. I don’t see Anthem recovering or BioWare loving this one down.
---
The one thing Bethesda has over BioWare is the fact they stuck by and fixed a lot of the game. It’s still far from perfect, but they seem to be learning instead of throwing their hands up.
---
Communication is also leagues better with Bethesda.
---
It's quite random. I sometimes get lvl 16 enemies in a silo on my lvl 200 character and no turrets.
---
Rifleman works only for non-automatic rifles. If your handmade has an automatic mod then it will require Commando instead.
---
Other than that, perks that will increase your damage output are Tenderizer (Charisma), Adrenaline (Agility) and Bloody Mess (Luck).
---
Edit: Also Tank Killer in Perception.
---
My exterminators explosive LMG only shows the explosive tag if you inspect, else it just shows the extra 30% damage modifier.
---
Hey, are you still available to help me out with this?
---
Daylies and this one event have 25% to give badge
---
Preach it.  It’s like if we have to work together for a common goal things... get... weird...
---
I’m at about 40 hp constantly and I do not have bloodied mess but is it really that helpful
---
If you get a chance to check before I do, let me know.. I'll check when I see a friend online!
---
Comparing F76 and Anthem development, they're almost totally the opposite of how they were made. People complain about Bethesda reusing code and assets from their previous games, but Anthem shows what happens when you don't: massively inflated dev time and budget.
---
Also F76 had a normal amount of dev time whereas Anthem was essentially made under a year.
---
If I read this correctly you are in Survival correct? PVP?  Go to Adventure mode and level your character up and adventure over there. IT IS PVP FOR A REASON! If you are red to me in PVP, you are dead. I don’t seek out low levels. There is no reason that makes any sense that a low level should expect to come to survival and just have this false sense of “I shouldn’t be shot or killed because the big bad higher level guy should feel sorry for me” Please go grind in adventure mode and stop complaining when you get shot in survival. I worked really hard to get my high level. It is such BS that lower level characters believe they should be equal with someone who has worked so hard to level up themselves.
---
Sounds awesome. What platform your r u?
---
I'll lend it to you for 5000. But i need it back right away.
---
Most handmades are better running a commando build for the best dps. Unless you find a good 2-3* instigating or AA you're not going to do a lot. Crit builds help as well as concentrated fire but it's still lackluster with semi auto.
---
That's interesting and kind of neat you did all that testing. I don't think most players would do that much testing though.
---
Yeah, the eye bots that fly around. They are bombs in this event. Shooting one causes a chain reaction damaging and or killing any player in the vicinity.
---
Wait isn’t slugger 1H? Sorry I’m pretty new to all these perks
---
It’s Y/Triangle to grab the wire and A/X to place it on console
---
I don’t think the jackpot is worth it. From what I remember it was just a lot of random junk and a few weapons. The other rewards five ore, which is greatly Preferable imo
---
Troubleshooter's 30% bonus is lower than many other bonuses though. Even a nocturnal would do better if you ran the silo at night. But I will say I use a Troubleshooter's LMG for the Encryptid event because it reks.
---
Stacking zealot's or hunter's with a prime reciever will be the largest bonus you can get against the SBQ
---
Nay brother, that is straight talk. I would be down with a BBQ thrown by the freestates but you can keep that enclave level of patriotism for yourself.
---
Ah ok thanks.  Im running a non-automatic build.  Handmade, lever action if i can ever find one lol.
---
My struggle us now what items to keep to sell vs my stash space. I think I am more out of space now. 😂
---
Tried late last night, was probably 26 hours from my last login. Still screwed. Has anybody heard anything about a fix? There has to be a patch of some kind coming soon, since there are so many showstopper issues besides this one. If not, then I guess I'll try something like a 36-hour wait.
---
In the 3D inspect view, yes. But that view isn't available if the seller is away from their base.
---
Bloodied mess is pretty nice, at least one card for the base boost. I prefer all 3 myself but I've been tweaking my bloodied build here &amp; there.
---
I took at least one rank in the perks that give a damage boost. Adrenaline Rush under agility is another ace perk, especially that first rank can get upto I think 36%.
---
Edit due to grammatical bs
---
I like the sound of that
---
Marsupial IMO
---
I hope they fix the star issue.
---
I was able to get the backpack finally but thanks for helpin. Psn im_chris1186 is me. If you need mats or need help grinding mats or challenges hit me up. I'm goin for the armor playing mod next. I'm gonna see how it helps with pvp in survival
---
Yep, it's a shame because, like you said, more cannons increased artillery time. However, I don't know if they also removed that function with the cannon limit, honestly they probably left it in, just that nobody can utilize it now.
---
As an online game that is trying to encourage interaction, it's a very good challenge.
---
They have pushed voice communication since the beginning and the game expects you to actually grab a mic and talk to others. Which is outside of a lot of people's comfort zone.  They hope to encourage some behaviors, because they believe it will increase your engagement or enjoyment of the game.
---
It's Doom's push forward combat mechanic.  You might want to snipe and hang back but the game knows you will probably have more fun if you get pushed into close quarters combat so mechanics are geared toward rewarding you for up close fighting. You might want to stay silent and emote only but you will probably have more fun if you engage socially with other players.
---
Marsupial.
---
I think you can equip/unequip them from the atomic shop.
---
Oh Tidus, you'll always be special in my heart.  And not for a good reason.
---
I’m fine with NO ONE showing up. I can solo it just fine.  But I was thinking it was selfish of me to kill it before anyone showed up. This post has made me realize that it’s ok.
---
And you may get 30+ other things before you get the responder bot.
---
IMO Charleston is a decent place (but I haven't looked at the soft serve one at all).  Charleston is good because if you get mob spawns, they're all level 10 or less.  It does take a bit of running to get the spawn, but it's not bad.
---
So you wouldn't keep 1 weapon that gets extra bounus for a SBQ fight? Ok. Personally I like to save on ammo, but you do you
---
Putting u/aycee71 in my camp now.
---
What yoy have that you might trade, or pjrchase with caps?
---
I’m praying we get a snow themed map for a little while
---
Harpers ferry is very good for violet, it's everywhere.
---
it really gets tiring reading "PLEASE BETHESDA" every fucking post
---
But spending 200k on the event you should know to bring more to keep yourself alive
---
Marsupial
---
You can either look in my vending and see if you’d like to trade or caps is fine
---
I might have to re-verify that.
---
Slugger is 2h, Gladiator is 1h, and Iron Fist is unarmed. I am 99% this info is correct.
---
Marsupial most likely.
---
Everything else likely varies with build or playstyle.
---
Nope. I'll drop my ammo in a lake to get rid of it before I sell it at less than a cap per round.
---
Here's a list of all of the creatures and their respective types of legendary prefixes they are affected by, this was datamined by another redditor.  Since there was nothing about scorchbeasts in the latest patch notes I'm assuming the info is still correct for them and they are both animals AND scorched, so Hunter's and Zealot's both work.
---

---
Which is odd. The thing I’m selling is my robot chest price that I used before I got a better one. I can tell the stats when I get on, but it’s not bad, especially for that low of a price.
---
This is a brilliant idea.
---
I will only jump across a map for a full shop. I will take smaller jumps for less filled shops. Worst are the shops full of non legendary weapons.
---
I never keep more than roughly 30 stims and about 30 radaway on me, Nuka cola weigh a lot, so does purified water, dump ammo you don't use, and like someone else said set a Target amount for junk that you need and dump the extra.
---
I trust you lol. I just don’t know what to do since I already leveled them up or combined them or whatever the term is
---
It was self defense that resulted in an unfortunate incident that, in the moment, I may have exacerbated slightly with the robbing.
---
I found changing weapon will remove the blip, don't think that's how it worked in 4. Been meaning to try the Pearly Peepers to see if the blip retains with those.

I hide a switch in a wall and plop a prop in front of it, then make sure that they can spot it through a window or something similar!
---
Just group up with them. You get loot when something is killed by a party member and you're within a reasonable distance, regardless of if you got a tag in. If you refuse to group up, that's on you. I always let people tag on legendaries, but I don't want to sit there with 5 enemies shooting me while I'm running a 19% HP bloodied build, waiting for 3 other people to get in tags.
---
Im not rn but you got any be?
---
Was able to find it be running through the whole building, but I really like how the metal detector actual works now. Beforw the change you couldn't even go through it
---
A few weeks or E3. We better get Enclave presidential suite.
---
Just so I’m clear on bulk... how does it work when you need something from said bulk... does it use it all?? Sorry I’m just confused
---
There are lots of great views, so then you have to consider your other goals, and decide which is more important. You know you want a resource node for an extractor (which resource?)...do you also want to be near common paths (for vending), and away from spawn points (so your stuff isn't regularly trashed)?
---
The latter 2 may limit you somwhat.
---
Found this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a2dph2/has\_anyone\_found\_the\_hunters\_long\_coat/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a2dph2/has_anyone_found_the_hunters_long_coat/)

I don't know if it will help. I didn't know this existed now I'm going to start "the hop"
---
Certain emotes will expand when you roll over it to reveal other emotes further out on the wheel. 
---
Hope that makes sense. Took me a min to figure it out too.
---
If you’re semi:
---
Hardened Reciever
---
Perforating(Max AP) or Piercing/Stinging Mag
---
Max range out on your rifle with one of the better stocks/barrel mods 
---
Tank Killer maxed out
---
Bloody mess maxed out
---
if your Rifle is Explosive, consider picking up demo expert; not required but its a noticeable upgrade 
---
Consider investing some points in VATS, and try to use sneak and headshots to your advantage.
---
Also recommend;
---
Adrenaline for crowd control
---
Tenderizer is okay too but I personally run alone Wanderer for damage reduction
---
I'll try that tonight. Thank you!
---
Maybe I wrote something that I don’t remember... when was it that I said I died from lack of stim packs? Any clarity you could bring would be awesome.
---
just coming in to say I think the wheel is crummy...
---
Nuking different areas should absolutely spawn different world bosses with unique rewards.
---
I won’t be on for 4-5 hours but no I don’t
---
Harper's and Fissure Prime for violet. Charleston and Morgantown have a decent amount of cobalt. Someone nuked the Fissure a ways east of the Nuclear Disposal workshop down south yesterday and I got around 90 raw cobalt. Most of it was bomb berries though so it's whoever gets them first.
---
No.
---
While I don't mind giving ammo away for free on occasion, Selling it is part of my cap income.
---
Marsupial with Class Freak
---
Bring up the emote wheel then as you go around hit RB (that says “expand” on the bottom of the screen) some of them will have a greyed out expand but some of them with expand not greyed out can be changed to the emote you prefer
---
Ok ill be on later tonight if i remeber lol. Ill see what u got.
---
I use TE gatling for AWOL and takes only three hits to level a major gutsy when I'm all perked up. It's also quite useful for encryptid, silos (turrets especially), knocking down keycard drones and more. don't knock it until you try it.
---
Bro it’s not even out yet, chill
---
If you can mail it, I’d gladly take it!
---
Bringing up the engine is really about pointing out what a technical feat it really was, almost every game that's online is built around an engine that's developed for online play- the bugs like you said were inevitable from the sheer scope of the game, but fixing so many with this engine.. it's still an admirable point.
---
You make good points either way, Fallout started from a better place, knowing what it is, having a vision.. I'm not as sure they had some of the future content figured out, I remember some of the stuff they data mined, some of the developer notes left in.. 
---
I guess the question is what these technical feats and failures mean for the future of gaming as a whole.. is it evidence that developers just don't have a smooth way of making games with wide scopes in the future?
---
Has anyone said marsupial yet? If not, it’s marsupial.
---
Thank you, but do you know how to get the plans for the weapon mods?
---
Marsupial or Speed Demon
---
Where in Dallas are you ? I'm near Richardson
---
Aim down the pool at the mural. i did it a a bit of an angle me right/mural left. It was a bit tricky but it finally popped up with the name in my camera and I snapped it.
---
healing factor if you don't use chem, awesome in melee, and pistols builds. however, if you like to use crit boosting chems it can be an issue, but this can be mitigated by the other perks in the luck tree. it can be really awesome in the right build and a lot of people don't use it so you can get the serum for a pretty good deal. if you find a nice enough player they might make one for you for free.
---
Edit: Heavy Tank builds aswell because you can regen from near death aslong as you are away from heavy hitters. then you can sell you extra stimpacks, at your camp for a nasty profit.
---
Im waiting for the one, thats take a picture of 4 players each in the different horseman armor at a fissure sight with the queen emerging behind them at 6:66pm. How did we go from drink a nuka cola to this?
---
yup, a couple fusion cores...and I dont remember what elese, either.
---
I only recall 1 SB and a bunch of higher level scorched.
---
Lots of XP, an nice adrenaline rush, and you get to see the twin missle turret in action.
---
I was also quite amused after the fact that I got to loot piles of SB guano....
---
I’m located in cedar hill to be specific. Like 8-10 miles away from Dallas. I just happen to be in Dallas county. Do you possibly wanna come get it?
---
Water filters are indeed pointless.
---
As for ultracite ammo, I use it exclusively in my B25 .50 cal, and that thing eats through ammo fast. That said, the .50 cal prime receiver does quite a bit more base damage as well as extra damage on the SBQ / scorched, so it's much more worthwhile. I've noticed many weapons have the "hardened" type of receiver, and prime receivers do the same amount of base damage, so the only benefit is the 20% bonus to SBQ. I could definitely see it not being worthwhile on most weapons like that.
---
If you go the other way on the road there is a chance for the civil war reenactor. Just past the jeep there is a body in the road, to the right in the grass is where he or one of the other random events can spawn.
---
/u/Valseek loving all the amazing work that is being done with the game and new content! But I was hoping for maybe an official word on the status of the Hooded Yellow Rags not being a cosmetic item and unequipping all armor? I've searched through the subreddit history and while it has been brought up a lot there's never been an acknowledgment  of Bethesda being aware of it. 
---
Anyway! Thanks a bunch for your hard work and time. :)
---
This guy selling s'mores for a cap and here I am peddling Vintage Nukashine by the jug for 100 caps. Am I a bad person?
---
If no one comes to pick it up by the end of the day consider it mailed to you. I’ll contact you by the end of the day and let you know for sure what’s going on. :)
---
Many of them are sold by vendors, I believe harpers ferry has a few as well as watoga vendors.
---
Personally I just bought junk on the market reddit and crafted(with super duper perk) and scrapped ~50 or so Handmades to unlock the mods
---
Ooooh lucky! I hope they figure it out.  We shouldn't be punished because of their oversight..... 
---
That said, I never was able to get the skyrim helmet/sword quest to work on my F4 main, but I'm still hopeful.
---
It was the revive ally part  and revive in water part that had me. Allies in survival is rare. I've found what may have been friendly players but I killed them out of fear regrettably. I had one encounter where I was spotted, player waved at me and I retreated  into the brush backwards with weapons drawn. I got my backpack btw so I'm goin home to survival mode. Next is the armor plating mod for pvp testing(I dont have any awesome op legendary armor or  weapons, I have legendaries for sure but no AAE/BE so I play kinda fairish with basic legendary gear). I'm on ps4 btw, team up or fight me or neither lol
---
You can get that 600 just by exploring really fast (atleast I do)
---
Yea sorry was doing something mah bad
---
I'll try that too,  so far, no luck on this method.
---
Just keep them and get the others, You will want to focus on your strength, it is the only special that directly impacts melee damage. The only reason I don't run rank 3 on them is because I run traveling pharmacy (My addiction to hoarding stims makes traveling pharmacy a requirement), so I can not fit it into my build. Plus I only use 2h in PA, most of the time I run unarmed with my instigating Deathclaw Gauntlet. I also have the cards to use 1h if I wanted, Lvl 125 so I have extra cards to burn.
---
Tje radx won't really help. You have like 3 seconds to take this picture.
---
Now I'm not a survival player, so the Grafton events might be too close to the station if you're worried about campers.
---
Yeah....I probably have some pieces that suffer from that issue. However, I also keep my better pieces out of my vending machines. I just don't have the cap space to sell people a 15k cap AA fire rate minigun or even a 8k furious swing speed switchblade. And if I can't sell them for what they are worth I will keep them for use in alt characters.
---
What I would love is another vending machine that allows players to swap items +caps. I put in my item, you put in yours, maybe we request some caps on top. Then we each verify the trade and once agreed, take the other players offer. If not verified, we can take back our own stuff.
---
We agree my friend.
---
Don't forget to take pictures for the other badge while hunting them down. Also, make the fox jerky while there.
---
I had this situation yesterday. There were just 3 of us - leveled 83, 180, and 203 (myself). Funny enough it was the level 83 that was running about smashing everything to death with a melee build that let him 2-shot most of the miners. the 183 and myself had to run after him to pop some shots off at the legendaries before he smashed them to bits.
---
Names GumGaymer
---
That was one of my favorite events/camp locations. Everyone would show up at my place after the parade because I would always leave a “breadcrumb trail” of power armor suits going from old man winter to my shop. This is also when I got heavily into running a shop and trading time limited plans. Nice camp by the way!
---
Your about an hour away from me . That's a far drive in rush hour traffic sorry :(
---
Whoever is designing these challenges seems to be misunderstanding what challenges are supposed to be, game design wise. Let's compare and contrast 76's daily challenges with Hearthstone's daily quests.
---
Both challenges and quests are a quick way for players to earn a little bit of in-game currency each day, but that's where the similarities end. Hearthstone's quests revolve around either things you'd be doing anyway (like "Cast 30 spells") OR things that encourage you to try different, viable ways to play the game (like playing lots of small or lots of big minions, etc). For players, daily quests serve to get them a little bit of gold and to dip their toes into different ways to play, and for Blizzard, daily quests serve to keep players engaged and entertained so they keep coming back. Win/win.
---
In 76, daily challenges are often completely outlandish, convoluted, and at times impossible to pull off. They are anti-fun, frustrating, and ultimately not worth the effort. Challenges that depend on randomness and luck, things that players have ***no*** control over are fucking terrible design (Grahm in a workshop is a perfect example of that), and whoever is putting those together fundamentally does not understand the value challenges could provide to Bethesda. 
---
So, here's my constructive feedback for Bethesda:
---
**Daily Challenge DOs**
---
* Simple, straightforward tasks that can be completed in about five minutes each;  
---
* Encourage players to casually try and explore different play styles; and  
---
* Use daily challenges to guide players through the game and its systems.  
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
**Daily Challenge DON'Ts**
---
* Do not include elements of randomness in daily challenges;  
---
* Do not require grinding in daily challenges; and  
---
* Do not require parties, groups, or friends for daily challenge completion.
---
Progress. Bethesda is progressing, we are not. :D git gut.
---
Wanna try to take picture naked in nuke zone? We can make it in those 10second before we die, maybe, if UI chose to work.
---
Junk is a problem for me so I’ll check the venders later thanks
---
If tips jars came with different skins, like an open guitar case, I could be a street musician or play at bars. :)
---
I have to take off my headphones before approaching. Shits too loud.
---
Aw, okay. No big deal. Thanks for letting me know. :)
---
I'm work now though for the next 6 hours. If you still need it when I get home, I'll definitely help. There's something satisfying about jumping off a cliff and getting revived lol.
---
Yeah... Survival isn't going to work with power lvling.
---
You should sell it on eBay, I’ll buy it off of you
---
Np I know someone will come by . :D
---
How different can you make your build the higher you level? And are you running a power armor build? And idea what lvl I should start lvling up power armor perks?
---
How much are you willing to pay? I’ll legit mail it to you. I want it off my hands pretty soon.
---
Haha that's why we have survival mode.  To get the cheap gankers off the Adventure servers.
---
Yeah, I already have a prime 2 shot minigun for the Queen and that's a beast to feed.  I recently got a 3\*  .50 cal with Explosive and Vamp rolls, and I can make it a prime, but I never will  Just expensive enough making regular ammo for that one.  I wish Beth would let us turn normal ammo into Ultracite just by adding the flux and Ultracite but I'm not holding my breath for that.
---
I’ve never been a fan of shotguns so my 2 cents is Ditch it. Melee is more useful in my opinion because of the high dps.  I have a sneak build myself but I have melee and rifle. With a little tweak towards melee because of this bug. The rifle build with sneak is great for adventuring, but melee is kind in boss fights.  With the recent nerfs to shotguns ( I don’t really know what they were only that people are in happy) melee is a good bet.
---
I always use a comedy melee weapon like a rolling pin for these events. Lower levels really appreciate it and I can always quick switch to a real weapon if I need to.

#DeadGame

I'm level 13 and bought 200 .308 rounds for 200 caps, even then it's still a good deal. Not having to worry about running out of ammo - I made that 200 caps back in less than an hour. 
---
The ammo vending machines charge like 6 caps a round.
---
Duppers or profiting off of dupers
---
Thank you! It is incredibly frustrating looking for this dude.
---
People that run are people that brought junk for some god unknown reason. I just don't even pity people that bring junk to Encryptid anymore. If there's bags on the floor after the imposter dies, is start picking them up.
---
The only time i run is when i'm a conduit or when it's seconds from dying, so i don't have to hunt the corpse)
---
The Kotaku article really shows how much bioware just screwed up every step up of the way.. and even though they are very different, how they handled their development gaffs, how they professionally recovered (or didn't) is still going to impact gaming in the future.
---
And there's other examples as well I didn't want to bring up to keep the questions simple, but destiny 1 and 2, division 1 and 2.. there's a lot of examples of technical failures and recoveries, developers "do's and don'ts" that will factor into the future..
---
The question is how it will effect future development, gamers consumer choices in the future..
---
I'm much more hesitant to buy any game on day 1 much less pre-order.. while I got plenty of time played/enjoyed with fallout, Anthem and Bioware definitely left me feeling more burned..
---
I was scouting out new Campsites last night and was thinking that would be a dope area to build in!
---
Hmm I believe it starts with an M? I'm not sure though.
---
I'd focus a little more on one weapon type. Shotguns do decent damage up close without too many cards with stealth. Gun fu is also a good card for close quarters with a rifle. If you like shotguns I'd try to find an instigating one. Used a lvl 35 one star when I did whitesprings runs leveling up.
---
I see marsupial has been covered. Grounded is another good one if you don't use energy weapons.
---
Not directly helpful for your issue since I did the hunter one, anyhow I killed the Yao Guai for hunter challenge by shooting it with a shotgun first and then bashed it with Syringer weapon since shooting with it seemed useless (I didn't have any of the poison thingy's for syringer)
---
Makes sense haha
---
cap wise for the key card, crafting with components, or stimpak-wise??
---
Pretty easy to remove from the sound files, I did it for the sound the game makes when you press E but nothing is close enough to interact with.
---
I use a mouse macro to tap E for looting anything I point at, my fingers hurt from the looting lol
---
They are so specific and annoying that I just ignore them. I really don't pay attention to them hardly at all.
---
Awesome, thanks! If someone else wants it that’s in the area though, feel free to give it away locally. Just let me know man!
---
How did you get your walk like that in your thrown room
---
Edit: nvm thought you built that in your camp
---
Okay, I'll message you my PSN hold on.
---
An eyebot exploding can still kill a player regardless of if it was another player that shot it or not, it doesn't count as PvP in regards to the event. So you and your vampire gun spraying around willynilly like a child pissing into the wind is still more than likely getting other players killed and hurting the event progress more than helping it.
---
Great post, I personally always hit Sheepquash and then follow brahamin to protect them from random mobs while team takes care of the beast but harder to do it when solo.
---
Honest question: other than cosmetics, is there a reason to consider changing your underarmor? Do the different styles have different mods? I've modded up my '76 jumpsuit, and I'm just wondering if I'm missing out on something.
---
Agreed, I'm torn.  I think I'll probably wear one of the other ones (either the base, or the armor plated one), and swap out to the +120 lb one for farming. 
---
That 60-90 extra weight, coupled with pack rat and/or bandolier (I always have traveling pharmacy) means I turn into a fully mobile Wal-Mart superstore!
---
Arguable. 
---
Not as good on as many weapons- arguably a waste on many.  It doesn't suddenly give you a whole new set of perks to key off of in addition to ones you already have.

---
It's freaking awesome, I always use that while playing.
---
Great idea to reduce in game caps, hope Bethesda sees this.
---
How about you don’t lob nukes all over the place it’s just a waste of a good missile
---
I know like I wanna give me to my friend my boyfriend and new people so they don’t waste time server hoping to find one like we can literally save them time it suck idk what bethesda thinking like what happened to the tourist like literally not in game at this point just hey you got randomly loot it that could take FOREVER I hope something is done about this
---
Makes note. Stock up on legendary weapons.
---
There's probably also something to be said for how EA must answer to shareholders, whereas Bethesda is privately owned and beholden only to itself.
---
I got a 2shot expl handmade if u want to buy that?
---
The number of creatures that show up can be wildly varying.  I've had it happen before when I was solo and the very first "defend the brahmin" spawned about 5 or 6 bloodbugs, at least 2 or 3 wolves AND a pack of anglers.  by the time I'd killed the bloodbugs half the wolves and the anglers there was only some ground beef left.  other times it's two or three bloodbugs and you're laughin'.  I personally don't even like to try to solo the event anymore, because I'm more likely to fail and robbed other folks of the chance to jump in / help and get rewards.
---
Afraid so. No joy, I must report.
---
You can still sell it....
---
So buyers get a different view to sellers? Awesome.
---
Would love this, have no idea why they assign weight to all these currencies we need to collect a lot of.
---
Shared stash or bank would be awesome.
---
5 times, no badges no smores, i have 3 tent plans though lol
---
Welcome to the game, anyway. Glad you are enjoying it. I'd love to help you guys if you were on PC, but I wish you luck anyway.
---
My boy juice head coming in with a save. Great points homie
---
It's on the fifth floor if you take the stairwell straight up, similar green sign :) It took ages for me to find it too, i figured you had to ring the reception bell
---
I see your point I just hope it gets fixed maybe a long side the legendary vendor on the 16th
---
Immersed 76 players are the worst. Thanks for playing the game though!
---
Duh.
---
My boy shoot down the dumb dumbs
---
With travelling pharmacy (3/3), chems are basically weightless. A made a fresh character, I got to level 13 over the weekend - already have 30 stim-paks stockpiled. 
---
Though I'm playing a sneaky rifle build so most targets die before they see me. 
---
I've been checking C.A.M.P.S. for plans and cheap low-level legendaries. Some dude sold the Acoustic Instruments plan for 25 caps - that dude was my hero for the afternoon. 
---
I actually think the gold mine for player vending might be ammo. The cheapest they can be sold for is 1 cap per bullet. I wouldn't buy 5mm rounds (you can craft 100 per shot), but everything else - if I was lead starved and needed ammo in a pinch, I'd buy it.
---
And let you control our FREEDOM^TM ? Never. This is a FREE COUNTRY, sir, a DEMOCRACY.
---
YOOOOOO
---
I mean, the fact that kids like something and because of it, it's good, isn't a valid argument, no offense.
---
How about letting us sell ones we don’t want in our vending machines and buy ones that we want from other people?
---
😂😂😂
---
Yes. Different faction unders have different SPECIAL modifiers.
---
How much do they cost? (The plans)
---
Once you get past lvl 50 you can do whatever you want with your build, after lvl 50 each time you lvl up you can move a special point or pick a perk card. But you only gain special point up to lvl 50. So I would suggest going to nukedragon (I think that is it) and planning your build there, and they will give you a road map on when to get what perks and such. You don't want to have to make major build changes past lvl 50, because it can be a chore to gain the lvls needed to make major changes.
---
I only run PA in nuke zones and don't run PA perks, so I am not 100% sure. I know that you cant get decent PA until lvl 25. So I would wait till at least that point.
---
Sent request
---
Yea, personally I think best solution is they give us dual wielding pistols perk.
---
I'll tank  a pylon for you too, I'm still trying to get stuff from this event!
---
Yes, different underarmors can be modded to give different stats. Like BoS ones give str/end, raider ones agi/per(i think it was per) etc etc. Check fallout 76 wiki for more details.
---
If the kids give me any peace later I'll get my eldest to join without teaming, see if her account sees differently to mine.
---
Yeah that's what I figured.
---
Grahm has a spawn point near sunshine Meadows so if you really want to get 10 atoms for likely 1/2 hour of work, here you go.
---
Happens a lot in real-time game design where new ideas are implemented, but the already existing content that would match up isn't brought along, i.e. the new personal terminal only showing Dailies that have been added recently (Biv, Scout stuff) and excluding all the Dailies from the base game.
---
That would be like when you could break the enchanting in Skyrim and put "Drain 2 billion health" on a Dinner fork.
---
I definitely shot multiple wolves with a syringer and I also noticed that none registered. Might be another bugged one.
---
Use an X-Cell
---
It only starts at night, so if it's daytime it won't be up.
---
Yeah. If you have a bunch of apparel but no weapons, I usually don't visit. My assumption is that it is clothing I already have. I like to see a balance between weapons and apparel. Having other stuff also hints at being serious. My main  has around 15-20 weapons and 8-10 armor pieces, plus stimpack, chems, mods, ammo. My alt is pure legendaries and has 40+ weapons in stock plus 20ish armor. I usually stock lower value items in the 1-6k range and reserve more expensive items for trades. This is mainly because I have pieces I am looking for and trades help facilitate that and expensive cap items would max my caps out
---
[You are welcome.](https://youtu.be/hqe3MRb3StY)
---
I'm will just have to jump on adventure mode to do it.
---
Getting the ID network stack into the Creation Engine was a huge technical feat. 
---
They also revamped the exterior renderer/lighting as well and being outside and looking around the game is gorgeous.
---
For the future of gaming if studios approach it like Bethesda and plan for the long term it will be good. If they rush helter skelter into something like Anthem it will be bad and a jumbled mess that is hard to recover from.
---
But mostly this is where the Creation Engine shines. It allows Bethesda to get content out there with low overhead/impedance. Bethesda didn't have to fight their engine. They are also better managed than Bioware.
---
Bioware was/is leaking devs, Bethesda has the same people that did Morrowwind/Oblivion/FO3 still working there. Dev retention speaks volume in this industry.
---
Very true, but as someone pointed out, Bethesda had a clear vision and scope of what their game is, and as that Kotaku article clearly showed, bad management and lack of vision was a long time issue with Bioware..
---
I also don't think that Bioware will recover, definitely not with Anthem.. they've lacked a professionalism ever since it was discovered that all that communication early on, was really them just trying to hide their technical failures as long as they could.
---
Destiny 1 fucked up, so did destiny 2 until Forsaken, Division 1 fucked up for a while.. it recovered decently, but still lost most of it's player base. Division 2 seems to be avoiding some of those same mistakes, but still feels a bit boring..
---
This isn't just one or two AAA developer gaffs, we've got a history of players feeling let down, burnt.. it's going to have an effect on what we buy and why. But also on future development..
---
The real question is what the future of gaming looks like? Will Fallout 76 last for years? Will Fallout 5 fail because of 76? Will other games that have nothing to do with this or Anthem feel the effect regardless?
---
I feel like "The Anthem effect" will be a term in the future, maybe for a lack of consumer confidence, or developer mistakes.. they truly make Bethesda look much more professional in my eyes.
---
Reminds me of the time someone was watching me through a window as I slept. They bolted when I got up! lol
---
yeah its very loud
---
I always figured they were suppositories. Either way, I like your idea.
---
As long as they moo I am all for it.
---
Would kill for it to give me lists of other dailies besides those 3. Would like to know if buried with honor or queen of the hunt dailies are available.
---
You can get a buff to different special categories depending on which mod is applied to the underarmor and which faction the underarmor comes from.
---
What fun is it there to dupe?
---
Yes, there are reasons to change your underarmor.   
---
All underarmors come in standard (no mod), treated, resistant, protective and shielded types, with increasing protective values and SPECIAL stat boosts, but the boosts vary by type. For example: 
---
* **Enclave shielded underarmor** has protective boosts of 9/13/5 and increases STR +3 and PER +2. 
---
* **VaultSuit shielded underarmor** has protective boosts of 5/5/5 and increases of STR +1, END +2, INT +2, LCK +2.   
---
The underarmors don't have a minimum level, so it's a huge boost at low-levels.
---
How often does the event occur? Can you just server hop in the same spot to get it?
---
I miss the wounding effect so much. That on a minigun flamer or ripper was nasty in 4
---
If the plans are known just sell em at a cap each that's what I do . It's basically free caps and you already know it so....
---
Same here. I hope they back-fill those in at some point, remembering to do Sweetwater's dialy and the park daily for Mr Fuzzy Tokens is annoying as I'm rarely further west than The Whitespring.
---
Weird.  I have done it twice during the day.  Maybe it started at night and turned day before anyone got there to start it.  Hate how short the day/night is in this game.
---
It'll be an achievement. Ding-dong-ditch your enemies.
---
Can you numerically prove that? Because I don't see much need for armor penetration on a bloodied 2.5x sneak attack headshot laser rifle.
---
If you look at the numbers, a laser rifle looks superior to many of the popular rifles. An auto laser gun has cheaper AP costs than the handmade. An auto laser rifle fires 10.1 rounds per second vs only 7.5 from the handmade. 
---
Surely we are capable enough to do a DPS calculation adjusted for armor values of differing enemy types.
---
I’ve had him spawn at that one, only workshop I’ve ever seen him at but there could be others I guess?
---
I understand completely.   Stash is full, and my carry weight is almost maxed out.
---
Mainly because I've been collecting for both the legendary vendor and player vending.
---
Dumped a lot of armor and previously tested weapons to the scrip machine.
---
I only recently  started roaming the mire and bog - I don't fully know the effectiveness of either the weapons I have, or the new weapons I've acquired, against critters in those areas, thus I don't want dump them...plus I want to keep the ones that have been working so far....
---
Fair enough, I could go and actually set a price on them
---
Plus it would be great against the almost immortal assasins sent/cav armor lol
---
Probably something like that.  I've never had WS or the bunker go hostile on me unless i did something stupid, and I spend an inordinate amount of time in WS.
---
\*bell ringing in the distance\*
---
Don't forget about opportunity costs.  The mats may be free but if you sold them instead it'd be 3c for each lead, 1c for each steel, 3c for each acid (for the gunpowder), and 100c for each violet flux.  It works out to about 0.5 caps per normal .50 round and 1 cap per ultracite .50 round.  
---
On the flip side, the prime 50cal uses around 30-50% less ammo per enemy than a non-prime 50cal so there's ammo savings there.
---
you can. they're on timers per "server" for each location.  I believe it's more than an hour cooldown each.
---
Took me like 5 or 6 times going back to the computer to advance the number. This quest really brings forth the frustration of going to the dmv
---
It will have 3 legendary drillspeeds too!
---
Mire is a great way to test weapons. Lots of big creatures.
---
Yeah i play on xbox and have a full unyielding WWR armor and everytime i join a posting on xbox my carry weight doubles but im still able to fast travel. I just cant sprint. If I join a friend there's a 50/50% chance that i end up being overncumbered.. T\_T
---
The crafting and cost. It's an easy way to blow 2k
---
Some metal and random junk
---
Expect to get one and be happy when you don’t!
---
he sell stuff? ive seen that guy like 4 times over the last week and i just get the talk action so ive been killing him for the stupid holo tape.
---
edit: google fu tells me that two bots spawn one appears with eye bots and thats the one that sells shit, ive never seen one with eye bots.
---
Democracy is non-negotiable.
---
I'm on Xbox too and it's so annoying
---
Per another thread, you can buy the mod plans from the production wing:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a8l1uw/where\_do\_you\_find\_plans\_for\_the\_urban\_operative/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a8l1uw/where_do_you_find_plans_for_the_urban_operative/)   
---
There used to be a wild spawn of the shielded operative plan, but it's reportedly been removed from the game:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bj8pqy/shielded\_operative\_plans\_no\_longer\_farmable/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bj8pqy/shielded_operative_plans_no_longer_farmable/)
---
Players can't damage camps anyway so why lock doors full stop ? I have no locks on my doors if you want to come and grab some water or scrap help yourself there's plenty out there to be looted
---
I'm a level 211, at this point, I wish that we could drop or destroy our duplicate cards...
---
Ha love this idea lol
---
Damn...
---
same - I've gotten everything else I want off him but not the coat.
---
HAHAHAHAHA MY CAMP DOESN’T EVEN HAVE DOORS, YOUR WELCOME 
---
FEEL FREE TO USE ALL THE CRAFTING TABLES YOU NEED
---
I made a new character over the weekend, having a nice neat perk interface was lovely. 
---
Now as I'm opening more and more pack cards, I'm like "great, here comes the clutter".
---
I agree
---
Yeah. I think you are OK just doing it solo. 
---
I was a bit miffed that the time I showed up, took one for the team and let the sheepsquatch kill me, shot some gutsies, and fired at the sheepsquatch, apparently ineffectively, that I got nothing for my efforts off of the squatch. 
---
But that's the way the game works. I wouldn't want some lame player showing up, hiding in the cabin, then collecting a legendary.
---
When i find your camp, I expect you to be on mic with the Fasnacht theme song playing in a loop! The nostalgia! =D
---
1 spoiled vegetable
---
Can you? I used it and it didn't work.
---
Depends on how hard one wants to party. :)
---
Only difference being you can trigger a legendary drop at will instead of relying on random NPC spawns. That makes it more attractive for people who have had a lot of play time in small snippets over months that aren't yet ready to take on a nuked Whitespring.
---
Your hatred of Fallout 76 is...
---
.
---
Toxic...
---
Or 200 from the vendor.  I can wait,  I’ll likely never wear it anyway.
---
I don't mind tanking the 3 as long as folks keep the sheepsquatch busy.  I always change my load out on the assumption I will need Max healing.  Nuka Nut, first aid, and field surgeon!
---
i got this on Adventure mode last night, never logged into Survival ever
---
All joking aside if Legendary Chainsaws are on her list I will be so happy.
---
Ha double plus funny man
---
I was hoping the fridge mod would remove decay entirely. There are some really nice buffs available from food, but it's not feasible to craft this stuff one at a time.
---
The instruments seem to be bugged for many, but the camera ones are not bugged, just super hard to get them into frame. You have to have the name show up on the camera picture (even the generators will do this), the only problem for me is the camera itself is usually bugged so you can't snap a picture at all.  
---
Taking a picture of resource deposits and the generator worked for me
---
I think I'll make a post just for this...
---
That's probably what happened, yeah. 
---
The event *is* called "Campfire Tales" after all
---
There are reports that single-cap sales go to the 10% tax. You might have to gouge people and charge 2 caps to get your cut.
---
Also very good points! I guess this continued trend when you look at games releasing as an initial failure, and later recovering.. Fallout has recovered faster than Destiny 1 and Division 1.. a smoother recovery, like you said because they had a plan in place.
---
I guess when you think about the history of these early failures, I think they lead to Fallout being called a failure sooner (feels like many/most called it a failure from beta or even before).. when it's an example of a faster recovery than games that have come before. Hopefully a full recovery, 90% of the players I've met in game haven't logged in for months.
---
Do you think Anthem will fail? Do you think it needs to? I'm of the opinion they have lost all confidence, they've reacted too slowly.. like you said about Fallout having a plan, I think their lack of plan is glaring.
---
Thanks for your feedback either way!
---
Its just a hoarding thing. Some people NEED and DESERVE to have the best items in the game. So they dupe weapons and sell them until they have lots of caps. Then they use those caps to buy what they want. On the dupe a friends item and keep a copy for themselves. Or worst of all, they dupe items and sell them for cash.
---
The major issue for me is that it leads to power creep as Bethesda feels they now have to up the difficulty to counter the influx of items and the dupers dupe new items to make the game easy mode again. Bethesda needs a system to break the cycle before they add the inevitable power creep.
---
You will ruin my planned bobblehead economy but nobody buys my shit anyways so oh well
---
I used an X-Cell and used a food item to boost me over 5, worked for me.
---
you wont (has been datamined) 
---
here is the list of what you can get 
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bmv494/datamined\_list\_of\_all\_weapons\_and\_armor/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bmv494/datamined_list_of_all_weapons_and_armor/)
---
so you will get alot of wood armor but good news there is legendary scout armor and bone club
---
Sooo true every word. It's like critics were insulting their mother or something..
---
I've found a couple, including the instigating 1 star that is my main weapon.  Yes, that is the best weapon I've found that wasn't a shotty (which I still haven't gotten the hang of using).
---
Are you so enamored with your self importance that you think that the player base is not acutely aware of the issues the game has or had?
---
Harping on them is about as useful as going up to people in the middle of a heat wave saying "How about the heat". It gets annoying fast.
---
If you examine the bobbleheads, it actually says they're supposistories on the bottom.
---
An underappreciated funny from the devs.
---
Hopefully something like that will be a good workaround until Bethesda can fix it!
---
I guess I have to try again.
---
And some diseases cause it to occur faster.  So it certainly can seem like it.
---
I'd 2nd this - pictures of it?
---
on the new personal terminal would be great, vie tried to figure out what has sold too and wasnt able to figure it out lol
---
oh that item sold for 1000 caps, now what was it so i can put another one
---
I had to grab all three AND be the dps against the sheepsquatch because, you know, why would any of the level 100+ people there even remotely help out? My schedule was spam 3 super stimpaks, start shooting with quad auto handmade, spam stimpaks when low, repeat for like 5 minutes
---
Pics and I will pay
---
Does talons affect unarmed weapons or just base fists? Bleeding power fist might be pretty cool
---
About to update my post with a link to the pics. Hold on a second.
---
lol, if its *ALL* of the music, then you should fix your sound settings =P
---
A good build goes a long way.....

---
Though now that over repair was nerfed I wonder how well it will do.
---
Or emulate the idea by cranking up the power requirements on the unit. Double the power in, double the water out. Six times the power in, six times water out.
---
I'm just saying some people get mad over people pointing out the flaws, and that those people shouldn't be ignorant of these issues.
---
WHATS A DUPER like you think I would know being I have been here seen launch hahah nope
---
Yeah I’m not saying to doesn’t work by any means it’s just as a vendor I like giving people really good deals cause I have 1000’s of rounds of ammo I don’t use it’d be cool to put stacks of 20 rounds up for like 10 caps so I could sell 1000 rounds for 500 caps which is still more than I would get dropping it or giving it away and someone would jump on that deal so they get a great deal and I could get some caps, and people could still sell the ammo they think is worth more for more caps. Like 556 and 308 is probably worth 1 cap per round but something like 5mm would be better to sell stacked
---
Todd??
---
I feel you man! Oh the curse of carrying your collection of weapons on you... T\_T Ive fought the queen and farmed Whitesprings with 1000+ / 400+ lbs on me. so...many...times... You just do what you have to do! Haha!
---
I moved my camp this weekend.  It is much larger and more complex in design than my old one.
---
When I spawn in at the camp, it takes significantly longer to render and correctly place objects.  For example, my generator renders where the resource node is, then is moved to the "correct" location, which is at least 30 ft above and to the right of the node.
---
Once that moves, then the resource extractor renders....
---
While all that is going on, no controls are not responsive.
---
As things load, I can start to move, but really sluggish....
---
Once camp is fully loaded, all is normal again.
---
This is on PS4, BTW, but appears the issue is similar.
---
There are not enough upvotes for this
---
Updated with a pic.
---
Hope it gets fixed cuz I dont remember it always being this way
---
100% it can be done in the atomic shop.  Go to emotes, iirc it asks you at the bottom if you want to swap out emotes.
---
man people are jaded against fortnite geez!
---
Dancing was around before Fortnite! crazy i know!
---
Why cant we dance when people are playing music with the instruments we can play?  Many players have built bars with dancefloors
---
we have a disco/mirror ball in game, but no way to disco!
---
It’s been updated with a pic.
---
Which would suggest the theories that it might be influenced by the player's account or area or such might have weight, because I experienced the opposite - at level 170, I've definitely had 6-10 explosives over time (not lucky enough for most to be good ones though), but maybe two two-shots.
---
Could not agree more bud
---
Oh, ok, it seems i misunderstood something, but it's ok now.
---
Also, holding the button that open the map will directly open the social menu. One less button press but a bit longer delay.
---
These make for a great option as well but still ADDED with the OP's  2a, and 2b and the biggest need of #3 which at this point is a no brainer really right lol?
---
PC woes
---
That's a rock fact!
---
LOL yes I noticed that too when I ran through it in power armor!
---
Read my mind on that . Soo many houses I would loved to have tipped or even left a note
---
If you willing to  ship I'd buy
---
Everywhere is easy as stealth rifle/commando. It's a cake walk. Even in haz or PA. Only downside since mine is a vats heavy usage, I pound thru fusion cores so fast.

Same exactly what I'm seeing. Flying targets force me to use my ranged to kill. I would like to try vats on a sbq now that the comment says it works . I've never been able to vats her during melee. I am able to vats the sheepshuish monster all day which is a huge bonus for me on solo treks
---
I've been finding broken ones in random loot boxes after I found the tourist. Tried taking it for my friend but it gets destroyed upon drop
---
I’m definitely willing to ship for sure. Anything to get it off my wall to be honest. All I ask is if you just wait till tomorrow for me to ship it to you.
---
Pointing out bugs that need fixing is one thing. The trolls who say they have left, but can't seem to leave this place get old. The ones who chime in and complain that people who enjoy the game must be Bethesda shills. 
---
If you're done with the game, offer your rant on the way out, then please don't come back.
---
I've had to relog in order to get some pics to work, even when the camera shows the location. It works once i come back in
---
Ditto here
---
I was kinda hoping Vault 51 would introduce the Zetan Aliens info the game
---
Area 51 = Vault 51
---
It is. But instead of complaing they write posts 12 paragraphs long and title it "my ideas on how to make the game better" so its a trade off complaining that goes nowhere or a very detailed list of wishes void of any technical details.
---
Caps come easy enough as well though. To ease that, just raid a place with enemies (that aren't ghouls) and sell their weapons. Like Morgantown airport or the mole miners in the Ash Heap. The weaker the enemy the faster you can gather weapons to sell.
---
They are not, sadly
---
Fair enough lol
---
Ya
---
Yeah, cause selling stuff to robot vendors is the only income that exists.
---
I think part of the problem is half the player base is playing bloodied builds. I'm not super thrilled to have to be the one to tank a pylon: with 1 END and 80% radiation it doesn't often end well. Still, I find myself in that situation whenever I go.
---
Marsupial is hands down the #1. But Speed Demon, Grounded and Healing Factor can duke it out for the next spots.
---
Selling long time ago duped items and junk. it's the only way
---
&gt; Do you think Anthem will fail? 
---
I hope not. I hate to devs losing their jobs and gamers losing their investment in the game (time and $). 
---
&gt; Do you think it needs to?
---
No. Despite the global collective REEEE of YouTube talking heads there is nothing wrong with looter shooters or multiplayer games. The issue is the way they seemed to be backed into a corner with no real plan. Purely a crisis of managements creation. 
---
Like I said the devs and gamers should not bear the cost for a management mistake.
---
My favourite quote.
---
I will try this, thanks!
---
No life. No job.
---
It's funny I an bloodied unyeilding and my strength is thru the roof. 30+ strength and when I have all 3 slugger perks AND the iron fist perk, my bloodied super sledge is still weaker than my bloodied pwr fist or even boxing glove
---
OMG DO YOU KNOW HOW FRUSTRATING IT IS like I own one but my friend just got fallout and I’m server hoping for hours still nothing I have found three from just randomly looting  bethesda like 
---
Hello we add in a new camera for everyone but after a few days after release  we make this camera cease CEASE TO EXIST have a wonderful day
---
My inner 12 y/o is rolling on the floor giggling at the thought of inserting bobbleheads in your special slot.  I may need an adult.
---
I need longcoat too
---
Its a survival game. So u want there to be zero risk? 🙈
---
I like that idea too tbh. Anything to get rid of spare cards
---
That doesn't solve the problem. The community needs to stop coming up with back end fixes for Bethesda's shortfalls.
---
this is obvious answer, duper will downvote
---
The drill is like the fo76 "bankrupt/lose a turn" sections of wheel of fortune
---
You probably have duplicates of every card in the game at this point 😂
---
Stick them with the pointy end! jk
---
Huntersville is also pretty good, and once you finish Mayor for the Day you can kill the level 50 robots with very little effort.
---
“Take a picture of Grahm and the Responder Bot Traveling vendor buying lemonade at Mr Squeeze’s stand, in a rad storm while Grahm is a 3 star legendary”
---
They have Anti Armor Rounds.
---
The thing is man I still actively play the game and want the best for it, I'm just pointing out something annoying with the community.
---
You know you can fast travel straight to someones camp.i did that alot since they set up vending machines.even if your a new player you can get caps and fast travel to the otherside of the map at level 1😅
---
Thanks. Still not working for me for certain animals, even when the animal name appears. Not sure what is happening.
---
This is an issue that's currently planned to be addressed in [patch 9.5 at the end of the month](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/5v7FIGaz3bakvwrXsOZerZ/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-the-purveyor).
---
Roofs take up obscene amounts of your budget, replace as much of them with floors as you can
---
Are you f*cling serious?? This crying sh*t on reddit has to stop
---
Yeah, it doesn't help that coal seems kind of rare (only a couple deposits in some mines) and dogwood get's scrapped into regular wood when you scrap all junk (really needs to be added to the protected list of stuff like hardened masses were).
---
I died a little inside when they nerfed Weapon Artisian.  I loved my chainsaw so much.  =(

&gt;constant stuttering, lag, crashes, and the inability to even buy stuff from the vendors
---
I've played for over 600 hours and I don't experience any of those things.  Shrug.
---
That's a good idea. I love the perk card system in 76, but changing them out can be a pain
---
Oh, Ok
---
Yes, agreed.
---
Should have about 248dmg with a semi auto hm
---
if they weren't dangerous then their trash-talk would just be sad. they have the best trash talk
---
Yeah, before you figure out where to find coal and dogwood (and then there's the period of going "I just harvested dogwood, where'd it all go" and then eventually realizing it scraps it when you scrap all junk).
---
Sometimes more than one
---
At first I saw a couple camps with multiple habitats and Im all like ‘wow people really like these things.’  I have four in my camp. I realize why.
---
Edit: They are all named Prince.   
---
Edit: I used the kissing emote.
---
This goes too far.
---
Drop off your junk before you do the events?
---
Again it isn't saying here is an issue, or this broke etc...
---
It's the harping. It isn't productive and it is annoying, and since it is annoying don't be surprised when people react in annoyance. It's human nature.
---
Confirmed, did just that and sure enough the buggies didn't show up. So another question. Does the wet burn or is it garbage? I've had cases where several players show up at the perfect moment where the waves start and it increases the counts dramatically. Since they just showed up they don't have any wood so it's me that needs to feed the fire. I try to continue collecting wood after the event ends but it's limited at best. I do really like this event after having grind a thon to get the 8 tokens. I'm working on my next 8 now because it is an event I can really enjoy plus I've got enough food to feed the server.
---
I love knee capping all the glowing ones and letting everyone else help finish them off so I can conserve ammo. 
---
Same for low level, just aim away from legs and cripple but not kill.
---
OP asks for help, receives help, then complains more....
---
Why die at all? We can just be junk haulin' gods, one shotting everything in the game. No justifiable reason to have consequences for dying. 
---
Really, I want the game to be so easy that it plays itself for me. Would be like watching a never ending post-apocalyptic soap opera, I could stop having to use my thumbs.
---
Or something.
---
If I'm with my bloodied autorifle character, I can probably outdps half of the other people there who don't run similar build. I can also tank the pylon for about two seconds. If I'm joining there, you see the sheepsquatch HP visibly decrease while I shoot, and ceases to do so while I reload. I'm put to better use waiting to strike down and clearing the mobs before they get near than being a conduit. If I'm on my tank character obviously I'm gonna go after the pylons.
---
My point is, not everybody who stays away from pylons is stupid dick.
---
Ya it does seem to vary from person to person. Im just saying even if you dont experience these issues, doesn't mean they dont happen.
---
I don't hate the product. I hate the fact that a company will sell lies and is defended blindly for doing so. It's not blind hate to call out a company for breaking the law. Geeeeeze.
---
True. Their bite is worse than their bark.
---
I agree with your basic theory that Bethesda isn't Stupid, they have to know about the currently common methods of Duping that is being used, and even hot fixed one of them last week, but the other (Unpatched) isn't one that allows for Mass Duping, and players still have to spend Caps to Acquire the Duplicates, which serves a couple of purposes from Bethesda's perspective.
---
1. Allowing the current method of Duping to continue introduces a limited influx of high level weapons &amp; Armor into the game, while also siphoning a significant amount of Caps out of the game, which in the long term actually helps to stabilize the game economy.
---
2. Stabilizing the game economy will satisfy more players than anything else Bethesda can do at this time, as this will allow players who have not been able to acquire really good items from RNG to purchase them without spending real money on Ebay, or their entire cap inventory on a single weapon.
---
I don't believe Bethesda has any way of monitoring player Inventories, and I would be upset to find out they do, since they claim they cannot replace Lost items that mysteriously disappear from players inventories &amp; Stash, as I have had this happen to me on more than one occasion.
---
Several Players that I know recently got involved in the duping business, after previously avoiding any interaction with known dupers for a long time, simply because it was so easily available, and "Everyone else was doing it" with no consequences, and with the firm belief that Bethesda had to know about it, and simply didn't consider it important enough to stop, or allowed it intentionally for the reasons stated above.
---
For a long time I tried to avoid any trading with players I suspected of duping, but after a while I came to realize that the game was so saturated with Duped items it was impossible to do any trading without the possibility of the items you were getting being Dupes, so I simply gave up, so I continue to Buy, Sell &amp; Trade whatever I have &amp; don't need for Caps, or other items I want, and no longer concern myself with the origin of those items.
---
I was rather hoping to give out the specifics in order to kick the need to fix it into high gear. Make it so widely known that it becomes a priority
---
There has to be at least 1 bad thing that happens from character death
---
I run into this all the time...I get there, run to the pylons first, make sure they're powered up, while spamming stimpaks, then jump on the roof to continually shoot her until one of the pylons goes down, then repeat.  Once in a while another person will grab a downed pylon, but mostly they just continue to shoot her while she's invulnerable.  It's super annoying.  When I do the event with my teammates, one grabs the pylons while the rest of us just keep firing on her.  The one doing the pylons will get hits on her when they're all powered up, but concentrate on keeping those going.  And we make sure to keep an eye out on that teammate in case they go down and need a stimpak.  I've gotten to where I won't even do the event unless I'm with them anymore.
---
Well, i've been collecting balistic fiber using mainly 3 locations : Radio tower in the forest, Camp McClintock and a location in the north where they seems to have been filming a cooking show. Shhh! It's my secret spot. But all i know is that there was no dot over there on the map, unless i missed it.
---
Probably referencing the new imposter and real sheepsquatch.
---
I've seen a couple at R&amp;G station
---
Or just plan your construction before you build. The guest will spawn at the location you drop your camp at. Don't move it until you finish construction so you know where not to block. People spawn on my porch right in front of all 4 vendors. Makes for a pleasant shopping experience.
---
Had the same issue at the camp fire event. Only the cave cricket wouldnt register. There are a bunch at Tanagra town in the top of the tower. They work.
---
vampiric works awesome on my buzz blade, over repaired
---
"8k caps"
---
"high value weapons and/or armour"
---
Yeeeah... ok.
---
Sell lies?
---
You can always sue them for false advertising. Can't you?
---
You can't. Sorry.
---
Personally can't wait for all of the "I NEVER DUPPED PLEASE UNBAN ME BETHESDA" posts lol. We will have much popcorn on that day my friends. Let me tell you
---
Yet here you are :)
---
I saw last night that someone made a Google doc of them here on the forums. You can search for that and it may help
---
ETA found it https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/comments/bnxk5b/a_checklist_for_the_merit_badges
---
Eh. I might agree you if the dropped junk issue prior to Survival Mode was PVP related only, but it was on any death, so no.
---
Always was a part of dying, still will be.
---
Thing is I don't think anyone is ignoring them? Each person is going to have a different tolerance to these issues, and what they consider game breaking isn't going to be spot on the same across the board.
---
I fully agree that these issues need to be addressed. But another issue with this sub is that if somebody can get past the issues they're a "fanboi" and if they aren't they're "toxic." How about neither? Labeling people is a sure fire way to get a cold shoulder (not saying you are, but it happens loads in this sub).
---
If Drills had an effect that panic'd robots I would love to have one and chase the Watoga 'bots around while muttering shit talk at my monitor.
---
\*crosses fingers\*
---
With one account, one character that can craft serum, even single recipe, one friend and four mule characters you can make 6k daily from vendors easily, even if you purchase the materials so its not 7k daily. You help each other out and each of you makes 6000 in fifteen minutes.
---
Yeah, maybe, but then don't crouch *before* interacting as well, or I might miss you.
---
Honestly in game. I had a guy message me asking and I hadn't even started the quest, so I started it with him and we pounded it out then and there
---
when you die you have to decide if it is worth it or not to go back.. makes the game interesting...
---
You can purchase the mod plans, but have to purchase the underarmor itself in order to mod it.
---
This is true.
---
Woah is this post plucked from a time capsule from 4 months ago?
---
Weve moved on past this rhetoric. Want to complain about the game? Go to r/fallout.
---
I have seen examples of people who call critics who were upset with state of the game, "toxic", and I feel labeling solid criticisms as such is wrong.
---
:-)
---
The warehouse walls have screen windows. It's the only unbroken option.
---
I would rather they fixed the spawn points..
---
You are getting so much damage beacuse you're only goddamn commie and those rounds are blessed by uncle Sam and made of Pure capitalism!! *United States anthem intesifies*
---
Neither of those statements are true  
---
1.I didn't ask for help I asked Bethesda to stop making challenges unreasonable  
---
2.I didn't complain in my reply, I was skeptical about this method of mob spawning
---
And if you think I ignored the advice I can tell you the first thing I did after hearing about this method was immediately go and try it, I still haven't managed to get grahm to spawn but I'm not giving up yet
---
There’s a perk card (I forgot the name but I have it equipped) that reduces the cost of fast travel.
---
Wood, Metal, and Brick have no glass, but the windows aren't visibly broken either.
---
Okay, good. I was worried about that one. Thank you for clarifying.
---
And we finally have the rest of the back story on the reason the nukes were launched. One Fox and one MSNBC viewer just couldn't resist smashing each other. This makes us stronger for sure.
---
The metal building set doesn't seem to have broken windows. I'm not sure if there's even glass in them, but it looks cleaner IMO
---
Want to complain about the game? Leave the subreddit for the game. Also, my post was about the people who ignore the issues in the game. And also you've proven my point that some cant accept this game has flaws.
---
Normally I would advise people like you to change bad habits to adapt to the world they play in. But with this most recent patch, Bethesda is totally willing to change the world to adapt to your bad habitats.
---
Honestly, there were very simple things you could do to protect yourself from PVP players, or at least mitigate the damage they can deal. But people refused to change. And why should they? They can just complain on Reddit and Bethesda will change the game for them. Arguments on what you should or shouldn't do are now irrelevant. They will do anything to appease the majority of the player base. They want more opportunities to get your money.
---
&gt; Is there any way to build with unbroken windows?
---
Vault 76 dwellers were conditioned in isolation to throw rocks at windows.
---
Unless you're a perma-sneaky who doesn't appear on the map :)
---
Agreed but it does make it even more in demand I guess.
---
Legendary super sledge is what I’m hoping for
---
So you either go lvl 21 or get incredibly lucky and get the lvl 91?
---
Because I keep getting level 61 Albino Deathclaws from that spot.
---
Whiskey and Fury help a lot, in addition to the tips below.  Don't go nuts with them or you'll wind up addicted, which saps STR. But if you're going in to raid somewhere, downing those first will make you a monster.
---
For PA, the only one that really (in my experience) helps is the one that makes fusion cores last longer. PA is so sturdy by itself that I don't know if there's much benefit in Power Patcher. Fixer Upper is good to have when you need to repair it.
---
Is there not plans to make the armor itself. Say like the Brotherhood Soldier or Marine Wetsuit?
---
You've just made me realize that the Broadsider is also in the 'ranged' loot pool... And honestly I'd rather have the drill.
---
I need a radio to play this music for my camp/shop!
---
I accept it has flaws. I just dont bitch 24 7. I like the game and dont care what anyone else thinks of it. It's a fucking awesome game to me. Nuff said.
---
jump in and start playing!
---
Thanks :)
---
And that is completely fair of you. And I feel the same about the game for the record.
---
I just got back on F76 over the last few days after not playing since maybe December-ish. I was shocked at the new challenges. It used to be things like “collect 20 wood” “break down 10 aluminum” “kill 5 mole rats”. Now it’s like half insane photography challenges and other half super grindy. And all for what, like 10 atoms. I was lucky to get the 10 yesterday for “build 5 camp objects”
---
Yep, l do a lot of scrolling when I have to switch out my perks around. 😅😅😅
---
Yes I love the taste of the Magazine's crisp pages. I'd love to savor them longer. More seriously that sounds like a great idea.
---
Been asking for this since week 1. Hopefully they’ll add it soon.
---
Good news! There are 2 skins for the Handmade in the game files: Gold and Silver. As for when those'll be released... no idea.
---
I actually tried this the other day. Switched to a Bloodied Rolling Pin instead of my usual rifle, and.....oops, one shot it instantly.
---
I did feel like a dickbag :/
---
I agree my BoD brothering! Good luck with getting your Mammologist Merit Badge - Ever Upward!
---
Fair point. I forgot that everyone uses a bloody build which is a whole other topic.
---
I don’t believe Patch 9 reverted anything.  I posted a theory that they purposely reverted it to see who was going to do it.  Took names, watched carefully, and next week I think a lot of people are gonna lose their accounts for good.
---
I didn't even see that. Wow, well played haha
---
I recently learned that quantity is better than quality for sneak crits, was using black powder but you can often land 5-7 handmade shots before most enemies notice you, dropping super mutants in seconds (only time i ever praise lag is in this game lol)
---
They are not saying that the entire player base does this only a small subset. Also what does self importance have to do with it?
---
I wouldn’t mind like a little death claw plush or maybe a chibi Scorch beast plush
---
Maybe they just forget about it since people damaging homes was so recent.
---
As someone who commonly uses TSEs, explosive perks are most definitely worth it. If you combine it with rifleman perks, it’s how you make the most of the rifle
---
Travel Agent
---
I price mine at about 350 depending on my mood. They don't sell that fast, but It doesn't bother me, I sell to turn a profit not to sell fast. I am just happy to be able to only have to sell 3 items to basically max the vendor cap limit.
---
Whats the best weapon for them. I agree that they as well as the fat one are tough. I've taken a half dozen sheepsquatch solo but give me 3 or 4 gutsys at a time and I end up running to get my shit together .
---
Grind some caps and buy the plans from Grafton train station (lever action) or Free States Vendor in Whitesprings (handmade). 1800 caps or so base price before hard bargain and grape mentats. Make a bunch for xp them break them down for mods. You’ll be waiting a lifetime for them otherwise, but by level 25 you can start building and modding both.
---
Maybe its time OP goes back to fallout 4 now...or man the fuck up. If you cant store your junk then stop crying
---
There is no need to be hoarding 300 lbs junk
---
Imo they could make us drop some aid also when dying
---
Is that how the inspecting works?
---
I dedicated Sunday to grinding this sucker to death, and loved it. I did notice that sometimes I had to check my special stats to realize I had been awarded a token. After a dozen or so I checked thinking I only had 3 from completed events and found I had 11. Winning! Then to top it off got the weight capacity mod and experienced the "already learned" bug so I have the plan and don't need it. Man it was a good day in the wasteland. I'm determined to get each mod now so I can carry a back pack of each type and swap out as needed for the situation. I can't see needing to have a 465lb carry limit, along with 4 pieces of 20% weapon weight reduction armor. So if you factor in the weight of weapons now I can carry like 1600 lbs if it's mostly weapon weigh.
---
1600 lbs is 726.4 kg
---
Empath, but only if you play solo.
---
Well until then,  you could build a radio tower, put a siren at the top and leave it on constantly. 
---
You know, just a gentle reminder it’s the apocalypse, and everything is trying to kill you.
---
Man I’ve been looking for a right leg with that perk for months. I only have four of five pieces but I still get occasionally encumbered
---
Even if they gave us loadouts it would be an improvement
---
Would be great. Awesome suggestion since zines not so hot atm
---
Then we can be pals ! If you're kn xbox add me up. DRIVEINKILLER
---
If it was a single bot talking about morgantown thats not it. The trader has two eyebot guards and a pack bhramin.
---
Since I struggled with the melons I've planted about a dozen of them at my camp for public consumption. I just hope people only take the 3 they need as they seem to be slow growers and no reason to screw anyone else.
---
It is exactly how it works, unlocked yesterday.
---
Yea, I've met a few of them already :)
---
I'm a melee build - the first time I crossed paths with a hermit crab, it ate me for lunch.
---
Hey man I'll get back to you
---
Thx kind of you!
---
Yeah thats exactly what i mean - great example!
---
We are living an endless Halloween as far as I know.
---
no
---
My only weapons are an Instigating Hunting Rifle and a Dragon... So I hang back, stand up, give the follow emote if necessary and only start shooting once I've lost the Instig and sneak bonuses. \*thumbs up\*
---
Of course, I've lost more than a few legendaries to assholes taking advantage of this to one-shot it themselves, but eh. Better than *being* the asshole.
---
That... sounds like something I would do.
---
Are there multiple campfire tales missions maybe? The campfire tales mission I complete every time I log in is over by the nuns cola factory. Up on the hill. 
---
That missions has you “face the shadows” by breaking the cardboard cutouts,  then emote, eat, or drink,  then pick dry kindling which automatically feeds the fire, then search for the lost campers belongings, then the camp counselor “visits” . But what you’re saying is completely different than the mission I have been doing and completing solo every time. So there’s obviously something lost in translation here.
---
I have this 3* Troubleshooter’s mini gun - wonder if it’s any good for Encryptid - 25% faster fire rate, can’t remember the 3rd *.
---
Bloodied will still beat out Zealots and Hunters vs SBQ though.  I just have a 1* primed 50 cal Bloodied for SBQ fights on my one bloodied toon.
---
I will
---
Y'all are just incredibly awesome! Thanks ✌️😎
---
Next one would be Fourth of July, FREEDOM DOWN WITH COMMIES and all that for a few days I’m sure. I mean I can see that as America would be real patriotic during pre war times or atleast that’s what the Chinese would think
---
Go for a Perception / Luck build. Try using VATS and go for the head every time so you can kill multiple enemies before they reach you. Also, take Gun Fu from Agility tree. Basically, gives you bonus damage against your next target while in VATS . Adrenaline might help, too.
---
It's just Demolition Expert, right?
---
So it's the rank % times the 20% base from explosive, if I understand it....i.e.:
---
- 24%
---
- 27%
---
- 28%
---
- 30%
---
- 32%
---
....extra damage. Or am I working this out incorrectly? Any advice appreciated.
---
I'm not

I believe that this week’s glitch opening up was already a trap.  No one seems to share my sentiment but it seems like a legitimate way of thinking considering they patched it so quickly.  Three or four days leaving it open and monitoring who did it.  Patch this week removes everything that was duped along with accounts.
---
Yeah, I accept that. Fusion generator gets you a bigger output than the smaller generators
---
Nice pickup. I'm on the prowl for a BE .50 now.
---
There's gotta be SOME sort of penalty for dying... come on now. 
---
And this is coming from a guy who has ZERO desire to play survival mode. 
---
No penalty on death means... well... why bother dying at all? Just make me damage proof.

Let's face it, nobody in their right mind is going to buy .38 and .44 rounds at the same 1:1 price that they do with 5.56 and .50 rounds. Bulking the lower caliber ammo together and selling it for a reduced rate (e.g. 2 rounds/cap) would still allow you to sell it to players.
---
Look I agree with that and think text chat should be added, but the simple fact is that Bethesda is in no way obligated to accommodate those people.   Would it be a public relations win? yes, would it make them more money? maybe but as a company it's their choice to do it or not as it just might not be financially viable for them and you really can't expect to force them to do it . If those people can not play the game they should make a stand and not support the company and try and change their mind, not legislate that games should be inclusive for everyone with every possible disability.
---
I just asked someone after doing an event and he was super awesome and helped me out.

How is it so hard for you to take a rad-x and suck it up?

I’m pretty sure it’s from the base damage if the gun
---
Percentages go up: 
---
20%
---
30%
---
40% 
---
50% 
---
60%
---
The damage of the gun goes up the more you rank up the perk card
---
Try 799 with hard bargain and full unyielding gear.
---
It actually confuses me why people lock doors in the first place. There’s no benefit unless you’re protecting crops, which is less than 2% of people.
---
They do more damage to metal armour, though, no?
---
Not that i don't believe you but I am definitely checking that out tonight the small details in this game amaze me sometimes
---
Gonna be tough to fit it in my build, that I know :/
---
Oh that is diabolical! Hey, Welcome! No! GET OFF MY LAWN! O.o
---
Now I wonder if it would count multiple ticks if you grabbed more than one conduit and if they count when you’re down.
---
I already know how it's going to go though, I'm just asking for them to remove useless effects. So chill yourself.
---
Prime ultracite Gatling laser. With power user, ammo is cheap it hits hard and I get to shoot green lasers everywhere.
---
If it's okay, I'll friend you tonight and you can hit me up anytime you see me! Some of these challenges are so much easier with help.
---
The game scraps 1 bulk item not the whole stack uses what you need and leaves the balance in your inventory.
---
I saw it (letters and signs are one plan) at the BOS vendor-bot in Watoga a couple of days ago.
---
I think the cost was 9700 depending on charisma.
---
6 days since update x 150 per day. Couple times I had to leave 2 or 1 scrip left because lowest armor piece is 3 scrips.
---
It has no effect. Melee already has a 100% chance when in range.
---
I upvoted so you can get out of downvote land 😂😂😂
---
I think that is the one that worked for me. 
---
"Crumpled fedora" may be the one that doesn't work.
---
Wow so... I should bulk literally everything I can because that seems like it makes the most sense???
---
Free atoms getting hard to achieve? Looks like a market strategy. I mean aliens, looks like aliens, Bethesda couldn't do it.
---
Pretty sure they patched that recently, I've tested it recently and it made a difference for me.
---
Watoga Station near SBQ/Site Prime. Lewisburg Station near Encryptid event. Problem solved
---
Wish they’d have a huge towering General Gutsy boss with rocket launchers and fat man nukes that comes out at the AWOL Armaments. Would be a nice challenge... &gt;:)
---
Lmfao literally I was thinking about all The trolls People could do with selling junk to People then throwing them off a cliff and getting the junk back and caps
---
I don't even want to use it, unless the power armor on the shelf is also for sale.
---
Let's face it: People are doing it now.
---
Maybe not constantly as you don't need to restock every day, but it does sell. I've already sold 1000 Plus lower caliber ammo a few times and have even bought a good chunk (somewhere around 2,000) .45 rounds on a 1.1 basis when I was out of supplies to craft my own. No big issue. At the end of the day no one is forcing anyone to buy.
---
That said, I would have no issue being able to set specific quantities of ammo at specific prices where it would be les than 1:1
---
I'd take monopoly "Go straight to the jail, do not pass go, do not collect $100" over another drill :p
---
I'm having a problem with the building next to her tralier, where you have to open the doors with hacking terminals. I did this quest last night and was all up in that building. Walking on the water reservoirs and the whole outlook posts they made to protect it. Now today, all the terminals are broken and I can't get inside that building to loot. Wtf
---
What I did when I switched over to rifleman is find perks that you absolutely do not need and that you can live without. Gonna be tough but totally worth it lol
---
I completed it after been stimpacked because I went down mid-battle. So most probably a timer.
---
I love that cheesy backfire/explosion it does at the end. It's so gaudy, but at least you really only need to visit the machine about once per day.
---
Most of my CAMPS are wide open... or have "character locks" in a couple of places.. but there's always a way out.
---
My Creeper camp has a couple of locked doors in it for sure... but... the point being, if you want to know why,  you're gonna have to figure it out yourself.
---
I'm melee/vampire primary and sniper/executioner rifle secondary.
---
Drawback right now is I recently started in the mire and bog  - while the executioner rifle I have works on L50 SBs, it does not work so well against multiple L80s simultaneously....or hermit crabs, so I have to find a new rfle for them.
---
Welcome to the VATS sniper's dilemma.  I'd recommend getting concentrated fire so you can get VATS headshots or leg shots to cripple enemies, but you're very rarely going to be able to do enough damage to kill everything before getting spotted, especially against super mutants or anything with armor.  I'd also recommend one good sniping rifle and one good single fire battle rifle for dealing with close range problems.
---
The challenges are only there so they can say "you can earn all the atoms free ingame"
---
A great resource, but in no way the authority. Laser rifles, for example are missing an automatic barrel option. Also, many of it's calculations seem to differ slightly from my own. That site also fails to take into account headshot damage, vats costs, or potential vats damage.
---
I did just find the enemy selection option though. I will have to play around with that to see how it works.
---
how many friends do you have that could honestly be the issue
---
just go to the lake in the pioneer camp next to the lan and throw a granade at your feet, let someone revive you, let them go the same
---
Oh nice!  This seems a lot more doable.
---
For the same reason that cave crickets have the same tankiness as a radscorpion.  They're completely out of balance with everything else.
---
Until they can "solve the problem" I would take that over the temporary fix of "player messages you" asking you to come back. And I would much rather have this feature now, which was already delayed since April.
---
To be fair that one would be worth 20 Atoms.
---
Did you happen to have vending machines added during that time? 
---
Apparently, items tagged for sale take up some camp budget in addition to stash weight.
---
Without seeing your build the things I always see people doing wrong for sniper:
---
Not having Escape Artist Perk
---
Not having Sneak maxed
---
Not using a silencer
---
Also not using PA makes you squishy af.  Make sure you take some talents to help.
---
Lone Wanderer (its embarrassing I have to put this here but people will always go dps before defense)
---
Barbarian (if you have str perks to spare, not common)
---
Blocker (godly for any spec)
---
Evasive (if you have agi to spare, this isnt common)
---
Oh and If you are using vats GunFu will help a ton.
---
so what would you replace dieing to NPCs with?
---
I'm the person that's always about 30-60 seconds late from the notification time so I can drop off my junk. Then I show up in stealth and grab a pylon if I can. Sometimes the pylon will be taken the whole time, and those are the quick, good days. Other times, I have to grab two or all three. I haven't had a failed one since the first week, though.
---
I like it because of the easy inventory management. I'm a terrible hoarder in the game and I'm always slowly making my way around Appalacia because of it. The bulking makes inventory management easy especially since I can sell what I don't need except wood vendors will not take wood.
---
I also always have 200+ plastic which makes this possible. I do not bulk plastic it cost 12 plastic and only gives 10 that feels wasteful
---
yea the red bone raider looks exactly like the yellow versions but with red highlights instead of the red. looks a bit more "raiderish" imo. im just using the exca about two times per week when i get lead. but this has to look cool! \^\^ anyone remember the price of the yellow bone raider skin? was it 800 atoms?
---
Thanks for pointing that out. The loot always goes to everybody in the team event, but the xp doesn't share unless you get a tap in.  Personally, it's trying to find the bodies of elites that's an issue sometimes. 
---
If it's a team Whitespring run, yeah, definitely agree!
---
We have all tried the “toe-stubbing”. But this is new level drunk
---
I hadn’t really heard the phrase “immersed players” before, so I’m not 100% sure what that’s about even after googling a bit. Til now I had only heard of immersive game content.
---
So if you’re up for telling me more, I’m always up for learning something new...
---
It’s interesting, to me, that the mutations involved are Adrenal and Bird Bones. The reason for this is they are alphabetically the first two mutations.
---
The reason I point out this alphabetical nuance is because I lost two pieces of armor while fast traveling in PA- both were Assassin pieces and both were alphabetically first in my armor lineup.
---
This suggests to me that perhaps the game alphabetically records inventories and something happens where the first item simply vanishes and then something else alphabetically takes its place. 
---
ie in this situation Adrenal is ignored/dropped and then Bird Bones somehow manifests as its next on the list for possible mutations.
---
Sounds crazy yet here it may be again...
---
Haha! Excellent...
---
I could help you out
---
No idea who.  Still doesn't change my response -- the possum badge challenges aren't that tedious. They are great, lengthy content -- something for which the community was asking.
---
Haha Normie player I see.
---
It was 1000.
---
None, I only play alone, so I don't think that's it
---
Nope. No matter how much you replace them with new glass, some idiot has to lob a nuke and the shockwave breaks them.
---
great!!!! ill try that after work, thank you very much
---
Alright so looks like I’m bulking everything besides plastic then lol because I’m constantly over encumbered because I’m addicted to looting everything/everywhere. I’ll get distracted as I’m almost full and I’ll go into like 5 diff places before I unload
---
Endurance perk card for 6am to 6pm STR boost.
---
I’ll pay the 2 dollae shipping :P
---
This is the one thing I've found about the challenges I don't like. It seems odd to force us into perk choices to complete challenges.
---
I guess there are enough choices they felt comfortable with that move.
---
I did Atomics last night, found me a fat man which killed my carry capacity. Then 27 mini nukes crafted (thanks Super Duper) for a total of 200 weight just in those. Had 2 perk points spare, put them in Ordnance Express just so I could move.
---
That said it was doing about 1k damage with only a rank 2 Demo Expert card. Not bad for a Fatman found in FEV on a character utterly under spec'd for the undertaking. It's incredibly fun to use as well. 
---
But now I need to mod the Fatman to complete Atomics, only have Gunsmith 3 as that's all the build can tolerate currently...couldn't find just the mod for sale at vendors though I know I've seen the MIRV mod around. Need at least 3 more levels so I can max gunsmith then get another card to rank 3 for daily use.
---
Charleston Landfill, too. I see him there all the damn time.
---
Yeah I'm getting really tired of running sideways, I gotta say. It looks like when you're walking somewhere you aren't really able to go, like up a mountain or something, but just everywhere, all the time, for no reason -.-
---
I also love this method. It has the added benefit that you can be two or three mobs away then the xp starts streaming in!
---
&gt;My Creeper camp has a couple of locked doors in it for sure... but... the point being, if you want to know why, you're gonna have to figure it out yourself
---
I'm assuming it's something terrible like pictures of Ben Affleck
---
That's not accurate. I've done 3 defences since this challenge went live and have stayed in the area the whole time. He hasn't showed up and I'm bored out of my skull.
---
This time 100
---
But we have a default expression.  Resting bitch face.  Pre-set photomode templates would be nice though.
---
You must feed fire in last part, or it will die and you fail. There is easy version where is vendigo and then there is hard version where 3waves of bugs attack and you complete it after killing legendary radscorpion. While waiting for radscorpoin to spawn you must feed fire manualy and keep egouth dry kindling in your inventory.
---
I've read that you can get all of them ( 0, 1, 2, &amp; 3) at the Observatory NW of Top of the World. But I haven't taken the time to verify as of yet.
---
I do agree but fuck me other games are much worse.
---
ever been on any Train Sim World Facebook group? I'm banned on 2 and one I was muted for 24 hours and admin deleted my post
---
all said
---
group one: anyone thing £20 per dlc is a bit expensive?
---
group two: wow the new dlc is lagging, anyone else having trouble?
---
group three: I'm sick of how this community is so anit criticism. can we all just have this post if none else to discuss it honestly
---
compared to them this is very tame
---
when the event was new you could server hop till you find a server without the timer and then just wait on that server. wouldnt take long and a serverhopping eventfarming dude (or maybe just someone who finished the quest) arrives and starts the event. nowadays there arent really people left with the quest and people know that 2000caps for the chance of a 3\* item isnt worth it. i see the event around one time per week. love the game mechanic during the fight.
---
The size of the one from general atomics Galleria from fo4, But actually a robot... missed opportunity in fo4
---
This is really good to know.
---
I was wondering why sometimes I could inspect the item and other times I couldn't.  I got a nearly perfect lvl 50 light combat chest piece today with -15% animal damage/+1 PER/harder to detect while sneaking.  Very happy I had a dense torso mod ready to pop onto it.  For 800 caps, it was a massive bargain.
---
For now I'm just selling one-star gear for 499 caps to help more casual players get their foot in the door for difficult content.  Unyielding and Vanguard armor pieces, Instigating, vampire and anti-armor weapons, stuff like that.
---
Whitesprings is a real thing.... Greenbriar bunker, near White Sulpher Springs, WV
---
Bunker complex build under a hotel during the cold war, where the gov't was to relocate if DC was bombed....
---
Was super secret, not now.  But I'd wasger IRL even now, the WS area would be toast.
---
this pic look familiar?
---

---
Fixed! 😄
---
What workshop is this?
---
Are you referencing a **laser rifle** with a **Sniper Barrel**? Because those barrels work just like they did in Fallout 4 to the best of my knowledge, meaning that they have a long recharge time between doing full damage. If you listen, after each shot you'll hear *tick... tick...  tick...* At each of those ticks, you're reaching a new damage threshold, so the fire rate on them is quite a bit slower. You *can* fire them faster, but you're doing a lot less damage per shot after the first shot. It's actually better for dps to use a regular long barrel if you want sustained fire. It's more fair to compare it to a gauss rifle (functions similarly but with a charge up while holding down the trigger function) or the Hunting Rifle. 
---
Separate post going over this:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a42csh/heads\_up\_a\_laser\_rifle\_with\_a\_sniper\_barrel\_will/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a42csh/heads_up_a_laser_rifle_with_a_sniper_barrel_will/) 
---
Example with the two highest dps weapons - the .50 cal and Gatling Plasma. These numbers are both taken from a min/maxed bloodied build at 19% HP with prime receivers:
---
Bloodied Gatling Plasma - 340 damage, 92 fire rate
---
Bloodied .50 Cal - 331 damage, 92 fire rate
---
The .50 cal benefits from 45% armor penetration. This is important because the Scorchbeast queen and many other enemies have a significant amount of both DR and ER. SBQ has 300/300. The .50 cal ignores 45% of that, reducing it to 165. This means the DR is almost exactly half of the damage being done. Looking at the damage calculation formula, you'll see that if the DR = 50% of the Damage, the damage is reduced by 36%. If the DR is equal to the damage, it's a 50% reduction. 340 is a bit more than 300 though, so the DR will be a bit less than 50%. It's difficult to calculate the exactly how much unless you have the forumal set up in excel, but I believe 340 vs 300 will be about 47% reduction. This is probably overly generous (too little DR).
---
**Bloodied Gatling Plasma** \- 340 damage \* .53 = **180.2 per shot**
---
**Bloodied .50 Cal** \- 331 damage \* .64 = **211.84 per shot**
---
This may not look huge, but it's a **15% dps difference**.
---
Each of these weapons also has their own perks and drawbacks - the .50 cal has no spinup time, is more accurate with less recoil, the gatling plasma can have a larger magazine size if crafted correctly (1 ultracite plasma core if crafted on a 20+ int character gets 350 shots per core instead of the standard 250), etc. I'd consider them roughly equal if we' re going by raw stats and usability, but because of the lack of armor pen, the gatling plasma falls flat. 
---
You may not think that 15% difference is a big deal, but I assure you that when I use my .50 cal on the SBQ, you can see her HP melting very quickly. This is not the case with a Gatling Plasma.  
---
The Gatling laser is in an even worse spot, since it shoots at twice the speed but does half the damage per shot with no armor penetration.
---
**Bloodied Gatling Laser:** 165 damage per shot, 184 fire rate
---
The damage here is roughly 55% of the 300 ER. If the damage is half the ER, it's reduced by 61%. Since we're a little over half, let's say the reduction is only 59%.
---
**Bloodied Gatling Laser:** 165 damage per shot \* .41 = 67.65 x2 (double fire rate) = **135.5**
---
This is where things really start to look bad. A **25% reduction in damage** vs. the .50 cal.
---
It’s a joke dude, its similar to someone owning a pet rock in real life, no one does it because they are excited about taking care of their new rock, its funny.
---
Lol, I feel your pain we need a hoarders support group on here. I'm over level 160 and still hoard everything.
---
It DEFINITELY works if you’re shooting for a spooky element!
---
That’s awesome! One of the first legendaries I found was an instigating black powder rifle! With 2.5 sneak damage it devastating
---
Can you take a picture of a dead player and get credit, just like another mob?
---
Slightly unrelated, but how soon can you redo this event after you fail it?
---
AA, will reduce armor on most things to nothing and it doesn’t have accuracy issues.
---
Quad is what you really want though on a lever action rifle. It gives you feel of an assault rifle with the damage of a sniper rifle and with Grim Reaper’s Sprint and Gun Fu you can get headshots for days.
---
If you do not use perks you're going to have a bad time.  The weapon will drastically under perform.  It's like buying the base model of a sports car without the flash engine, you will have to lower your expectations.
---
Ive had this happen to me as well. The item renamed itself to an exact name I had customized for a different item. Inventory is really weird, my favorites list is all bugged out also. Favorite wheel shows Anti-Armor Gatling Laser, when I select it it pulls out a Mutant Slayers version. I'm half tempted to just drop items to make things simpler.
---
I have 20agility and speed demon for realy long time, also i am plaing on original PS4. If i run staight for too long, i am on empty place without nothing around. Console is not strong egouth to render everything and i kinda like it, i am flash!
---
Maybe. But that's only another 30 seconds or so...If you don't die in your own 3 second period.
---
I'd just love to see how the base damage increase works out with each rank of demo expert. Was wondering if someone re-did the maths on it since patch 9.
---
Just as a follow-up I read (and ofc can’t find the post) that pipe revolvers will be in Purveyor loot table.
---
Very awesome work. Keep it up!
---
They can be one shotted (or seriously damaged0 if you hit them in the thruster. But you might not have time to sit there and aim with a group of them harassing you.
---
Hope it’s only temporarily for you buddy. Must be game breaking...
---
Honestly have no idea what could cause this. 
---
Haven’t read anything about it yet nor experienced it. 
---
Maybe the other guys theory has something in it?
---
Very tough for a face tank bloodied non-PA player, yes :P
---
Looks like Ironclad's got to go....
---
Just put a mat either in a decon shower for the bloodied builds, or on a radiation emitter to almost instantly kill them
---
Awesome! How did you find out?
---
Anyone had an issue scrapping a foundation after patch 9?  I have several giving me "camp unaccessable errors" we trying to scrap.  Pretty funny when all i have is about 12 fountaions placed.  Only way around it i have found is rebuilding camp.
---
Yes. Of course its still worth it. You don't wanna be the only kid in the neighborhood without one lol. It's like rocking Walmart sneakers when everyone else has Jordans. Joking of course
---
Wanna tell me what’s great about having to fast travel to and then kill 15 different animals with 15 different guns (that you won’t be specced for) to get the hunters badge (with a decent chance the badge just doesn’t register the kill)? 
---
Or what’s great about individual aspects of several of the badges being bugged almost beyond use? 
---
The tadpole challenges were fine, the possum ones are monotonous fast travel simulators with 22 requirements at the high end. Thank god I didn’t have to do them
---
Some people should be griefed,so they understand they have to thank devs for making this game so soft :D
---
Well that was a can of worms I wasn't expecting to open.  The subject of accessibility in games is completely different from what I was commenting about. 
---
I am only discussing game mechanics designed to encourage certain behaviors which is the only scope I'm even remotely qualified to comment on.
---
I've done more than a hundred full clears of the civic center. I've gotten any form of legendary from it...maybe 60 times. Maybe ten 3 stars.
---
In addition to the other reply I just made, I'd also argue that energy weapons are clearly meant to benefit from armor penetration, because they can roll with the Anti-Armor legendary effect, which does literally nothing on energy weapons. Another hypothesis - major gutsies that shoot lasers do far less damage than their ballistic shooting counterparts. I beleive this is because although they both have armor piercing effects added, it only benefits the ballistic version of the gutsy.
---
&gt;if you’re not going to at least take a pylon, don’t show up
---
Healing Factor makes it pretty damn hard to hold a pylon. I literally have to spam stimpacks. Used ~40 stimpacks on my last sheepsquatch event. This is all while sitting in relative safety on top of that building. I do know the nuka perk can give some lovely hp regen but i rarely have the time to prepare for the event. If i'm serverhopping and the event is up i'll just fast travel and help.
---
I know i'm bad at holding the pylons so i try to activate one only if there's no other option left. On the bright side i can deal lots of damage, and i can quickly clean up all the adds by myself  (NOT the bombs) while the impostor is invisible. 
---
I understand your grief but i'm honestly way more helpful in that fight is i don't have to constantly spam stimpacks. (it's also not that useful if i take one conduit and die 30 seconds later).
---
Or does the game work TOTALLY fine when walking sideways? Just curious
---
sorry that that happened to you, truly, but it got me to thinking how it would change up the game if mutations randomly evolved to other mutations. It certainly would add another dimension to gameplay. I'm assuming a lot of players would be curing more.
---
I know it goes against Starched Genes, but adding some randomness like that definitely would add a touch of difficulty and surprise to the grind
---
But....but.....Walmart has been so kind to me......
---
:)
---
But there will be shovel, legendary. Bloodied shovel. Blood everywhere around graveyard.
---
As it is it seems most players don't seem to care about the camp (no matter how much effort it looks like has been put into the camp), they just check the vending machine, the fast travel to the next.
---
I agree 100%.  There is no reason Brotherhood members couldn't "go scorched" while wearing PA if they were exposed to the plague before putting the suit on.  We should have mobs \*using\* some of those legendary weapons, too -- like a Super Mutant with an explosive minigun, or a miner with an instigating melee weapon.
---
I go to where death awaits.  I find hidey spot for stuff.  
---
I go to where death awaits.  I drop stuff on death and lose it
---
I think
---
So
---
I got to where death awaits with much raw fertilizer, HA!
---
I run up to mobs and wait I let them shoot then I whack the baddies to finish them off. Everyone gets a piece of the pie, unless it's a group then I move off so they can have fun, plenty of stuff to do in the world.
---
Thanks for the offer, got someone to help.
---
Do you know how to find it, I am a complete Texan and I need the outfit
---
Yes, and have them guarantee a similar drop! That would be great, maybe have a weekly boss mob that has a certain legendary
---
We need a vault boy “hold up” emote. It’s the biggest fallout meme.
---
Sorry for replying late. I can help. Someone helped me. Add me jeditrex if you still need help.
---
whew boy, where have you been.
---
Probably will eventually end up in the Atom shop for like 800-1000 atoms.... Limited Time!
---
LOL.  The funniest time fast traveling into someone's camp was one built over part of the lake in Toxic Valley, close to Pompy, and I died from toxic water radiation while loading in.  My bag was under their floor, so I actually tracked the person down outside of West Tek, asked him if he could remove part of his floor so I could retrieve my bag, and he was happy to do so and actually apologetic about it.  I kept the ultracite and crystal scrap I needed, but offered the rest up for him to take since he was kind enough to partially dismantle his floating barge.  I bought all of his 5.56 ammo, too.
---
??
---
Yeah, got lucky not to long ago walking over encumbered to Watoga from the SBQ fight and cut through the Sundew Forest. It dropped off a 3* Legendary Super Mutant.  It's great for fighting the Imposter Sheepsquatch too.
---
Never happened to me before, so I have to ask - what were you doing that may have caused it to disappear?
---
Platform?
---
Why one earth would you spend about 2k caps for a 3 star legendary fight? There are a couple neat cosmetic bits, but I'm not actually going to wear most of it...I'm wearing the hat right now purely for the "collect bones while wearing a fedora" bit. 
---
Beyond that ,it's a normal 3 star legendary, which you can get anywhere without pissing away caps.
---
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that not everybody actually knows how to do this event - friend and I went through the quest and... nothing happened at the end, just a dead terminal. No message in the log on the existence of a quest to start the event, or how to start the event, or if that terminal even did anything. Joined in twice thanks to the new in-game notifications and thanks to whoever started it. I only heard you had to volunteer for pylons and to use stimpacks (thanks Reddit) but honestly there's very little information out there for casual non-hardcore players.
---
Samee
---
I feel you on the healing factor. It’s rough, I get a couple point into first aid for it to compensate. But as a bonus if you are a high sneak build you can hold one pylon while hidden without using any stim packs at all.  If you had an extra piece of regenerating, bam none at all.  It only works if there is not chaos of course.
---
Nah, they have AA bullets
---
True - I thought I'd wasted caps on a serum when I took it but hadn't unequipped Starched Genes - but it worked just fine.
---
YES! I was there and was lol the whole time there was screams. Need to have Camp items like in FO4 like spikes, the super mutant blood bags, and other horrendous stuff can spruce up a horror themed camp.
---
I forgot to post it, sorry haha 
---
XBOX
---
Well until then people have been shooting me messages like, "looking at ur 3 str come to your camp plz". But, at the same time it's pretty easy to tell what it is 70% of the time. For instance a Two Shot Explosive would be a Two shot Legendary and it will say in writing right next to the weapon upon viewing it, "Bullets explode for area damage". I don't think that 3rd stars going to be a deal breaker. Bethesda needs to fix it but I'm not going to neglect doing my normal events and such.
---
Almost no one accepts team invites here anymore, and you have to follow the guy with the bloodied melee around to hits before he does.
---
Yes I agree
---
Yes this would be great, bugs me seeing it not lined up.
---
Prime receivers are admittedly useless (or at least prohibitively difficult to maintain) for ammo-chewers, but sniper rifles? You can pry my Prime Hunting Rifle from my cold, dead, slightly irradiated hands. One Whitespring nuke zone run and two or three dead Scorchbeasts gives you enough flux and Ultracite for several days' worth of ammo - I'm more likely to run out of lead than either of those.
---
That said, I think it's pretty obvious that they are planning on buffing them, given the Prime HR buff last patch. (I don't know which gods I pleased for Bethesda to pick my weapon of choice to do their testing on, but I'm going to assume it was Mothman. Praise be to him.)
---
Exactly.  AP is OP when our AP doesn't scale nearly as well.
---
I don’t think that’s a crazy thought. It occurred to me too.
---
I've been making caps hand over fist from my shop. The fast travel cost is not an issue.
---
I hung out at the encryptid event and revived someone! So exciting!
---
🤣🤣 ya that was after mastering like the *best* route to hit em all without spending a fortune fast travelling, and only having what you needed to sell on you and grabbing more at the next station lol
---
I hear somone is havin a hard time against em ey? 🤣
---
Close!!!! Looped showings of Gigli, and level 3 locks on all doors.
---
I'd be okay with that.  And from an rp standpoint it's pretty phenomenal.
---
You can find plans for everything but Enclave. I can build marine, 3 different BOS and a bunch of casual and Raider.
---
Yeah I really hope it's temporary, it's making it really hard to enjoy it and I can't really fight anyone because I can't move around properly.. Everything works completely fine when walking sideways, it's really weird. I tried googling it and searching on here and I couldn't find anything about this.. :(
---
I think the nerf was specifically to explosive shotguns. They are OP in FO4 (i have one myself) so i guess they didn't want to recreate that in FO76. Still, a Furious Two Shot combat shotgun would be pretty sick vs bosses. Shame the Wounding effect isn't in the game (hint hint Bethesda).
---
Huh. I killed a Yao Guai with a syringer and got credit for the hunting challenge, but didn't get credit for shooting it for the chemist challenge. I don't know if that's the same bug or a different one.
---
Did anyone one else just get a chill down thier spine
---
Thanks will do
---
It took me a minute but ahahahahaaa :D
---
There's always a member of the Dick Clan in most events.
---
I was fighting one last night and he was kicking my ass so hard I almost laughed.
---
This happened during Free Range over the weekend, so of course all the brahmin were blown away and we failed the event.  Yes, we want the loot from the sheepsquatch as much as you do, but we also want the plans that the event gives us.  The sheepsquatch isn't that hard that you need those weapons.
---
Going AFK or base building causes massive hunger/thirst spikes for me (and I assume everyone else :)).
---
Heh.
---
I just thought it would be nice to be able to make your character "look" dumb, or angry, or stoned.. or whatever it is that  you have in mind when you play them. Just another level of gameplay, ya know?
---
Also... "text balloons"  would be a nice addition to the camera, too.
---
If they were going to catch people doing it they’d do it themselves knowing that the idiot players would fall for it.  I know people that were doing it and I stopped talking to them the minute I was offered shit and asked for items to dupe.  Not getting wrapped up in it.  They’ll get what’s coming to them.
---
Awesome, yeah that event is something else when it goes right.
---
System?
---
Lmafo you see how it could be a issue
---
Then perhaps its not the enemy, but yer build that is weak against them? 😉
---
I've actually had a conversation with someone who did this and their mindset is to limit the number of Legendaries to themselves. They do it so they get the Legendaries and then sell them. They don't want other people to get them. I said that's a fancy idea but also don't be a dick lol
---
Dick Clan.
---
Crap. PS4
---
Take my money, I would buy one.
---
Oh okay, I feel you then.
---
Perhaps they could implement something where you can bundle items to sell in sets or groups (or provide the ability to bulk ammo).
---
We may see some changes in the near future, or at least for now we can generate discussion.
---
That was where I launched my first nuke, with help ha. Me and the guy ran through both areas with a similar experience but had ghouls spawn up top.
---
I wish we could re roll one stat for scrip
---
Yeah, the holotape recording at the beginning explains it but maybe audio settings make it so people can’t hear him with everything exploding.  I guess Beth could do a better job of explaining it.  I just feel like if you’re shooting it to hell and it’s not doing anything it’s time to look for other options.
---

---
You might be able to redo it right away if you server hop. On the same server it sounds like it's at least a 2 hour cooldown.
---
Actually, dogwood *is* protected.
---
Hunter’s long coat. I did get one from the vendor bot west down the road from Janet’s Soft Serve. 
---
It was 920c, and took more tries than I can remember. I’m level 150 and found it last week 😐
---
probably because they use nylon for the increased carry weight and its not as hardy as canvas?
---
Yes please. Even if they still won't lettuce sell them to vendors, at least lettuce bulk and throw on the player vendor so we can set realistic prices. I understand that npc vendors sell ammo at outrageous prices, but idk anybody who buys that from them lol.
---
Hahahahahah, excellent.
---
To role play as a homeless scrapper that’s never made it outside of flatwoods and really only has to worry about fighting level 1 ghouls
---
Because when you get pregnant the baby robs your body of nutrients. So some thing just in a game and with a bacpack.
---
Oh did they fix that? I KNOW it used to not be since I kept getting it and losing it and one time specifically checked it (before and after scrap all junk). Stuff is so useless and rare to find I haven't bothered gathering any lately.
---
I don't worship money. 
---
I look at the facts and logic. 
---
My opinions have no place in how rich people should spend their money or deal with tax laws. 
---
Wishing they paid higher taxes is asinine. Would you be willing to give up 75% of everything you make? If you wouldn't then you have no room to talk. 
---
Don't like the tax laws? Find enough Congressmen who'd be willing to give up 75% of their salary. 
---
Don't like how our taxes are being spent and mismanaged me neither, let's find members of Congress that will fix it or vote new ones in that will address the issue and negotiate new budgets.

No trains... but pump cars would be awesome. 
---
However... it would be kinda silly to have pump cars going willy-nilly (yup, I said willy-nilly) in every direction... what happens when Car A, leaving Sutton Station traveling south at 20 mph, laden with bulked aluminum, meets Car B, that left Charleston Station, fully loaded with Dandy Boy Apples, 4 minutes ago and is traveling at 24 mph?
---
Along with this can we get the ability to breakdown ammo?
---
Thanks.
---
I guess, those are the only enemies I ever seriously worry about.
---
I honestly forgot that even existed until just now.
---
A nuke silo has 3 of each level, except 0.
---
Your heavy weapons analysis looks pretty solid aside from the lack of damage per second calculations. Divide fire rate by 10 to figure out bullets per second. You then can multiply that by your damage. You can then get actual DPS values there. I guess it still works for the sake of argument though. 
---
The laser rifle only displays a sniper barrel option. There are no options for automatic barrels. The website is still a work in progress. Something must be funky on the calculations too. My own calculations seem to be slightly lower than the website tells me when you start factoring in sneak attack modifiers.
---
Wow, thats really good.
---
Sorry, where exactly is this datamined information from? Is this reliable?
---
When I saw this my heart plummeted...just too many weapons up for grabs as legendaries and as a result of this..this reduces massively the probabilities of getting something we actually want.
---
This also adds more strength to spunking all my 1000 scrip onto the mystery option. 
---
Given an option, it would have been 1000 on ranged but I'm gonna just taken my chances with the mumma
---
You could always find a local print shop that does embroidery and have a custom piece made for yourself.  It will not be anywhere close to cheap, especially with multiple colors, but if you really, really want some pioneer scout patches for cosplay or just general fandom, it's always a possibility that's only limited by your budget.
---
When I was younger, there used to be a shop in the local mall that did custom embroidered hats.  Pretty basic with maybe 2 colors max.  Maybe do a google search for "(your local city) custom embroidery" and see what your options are.
---
Of course.....if you're artistically inclined, you could make your own by hand.  People were making incredibly elaborate embroidery by hand waaaaay before mechanization.
---
Lmao ouch. Always the good ol pipe guns or alien blaster if you want to be SURE you wont one-shot anything.
---
Behind the super-duper mart, just enter via the sewer cover there...
---
Not sure why anyone is downvoting this. 
---
I get what you're saying. I think that people who are still here are the ones who really enjoy the game alnd are just fed up with the toxic negative trolls. ... fed up with the imbeciles who wrote articles declaring the game finished, and so on. 
---
We all want it to improve over time. And it seems like Bethesda is really listening and making progress. 
---
I think the downvotes you're getting is just because people who speak up and say anything positive about the game get slammed as bethesda shills and so on. 
---
Yes, it has gotten toxic. It has goten toxic on all sides. 
---
From my perspective, it's all about one's tone when pointing out bugs.
---
I'd have to look up what my build is, but I'll be looking to incorporate those talents.
---
For the first one you can coordinate. Just jump in your PA naked to begin with. Both y'all hop out and then snap a foto. 
---
For the other one, that's tedious 😂😂😂
---
I just spam them with team invites. They usually get the message.
---
Dang, sorry, love to help but I’m on PC. I need the same.
---
Right now I struggle with ghouls/scorched, so I've got that going for me.
---
I'll never understand why there aren't bulk ammo boxes and bulk for EVERY junk type. Would take like a half hour to implement, they don't even use different models or anything.
---

He was also in Poseidon last night. I've seen him passing Poseidon before, but never right down in the workshop area

Wait a minute, the game isn't supposed to look like this!?
---
Gun Fu looked weird, but it is worth giving a shot.
---
Try adding a second stair to the opposite side of the floor, remove the first stair, remove the floor, remove the second staircase, this has occasionally worked for me. Also, try logging out and back in. That’s worked too.
---
TLDR
---
People playing multiplayer games are stupid.
---
I feel like they will lower the negative 60 in a future patch but by that time I will have spent all my badges. I feel like they will patch it
---
I'm sure it is literally just for balance.
---
Use automatic weapons vs. gutsies.  Bloodied or Anti-Armor.  Use stealth if you can too.  I'm fine with gutsies - but the imposter SSQ is just stupid OP with its ray of death.  Done many AWOL Armaments solo without trouble - but I hate Encryptid.
---
Yup, I learned :) Now I have a 1* Stalker's golf club (NOT FOR SALE AT ANY PRICE)
---
Same thing happened to me with the large power armor Statue. This update caused a lot of camp placement issues.
---
are you referring to the Sheepsquatch event? If so, that event is only initiated by player action. it is not a random, timed event.
---
Not a bad tactic!
---
New Plan: post on Reddit sub for groups and make them pay you fractions of the cost of the card? 😂
---
I did this event 5 times in a row. Just hopped servers after collecting all the cards. Had a team of 6 ppl go with me. They were really helpful with conduits, but I still burned through a lot of stims.
---
My favorite is the one that effectively makes the Swimming scout badge impossible without cheesing it - "revive another player in the water"
---
I have tried that but when did it the second staircase got stuck as well
---
I agree on wanting a "preferred" item system that's independent of the Favorites Wheel that also provides protection from selling or drops.
---
On my way. Ill be sure to bring a geiger counter.
---
Stick to the Forrest and do a bunch of the side quests. The main quest progresses too fast if you don’t focus on a perfect build.
---
Take a camera picture of a player in Responder gear shooting up in a train station bathroom while Grahm and Chally the Moo Moo hold an intervention
---
Its a pity, hope you find someone, and thanks for reply bro !
---
Legendary vendor right around the corner fortunately! Whew!
---
if the enemies are considerably higher level than you, then a higher level player had been in your area and the enemies spawned took that player into account.
---
But, if you’re in the Mire or Cranberry Bog then they will be higher level than you at this point anyway.
---
Maybe they should have instead made more hunger/thirst from carry all that extra shite around...
---
Thanks bro. U are a lifesaver
---
I'll be on later and can help of you still need it
---
do you have a Geiger counter?
---
Oh thank you for this!!!!!
---
Yikes, if logging out doesn’t work, the only other “solution” is to move your base. Even just a tiny bit.
---
I don't rly know anything ab the event, the only thing is, is that I need it for a challenge.
---
Lol, can I get this as too comment please. Shoulda put a tldr in there and that one would have work perfectly.
---
I've been known to wake up my SO when screaming "TAG 'EM AND BAG 'EM KIDDIES, I'm seein' STARS!", while knee capping mole miners.
---
It's going to be pretty embarrassing getting legendaries from the new mole miner lady, knowing that I slaughter and toy with her people.
---
Next up in the Shop for 200 atoms....
---
The 1970's is back!
---
Oh thank Godzilla.....
---
what mutation did you have? and did it kill the hunger?
---
I use my explosive Gatling and just tag everything once
---
ITS A TRAP
---
I think you’re thinking about this the wrong way. It’s not here to replace legendary farming it’s only to supplement it. You scrap the trash you wouldn’t keep anyways for a chance at something else. If you get more trash then you haven’t lost anything, just scrap that trash and keep moving forward. I rarely see 3 star legendaries and the one star armor I get is garbage so getting a guaranteed 3 star is going to be great even if it’s something I might not use.
---
Do you by chance have more than one vending machine?  If you do, do you specialize with the machines? i.e. this one here only sells drugs, the other one only sells ammo.  If that is the case, did you also label the machines?
---
I say all of this because here is what I've noticed.  I have 4 machines at my camp and at first someone would show up, check the first machine they walk up to and then leave.  I think there's still a lot of people out there that don't realize different machines means different inventory for sale.  After I labeled my machines this got a lot better.   I sell  probably bout 20-30 stims a day for 15 each.
---
The other thing you need to make sure you have is a good volume of people coming to your camp, if you're only selling chems and first aid stuff, when people hover over your camp they may not see what they are looking for.  With that said make sure you're selling something of each item listed, even if it means throwing in a few cans of pork n'beans just to get a check mark the food column.  Come for the mats, stay for the stimpacks.  Unless it's survival, then its come for the griefing, stay because you were murdered.
---
That quest sucks.
---
Doesnt show up with outfits that have backpacks. Cant remember the explorer but they did make that clear.
---
The best advice I can offer here, and this may be true in your case, is to go slow, be patient, and definitely follow the main quest line. It also can’t hurt to fight enemies under your level, until you can collect/upgrade enough good armor and weapons to make your life easier. 
---
It also definitely pays to think through your perk loadout, there are several great guides on this you can search for. But coming up with a plan instead of arbitrarily picking perks it definitely helps.
---
True true, not sure how I forgot about them haha
---
You only need one, plant it, scrap, plant, etc
---
I didn’t want this because I hadn’t thought of it. But now that you’ve said it.   I want it.
---
This is nice. thanks for this.

just tried creating a new character and i can play the game that way but try logging into my level 98 account which has a two shot exploding the dragon that i cherish, no luck at all, i dont know if i should wait for the new vendor update on the 16th but im genuinely scared i just got my account terminated and all i do is sell cheap and help low level players :( i did scrap up to about 1000 steel the other day with my scrapper perk and going to the top of the world and west-tek.
---
I have never seen it go right lol! I have tried doing it so many times and there is always so many people but damn it’s a mess! I hope someday I will get to see it be successful! I just knew that there would be people needing reviving there haha
---
It would be awesome :)
---
Thank you for attacking the position I did not have
---
Possibly. I ran all three when I did it
---
You can buy a recall card from vendors and then modify it at Tinker bench and go start the event yourself. Im unsure what that ‘60’ number refers to but it does not mean you have to become conduit 60 times. It’s not 60 seconds either but as long as you keep activating a pylon then you should be able to achieve the goal in a single event!
---
Yeah I for sure do. I alternate between queens and imposters so I can get al those sweet super stims.  Helpful tip if you aren’t already doing it. Scout for open servers by sending someone with no cards out.  That way everyone has plenty of time to load in before you pop the event.
---
Separate severs. 
---
You'll be starting over.
---
It's hilarious to me that this event is literally set up so that people who want to squat in the corner can still legitimately contribute, but they won't. Having dudes off to the side keeping the pylons up from start to finish is actually, honestly helpful but the moochers won't even do that and burn some rando food items to heal. Sad.
---
this would be great, i have most of the boobleheads and a few of the magazines
---
Todd we told you that you mustn't make undercover posts on reddit
---
I'll be on around 7 or 8 if that's okay:)
---
I see what you did there.
---
What weapon are you using, and what mods does it have?  Bloated ghouls can give you trouble for sure, but scorched shouldn't be too big a hassle unless they manage to swarm  you.
---
Oh imagine the PvP trolls with laugh and sorry emotes 😂
---
Sometimes it can start during the "evening" cycle, when it's still light out, but with the 50/50 cycle that the game uses it's considered night.
---
Hell we can't even inspect the item uess the owner is near. I think they should start with that first
---
To play devil's advocate though, there's also a message that pops up on the screen saying 'Activate the pylons" every time the pylons need activating
---
The new system is way better if you have ever experienced invincible mole rats.
---
I noticed this the other day when higher level persons launched nukes and I must say it is ingenious
---
a semi-circle i can't even get them to line up properly
---
this really needs alot more attention tgan this, brilliant idea OP
---
Nice are you on PS4?
---
*than
---
Didn’t have a mutation at the time. 
---
Didn’t eat it because I thought it would kill me instead of my hunger.
---
All comes down to people playing there parts and by now most should know what's up. Definitely glad you got the revive though!
---
Redbox was selling it for 15 bucks. Used copies tho but should still work fine
---
how I did this in one event was i would activate a pylon and then run away from the battle zone. when you fall to your knees DO NOT respawn. let the 30 seconds tick down. the first time I did this i was able to complete 45/60. surprisingly very simple achievement.
---
Being honest, it's kind of bad lol. I feel bad doing it.
---
I was  hopping it was a mutation :(. thanks for the reply
---
This, also you will have tones free carry weight because you will eat all your radaways.
---
I refuse to have to pay for an item with 5 mule accounts at max caps, So the legendary vendor will help me try and get good items for cheaper.
---
As a warning to others I've been at sunshine meadows for 3.5 hours and done 4 workshop defences. That spawn is in no way guaranteed.
---
It still works without having to be on a team right?
---
They want you to buy ATOMs. That's the reduced answer.
---
I agree in this instance. I totally forgot about those scenarios.
---
Yeah, I’m currently making those caps to fund my terrible addiction of putting out serious damage. But send me a pm maybe we can link up and share the event.
---
Same same, but different.
---
Im online at thia moment, here its 9 pm im going to be playing till late i think
---
😂👌
---
Weird. They were supposed to remove that ability from Megasloths. Anyways, I think he just follows you around wherever you go.
---
they do sit on a conrete pad so as long as you started with the highest with the least amount of conrete showing you could work down, that's how i have it my camp at the minute
---
I have a feeling that will be resolved shortly.  We had the same issue a few weeks ago with the robot vendors except they never showed up period.
---
I think so
---
Eh, it could be like old pnp where you burned your character sheet. Or like Wizardry where you lost a level (or notnif you could pull the floppy out quick enough) or like Baldurs Gate where you had to pay coin if no cleric was in the party.  Bottom line is that death should mean something.
---
It would be nice if there was no cap limit at all
---
That looks amazing!
---
okey thanks i will give that a try
---
Thanks, i ended up buying  and scrapping the gauss at enclave. Couldn’t find where the mods were. Thanks for the tip!
---
Yep, though I honestly couldn't tell you when. I just know I did the Dogwood Die-Off event the other day and the dogwood reward surprised me by not autoscrapping.
---
Add me psn suprobo3
---
I can help contribute. I run queens at least once when I'm on I can send you an invite on the PS4 messenger and we can roflstomp some end game content for sweet 1* wooden left legs.
---
Where did you saw that that forrest maps, thats treasure for me :D
---
Savage
---
Yup
---
They at least need a whistle command a level 60 was trying to get my attention yesterday and I (level 17) turned around and almost attacked. I would also like to see a no mic emoji which could work for the I can't hear them one you recommended

Grounded is super annoying. That electrical explosion is a mess.
---
Yup. Something to do outside of grinding end game content for 1* wooden left legs.
---
Do you think crossplay will ever come to the two?
---
Even if they just tried I wouldn’t be irritated. I have seen plenty of people try and take the pylon and just get murdered by the imposter.  They respawn and run right back to it and get murdered again. I love the effort.
---
The most intense but best nuke Zone IMO. IDC who you are the burrows is a nightmare when it's nuked.
---
Sometimes I get Whitespring fever with my lower level; I can’t quit.  Break all my shit, run out of shells....go fix it up and buy some shells from a rando at 3am in artisans corner.  Just get in that groove.   Not so much with a high level that one hits everything with a ski sword.
---
This
---
I got the little animal friend icon to show up several times when trying to tame an enemy...but after that im not sure just like you
---
I heard its best to just leave it alone and let it make its way back to your camp alone, so ive tried that
---
i waited 2-3 days but still not animal friend
---
so i try again, ive tried many times but so far no animal friend has ever made it back to my camp
---
do we need to keep the perk card on until the animal shows up at our house?  or can we remove it once we successfully tame it?
---
and if we try to tame another pet when once is still active, does the new supercede the previous?
---
thanks for any answers, ive been trying to get an animal friend at my camp for about a month now with no success
---
Yeah I agree, just trying to do the best we can with what we have. I am not really a fan of how tightly controlled the economy is in these artificial ways either. I would prefer more consensual controls and balances than hard limits that make no sense in lore.
---
No idea
---
Hmm I have a primed combat shot gun and love it
---
Yeh that much I do see, and the two times I've been in the event I've gladly stepped up there (my poor stimpacks). And yes the recording does explain it, but when I listened to the holotape weeks ago I couldn't start the event, terminal said something about system not ready? My guess was someone else had already started it too recently and I wasn't able to trigger it. Poor experience for a story quest that just ended without an ending.
---
You know it.  King of the swamp here I come.
---
Probably unintentional. Maybe submit a ticket? 
---
I'm upvoting in hope bethesda sees this.
---
Yeah that would also be very nice
---
I'm Bloodied and power armor majority of the time and when I die I don't lose rads.. do you? When I'm outside of PA I only have 5 rad resist. In my excavator I have 300 something rad resist.. hazmat is 1000 rad resist. It's not hidden.
---
yeah i kind of feel like its dumbing down the game..... its a bit too easy and convenient to just fast travel away from a firefight
---
Commenting so i find this later 👍
---
I just wish they’d stop making the cool stuff limited and would just add them permanently to the atomic shop. Good work man!
---
Legendary spawn rate in the burrows is similar to WS, sometimes a bunch, sometimes only a couple of level 42 ghouls. Nuke will transform them to max level but won’t turn non-legendary into legendary. So whether it’s legendary paradise or not highly rely on RNG. Also no hardened mass in the burrows since there’s no radiation. No-stress farming place for xp.
---
You tamed this guy right?
---
https://i.ytimg.com/vi/33IcjMjWPHE/hqdefault.jpg

Same could go for turrets
---
I have my camp there and I love it. I hope they give us all the Halloween decorations that is already in game for Halloween. Maybe a Halloween Parade too?
---
Alright, sorry I couldn't remember what it looked like just knew they said it wouldnt show with other packs. I dont really have an answer for ya man. Maybe "it just works" comes into play here. I actually wish we had an option to hide the backpack. Spent a lot of time getting my armor to match and get the look I wanted. Either that or make the mods actually change the appearence/give us more skins.
---
I believe you're thinking of the other one; electrified or something like that. Grounded is +100 energy resist and -50% energy damage.
---
this is how I feel about it, too. someone else mentioned invincible enemies (ie hidden) and we kind of do need this for that scenario.
---
but yeah, no one should be able to escape a gun fight because they hid around a corner for 15 seconds without being shot.
---
So yeah for me being low health with rads blocking 80% of my health yeah it's a bad thing to have -60 rad resist outside of PA when I only have 5 rad resist to begin with lol.
---
Some of the quests you readily pick up at lower levels (Rose, parts of Mysteries) will take you to areas a 23 should probably not be. 
---
The right side of the map (bog and mire) is high level.
---
THe east side of the middle stripe (Savage Divide), is high level.
---
The middle and west side of the Divide and part of the bottom (ash heap) will spawn high level enemies if a higher level player is, or has been, around recently - revisiting those areas later will likely yield lower level enemies.
---
@23, you should probably still be bouncing between the Forest and Toxic Valley (top west on the map), and the west side of the Divide (path of the wind) and top of the world.  You can also do the area right around the pumpkins on the map, but I would not go south or east of the pumpkins quite yet. North may be ok, if a high level isn't there already.
---
In about 5 levels, with the right weapon, you hould be able to do Whitesprings.
---
At around 30, start the excavator quest in the lower edge of the ash heap.  At 45+, you can go anywhere.
---
You’re right! I mix that up all the time. Electrically Charged... fuck that mutation. Lol.
---
I have high hopes for this. Really hope it isn’t disappointing. I’m keeping my expectations reasonable but still very stoked at all the potential. In.
---
Thanks! I have another question I’m not sure if you could answer. 
---
I am trying to do the order of the tadpole mission and it said “control pests at dolly sods” and I looked on here and someone said it was the daily that pops up which is claim the workshop so I assumed that was it and I did it and killed the ghouls that came but the task did not say “completed” so I’m not sure if you did it but if you have any insight I would greatly appreciate it :)
---
I've already forgotten if this is the case, but check your inventory to make sure it's not a plan you have to learn.  You're definitely supposed to get it one way or the other after finishing the quest and getting your first backpack though, so I  would submit a bug report.
---
You can still destroy bases by kiting the enemies that spawn after fast travel.
---
Having unlocked doors makes it even easier for us to wreck shit.
---
Yeah, certain areas, I can't even find the enemy that's apparently near by. It's annoying to have to jog x amount of distance to fast travel. Especially when I'm just trying to grind a simple photo challenge.
---
I launched my first nuke on the SQB the other night and I did this by accident. The people that showed up didn't complain but I still kinda felt like an idiot. Is there any benefit to this other than not getting irradiated? We killed her pretty fast so with PA armor it was only maybe 3-4 radaways of radiation.
---
I can see this getting really annoying on those 20 minute+ kills though.
---
There are 2 metas now - PvE and PvP.  PvE is Bloodied, PvP go with explosive fast fire stuff or high damage VATS stuff I think.  Bloodied doesn't do as well in PvP, and PvP builds don't work as well for the other 90% of the game.  Despite the general ignorant remarks about OP melee, ranged is actually far more meta for both.
---
I am pretty sure this is happening in menus when trading or vendoring. After selecting an item it is still possible to move the original selected item to something else while selecting a quantity or price and when you finally confirm it takes the currently highlighted item instead of the one you had originally selected.
---
This has happened to me so many times.
---
thank you for the help
---
For what it's worth I dont believe the game actually even starts till 50 when you can move special points instead of perks and all the perk cards are unlocked. So if youre getting kind of abused by the npc mobs don't get too flustered.  In time you will be mopping the floor with the environment just like the rest of us.
---
Just think Appalachia is beautiful already now think about it with snow
---
My gt is HIGHKINGBATMAN I'm joining you
---
Oh a piece a candy
---
Add to that Paint, It has a fair bit of lead in it also.
---
Most likely
---
Yeah I’ve checked in my notes. Nothing. I’m pretty bummed out considering I’m meant to be able to craft a better one than the leave 20
---
thank you for the help man,real talk. :)
---
You’re more flammable
---
Player triggered, but there is a cool down period in between. It'd be nice if it was shortened to maybe 30 mins.
---
Dog food is the most popular food easy to come by, but as a high lvl with carnivore mutation ionized meat is the best to just satisfy hunger.
---
I actually know a place, used to get t-shirts there for my business. Never priced patches though.
---
i love when players do this, i get there in my hazmat suit, and realize they have pulled the queen into the non-irradiated zone, so i can can put on normal armor again! brilliant!
---
No game should ever fail. The sheer amount of games dozens of people have put passion, love and their livelihoods into that floundered anyway because of poor management, unforeseen issues or just shit luck is absurdly large and it's hard enough as a worker in the industry to keep a job and steady income when everything is working right, let alone when shit is going South.
---
I like to drop 2 nukes in the clear and the last nuke with the biggest inclusion to allow for those sweet sweet high rad fluids drops. They seemed to have altered the drop rates of hardened mass and glowing mass to where you get 2 or even 3 at a time. But high rad fluids seem to drop less often and only one at a time. 
---
All of those adds in the nuke zone I usually walk out with 20-30 high rad fluids. For me it's worth it.
---
I did the Stings and Things daily to mark that one off.
---
When I first got the game on release I hated it then decided to give it another chance in February and have loved it since. Like I always tell people when they ask, "I say, it's came a long way give it a chance"
---
I'm having issues with foundation not being able to be scrapped. Getting a "part of the camp will. E unaccessable error".  Funny thing is all i have placed is 12 foundations on a rebuild. I'm sure it has something to do with the easing of foundation placement requirements.  Maybe now they need to ease the requirements to scrap them....lol.  sad when all that is placed in my camp are 2 bugged foundations.
---
Hmm water filters are pointless...
---
Prime receivers are awesome though.... once you have  got all your mutations, arch, and are fully geared ....what else would spend all the flux on...  20% over a whole fight with the queen really speeds things up
---
So it just appeared at my camp as I type this. Basically it was super bugged(just sitting still/no animation or anything) so I just left it on it’s own. I  went afk for like 20 mins, ate some food, joined my buddies server, and he just ran out of the woods into my camp.
---
So it seems like it’s just time based after you capture it. Still not 100% sure tho, my buddy is currently chasing his tamed deathclaw as it goes on a rampage through Watoga lmao.
---
Also, I just tried to server hop again and it’s gone from my camp now. Seems very buggy.
---
What about in-game though?
---
So your gay now?
---
Jk
---
I did the basement one, it sent me back upstairs, now it's saying to go down somewhere again..I'm confused lol
---
People keep saying handmades are the new meta, but they always have been lmao
---
Right now I'd say bloodied automatic builds are the best on taking someone or somerhing down right not, but full health and a good rifle plus the right perks still works great for me
---
Yep, that’s him
---
Lololol I just ran Janets soft serve 10 times and got the Hunter's Longcoat!!!
---
Check to see if there is a wall in same place above the one on the second.
---
Sonofa... THAT's why it only works every once in a while?
---
Oooh! I do love my self crafted hand made silenced hardened receiver 5.56, nothing special but still a great range 170+ and stealthy, good to know it isn't going to be nerfed.
---
Daaaaamn 😂🤣🤣😭😭
---
AA (Faster Fire Rate or Vats Crits) Handmade with 25 percent less AP cost. 
---
I have both so I use Crits for PVE and FFR for PVP.
---
yeah I'd love bulk ammo cause I just feel heartless selling 5mm for 1 cap..... the only ammo I can even feel not terrible about is grenades and explosive weapons ammo and even thats a bit of a stretch
---
I've started doing Sheepsquatch like I tank in WoW, and I usually end up doing this for every group with only dying maybe 10% of the time (usually to eyebombs). I do this in Power Armor, so YMMV.  Here is my loadout. I'm sure I'm not perfect about this, and ABSOLUTELY welcome a revision to my method if you notice anything!
---
Tips for being a good Imposter Tank (or at least one that doesn't die):
---
1. Change your perks.  No, seriously. Throw on Born Survivor, bring Stimpacks. Also, throw on Fireproof and Serendipity (yes, I know that seems counter intuitive with Born Survivor - it isn't, Eyebombs hurt, and in a wave, you won't get that second auto-stim). If you have to swap out anything that is fancy damage, that's fine - you are there to tank, not to kill. Also, get some good Endurance and Perception food.
---
2. Get a good vampire weapon you are specc'd for.  You are there to TANK - not to KILL.  Tanks are about staying alive.  My fav so far is a vampire combat shotgun, rigged with perforating magazine - it tears up those gutsies and the boss a bit better, and you get good health because of the way shotguns work currently in the game.  Once the group gets smashed to itty bitty sheepy pieces, that big boy is on YOU, and for the most part, will stay on you. Use VATs whenever possible, but try to keep that weapon on Torso for VATs.
---
3. Strafe/Circle kite.  Most of the attacks are pretty standard, and one direction. Don't run, keep your gun trained on the Imposter.
---
4. It's totally okay to be all three conduits with this build.  I started doing this at level 60 with Excavator and 5 Endurance.
---
5. Hot key your meds.  For serious. USE YOUR STIMPAKS MANUALLY EVEN WITH BORN SURVIVOR.  The server isn't perfect, timing, etc. isn't perfect, you will need that extra tick to deal with latency.  Also use Med-X, it's your friend.
---
Most of you min-max, MMO types will look at this and say "No shit", but I've noticed a LOT of people that are NOT your standard MMO type people running in, and getting ROFLstomped. Doing this, I average about 1 Super Stimpaks and 10 regular Stimpaks per fight.  This doesn't take a super character to do, just a good vamp weapon (preferably one you are already spec'd for), power armor, and practice.  I've been doing this since about level 60.
---
If you are doing this on PC and want me to come and tank Imposters while you pew pew, I take Stimpak donations ;) IGN: SallyTheAltarBoy.
---
Edits * Clarity, Typos
---
The Encryptid event (a.k.a. imposter sheepsquatch) is initiated by player action but has a very long cooldown.
---
I'd actually argue bloodied is the the top PvP build post patch 9, not godly but definitely the only ones who give me an issue time to time.
---
Unless networking technology takes some massive leap ahead, and graphics technology doesn’t improve at all in the same time, that won’t be happening anytime in this decade.
---
Not to mention cheating is still possible in games that are stream only.
---
Oh, interesting! So it's ticks then is it? Hmm.. Well that should alleviate some of it I suppose. Might be annoying for the rest of the participants, but hey :P lol. Thanks for the input!
---
Same, ive really wanted there to be a new system for a long time. I just hope its done right, and not have any mess ups.
---
I built my CAMP outside of Helvetia for the event, originally just so I’d have a free fast travel point no matter where I was when the event started. But after realizing I dropped it ten feet from one of the town’s fast travel spots whenever others warped there, it quickly became a place for people to run  after/between events to scrap, craft, trade, etc. 
---
I still haven’t moved it from that spot. It’s probably my favorite CAMP Ive built between all my characters and all the CAMPs they’ve all ever had.
---
oh, im sorry it disappeared!  but at least it did show up for a bit i guess... better than nothing!
---
hope it will return for you
---
Given that Wild Appalachia basically wraps up tomorrow (the Legendary Vendor is the last of the items on the original roadmap), I'd expect we'll start hearing about Nuclear Winter in the weekly articles fairly soon.
---
Been trying for for a few days so logging doesnt seem to work and i really dont want to but it might be my only option
---
No worries, I appreciate the input. Yeah, hopefully we see some pretty cool skins that can help us match the look we're going for.
---
I just started this quest yesterday. Do you get badges you can put on your clothes?
---
Yeah, it sucks.
---
"Previously, we had announced that the Purveyor would arrive on May 23 but, as it turns out, Mole Miners are exceptionally fast diggers. She’s going to arrive a week earlier than expected and is now looking to kick off her grand opening on Thursday, May 16."
---
You can bet your arse they've thought about it already ;) hehe..
---
I heard it drops from Ash heap events, but so far no dice for me.
---
I shall return the favour!
---
they did this because when you get stuck behind a coat rack or anything else and there is enemies on the floor above or below you. You couldn't do anything except a hard reset.
---
I don’t think “proof” means what you think it means.
---
Me too.....I’ll give handies behind the truck stop bathroom. Shits hard to find
---
See, I’m the opposite. We should drop Aid and junk in adventure and Aid, junk, and ammo in survival.
---
THANKS YOU SO MUCH BRO 😆
---
I hope so too!! But you’re right, it did show up so it is something. It just doesn’t seem to be a polished mechanic yet.
---
So why buy any games? Fuck, enjoy your sticks, man.
---
Even better if the face changed on it’s own… you come back to camp and Rocky is angry… but why? **dun dun dun**
---
Np glad I could help:)
---
I've got most of the mods for the handmade and would do it cheap if you are on PC.
---
Those guys must have top tier armor pieces with AP refresh probably - if not its hard for them to be tanky and they should drop easily enough if you can damage them.
---
\*cough\* New Vegas
---
So I can put something together for you.  Would include:
---
- 5 Level 1 Pocketed Treated/Studded Armor
---
- Shielded Vault Suit
---
- A level 1 Berserker's Pickaxe
---
Yes!
---
It's very simple.
---
Explosive modifier makes the gun deal 20% extra damage as explosive. With the five cards it brings that number to 32%.
---
You need to figure out whether you want to spend five whole perks on 12% damage.
---
In my experience there aren't enough cards to justify such a small boost, for example I would rather reduce the carry weight of all chems by 90% and ballistic ammo by 80% and 25 carry weight for the same card investment.
---
If you you grenades, rockets and nukes then yeah it will be super though.
---
Glad to help. Good luck out their Vault raider!!
---
One star bloodied or instigating will sell? Shit, I’ve been turning them into scrip. FML. Well, thanks for the heads up on it!
---
do not black his name dude.
---
np, good luck! (and avoid the Musician tasks, some of them won’t register! bugged)
---
Camps can still be damaged by kiting the enemies that spawn on fast travel to a CAMP. Having unlocked doors makes leveling a camp quicker and easier. 
---
My favorite is when Scortched spawn.
---
Not tomorrow. Thursday, 5/16 for the Legendary Vendor.
---
Nothing more fun than pissing off the WS bots.
---
what about the BOS Combat armor paint not appearing on vendors?
---
Sadly I’m in ps4, seems like you have the tanking down to a science. I like it.  I am bloodied build so it’s always nice to not have to take all three.  My agility is maxed so I was thinking of going the regen armor and the same perk load out. I feel like this should be it’s own how to.
---
&gt;Ask them nicely once. If they don't respond, get in their way a lot while you destroy the legendaries
---
Ummmm, yeah, that's a wee bit passive aggressive,  no? 
---
Just because you and your posse have a problem with Mr. D-Bag does not mean that you have to ruin things for others...or to put it another way, 2 wrongs don't make a right.
---
This is especially true if you didn't trigger a given event. This becomes even more critical on higher end events like the Imposter or SBQ. I don't have any issue with lower levels joining in for the XP and loot, hell I encourage it, but I'm under no obligation to take a beating or do all the dirty work while you tag and then hide. I'll help as much as I can but you've gotta meet me half way...
---
No doubt, however in high tier PvP you can learn to expect pretty finished builds with proper gear and currently no one is very tanky now if you know what you're doing. I'm taking about the same amount of bullets killing bloodies, yet they're doing increased damage, so definitely formidable foes in PvP.
---
I speculate 4 and 5 star are gonna be vendor exclusive and cost like 500 scrip
---
Ssssssssshhhhhh.
---
Best thing thats happened so far imo. I love the sound of it. Not a joke, i dont know why but i like the sound
---
The disappearing item issue is tough for users to troubleshoot since they often don't know the proximal event to when the item disappeared. They only know the first time they looked for it and it was gone. That's made it very hard to troubleshoot.   
---
I lost a power armor arm after fast traveling. Was it related to fast travel? How long had it been gone? I have no idea. It was there the last time I got in the PA some time before. I'm careful about selling, scrapping, and dropping, because I know I made a mistake when I started playing and lost my outfit, but we'll never know.   
---
I don't know for sure that there's a bug, but I have heard and observed far too many missing item reports to write them all off as user errors. This many sentinel events don't happen in most online games. Something is wrong, or maybe multiple somethings. Time will tell.
---
Found him 3 times. And have sold off my excess patterns in my store already.
---
I can mod to your liking in a few hours
---
If it's just one, I melee them - up close and personal, and aim at the apendages, not the body.  (Seems like when you get close, they have a harder time hitting you with their primary weapon.)
---
Dyer chemical, I found a high perch and sniped with a 50 cal.  (Recon scope helped a lot with the smoke cloud bots)  Because of the high angle, most of their shots went over my head.
---
Took a while, but it worked.
---
It always stays a while a server restart. It's neither a fix and possibly, not even an actual glitch: servers possibly don't get enough restarts. The one you got on was probably recently restarted.
---
😂😂Nice!
---
Pacifist mode will only prevent you from doing damage to another player, It does not prevent PVP, well it does but only because it prevents you for doing damage to another player making it so you can not initiate it. Taking a workshop DOES NOT turn off pacifist mode. It will not keep you from getting killed. There is a lot of misinformation about pacifist mode floating around out there. If on a team, anything a teammate does to initiate PVP, will also initiate you into PVP. I am sorry if you already knew all this, I just hate to read the misinformation being thrown around in regards to pacifist mode.
---
Now with this newest patch Bethesda changed the PVP mechanics for workshops, making it so you had to be at the workshop to be affected by it. Before a person could contest your workshop and attack you anywhere on the map. So you could just leave the workshop area to stop the pvp, I think, I have not tried it.
---
The latest duping method that was patched didn’t lag the servers. People are saying it had to do with using vendors, and that’s not gonna lag everyone on the server out or crash the server. The only one that ever did was the crafting and dropping boards one that was patched at the beginning of the year.
---
The servers just suck, they are cheap amazon cloud servers, not dedicated servers that Bethesda owns and operates. So unless their employees learn some new coding optimization methods, the servers will always be laggy and crash frequently.
---
you sound more like someone who doesnt want anyone to have a different opionion than you, and if you hear a differing opinion, then it is "harping"
---
i know i know, you are defensive of this game franchise, but so are the ones that criticize the game's flaws.  If people didnt care they would just chuck the game and play something else.
---
If just one person complained about a bad bug, but then no one else did, then Bethesda would never care enough to fix it.
---
Of course, you can have many many many people complain like they did with repair kits and Bethesda will still ignore them, so maybe thats not the best  point for me to make...
---
I was trying to catch up on the backpack ordeal and managed to catch up on the stupidity as well. Damn, what a stupid post
---
Another day older?
---
Why does this remind me of a Spongebob episode?
---
It seems to be acting funky lately. Also make sure you have stash space. Most drinks weight a pound each.
---
I think max lvl is higher, max lv weapons are 45 i believe
---
Old man Mose
---
What is needed is plumbing so that we can route the output of all the purifiers to a bucket.
---
With my luck a brahmin will come along and kick that bucket.
---
I believe it was data mined at 60% and DOESN’T stack with GWS perk. But that was on the internet...and you know what they say about the internet.
---
No. It would  just result in the average item cost 
---
skyrocketing.
---
I have 50 pounds of space left so idk
---
You don't appear to understand what a marginal tax is.
---
Deeper in debt
---
I have, removed everything around it including the roof. It's still bugged
---
You've hit the terrible trough where Rose's quests suddenly far outpace your level. Stay in the forest and Toxic valley doing side quests until you're level 40+, preferably 50 so you get better rewards from mainline quests (max level All Rise, power armor, etc)
---
I'd prefer that it stay where it is... but all cosmetic items (ONLY cosmetic items) were shared by all characters.
---
I start to ring mine when slowpokes are taking too long at the legendary slot machines
---
So this is already the account cap limit and many items already cost more than 25k caps when trading.
---
And deeper in debt
---
I think this was mostly in anticipation of CAMP Vendor fast travel issues. Without it, if you spawned in a locked room or under someone’s floor and there were enemies nearby you’d be screwed. It also makes it so people can’t trap you in their indestructible house. 
---
It does create a bit of an easy button for some things, but I think it was a necessity.
---
I love when I check and see this!  Then I ft to where the group is waiting for it to start.
---
Just solved it myself.... Lol turns out if you have a non bloodied weapon selected it doesn't show the bloodied damage on the others in the pip boy.
---
No it does not, Pacifist mode only prevents you from damaging another player, and or initiating PVP via damaging another player. Workshops have nothing to do with pacifist mode. Really all it does is put you at a disadvantage (in the workshop areas, it is still great for wandering the wasteland) if someone comes and initiates PVP with you, because they can damage you, but you can not damage them.
---
Ah cool, thanks for confirming. I had worked it out correctly.
---
Much appreciated :)
---
You can use work stations too. Select craft and it teleports you in fruition of the station then you can quit and be inside. I like to take a quick nap and leave random bits of junk laying around.
---
I’m just now getting into the end game of things and I’ve finished the story (launched a nuke) and all that but I wanna know how you make ultracite ammo.
---
Exactly also, some interesting spots for CAMPS lack a ton of space for water purifiers. Rocky cliffs for example. Add Super Duper and it’s a good way to get a lot of purified water quickly when Mother Nature isn’t feeling generous.
---
lols yeah I had a day like that - logged into a free range event right as the sheepsquach jumped out traveled to help a friend at a power plant then found the responder roaming trader then bumped into grahm and was like yush tis a good day
---
You might get lucky if you capture and hold the Abandoned bog town workshop. I’ve been attacked by anglers there many times
---
Mmm... I think you can recraft them to a higher level.
---
The revive one?
---
If it's over a stair, then that's the problem.  Stairs now need clearance above them.
---
Megasloth spawns near the flooded trainyard sometimes. Don't know about the others sadly, I was able to complete it without them.
---
i played all weekend on many many many servers
---
all my teammates noticed it right away
---
after every day for a month loading up the game, finding a server, and then having a stuttering mess while the game loading in
---
for us it was waaaaay better on every server we loaded into
---
Yeah, itd be nice to knock out the revive in water one as well.
---
Yea, I figured it was either one of those. I just assumed or leaned more towards the duping because of previous issues. I know the servers are shit. It just got really bad around that time frame.
---
Thank you!!
---
The MoM quest rewards are the only unique weapons that CAN be upgraded. TBF I don't find the gun to be any good, and the armor is as good as an outfit.
---
If you’re looking for reviving in water i’ll be in spruce knob lake in 5 mins. But quiproquo
---
Gt LtT4Z
---
Edit :  no stims needed
---
This is correct.  There is a hidden environmental effect that reduces incoming radiation prior to applying the standard RR equations for damage.  
---
I believe one guy did the math and it would require a  32,780 RR rating to match PA in a nuke zone (hazmat suit has a higher reduction modifier before damage).
---
Walked into guys house to the trade machine he then proceed to attack me then close the door, so i jumped to the 2nd storey balcony and went back to the station.
---
Unfortunately that's the biggest frustration. No specific knowledge. I was doing all sorts of Inventory management /selling etc so lots of possibilities
---
I would prefer permanent content rather than limited-time grind.
---
Thanks man, give me a shout when you're free :)
---
Yup... and the only logical answer is "Screw those greedy bastards" and don't buy their stuff.
---
We shouldn't be changing stuff to meet the demands of those chumps.
---
I got u. I'm on now. Pming u
---
Oh nice, thank you for the tip!
---
Most kind, but it is hardly original on our part.  This was a tactic developed very soon after game launch by others before us.  I saw what they were doing by just participating in the event and simply copied their strategy when I started launching.  I hope lower level players will bring it up to their team leaders or remember it themselves before launching.  I hate to check the map when someone launches and see Prime in the bullseye of the blast zone.  The fight goes so much faster and is far less resource consuming for the obvious reasons.
---
Nope.  No stairs anywhere near it.
---
This game NEEDS tough enemies!!! 
---
im tired of one shotting everything and i dont even play with a meta character build, im a mess of QOL perks and some melee, shotgun, and heavy weapons perks all fighting for perk space 
---
I say keep the gutsy be bad ass SOB's
---
they have trouble shooter perks for robots!
---
Do you have to take damage for it though? I have healing factor and just take all the conduits while sneaking and undetected so I don’t lose health. Don’t think I’ve unlocked it and def have been one for more than a min.
---
Awesome. I’ll have to check again. The first time I didn’t actually read the terminal, so I didn’t realize I was summoning an invincible sheep bot.
---
That’s not a bad song. I love that song.
---
No, not for me-- I have the rubber-banding still.
---
IDK. I sometimes see that stuttering when loading in and sometimes don't. The rest of the game is pretty smooth for me, though. They did server maintenance on Friday evening, I guess servers are still fresh. Or maybe the "server health improvements" actually did work this time.
---
I think you should google the definition of harping.
---
They could and did do it the same way as they did legendaries. It’s just a simple script that looks for multiples, and from what it seems, the items had to be exactly the same to be considered the same, so same mods, and exact same condition. Because of this, most, or possibly none of the dupes were actually deleted.
---
If there were unique item IDs on items, Bethesda would have already wrote a simple script and deleted every dupe in the game, the day after any method was found.
---
Youre offline unless I'm a friend. So I cant join the game.
---
If u need help let me know im.on now
---
I've seen Grahm wander up to/through the ammunition factory, Dolly Sods, Sunshine Meadows, and the junk yard near Charleston. Good luck!
---
I do agree about the challenges, though.
---
Not really. People go down in the pool of water at the Imposter Sheepsquatch event all the time
---
Super happy to hear it.
---
i for one was hoping for a slew of salty ban threads this AM...
---
What is the D glitch
---
Have you tried using the Xbox app? I just pop it up on my phone anytime I want to send a long message, makes typing soooo much quicker and easier.
---
or you could not carry any junk with you
---
Sold 571 Shotgun Shells for 2 caps each. All shotgun shells gone from inventory after the sale (i.e. they bought them all). Did not receive 1027 caps (my fee after the sale and 10% tax). Instead got 117 caps.
---
System is guaranteed broken.
---
Sent u my gt
---
So, basically a "Wanted to buy" section?
---
How would you enter the item? There are so many variations on weapons and armour...
---
This is directly from the games data files themselves. I included screenshot of the parsed data file information
---
I visited a camp near vault 76 where the vendor had a bunch of ammo for 0 caps. Thought it was a nice way for someone to help others (and newbies).
---
Will do buddy
---
Id like to know what people bought from me
---
"How was I supposed to know that cheating would get me banned?"
---
You're a genius.
---
The outfit combined with the amulet is decent armor, is upgradable, and never needs repairing.  Pretty nice for the sneaky sorts.
---
Crit/Sneak rifles are so far ahead of everything its ludicrous. 
---
There's like zero balance lol.
---
Please don’t mention the perks you’re referencing.
---
Why is this surprising?
---
After Brewing was added there was at least 1 Daily involving alcohol everyday. 
---
And if you’re not gaining a level or 2 everyday I’m not sure what you’re doing. 
---
Of all the things we could complain about involving the challenges, these may be the silliest ones.
---
They don't want us to complete them. These desperate attempts to make dailies uncompleteable so we buy atoms makes me worry about their financial state. Do they need those dimes that badly?
---
set up a max budget. so say i can dedicate 2K caps to buying Bulk Steel at 25 caps each, if someone decides to sell me 100 bulks i could only accept 80
---
Im a big fan of the special slot.
---
How do people figure out the pricing on this stuff though? I have a bunch of legendaries and whatnot that I know people want but I have no idea what a good price is until someone buys it.
---
I agree with not having a mule character so i can pay 60k caps for something, 100%. 
---
But if youve noticed, over the last week, those same items can now be bought for 25k...or 12k..or even 1k caps as ive seen in a few cases. The value is coming down cause theyre so common at this point.
---
I got more of a Plank or Wilson vibe.
---
is the dick glitch who turn people into dicks for using it. remember children dont be dicks dont glitch
---
Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go
---
All good advices, thank you.  
---
I do have 2 machines, and one is specialized in chems. They're labeled with the small 'chems' and 'ammo' stickers, I can probably do better.  
---
Anyway, I've sold some chems today, so It gets better!
---
Yes, These wending machines probably can buy only regular items, like junk and consumables. Need screws? tell everyone you want to buy them and set up the price, maybe someone will sell you them
---
We tried that. The explosions kept instantly killing us. We let a mole rat attack us with no armor on lol.
---
I'm selling a drill in my vendor for 10k
---
Im online and at the lake
---
If I get a rolling pin I’m gonna furious
---
it may be hard to do so with legendary gear. but simple stuff like bulk junk it could work
---
Always appreciated
---
lol he blocked me...typical
---
I have been trying to get this since Day 1 and haven't had it drop yet.
---
 The Sword stacks anti armour with Incisor, and with appropriate care and feeding can be quite strong.
---
Thank you for this information.
---
I LOVE this
---
aw man im sorry to hear that.. I was hoping they have figured out how to fix it...what system are you on?
---
Got someone. Ty anyways.
---
Yes, and these machines probably should reserve stash space for items you want to buy
---
Lol. That’s awesome. I did the TSE thing with another character and it worked. Maybe we just got lucky.
---
XB1X
---
i hope so!
---
You lost me at 200k caps
---
I owe my soul to the company store
---
I'd prefer just "mic?" over no mic. Then you could ask if someone has one or hit the no emoji first to say you don't have one. I'm always looking for folks with mics but it's hard to tell who's anti social and who's just in a party already.
---
*vroom*
---
Lol, I’ve just been doing the whole shop/ trader thing since early in the game.  It’s pretty easy to do once you get started with some good items.
---
It is a strategy that has been around for a long, long time and lots of players utilize it.  I would just like for more people to be aware of why it is done and especially for lower levels to take a second and really look at what's going on before they jump in there get busy.
---
Death it is.
---
Jungle Japes theme in the mire would be pretty bomb.
---
I did this one and it was pretty straightforward and easy , how can people messed this one up.
---
The idea was more about increasing traffic camp and promoting socialization in general than exclusively maximizing vender profits. Had no idea an idea like this would be so unpopular...
---
to craft some serums, to craft useelss water filters, and probably to craft something else that I dont remember (shielded underarmor?).
---
Fast travel keeps failing, just drops me out of the map and I have to keep trying, never happened before, must be the changes from this patch 9
---
Both
---
Me: Reads the post.
---
Thinks: Ok I can agree.
---
Reads:"may all your 3* be wooden" 
---
Me: Whoa there, calm down, nobody deserves that!
---
Read edit: Everything's fine.
---
But seriously, I will remember that and say it the next time I see someone one-shoting all the legendary enemies in nuked Whitespring. Nice addition to my vocabulary.
---
Not being funny but they are challenges for free atoms. At the end of the day if Bethesda want to keep this game going for years to come they NEED to have a revenue stream. They aren't going to be able to keep the game going for 10+ years (as they did mention before) just from the revenue they get from the sale of the game.
---
For all the days where there are "hard" challenges there are many days when it is piss easy to get all the daily challenges within 30 mins - 1 hour of gameplay.
---
At least Bethesda give a somewhat viable way to get their premium currency, unlike some other game companies I know of.
---
Btw if you tag over one person none will be notified,create post and tag ppl individually
---
:( still bugged
---
Ever have it bug and not advance after finding the missing camper’s items? I just failed one because of it. I collected all of the items and it never acknowledged it. 😢
---
if you’re on PC i think that happens due to mods and there’s a file you need to edit pointers or something like that.
---
I'll take it
---
This is a SUPER GOOD IDEA
---
How much you want for it and when
---
So based on 36% range 35% melee and 28% armor, for 5 extra scrip you get 71% chance at a weapon ....which exchanges back for more. Definitely best pick you need a large variety of things.
---
Got rid of healing factor, it super sucks for chems
---
There are 2 versions of this quest that I have seen.
---
One has a wendigo boss, the other a scorpion boss. This rock is from the scorpion version.
---
Edit:   You can tell the difference between them from the items you collect and the tape that is played after you collect them.
---
 One tape is of a boy collecting bugs the other is a tape of a girl screaming.
---
Why? Is that common in PC games?
---
What if we had player run radio stations
---
the game is basically unplayable without marsupial
---
I see both sides.
---
As a seller, I agree the weight penalty for individual parts is high.
---
But
---
As a buyer, I may not have enough caps for a full set, or I may only need one part.
---
I barely have enugh caps for the calibrated shock mod, much less what I imaging a full set might cost.
---
OTOH, the (not X01) PA suit I have is only one piece short of being all L50.  
---
I don't need to spend the caps on the other 5 L50 parts that make up the set - I have them already.
---
At which point I either have to scrap them, which seems like a waste off caps, or try and resell them, leaving me with the same weight dilemma.
---
Bethesda never said they have a algorithm that would detect what was duped.
---
They ran a script that was supposed to delete multiples of the same legendaries on the same character, it didn’t work.
---
They hotfixed it this morning. You are asking for something that has already happened.
---
There's a random event spot just down the main road from Bogtown. Occasionally it can spawn a Megasloth being attacked by three yao guai. I think they'd already won on one server hop though, because I only saw the yao guai, but luckily that was the last one I needed
---
I know, and I have it, but if traveling, say, really far north and it’s a 27 cap travel (with Travel Agent), and I see a Camp relatively close to where I’m going and it’s only 16 caps, I’m gonna hit up the camp. While I’m there probably take a look around, say hey to the owner and check their stock.
---
Im digging my junkie build. Just changed it up a bit, 2 vanguard, sentinel, ap refresh. 2 bolstering, sentinel, ap refresh. 1 sentinel, assassin, ap refresh. Im not the tankiest build but its interesting to say the least.
---
We can't even hijack a radio tower from Super Mutants to broadcast an emergency message requesting for people to run naked through a nuke zone with you to everyone in West Virginia.
---
Oh, so that's why people often are advertising that they want to buy rubber...
---
I got the level 1 2 and 3 inside a silo
---
I thought this was known behavior, but good job bringing visibility to those that don't know it.
---
I still have to wait several seconds to even have my controls enabled.
---
I've noticed that the only people bothering to grind nuke launches are always doing this strat now and I love it. Thanks for your work.
---
The ones I habitually hit: level 2s in Appalachian Antiques and Watoga High School, level 0 in Huntersville. Haven't looked too hard for a 1 or a 3 yet, since I'm in no hurry to do another nuke run.
---
I agree, I tend not to buy on the open market though. Especially after playing hell trying to do a trade for a few serum recipes. It is just not worth my time trying to rely on someone else to meet and have what I want when I want it. 
---
I do think it is great that the price is coming down on items, even if it is due to illicit activities. But in the long run, the economy in this game is shit, and it will probably be shit for awhile. But with the implementation of the player vending I think bethesda has taken a strong step to making the economy better.
---
i mean clearly i can, because i'm not pouting and going *UGH, unsubbed!*
---
Not always
---
Handmades have always been the OP PvP weapon. Anti armor explosive or bloodied explosive.
---
ah well, dang, i was hoping they have fixed it, maybe somehow my team and i just got lucky this weekend...?
---
It isn't changing anything aside from forcing mule characters for caps, which is already happening.
---
Good man
---
gotcha
---
Thanks bud
---
Dont eat the badges!
---
There is a 25% chance of getting a badge. I have gotten 5 badges from this quest.
---
Earned* frick.
---
That’s not toxic, that’s you getting outplayed. 
---
And if you want a TSE whatever for yourself so you can’t complain that’s why the other guy is winning(and I guarantee you it’s not the reason he’s beating you), then go buy one of the million super cheap dupe tse up for sale right now like everyone else.
---
yeah, well... that means they need to fill all slots with mules... which keeps the gene pool cleaner.
---
If they could do this with ALL characters, and not need mules? The economy will just reset to that NEW level.
---
Your a star! I am on PC and I have four mods, I'll find out now what needs changing in my Fallout76Custom.ini as I bet it's in that one.
---
Exactly. Dancing has been a part of many MMOs for literally decades. Sometime you want to dance with your squad.
---
They will be added later possibly with vault 51 or 52, whatever that one is. If not then after nuclear winter we get companions for sure with the 3rd dlc wave, so they will be in game then for sure.
---
Yeah we are seeing 2-3 of the masses and the the fluids on secondary drops also.
---
Very well. Crit damage handmade melts just about anything, man or machine or mutant.
---
There still there I got 3 today it’s just random
---
did you see the vidoio of the player using a legendary drill during a WS nuke run?   
---
 Its impressive...
---
:O
---
Yes! i recognize having seen the name of that .ini file. it’s usually like 4 lines to edit... im sure there’s a bazillion results for that one on google.
---
I get this randomly, standing or  crouched or watever. Its annoying
---
It’s still there man I got 3 today it’s just random man
---
Dailys, events, grafton monster has a few places he spawns for a quick 100 or so xp
---
Use to be up to 3, did they change it again?
---
1200c and Ill be on around 6 EST if that works.
---
Not for a fortune but people will occasionally purchase 1star bloodied, furious, anti armor, and instigating items
---
I've read one also has a flatwoods monster boss. It's supposed to change depending on what you do, but from what I can tell, it's just random depending on what items you find and what the dialogue says
---
All other grenade and mine plans show up fairly regularly as random drops in explosives chests. 200-300 caps is probably fair for that sort of plan. They're fairly common and not that popular, but annoying to find if you're missing one for your collection.
---
Yeah, it always brings your hopes up for a successful fight when you see a well placed nuke.
---
Unsure , some guy told me about a while ago to prevent spamming.
---
Personally I gotten a response before just by tagging one person u/valseek
---
No renamed items will display the default name to others, or drop the name change if traded or dropped
---
I agree that there should be tougher enemies, but i feel like it shouldn't be a colonel gutsy. Maybe some more monsters or buffing deathclaws, something like that
---
Hell yeah ! Take my money !
---
It will sometimes glitch on the finding items stage and give you no quest markers, items, or credit, depending on the version of the glitch. If one breaks, it's not just hard, it's impossible.
---
Why is everyone suddenly after this?
---
Just use your fists
---
Tell that to all my weapons in my stash , only two are viable with my previous build and none of the one I used before are worth anything
---
That is, in fact, the highest order of bullshit if people can stick up machine gun towers and play them off as a shop I should be able to plink those same turrets down from 300M with the can opener (my pipe bolt action that gets both sets of perk cards until they fix that but until they do it gets both handgun and rifle perk cards and hits harder than almost anything else I normally have on hand)
---
Lol buddy, you clearly haven’t experienced these weapons in PvP. Fireproof and dense mod make no difference to the legacy lasers, they will still shred you, and fast. Sentinel makes no difference either because with the splitter mod on guns like the laser and Gatling plasma, the stagger chance is crazy high.
---
Dude me too! Every single time I log on 😥
---
Oh wow. Did not know this.   I have not seen the Grafton monster. I do it solo quite often so I'll have to test out different ways to complete it.
---
The only difference I can make that I can think of is what I do around the campfire.  i.e. Eating, drinking and Emotes.
---
At the flooded train yard you can have either anglers, ghouls or Mirelurks spawn when you enter the area so that might be worth a try
---
yeah, we usually get updates on Tuesday unless there's a delay so getting something EARLY on a Thursday is weird
---
Leaving the drop-site outside the zone is a trade-off.   
---
It makes it possible for lower level characters to participate, and for characters who dislike power armor.  
---
It makes the fight (much?) easier, with the side effect of less flux, less glowing &amp; hardened mass, less highly radiated fluid, and less legendary mobs dropping legendary loot.  It cuts the size of the actual nuke zone roughly in half, as the bottom half of the circle is actually off the map, and gives the SBQ an excuse to wander off the map...
---
Is it better? I'm honestly not sure. I never really minded the jog in from Alpha... (and the slow/painful/overencumbered fight/walk back to Watoga...). 
---
But I'm also a lazy biznatch who doesn't like running silos, so thank you for doing the work on that ;)
---
I will, this Sunday Sunday Sunday!!!!
---
Easiest way: You'll find level 0, 1, and 3 terminals in the Penitentiary close to the main entrance, one of each level. Unlock them and server hop two more times.
---
Level 2 terminals are in Watoga: one in the Transit Hub, one in the diner to the east of the Shopping Mall.
---
EDIT: A third lvl 2 terminal in Watoga would be on the upper floor of the E.M.S. Building, next to the questgiver robot.
---
Shh they’ll nerf us
---
I’m hoping we get a paragon level system like diablo where you gain these per account versus per character.  I won’t mind per character, but I’d like to see a system that won’t discourage trying out new builds.
---
1000 and you got a deal
---
Sucks man...
---
Have your tried pulling the plugs and do a TOTAL restart? Internet and so on...
---
Well I’m sure you probably have. Just wanted to make sure. Maybe a complete restart both for PS, servers and internet to connect at fresh. 
---
Hope it works for u soon again!!
---
Example? You could shoot me in my full Sentinal assassin with a non legendary shotgun and take half my health now.
---
I usually run my Tesla tags a bunch. Last time 3 times I did the event everyone used Tesla so more then not people know the ettiquette
---
I think I'll try one with just eating and drinking and 1 with just Emotes.
---
For the chemist possom badge challenges, one of them is craft a plasma grenade.
---
Huh. I’ve only done the event twice, but I thought the kindling collection part was referring to harvesting wood scraps from logs and stuff, similar to Fasnacht. I never noticed markers on my HUD for the actual kindling. I guess that explains why the meter never went up after collecting scrap. Thanks for the tips.
---
Yeah, but it's almost every time for me.
---
Cool. I believe I saw that in one of your other posts. Thanks for the insight into this stuff. My Campfire Tales percentage where I get a badge on a successful run is closer to 15%. At least with some of the challenges you’re guaranteed something for your time!
---
I was also today years old when I found out, it's a rare reward though
---
Oh okay, thanks.
---
There is one shot protection for PVP. Occasionally it bugs out and stops working, but normally you cannot die from a single instance of damage. It all gets reduced to around 200 damage or so. Someone with only a single point in endurance has 250 HP. That means it takes two shots to kill you at full health. Bloodied users have only one third of their life bar. That puts them into one shot territory. Bloodied is a disadvantage in PVP.
---
Yeah they removed the bowl without a mention for return (maybe we were all too cheeky on the nukashine tab lol) 
---
About the keg, as far as it seems it's not implemented yet.
---
Sorry to say that but your bar will have to wait a little bit longer to get the last touch.
---
That’s good news!
---
Awesome, thanks! 
---
Is "objectName" what goes in the map legend, or does each individual pair of coordinates need a name?
---
For example:
---
Scene
---
Travel
---
Is this correct?
---
Ah good to know, cheers
---
I had this problem too and had to move the camp.  See my post about the new glitch around stairs.
---
Dicks out for Harambethesda.
---
The fissure closest to Kerwood Mine has dead Megasloths that spawn around it, and those count. Other fissures have dead Yao Guai.
---
Otherwise, taking the Bog Town workshop can be attacked by Anglers and Radtoads.
---
What I have seen is a lot of posts that are already downvoted enough that they wont get any traction have massive downvotes to every single comment the OP makes.
---
Even when many of the comments the OP makes are simple clarifications of their point, or even replies to direct questions of other commenters.
---
It seems like it's not even a simple break of reddique (don't use the downvote as a disagree button), but people are of the mindset that 'I don't agree with something OP put in the main post therefore nothing he writes should ever be seen'
---
It's not at all. If you have anything that is semi or full auto then that makes no difference in ttk.
---
I have this problem also
---
I thought dense mod and fireproof was effective against explosive guns. Is it not?
---
I thought executioners and radiation damage was effective against bloodied builds, it it not?
---
Sounds like your armor was carrying your PVP skills. I mean this in the nicest possible way, I know you won't take it like that, but it's true.
---
Learn to adapt.
---
Ceramic, glass, concrete and bone have very little use outside camp construction. If you're doing craft/scrap to unlocks mods for weapons (eg. lever, handmade rifles) then you'll be limited primarily by screws, with rubber being the limiting factor for most armor types. Weapon modding is mostly screw-limited again, while armor modding varies heavily depending on your preferred mods. Repairing tends to be heavy on aluminium and adhesive, plus ballistic fiber for armor.
---
Since the Scrapper perk was buffed, you don't need to keep much steel around. A buffer of 200 is fine, or even less if you don't do much crafting. I don't keep much wood either as I only use it for cooking, and it's easy to farm. Cloth can be dumped if you don't need gunpowder. Never keep actual gunpowder in stash, as acid and cloth weigh less.
---
That's why I'm trying to educate people to really look at the map before zipping over. That luxury only works if we don't have to put our gear back on and run in there and try to kite her back over away from the eager, but clueless players who want to fight her in the rad zone.
---
Hope it [does!](https://www.google.pt/search?q=proof+meaning&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=pt-pt&amp;client=safari)
---
Am I the only person who wants a legendary drill?
---
That works.
---
In this example I'd need a way of advertising that the seller can craft PA on-demand  but the weight restriction is too much to put a bunch of random pieces in storage. Maybe armor display racks where we could display which types and pieces we can craft. Not a trivial solution for sure.
---
I've taken to giving the thumbs down emoji when assholes with TSEs obliberate enemies before anyone has a chance.
---
It will save you of you are in PA and the dense mod will let you live through maybe one extra bullet.
---
Lol nice find bud many thx :)
---
Its to simulate stubbing your toe or your battle worn joints jolting with occasional pain. ;)
---
I have, but they haven't done much to me,  so it's likely I was against players that need more "gud." I don't bother with Dodgy, as automatics are pretty ubiquitous. This is the kind of information I was looking for, and I appreciate it. I've had lots of luck with auto weapons and tormentor. I'd assume they use the laser rifle fire DoT mod for extra burninating as well? Would legacy plasma rifles be comparable?
---
Since you have to launch a nuke to have a chance at this at all, hack all the terminals in a silo first, then do the level zero at the lighthouse three times.
---
As if you could survive prior to that nerf... I would one/two-shot you whether you liked it or not. Believe it or not but any vats rifles are damn powerful. Funny how only bloodied or explosive weapons get the hate...
---
Also you can use fireproof (i think) and dense mods. Voila, explosive guns are meh. Another funny thing is how you said
---
&gt;Now there is no armor or combination of perks that can stand up to bloodied weapons or explosive weapons.
---
when we clearly have anti-explosive defenses.
---
Honestly, I feel like 76 has been my favorite Fallout. 
---
The 76 experience has been incredible. I stopped playing for a while because of school but now that I’m back into it I am just as happy and surprised as I was when I first bought this game. I have made myself a wasteland photographer and i go around taking pictures of people and places. I’m not amazing at it, but having 7 people huddle for a group pic just for my entertainment and snapping a picture of these complete strangers is awesome as hell. 
---
I can’t think of any game where I can just fuck around and have fun like 76 and it really helps with my stress. Definitely going to be sad when the game shuts down.
---
This will be easy for me since I seem to be the only one that ever uses the pylons.
---
 I had to be the conduit for all 3 pylons so many times I hesitate going there any more.
---
 Most people either stand around with thumbs up their asses or fire at the boss without damaging him.
---
 I am Amazed how many people don't actually follow directions or read the quests. Mind boggling.
---
They are getting fucking stupid with this shit.
---
Thanks for your post. I'm such a filthy casual that I didn't even know there was a sheepsqatch event...
---
Yes but a lot of people are quitting. The only end game content for many players is survival and they keep nerfing it patch after patch.
---
I guess I got a splinter kneeling on that porch roof.  ;)
---
You cannot normally one shot someone in PVP, so I do not see how lowering your health to 30% thus allowing others to one shot you is good for PVP.
---
Unreleased, most likely...
---
Already launched a nuke and completed the test, terminals are all I have left
---
Solo with no alts I used to sneeze 2.5k a day between robot vendors, drops, and events.  If I was really on it 3k.   That was without trading or selling to other players of any kind.  Now with player vending I'm making upwards of 10k a night. Three things keeping people poor.
---
Buying ammo or junk.  Just stop.  Farm everything and keep every last cap to yourself.
---
Trading caps back and forth in pvp is not profitable and shouldn't be.
---
Get out of the friggen Whitespring and play the rest of the game.  Seriously.
---
You have to set up a line cotton candy bites and wait to let ol'slothy take the bait... It's magic.
---
actually yes, however the things were already at sale when I did remove the wire so "In theory" the CAMP limit must be higher than that.
---
However I will consider removing the machine or the orders to try adding again the wire on its place.
---
I dont know if this is some kind of bug on "how much space do anything require on the camp budget" that just is different on the time "you place it"and once you relog into a server... 
---
Like if, for example lets say Wire takes 2 CAMP Units when deployed, but by error when you jump into a server that wire gets recognized as anything that requires instead 4 CAMP units... so...
---
I could build a house.. and add on that session lets say 10 cables = (20 Camp units) but then I go out, and in relog the server gets those are (40 Camp units) making the server believe I am at higher budget llimit... (lets say if the max would be 200, they got like I have 220/200.... so even removing stuff, Im still "over the maximun limit"...
---
That would be one plausible consecuence for this kind of error... I wount be surprised looking the trouble arround the Power Armor weight limit bonuses such the Mining PA, getting rangom x2 (+200) capacity or bugs where a PA only gives you 10 adicional weight... etc.
---
Thnx this helps
---
I agree mate the amount of times I've shot players thinking they where gouls is unreal then they think you want to pvp then it leads to a dinner date then back home for coffee 😅
---
I think auto handmade with -25% vats cost is 8-9 AP per shot. Combat rifle is 7 per shot. Is pretty good...
---
He was right in Doddy sods, few ft from the workshop. Thought he was a mob at first tried to kill him
---
That sucks man. I have only had it happen once so far but now I'm super paranoid and check my camp the second I log in every time now...
---
They should since metal armor has lower energy resistance
---
Yes!  One time a participant DC'ed immediately after picking up the missing camper's item on the picnic veranda (where the armor bench is) and the quest could not advance.  I was in a team with another player and went so far as to quit the game entirely and rejoin in hopes that the item would show up for me.  No luck.
---
An easy solution for this problem would be to make the missing camper's items appear with one or two extra pieces.  That would be an easy failsafe/redundancy device to ensure that if one or two items fail to register for any reason, the rest of the participants still have a buffer for advancement.
---
You don't have too haha, just is how it works. Mix bloodied with a stealth boy, medx and sentinal/assassin's, dodgy and serendipity with high luck and crits. Tell me that's an easy fight.
---
1st off, nice flex... I guess? 
---
2nd the fireproof perk doesn't do nearly enough to save you unless you are in PA so that arguement is invalid.
---
3rd, the dense mod will let you survive maybe 1 extra bullet from a handmade. There is no real "anti explosive" defense for PvP
---
One reason it happens is because Well Fed ends.
---
Yessss.  My Bloodied Deathclaw and Mole Miner Gauntlets do around 1900 damage but my Bloodied Meat Hook does about 2600.
---

Yep not even going to bother.
---
As the melee tank in a group of squishy sneak snipers, I know this pain.
---
FIGHT ME LIKE A MAN, DEATHCLAW! STOP RUNNING FROM THE INEVITABLE.
---
I've had this happen to me since the patch too! I was in the middle of nowhere walking and just got hit by nothing.
---
Are you sure the timer isn’t starting? Even if hidden there can be an enemy within the radius.
---
Hehe...
---
I was born one day, when the sun didnt shine
---
Two words: punji traps &gt;:)
---
Thank you - I had the same questions and never though the mission was referring to the actual game challenges. Makes it strangely pseudo-meta - challenges on that list are about the game as well as referred to in the game. Honestly, I was lost on the Pioneer Scouts missions until this simple realization. I feel a bit silly now.
---
The best is getting only one leg, then you can start your own parade around the whitesprings loop.
---
This is amazing. Out of interest... Which site would you pick if you were me? The one I fancy is right on a spot where 2 yao guai spawn.. I bloody hate yao guai
---
Yeah.  No ticking, no symbol in the corner.
---
I think it's really an admission of defeat for them for bugs like inaccessible enemies or players getting stuck in geometry, or always stuck in danger.
---
Doesn't matter when you can fire out multiple bullets a second.
---
The economy is already at this level. Items already cost more than 25k many times and sell for it.
---
Challenges have gotten ridiculous. I was able to buy Patriot paint in the beginning because the challenges were decent now I'm lucky if I break 400 for the stupid possum hat
---
damn i wouldnt wish that on my worst enemy
---
It was popular when it was new because it’s a whole side quest deal, and you get a free go. If you get to the end and the computer doesn’t work that means that the server is on the cool down. Just go to a new one and try the computer again.
---
Heheh, my stock, bolt action pipe rifle does 223 damage and is virtually unbreakable. I can one shot quite a few things with her and do it for days.
---
I dont know why the hell they made the level up once into something where you have to complete 3 criteria out of 5 to get 10 atoms. as someone who is 130+ I dont level up as much and barely make it to 1 level per day. so why do I need to have 3 challenges to complete just for 10 atoms. what was wrong with the old one where I just get about 10 atoms a day for leveling.
---
Hmm.  Maybe.  I tend to keep well fed and hydrated, but - speed demon
---
haha...I'm glad he doesn't aggro on us when we accidentally attack him like the Whitesprings bots do.  I wouldn't be able to count the number of times he'd have kicked my ass if that was the case :D
---
I have been lugging around a lvl 35 suppresors 10mm for 110 levels I only use it when I dont want to one shot everything.
---
We do need a way to charge less than a cap a round badly.
---
“Whitespring Fever” I know that one... Stupid sexy Unruly Golfers
---
Definitely not when this is happening.  It even happens standing in my camp, and I don't have any.
---
Crits don't matter when I pop a stealth boy.
---
I've had this sporadically happen since the last patch as well.  It's not Fast Travel aborting itself - it's like the option just "falls through."
---
ugh dude but did you hack the terminals in the silo? If you did you should only have level 0 and maybe a 1 left
---
I'm fine with daily challenges being hard, but they should really give more Atoms.  Like 30 or 40 the same amount the lengthier weekly challenges give.  Not just 10 or 20.
---
Enjoy your scenic lake visits
---
I gave up trying to find it after 10 hours of server hopping at the water park.
---
Yeah I sit there for a second thinking I'm at a loading screen and then realize "Nope".
---
The important perk for the laser rifles is tank killer. Tormentor is nice for people who don’t run adamantium, but all of the top end PvP’ers do. Yeah everyone’s running the fire DoT because it somehow isn’t negated by dense or fireproof and can take half a bloodied builds 20% hp, by itself. Legacy plasma rifles never had a chance to drop because plasma rifles only dropped as 1* until a couple of patches ago.
---
Bulk ammo seems like the easiest solution, it’s like that or what implement a decimal system to caps which just sounds ridiculous
---
I’m on Xbox but thanks for the offer
---
pretty much how gamers are these days...bitch first and THEN realize it was user errror
---
Happens to me a lot! But the worst is when you die by accidentally taking toxic goo instead of food or water... T\_T
---
Heard it’s Battle Royale for legendary players
---
appreciate this post, realized I being doing the event wrong.
---
Oh course there would be only one trai and you could have a cool down per player.
---
Player A goes to the white springs. He selects it and is tooken to an new cell for the cab. Other plays see the train go by as controls in the cab glow. On glowing the player clicks (or presses the button on console) while overed other it, a little like fallout who if you have ever played it. Once at the location you have to wait 10 mins before you can use it again but now that one train is at the white springs player B can take it to sutten
---
Whew.  I'm a bloodied build so I was thinking NOPE NOPE NOPE
---
I've done it solo \~6 times, and never had to add the kindling to the fire, just ran back and forth as it respawns, and the bar fills for each bit you pick up. Makes it easier to keep the fire alive during the last round as well since you already have some kindling picked up.
---
Even worse is when you constantly hit the stimpack button when you're trying to bring up the challenges. ;)
---
Sounds easy, since it seems like I'm the only one that knows the damn things are there. 
---
_you guys just keep attacking the invincible shimmering deathbot tho, well done_
---
At the end of the nukashine quest Biv asks you to come back, he gives you a daily taste test quest and you get a new recipe each day
---
It's because of the hood; the backpack and hood would clip with each other.
---
It seems dumb to think about because a lot of things clip through each other, but they do care about character's appearance and making sure outfits look good because it seems every other patch a change is made with certain outfits to prevent clipping with some items
---
You don’t say... I’ll have to check that out.
---
Eh in my camp you can always take the stairs to the roof and jump. Actually there's a missing wall on the second floor that works as well
---
Word up. Thanks for the info!
---
Even more odd...when you're a male character and you randomly take damage with female character sounds....and no one else is anywhere near. Or when you randomly get hit in the head by Technical Data that flew at you from out of nowhere.
---
You can use animal friend to pacify the Queen, this draws her out of her fighting in the blast zone and hopefully draws her your way!
---
You should have both... Even if you don't have the distilling station, it still distills slowly in your inventory. I believe. I haven't played since the update that added that.
---
Nothing I said was bitchy, and I didn't delete the post as it might help others.
---
It is weird that the bloodied effect becomes non visable unless you have a bloodied weapon active.
---
And it definitely wasn't user error..... Nothing I did was an error.
---
So pipe down.
---
You should have both the brewing station and the fermenting station in your CAMP build menu under Crafting, once you've finished the Nukashine quest. There's not a separate "distiller."
---
So chemist and musician are not completable. Any others?
---
Just server hop and waste caps, and time....and sanity.
---
Base building for me. 
---
Can't count how many times I've heard the drip sound to alert me of my hydration when I'm working on my camp.
---
I just went to the encryptid event and waited for someone to be downed in the water in the middle of the fight and revived them. It got me the revive and the water revive for the swimming badge.
---
I've assumed this is because some chem effect just wore off, but I'm not sure
---
I can sell them to the vendors for a little over 400 caps, so I price them all at 500 caps in my machines.  They are a good seller.  I just make a bunch of them (with Super Duper equipped) and keep about 5-10 of each in the machine at once.  Marsupial sells the most followed by Speed Demon and then Healing Factor.
---
This is one of the reasons why I'm glad I'm a heavy gunner build, I can just fire into a crowd for tags so that everyone else can get a hit, a few shots from one of my explosive weapons won't kill the mole moners in Uranium Fever so no worries there!
---
I mean......"general public" to use a very broad brush.  People still die by touching live electrical cables with their bare hands and fall off cliffs while trying to take epic selfies.  I'm just trying to disseminate knowledge so that more people have a good idea of what's happening and don't run around like headless chickens.
---
The event is pretty straightforward if you keep looking at the what the HUD asks and guides you to do, but some people get tunnel vision when activity is happening in front of them and ignore peripheral stimuli when engaged in conflict.  I certainly do when a pair of lvl 76 yao-guai start kicking my ass around, or I'm in a sparring session in real life.  It's hardwired into our brains and we can only over-ride it when we have the resources to not feel the danger of imminent death, ie high end weaponry and gear.  If a lower level player is getting all they can handle with a half dozen bloodbugs swarming them, I cast no blame for instinctual self preservation.  They're still being very helpful by eliminating those bugs.
---
My instigating DCG is at about 300 off a team and 400+ on a team. Which is enough to one shot most enemies. I don't run a min.max build and I think that those numbers are pretty good. Add in rank 3 glow sighted and I am a squishy force to be reckoned with in a nuke zone.
---
I miss having to eat Gumdrops.
---
Where do you get wood? there are literally trees and fallen logs and wood piles all over the place that you can harvest. For the water pumps - yes you do need to acquire plans.
---
I still have to wait as well. Hell I’ve even noticed it to be worse this patch lol. Enemies are invisible longer it seems or my favorite glitch is when all the enemies are laying on the ground dead but are following you around doing damage. Nothing like running whitesprings and have loads of seemingly dead ghouls “slithering” toward you. I just shoot till I hit their hit boxes or the couple minutes go by for them to actually load properly
---
I think most people know, they just don't wanna spend the stims or have junk and don't wanna risk dying. Its a free rider problem that leads to many incomplete sheep events
---
You do realize that i'm going to use my crit strategically. If the first hit is the crit people will usually panic and pop a stimpack first. That gives me enough time to take a second shot; the one that kills the target.
---
There used a bug that was pretty rampant in the days around launch, and it had something to do with connectivity delays (not always on your part) and the game thinking you took damage during the delay. 
---
It was kinda the reason I stopped for a bit, because I had been scrapping and had a GOOD BIT, full health and in power armor. Then *plbt*
---
Dead, no rhyme or reason.
---
Agent Gibbs, is there something you've been hiding from us?
---
;)
---
Fallout 76 is obviously the buggiest and the least polished Bethesda game. Thats a fact. And it still has a lot of bugs and inconsistances, including gameplay, design and graphical issues. Do I hate the game? Sometimes. Do I think it was released too soon? Absolutely. Do I think that this game could have been much better and it has enormous potential? Yes. 
---
No hate, but this game have TONS of issues still. Someone oppinion wont change in what state game is. "I love the game" is as useless as "I hate the game". But constructive and fair negative oppinion with examples and context is highly beneficial for overall game health. Especialy for online one. I personaly actively worked with support by presisely describing every single bug I expirienced during the game. And I encourage everyone to do the same.
---
If you passionate about the game and hate or love it, thats understandable. But you need to temper your emotions and focus on what could be done by you as a player to make the game better if you want for it to be better(it desperately needs it, currently)
---
i was looking for it all day one time, going to every location and eventually gave up and resorted to asking people on the server if they had a camera i could buy, then by random luck i found her at the mothman museum by the statue. it’s annoying how static the spawn is but it is possible.
---
im sorry to hear that.... bummer.. what system are you on btw?
---
I think anything that boosts your max HP does this, so it's the #1 hazard of playing Bloodied. Died a few times to Psychobuff before I realised my error.
---
This is also the only way the top tier players will fight the queen. (Bloody unyeilding)
---
The website is not entirely correct, or the sheet dps in game is not quite correct, because yeah.. things don't add up. I'm using my in game character sheet values when holding the weapons. I don't have a bloodied hunting rifle, but I think I do have a gauss, laser, and ultracite laser. I don't think I know all the mods though. It's easier to compare on heavy weapons, because they adjusted them to fall into either a fire rate of 92 or 184 on pretty much all of them I think.
---
&gt; So they dupe weapons and sell them until they have lots of caps
---
For caps they just duped nukas, each nuka give a cap on use. I remember seeing a screen on reddit of someone with a really high amount of nuka bottles.
---
I just avoid situations where I could die, because at any particular time I've probably got \~700 lbs of junk on me..
---
Except I stealth boy at the beginning of every fight, wouldnt get the chance
---
"chasing his tamed deathclaw as it goes on a rampage through Watoga"  I super lolled at this. Thanks.
---
Just to add on to OP's point, regardless of where you drop, try and keep the edge as far away from dropsite v9 as you can. This is where players will be hanging out a good 75% of the time. When the rad zone is right up against it, the queen will land in the rads and all the heavy hitting bloodied melee builds will run in to do their thing, and end up dying to rads as they get up to her. You want them to be able to do their thing, unless youre running a BE heavy weapon, youre not coming even close to their damage output. Help them help you, because while they may have a 3000+ dps weapon, they can be killed by a strong breeze.
---
Wrong sub?
---
Thanks.  I'll be on the lookout for that and see if it correlates.  I'm more often under the influence of Glowing Meat Steaks or Grilled Radstag.
---
To begin the questline go to a railroad stop. Find a poster for the party (i recommend the charleston stop as all of tge quest revolve around there). 
---
Once read the quest begins and you need to go to the frat house. After you finish that sequence youll want to go just south of the college to big als tattoo parlor. Inside the new building youll want to open the nukacola machine and go down and around to the back room. Youll meet biv. After talking to biv he'll want to drink a fresh nuka cola. Youll need to go to ANOTHER frat house to find a password to the backroom. Once inside youll be able to make him one and USE THE FAST FERMENTER. 
---
 After you finish all that youll be able to build and use the distillery stuff.
---
The only place I can really see you running into trouble is when you have to head to the control room.  Prior to that you can hack and lock pick your way through.  Once you have to repair the mainframe you might be in trouble from there on out.
---
It's really simple, if I kill 4k 3-stars and you kill 40 3-stars, I will have about 100x more drops than you. I will have more caps, junk and ammo. Everything that I have can be sold for caps. My caps can be used to buy more high tier gear. The excess amount of time and effort I put into the game literally "earned" me more and better gear than you.
---
But i'm usually the one who's starting the fight....
---
What do mysterious quills do?
---
Yeah it is a good suggestion and as far as I can tell all the mechanics already exist. Just give the bulked item 0 value at normal vendors.
---
Absolutely true, and it's happened to me more than once.  However, I don't want to address glitches and bugs as those aren't part of the intended event.  It's just an unfortunate thing that will hopefully be ironed out over time.  My advice is coming from a "perfect world" standpoint.
---
Yeah I know some of them do that but there are a lot who just have no clue.
---
If I'm only on one conduit I barely use any stim packs but once I do all 3 I go through like 30 or 40 per event.
---
Then it's back to farming ticks.
---
What does that mean? Just explaining the build can be easily combatted which I do already every fight I get in
---
And all of my efforts were for nothing when people dupe top tier gear by the thousands.
---
r/lostredditers
---
That's a pretty nice idea.
---
I server hopped on whitspring bc it has 2 spawns very close. One is the red car infront of whitesprings entrance. The other is the Miner Monument.
---
Someone spawned Sheepsquach last night and I was only person to show up, poor guy. On the bright side I finished electrician and two 3\* robots spawned and probably dropped better/same stuff the Sheep would of.
---
If others take the Pylons I can hold it still  and tank it the whole time with 5xTroubleshooter + Med X + Lone Wanderer 2 and blocking it's heavy attacks while smacking it with melee weapon. Others need to take the conduit though 😶I can't do both at once w/o dying instantly.
---
Also if you're downed wait out the 30s since you remain a conduit. So you don't really *have* to spam stimpaks.
---
Until they fix this, I'm still dropping excess ammo at train stations.
---
They didn't
---
Telling u right now I tried to do it as a lvl 100 in a full set of t60 lvl 50 used over 80 stimpacks and and insane amount of ammo
---
Just saw a video of a guy soloing the sbq doing this. It was insane how much damage he was doing. He didn’t even have a legendary rifle. Idk if he was exploiting something but he shows his build after and it was a stealth crit build with a combat rifle.
---
they are called "challenges" after all, not "gimme gimmies"
---
Nuke zone Challenge: just stand outside of the blast zone, one person run in, take the pic.  Expect to die.  Done. 
---
Grahm challenge: visit workshops until Grahm spawns, there are quite a few that he visits.  have a couple friends/teammates look for him as well and it'll be done soon enough.
---
Duel wielding pistols FTW ^_^
---
Maybe as a atomic shop outfit but chances are slim
---
That's something I want to do for a next iteration but currently no, it doesn't group them so you can get repeating object names unfortunately
---
A [commie whacker](https://youtu.be/El49mRqP7sw) would be perfect for this.
---
Or, if you're a filthy commie yourself, a protest sign would also be good.
---
At the raider’s note loot stash on survival. Marsupials only. If you bring friends we will assume you are the devs.
---
Doing god's work!
---
God, in this case, is the Mothman of course.  Hail Mothman!
---
PSN Yota151 I'm sending you a request now
---
The one true Moth and savior
---
..so that's a vote for "no" then? :)
---
I've noticed this quite a lot. Poor little ole me, a bloodied sniper, grabs a pylon and eats stimpaks like potato chips while heavily armored PA users run around like chickens with their heads cut off
---
It's the same thing in game..
---
as a melee player with maxxed sneak I think this would be easily doable
---
maybe I'll try it
---
That is very thoughtful, I applaud you, sir!
---
Many get their "one-and-done" gun then that's *all* they carry.
---
I’ll swing by
---
That is awesome, I  would like to see it,  but I have not yet had the opportunity to go to the camp fire  stories event, because it hasn't happened yet, at least for me. I put in overtime this weekend in game and nothing yet 35 hours since Friday. I  need to score the s'mores  and BlackBerry crumble recipe plans in order to finish my cooking merit badge. Lol. Maybe it's the luck of the draw! I also noticed that site Alfa was not working as well. Strange things happening in the wasteland, Dam gremlins.
---
Cool, this thread isn't about that and I'm sure we can have both.
---
I like the idea OP.
---
If the fire regenerated while you were solo, that means you destroyed all the insects that were depleting the fire's health.  The fire regens for the next wave and you're good to go.  Solo is way, way easier because the spawns are easily manageable.
---
It means that you're doing your stuff, wandering around or whatever then some dick headshots you out of nowhere with a crit. You have 1 second to react. 
---
More often than not the target fails to do anything meaningful and it dies. Then i'm running to their lootbag and quickly server-hop because i'm not just a dick, i'm also a coward and i'm not letting people have their revenge.
---
FFS - that's way better than my "get hit in the face" tank write up I made! I miss sneaky shooty some times, y'all are the real MVPs.
---
Sweet, we need to start a support group.
---
"There are more of us out there than you think!"
---
..mobs then? ya, that would be an issue the Mistress would be insufficient to
---
Thanks all... I tried bog town and the road south of there, then got the sloth at the fissure.
---
No, all your suggestion does is increase the amount of people coming to your camp... because it's next to the place they need to go.
---
Sadly duping still exists - even after they hotfixed that one method last week, there's another one. At this point I just kind of feel like "it is what it is".
---
So not in a head on fight? Any build is viable then
---
let me know how it goes!
---
Lol wtf
---
I get random staggers here &amp; there, I think it's delayed hits from previous battles or something.
---
But I'm pretty sure it's well fed. It'll kill ya with the right conditions.
---
Yeah I was just responding to the whole 'bUT iT's so eAsY' comment.
---
I do think it would be worth putting a little note next to the belonging section to say that people have experienced glitches there, just so new people aren't driving themselves crazy when it doesn't work.
---
I dont know how to get it but there is the squirrel scout banner in the camp workshop so i imagine its something.
---
Does this have to be in game? If not, I may have what you’re looking for!
---
Yeah, when the nuke is placed right and we're fighting the SQB out of the zone, I sneak up underneath the queen and vats hit her.  I do about 3-5% damage per hit.
---
Because I'm running one Chameleon armor piece and four Unyielding, my strength is 36.  With Ninja and stealth, I'm doing almost 8000 damage on the first hit. NOTHING takes more than one stealthed hit except Mirelurk Queens, SheepSquatches, Imposter SheepSquatches and Scorchbeast Queens.  Even ScorchBeasts are a single hit.  Mirelurk hunters get flung to the side while smaller things explode into a mist of blood.  I have to switch to a Tesla rifle in Uranium Fever so that I can hit the legendaries and not kill them.
---
Marsupial for overall utility.
---
Adrenal Reaction for insane damage - honestly even though it's been nerfed, I feel like running adrenal with a bloodied weapon is damn near mandatory now if you want to do respectable dps.
---
One of the few fantastic ideas I have seen on here.
---
I have high hopes you are right, but that one TSEx3 guy just can really wreck it.  
---
But there are great souls out there as well.  In the Uranium Fever in particular I'm thinking of, one kind soul would run to the elite, tag it, then make the "come here" emote!  More of this!
---
agreed. I sold a bloodied combat shotgun 1* for 800 caps the other day iirc.
---
My shop is a Bloodied Build shop, with mostly bloodied beginner stuff, lots of 1-2* bloodied, unyielding, and bolstering gear. A few other tidbits for the plan shoppers. Add me and come check it out, or find me in the wild! PSN FerretGR.
---
Hopefully whoever exploited the glitch will look me up in the game. I've got lots of caps and am tired of grinding this rigged RNG.
---
These are definitely damage.  I hear the heartbeat, and the "bam" of nerd rage and see my health climbing back up from almost zero.
---
the one tricky bit is the level with the broken reactor, I'll have to waste some radshield on it while trying to lockpick things. Or I could just die from radiation once or twice...
---
Will do.
---
The stealth boy is the only issue for me, but I could use the same thing and be just as much of an issue. So that is kind of a wash.
---
Everything else is easily ignored with an automatic critical hit. Serendipity is basically: flip a coin, heads you die, tails you die on the second shot. Bloodied is always two to kill. Serendipity bloodied is death on one shot half of the time.
---
I've sold ammo for 1 cap a piece consistently, and 5.56 for 2 caps and ultracite ammo for 3-4 per bullet. They are paying for my time spent farming and the mats I used.
---
Freestates vendor at whitesprings and Harpers Ferry sells them.
---
This is actually a really good idea and a breath of fresh air compared to the posts claiming that raising the limit will lower prices.
---
Have an upvote.
---
Cultist daggers are pretty awesome too.
---
Hearthstone is also one daily challenge per day that you can reroll, plus you get packs that affect gameplay from the challenge rewards, so it’s almost like the systems are too different to act like they should be comparable.
---
Yes, SOME do. And when the account cap is now set at 625,000 caps... items will cost 750,000 caps... and we're back at square one. 
---
That's how this would go down.
---
To be fair, the first time I played this event, I didn't know about the pylon mechanic? And I hammered on an invincible squach. I hadn't finished the quest line myself, and had no idea what was going on.  That's no excuse if you know how it works, I'm now a pylon bearer.
---
More so, I am all in for player made radio stations, with the ability to put any music there. And for player made holotapes, with the ability to record some small  messages through voice chat on them.
---
I felt the same way until I just stopped bothering to log in.
---
&gt;I love the game, and have followed it's improvement since lunch
---
was there a new patch that got released this afternoon?
---
How do you handle the spin-up lag in group event situations though?  I took mine to Uranium fever once, but in several instances, by the time bullets were firing, the target was DOA.
---
Then I'd end up wasting ammo while looking around hoping to tag the next mob...
---
Ofc i'll avoid head on fights. I already said i'm a coward :D
---
You know you aren't an idiot because you obviously realize it is better to fight in the clear simply because you felt like an idiot for misplacing the shot.  Does that make sense?  If the right group shows up, it doesn't matter where you fight her.  Most experienced players come prepared simply because they do check zone placement on the map before they travel. My group does and we know what we are in for most times.  Even when she glitches, most experienced players will always stay in the fight right up until they see it's a losing battle.  It is very hard to control anything the Queen does after she gets in the air, but it is much better in the open for so many reasons.  Trying to prevent those 20 minute fights is just one of them.  Less resources is always better.  Vision is better for everything, especially spotting the low to the ground adds.  A lot of people like not having to fight her in their PA.  There are many bloodied players who like it because their rads are easier to regulate.  So yes, I think there are alot of advantages to this tactic.
---
It's not a no but it's not a yes this is a warning I did not stealth  If you stealth you might stand more of a chance
---
plus Iron Fist, Radicool, Nerd Rage and Bloody Mess
---
I'd pay 50 caps to watch this unfold.
---
TIL the legendary vendor will be a mole miner lady?!?
---
All I know is the gas cylinder on my BoS Engineer outfit is clipping through the bag, but I like it. It's in such a way it looks intentional.
---
Don't want them to fix it, but I'm guessing it eventually will be. Go chase dupers or something else pls.
---
Melee guys sometimes really chap my ass in these sorts of events. You either have the guys with the good builds that can one-shot everything, and you're chasing them around trying to get shots in on the legendaries, or you get the guys with the crap builds taking forever to keep up, because they have to whack those glowing ghouls at White Springs 10 times before they go down.  You almost feel obligated to sit and wait for them so they can run up and get a hit in.
---
It should just be an unspoken rule to run a ranged weapon when doing group events with lots of low-to-medium legendary mobs.
---
Funniest part is he went on about how he makes a living off this game. Even funnier is that I was 15 levels lower than him at most
---
I've gotten multiples, and the others have been 1nor 2 stars, but bbn I've never not had the 3 star. I did have an issue before I was high enough level to get 68s that ghouls or a regional horde would be in there and kill him before I could but. Always there. Your luck is terrible .
---
Did they fix it?
---
I had same issue.  Couldn't remove any floor pieces to get into my bunker.  So time to rebuild....thank you Bethesda.
---
There are level 1,2,and 3 at ATLAS obervatory. I think there are two seperate level 3 there.
---
Tesla gun works wonders.
---
Thank the lord XD, don't got to hog all 3 conduits for myself now
---
This is a confusing and uncomfortable interpretation.
---
Like they do the same thing just different skins? Can you not fast ferment outside of Bivs place?
---
Did it like 10 times no badge hopefully I get two in a row next time
---
Try the meathook. It's better.
---
I bet they changed it because they didn't like how easily everyone can get the daily challenges. Used to be challenges you'd complete by just playing the game, but now it seems most dailies require going out of your way to complete them. 
---
Like one daily the other day that required taking a camera picture of a player sneaking in the missile silo of Sugar Grove, or something like that. Even when you're playing with a group, it still is a challenge that requires going out of our way to do it and not as part of organically playing the game.
---
Harhar, you must be a dad
---
Darn - my drug shack needs a fully working bar im hoping the kegs have functionality. Would make my day.
---
no just nuke whitespring
---
you need better equipment than you have now to take on the queen
---
Heavy guns
---
But that doesn't even work, not in a case like Uranium Fever.  Everybody is on the team, and as long as a team member hits a mob and you are within distance (something like 100 meters), you get to loot.  All they are doing is depriving others of xp.
---
Now in Whitespring where that guy is not on my team, yeah, he's hogging them for sure.
---
as others have said, I'd probably run into some trouble in the control room mainly..is there nowhere to hide or you never have the opportunity..?
---
Thanks! I switched to face smash/shotgun for 76, after playing through NV and FO4 as sneaky/sniper.  It's fun to do "slow and steady" murder builds as long as you have a DPS buddy to help you.  I'm sure this "how-to" will be COMPLETELY obsolete within 90 days, but it's a fun  way to do it now.  Sure, I'll use a couple more stims than people, but it feels good to be wearing a walking machine of death.
---
That's one nasty glitch
---
I think a set of troubleshooters armor would be best. Something similar to what you would run for the Encryptid Event. Almost everything in both places are robots.
---
its not impossible,... but it is "challenging".  Grahm isn't hard to find, just takes some effort.
---
There will always be these douchebags, they know what they are doing and just dont care. It’s sad really...Reflects who they are in real life unfortunately.....
---
I want legendary undergarments
---
**AND FFS WHEN SOMEONE TANKING A PYLON GETS DOWNED STAY DOWNED FOR THE 30s. DON’T GIVE UP AND THE SHEEPSQUATCH STAYS VULNERABLE THE WHOLE TIME. 30 UNINTERRUPTED SECONDS IS ENOUGH TO TURN THAT FUCKER INTO SCHWARMA**
---
It would definitely make playing my support/doctor character a bit more rewarding for sure.
---
I'd be okay if they would just modify the loot table so that the legendary effects actually correspond to the weapon or armor. That's all I'm asking for. No more stalker's weapons or faster fire rate single shot weapons.
---
Absolutely, man.  For Free Range, I go poke the 'Squatch, then I ignore him and go tend cattle until I'm positive no more adds are coming.  Then I'lll switch back.
---
Could I buy the other high capacity plan off you?
---
Did all that but I only got brewing plans and if I go to someone's camp with both, it only lets me use the brewer, there's no action prompt on the distilling station.
---
Ooo I did that and it worked!
---
A little advice if you are a low level and want to get hits in, get a tesla rifle and tag everything that moves! If you see a player with their health bar on low that means regardless of their level they would not be able to tank hits from incoming mobs only so you can take a hit on them while you take your time getting to it. Bloodied builds usually one hit everything, and they also usually die in less than a fee goods hits as well.
---
Crit and Sneak attack multiplier math needs nerfing.
---
Well I don't know your you said you're going it with that  Mistresa of mystery or Whatever her name is so you would be a believe the Phantom device I don't know if those are good or not but they might help you if you have the stealth bits
---
I really think if you're on a team, as long as one of your team gets a hit, you should get loot and partial xp.
---
I Have a Camp in the Far Far South Called "Jay's" on PS4, made over +250K in sales in 3 days... 8 Mules plus my Main &amp; Wife's Main Characters Almost have full Bank accounts.
---
Most of my Rare Explosive Weapon are gone, but more to come soon. Thanks to all the Patrons who made this possible. Visit me if you see me on the map, I may have something you need at a more than reasonable price, massive discounts considering I have very very little room for more Caps.
---
It's pretty amazing for any large mob situation.  You're using the automatic version?  Have they fixed the bug where it'll just randomly stop doing permanent damage?
---
I know, right?!  How do they even...?  I imagine some clandestine, evil Discord chat where they coordinate, sending their slimy agents to any concentration of happiness and cooperation...
---
I do have a few pieces of Troubleshooters armor but they clash with the dress ;)
---
If I can't go in style, I just won't go!!
---
Yup! https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/5v7FIGaz3bakvwrXsOZerZ/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-the-purveyor
---
Whoops, I meant fermenting station, not distilling. I only have brewing unlocked though.
---
No like they're literally the exact same thing. Brewing is beer, distilling is hard liquor.  It's the exact same workbench for both. I guess what your trying to ask is how to ferment? The fastest way is with the fermenter. The fast one in bivs place is 1 time use. Just put the drink in the buildable fermenter at your camp after you make it and itll be ready faster than keeping it in inv. Only works at your camp, you can't access your fermenter from someone else's, but you can check on them through any stash
---
I put the I.O.U. beer note in my machine for 1000c just because. No bites yet.
---
We probably should’ve taken demo expert off. It was entertaining watching a mole rat beat up my friend for 5 minutes straight though.
---
Its called a fermenter and idk. It shouldve came with your brewing station.
---
I always go to vault 76 for wood, loads of fallen logs around.  Try taking workshops, you don't have to keep them but they give good plans early on.
---
Fast ferment is a one shot quest deal.  It’s now slow ferment (fermenter) or really slow ferment (carrying)
---
This is amazing! Mind if we share for Fanart Friday on social?
---
I was getting a steady flow of Legendaries running Whitesprings last night. I managed to cap myself for scrip for the day in about an hour and a half.
---
Same! You rock
---
But can it please not cost me $8 USD
---
Didn’t think I’d be a help to anyone writing this, but stoked that I am.
---
Use the ghoulish perk , as I do. Rads then heal you in the radiation zone, and is better for me for the sbq fight. Understand why you place the blast where you do, but there are other options. I also use vampire perked weapons, added HP boost.
---
That's correct.  Maybe that's why they always run the BFG weapons?  They like being the leader of the kill parade?  The psychology mystifies me...
---
When I join, I hit it with a cryolator but everyone else is f-ing about so I stopped amd just get shots in at enemies now and let other people kill them and I get xp and loot. Tired of repairing my guns and building ammo for people who don't try

---
 &gt; Do you have a twitter as well or just an IG?
---
Script. Sorry.
---
I dont run unarmed for the SBQ, even outside the nukezone. My 400 damage does not do enough damage to keep up with all the Adds, and it barely tickles the SBQ. I usually run PA and a Furious Gornaks Axe. Not the best but it works, I can at least see the health go down a sliver when I am al chemed out of my mind.
---
None of them, I prefer Instigating on lever action.
---
This sounds like Craigslist “Missed Connections”
---
Yeah, i dont think its necessarily a good thing that the prices have come so far down. Didnt mean it to sound that way
---
ya know I forgot about that..even a few stealth boys might help, hmm..
---
Hmm, I don't remember seeing that but I did just finish the main one so maybe I have to wait a bit. Do you happen to know the name of the daily event?
---
Isn't that how real combat works?  Whoever shoots the other guy first wins?  If I see you poking around somewhere and I shoot you in the head, I should win.  Likewise, if I'm out somewhere and you get the drop on me, you should win.   
---
That all being said, I don't PVP in this game and have no real intention to, so I don't really have a dog in this fight.
---
If you get an explosive weapon I’d recommend fireproof more than the other 2.
---
Otherwise go for adamantium skeleton.  Ironclad is... meh at best.
---
I think you are totally misunderstanding. It would be 125k period across all characters, which is exactly as it is right now but you don't have to log in and out to do it. Not 125k per character 
---
All that changes is that your caps are pooled between your characters on the account.
---
Yup that down timer is helpful. It’s more than enough time for me to kill it. Just make sure to get your tags before going down.
---
So dont forget those
---
Thank you! Of course!
---
There are mobs before that, but you can maneuver past them without engaging, but then you hit a sentry robot and few Mr Gutsy robots that you have to deal with in order repair the mainframe.  They tend to make short work of soft fleshy targets like humans.
---
Man, imagine the absolute madness those challenges are going to bring.
---
I really wish I was more tech savvy. I would love to get clips and patch them together with music.
---
Granted your solution won’t solve the problem one bit. Having said that it would be nice if we got a few more legendries and I have a few ideas.  These are just spitball ideas.
---
1.	Ghoulish - A legendary where the higher your rads the more damage. It could be called Ghoulish. For armor it could be higher defense the higher your rads. 
---
2.	Vanguards – Pretty self-explanatory, the more damage the higher your health. Could be a secondary legendary effect that offers max 25 -30% damage when full health. Whatever it is it should be the direct opposite of Bloodied but obviously it couldn’t be as high of increased damage. This is why the secondary effect would be best. 
---
3.	Critical - Some kind of legendary effect where critical do damage to all surrounding enemies. 
---
4.	Some kind of damage increase for the higher percentage of AP you have remaining. I’m not sure if it should be points or percentage but you get the idea. Get up to 100 points of damage the higher your AP.
---
Build your little personal terminal at the camp and it'll tell you when Biv is ready for you again
---
it's called something like tipsy taste test
---
I just accept that every day there will be a few challenges I completely ignore. Today it's half of them lmao
---
Awesome tactic.  I have a cultist dagger I always carry, so I'll run through a group, poke each one, then let others blow them away.
---
And you're right, there are *lots* of options all the time.  The group I run with are always up for anything, so if we find a concentration of jerks here, we just go there, or there, or...etc.
---
It gets easier. I couldn’t figure out the wood thing at first either. I was scrapping everything from hammers to wooden spoons for my measly amount of wood. You just need to walk around the forest area and search for fallen trees. Not all will give you scrap.
---
I wish more could see it. I am kind of amazed this was down voted honestly
---
.. especially in dresses I would imagine
---
Ok, no problem. So, each pair of coordinates needs a name, and it can be the same repeating name for each object in each unique category? 
---
Like this:
---
Scene 
---
Or am I still off base?
---
It may or may not have been me on xb1. I did not take pictures of you I just had my camera out.
---
I honestly wonder how hard that would be for them to code in. It would certainly eliminate some of the problems I have placing walls next to one another at odd angles.
---
I love my bloodied build. Mostly because if I can one shot things they should be able to one shot me too.
---
 Want to come and visit! Awesome build
---
No mine are there, two of yours are gone... Your last reply was deleted almost immediately after you typed it. You began the reply by acting all offended because you though I called you ignorant in general. Then you said everything I said sounded like a crazy conspiracy theory. 
---
 The one before that was removed by a moderator. I forgot exactly what it said but I'm pretty sure it was a personal insult.
---
Is that all the fermenting station does? From other replies I'm guessing it glitched out and I just won't be able to unlock it on this character, but if that's all it does I'm ok with it. Still a bummer but at least wouldn't ruin my goal of crafting booze to vend.
---

Do it and take more of his caps 😁
---
Dude, excellent, thank you for the link.
---
I love this game, I need to be a better researcher and note reader!
---
Excuse me wtf?
---
Too many weapons just have limited value. Broadsider is too gimmicky to be of value, and the radium rifle lacks mods to make them really viable weapons.
---
You have to fight off Grahm's great deals!  
---
*(Also, I still have to find the goddamn camera yet...)*
---
I think that's what the fermenting station is.
---
This why I do things on my own.
---
Love it. My first time was a mess too. Took me a little bit to see I wasn’t hurting him and noticed those nice little waypoint markers
---
Oh that didn’t pop up! I will walk around more! That was probably the daily they were talking about then haha thank you so very much for the help!!
---
Oh thank go. I saw that and thought - welp, not doing that one!
---
That's something I think about a lot:  the inevitable shutdown of 76.  I'm sure private servers will keep it going forever somewhere, but I think I'll be there when it shuts down.
---
Calling it now:  we have the shutdown party on the New River Gorge Bridge.
---
Like any event, a higher CHA score improves your chances for rare end rewards.  I personally have a base of 4, +1 CHA from a legendary leg armor, and depending on my health a couple unyielding armor pieces can add up to 6 points.  If you wear a full unyielding armor set with low health, you can get +15 from armor alone.  Eating a sweet roll during the eat/drink phase, or being in a full team while using two ranks of Magnetic Personality perk will certainly improve your end rewards.  If you have time, drink a beer when the last wave starts for an extra +1.  Just giving you advice on how to improve your chances.  I just roll with whatever I happen to have.  (to make a sweet roll, there's always sugar bombs at the top of the church steeple at Flatwoods, and plenty of nearby snaptails along the river to craft raw sugar.  The chef vendor in the Whitespring Hotel sells the Sweet Roll recipe.)
---
He is a waste of ammo lol
---
Do you have a twitter as well or just an IG?
---
It's a real problem in EU where most of the players are German or Russian, many times they don't speak a word of english
---
There is something to be said about being a glass cannon, y'all have way bigger atoms than me running with that.  I worry about health too much.
---
Legend has it that if you say Atom three times in a row, it will appear in Atomic shop for a price of just 4 canvas bags
---
I just played this event for the first time after seeing this post and I saw the rock :)
---
Talk to the scout leader inside of dolly sods, it'll point you in the right direction
---
Wood can be found additionally at wood piles near a lot of homes and most cooking spots. 
---
Boil all your water. It'll still have radiation but less and no chance of diseases. Anyways advance cooking usually requires boiled water, not purified. I think the overseers chest in the Charleston DMV has a land based water purifier for your camp. 
---
Eat what you kill. Mole rats, mongrels, oppossums, rad stags, Brahmin even rad roaches. Most meat gives you buffs as well and they last way longer than chems.
---
Perk cards butcher's bounty, can do, pharma farmer will give you a chance to get more meat, food, chems respectively whenever you're searching. Wood chucker will do it for wood but I never use that.
---
Maybe for you. I would stop and check out peoples places, as would many others. Or you know what, screw it, discounted travel is a bad idea, the other sub ain’t kidding when they say this sub shits on basically anything and everything.
---
Waving when you enter that event seemed to be the universal sign for I'm not going to be at d-bag.
---
Wat? You don't lose health if you sneak while activating pylons?
---
I really, REALLY wish we had the option to keep events like this from appearing on the map. I have only done the impostor event a handful of times but have already experienced anchor teams where I needed to hold all three pylons AND deal the majority damage at the same time. If you're going to be dead weight, I don't want you to get a free legendary from my wallet. I have the superstims for it, just let me solo the damn event instead of broadcasting FREE LOOT, COME RUN IN A CIRCLE FOR 10 MINUTES to the whole server
---
edit: or at the very least give a sizable exp/cap/rare loot reward to people who actually take pylons and hold them for an extended period of time
---
You assuming we can't have a campfire or tell tales during the day..?
---
I definitely agree with most of your sentiment, though. I find with my melee build I’m literally burning stims and chems like crazy because I have to activate all three fucking pylons myself to get anyone to do anything progressive in regards to our ultimate goal of killing the son-of-a-bitch
---
Shooters yes, but MMORPG type games?   No.
---
I guess, technically the question mark saves you. But your picture is proof of nothing about the possible inclusion of NPC’s in the futures. :)
---
Probably just as difficult as it is to do in game those picture challenges are a nightmare
---
Lol I love when people hit me up like that. Try to jack my workshops and then get pissed when I dump anti armor rounds in their asses 🤣 
---
"Sorry about your luck, bruh!"
---
Very good advice!
---
Of course my *hope* is the bloodied build peeps will hear our outcry, curb their one-shot ways when appropriate, and help us all strive to create a better wasteland.  I can dream, right?
---
I still believe that luring her out of the nuke zone make it more likely that the queen will wig out, but I've gotten into the habit of leaving forward station delta clear.
---
It's almost more about keeping the nuke zone inside the map boundries for maximum flux gathering. Hit fissure site prime but aim for the flux.
---
if people find out there's a game outside of farming whitesprings.. i'm gonna loose some serious ammo business.
---
Just an IG. Haven't made that jump to Twitter yet lol
---
The thing is he got angrier and I told him it's just a game. He said "that some people Make a living on"
---
Leads me to believe that he sells items on like Ebay or something
---
And those corner roof pieces, but going inwards.
---
That is unfortunate, for a silver and gold post
---
I hate that you're right, but you're right.  I know they just need a hug, but sadly that's not an option.
---
Just switch that crap off man...
---
This is just wrong. Fireproof + Dense chest prevents 100% of explosive damage. PA will not help this, the full protection combo is only possible out of PA.
---
Marsurpial due to map control it gives
---
Are you able to sell them without the mats? Say 100 caps per s’more?
---
Oooh ok, I get what's going on now. I noticed I don't get a prompt to use it at people's camps and I only had a pop up come up at the end of the quest saying I learned brewing so I assumed it was bugged or I missed something. Thank you so much for clearing that up.
---
Nope.  Not if you have healing factor mutation and can remain undetected. You gain 300% healing with that mutation if not in danger. So I just run up, activate all of the pylons, run away and my chameleon mutation makes me lose them pretty fast.
---
Items, caps, you name it, people always try to sell it. 
---
I guess you could make some extra pocket money,  but definitely not make a living lol. What a tool. 
---
Unless he's some high profile youtuber, dude can make 100 bucks a week at best.
---
It super rocks for regenerating armor and hiding from your opponwnts in PvP
---
I'm at level 200 and have been to a whitesprings nuke zone maybe 5 times. I feel so bad for the people missing out on the actual game lol
---
team up with a friend, leave the server and come back :\\ I had this problem too
---
One of the few times I’ve seen him was at Tyler County Workshop, and another was near sunshine meadows, it is possible, but hard to find.
---
So here is a pro-tip I learned after a few failures.  Collect a full set of 15 damaged mainframes in addition to the 15 you need to get through the silo (visit two silos if you have to).  What this does is allow you to be prepared for the next time you make a nuke run.  You can repair them from the safety of your own work bench then when you get there you have to pull out the damaged ones, replace them with the repaired ones, and move on.  This means you always have a full set of mainframes available for future launches.  It cuts the run time down making it a pretty fast event.  Then you can farm flux, SBQ, or ghouls pretty easy.
---
I always try to give an emote from the "happy" side of the wheel when I encounter anybody.  I also admit that I keep an eye on those that don't respond (less so now that swat damage and CAMP damage is gone, though).
---
Empath the most valuable mutation for a team of four.
---
Cool - I have three pieces of Chameleon armor so am normally practically undetectable. Hopefully this works as well. I do have the Chameleon serum i bought for cheap recently but haven't felt the need to use it yet...
---
And yes I have healing factor.
---
Yeah I did the same, at level 150 lol
---
AA because it shoots where its aimed
---
looking for red asylum workers dress and hat  willing to trade 3* hand made   or possible other 3*
---
They're scary stories that get told in the dark around a campfire, get real dude.
---
I'm with you on this. I think it's pretty fucking stupid that your turrets can attack me, but I have no means of defending myself unless you happen to be at your camp at that particular time.
---
What is this witchcraft?? How did you do this?
---
...Also, please tell me I am not the only one mid boggled by this...
---
 Take a Camera Picture of a Player in a Nuked Region while you're both Naked, m, yeah while one player has a TSE Laser Gun, and the other is standing on the Scorchedbeast queen while posing for 76 minutes and drinking 5 vintage nukashines.
---
SBQ (Scorchbeast Queen) Drops a random ultracite receiver plan on death once you have used that plan you can craft that ammo. So attach the prime barrel to one and let it rip!
---
Shhhhhhh it's only small detail.. Like changing lore by beth.. It's only a detail
---
Sure, I need some help on it too
---
I've learned this by example. Changed my SBQ drastically
---
Thanks for dropping by
---
Any solution to this? I accidentally placed a floor piece too far over and I cannot for the life of me move it. I've tried what seems like everything, aside from moving my camp again (almost finished so I'd really rather not have to start over)
---
&gt;BETHESDAS ONLINE **FURRY** FEATIVAL
---
Mr. Fuzzy would like to see you in their office, pronto!
---
Best answer
---
Im working on that now.
---
Wooden blocks, baby rattles, and pencils of course.
---
never heard that before, and sounds like an awesome bit of advice! would it be possible to speed run past everything, grab the damaged mainframes then fast travel out, concentrating on your second run as the real nuke launch run?
---
Thanks for all the advice guys! Really appreciate it! Thank you so much!
---
It is a survival game afterall, and you're plunging into the wilderness with nothing. The early levels are my favorite part, when finding a slightly not terrible weapon makes your whole day.
---
We need load outs for such endeavors . Crafting, looting, battling, etc!
---
Awesome!!
---
Ps4
---
At 999 it gave me a clear pop-up window that warned me I'm at the limit and can't get any more when I tried to shred another weapon.
---
Winter pack is called “wastelanders” which imo is a hint towards npcs, my current theory being a server wide story line, where after killing SBQ npcs come out of bunkers and maybe other parts of the wasteland, leading to scorched being replaced by raiders.
---
Yes, and let me have a designated outfit too!
---
I always run my melee toon nude.  I fought the queen nood.  I think I have a capture of me dead in a nuke zone coz I loaded in it.  But have to wait til after werk.
---
 Thanks! I have heard of that. Somewhere like watoga with scorchbeast scat might be a good place to look
---
I do this too, and run with a squad that has Rad Sponge.  I prefer to fight in the irradiated zone to get the Hardened Mass etc. from the smaller spawns.
---
I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine
---
There is no easy way to get it, it's more about luck. I had to find the camera 5 times over 4 characters (DON'T DROP IT)  Server hopping didn't work for me, people still post here that they found it but not as frequent however joining can be bugged. 4 out of 5 times I found it at Phillipi, a bonus that 2 other spawns (3 in actuality) are near by.
---
That’s a good theory
---
I price my Items just above what I feel would be beneficial to resell at a higher price. Like my serums I priced at 350c to still be competitive, but to help prevent people from just buying them and then selling them to a vendor at a profit. I know I wont sell as many that way, but I don't have a large stock of fluxes to make large quantities, so I have to make it somewhat worth my time it took to farm the materials. Also to help recoup the cost to buy the plans at 4k each.
---
Yup this is where it's at for wood.  Also,  keep an eye out for wood piles. You can harvest from those as well.
---
Food is easy enough at low too, Flatwoods has brahmin (milk and meat), mutfruit, silt beans, and tato. Once you have the wood, boil that dirty water - better to drink, also making tea/juice with it is good, cooking stuff gives XP too!
---
Scrap every extra weapon to learn mods. Better damage output from better modded weapons is essential.
---
Also, I found Pharma Farma to be a great perk at low levels. Stimpacks and RadAway can be hard to come by at first and easily used up.
---
Cool. Pop a Nukashine and celebrate in style!
---
So you turn your frog into prince may you live happily ever after
---
Congrats now you can actually have fun lol 👍🏼👍🏼
---
Me too just the other day, I feel pretty strong now it's dope
---
I probably take random damage at at least once a day, more often than not right after I'm done sprinting or jumping up a cliff/ incline. I assume it's just the game being goofy for no reason, it's only a few HP at max. I just pretend a mosquito bit me.
---
The less they’re worth though. Supermutants in the Divide and up are the best bet and if you are a high DPS build (bloodied or melee) the clear time is basically the same. Plus you get straight caps, some decent ammo, and gunpowder. And maybe worthwhile legendaries.
---
Yeah because bethesda doesn’t want us give out to players they have to find them themselves which sucks
---
Having lots of rads is the way to to do it. It isn't as bad as it seems running low health. Especially if you start stacking Unyielding armor.
---
You seem to be confused about the effects of the Fireproof perk, Dense chest mods, and how they interact with Power Armor.
---
Fireproof provides % protection from explosions and flame and has 3 points.
---
Dense provides a flat % protection from explosions which stacks with Fireproof and provides no benefit while in Power Armor.
---
By combining Fireproof and a Dense chest mod, as long as you are NOT using Power Armor, you benefit from 100% protection from explosive damage.
---
There are many perk options available that allow for mitigation or avoidance of damage. If you intend to pvp, these perks are virtually required. VATS critical hits ignore armor and armor effects, so perk avoidance and damage reduction is all you get, which makes things like Serendipity and Dodgy extremely useful. Likewise the damage reduction % buff from Lone Wanderer.
---
I e always toyed with the idea of a scoreboard at the end of a big map event. I know it’s probably not possible for Beth to track all of that, but it would still be cool to see how much damage you did or a letter grade.
---
I’ve had people buy 20 rounds and i got 18 as expected (1c each) so must be a weird bug
---
Clown?
---
It's definitely a quality of life thing that should be charged
---
Yes, you are right about just playing the game vs. going out of your way. I feel like it disrupts the flow, now. Those camera challenges.... screw that. Like you say, they would never "just happen" and they're not even worth that many atoms.
---
I actually loved the challenges before, because I thought they were fair. I decided I would not buy any atoms, and like Pete Hines (I think?) said, you (used to) be able to acquire them in-game at a very high rate just by playing. The challenges were easier, but it didn't seem like an imbalance. Lets say you did all the daily challenges. That only nets you like 60-80 atoms. Most of the good stuff costs 700-1400, so you still have to grind grind grind. I just personally think... the way the challenges used to be were fun, easily obtainable just by playing, and acquired at a rate that you didn't HAVE to buy atoms to really get anything on the store. At the same time, buying atoms was still nice because there were enough items in the shop available to be worthwhile. Now, with repair kits and the grindier challenges, you can see what's happening, and that kind of bums me out.
---
I had to server hop to get the Flatwoods ones to reset.  There might be a timer before you can milk again.
---
&gt;I just hope we can get some serious lore soon and some meaningful quests.
---
This may sound odd, but scouting in West Virginia has a fairly long history. And I'd argue that it has a lot of lore rooted in the Fallout universe. The Pioneer Scouts were clearly using their programs as a method of indoctrination to turn kids into commie-hating patriots.
---
Listen to the tapes, the logs, the training, the quizzes. The majority are basic science and nature facts, which holds the heritage of scouting's traditional aspects... but they equally show how other questions are geared to get kids to hate commies. The Pioneer Scouts had to opt to bring in adults after the bombs fell due to "lack of enrollment" (aka, people fleeing and dying out post war). Their goals never changed though. They wanted to raise kids on American values while getting them to hate "the reds".
---
It may not add heaps to the lore, but it's giving flavor to the paranoia and ultra Americana that was being pushed on society prior to the Great War.
---
The rest of the game definitely needs more substance to it, but I feel the Pioneer Scouts add a bit to the background of the series. I just wish the damn badges weren't so grindy.
---
I had a feeling that might be my only option. I’m typically a PA user but I’ve stacked up a nice collection of 3* armor and with the backpacks out I think it might be time I make the transition! 
---
Edit: why did this get downvoted 😂 not that I care but damn do people hate PA users or somethin
---
You’re*
---
Had this happen to me twice. I have stopped participating in that section of the event.
---
it's a good feeling! congrats! now you have to get used to no more SPECIAL points to add
---
Plans.
---
"Atom shop is OK because you can earn Atoms free while playing"
---
No. Every other game I play, that is not a solo game of course, has text
---
awesome! Thank you very much!
---
Rug group selecting is an old fo4 secret.
---
Yeah, even though the challenge is doable, I don't think the average player should have to do this much google-fu/server hoping to complete it.
---
It's not a bug, always been that way. It's the finding of the magazine, and the popup, that trips the challenge counter
---
Yeah, I think I now have to redistribute my current points.
---
I buy stimpaks, disease Cures, antibiotics, plans I don't have, fast travelling, entering events. I sell things cheap in my store so I always spend so I don't reach the cap limit.
---
After stop 4 it quits..... I'm not given the location of another stop, just the exit.
---
That one pissed me off. My buddy and I spent ages looking round Sugar Grove taking pictures, Turms out they meant Site Alpha. If it's called Site Alpha on the map then call it that in the challenge I say.
---
Maybe with the phantom thing, you might try it out at Watoga first to see if it working on robots.   You have to run right in front of a sentry bot in a small area is the problem and since the security system is alerting everything they are already looking for you.
---
Thanks for the tip! I just assumed what was unlocked to start with was it, I'd really be missing out.
---
Jeez let's just have indoor plumbing, why not??
---
I don't think buying a mag should count, BUT reading one definitely should
---
It only helps for the possum ones, not the other ones
---
If so, then the challenge description needs amending to find all magazines, as collect Implies you can trade them.
---
I buy power armor plans, both parts and mods, gives me something to do since my collection is at the point where I only need crafted sets
---
No this is the most f\*\*\*ed up rebalance the are doing. 2 months ago you could easily get 40 of 60 atoms per day. i got about 160-200 per week (i also have a life...) . No i can get about 50-60 per Week. That is a nerve. 
---
But as they say: "Buying atoms is optional, you can earn it for free, simply be playing the game...
---
Hunter's hood please.
---
Still havent even found the damn camera. Its all to lock off free atoms from being earnable. Same with the "Craft 25 different drinks" ones back when Biv had just been added and nobody could get all the recipes that fast.
---
What if we could just chose the amount of a item we want to sell with a set price. So I want to sell (x) amount of ammo and then get to choose the price (y). So 500 5mm for 100 caps, this would be a “quick fix” while they could work on a bulk function
---
Or just let us set prices at 0.1-.9 and round to the nearest at cap
---
Thanks.  I had thought most knew this by now also, but our experiences in the past week says different. I  believe the rise in player participation because of all the new content is drawing many new players into the endgame fights.  The acquisition of better gear through player vending has given many the minerals to jump into this event without really knowing what is going on.  It's by no means a huge problem, but it is frustrating to spend time and resources designing the best possible launch for everyone's benefit and then have some try hard with a new, high damage weapon jump in there and cause issues because they don't understand launch tactics.  So I thought it might be time to revisit protocol and hopefully explain why the Queen isn't always supposed to be battled in the middle of the big red circle.
---
Well, I do have to question why you ask "why you being all buddy-buddy..."
---
It's a game... when I get my ass handed to me in PvP, I don't hold a irl grudge. I usually give a thumbs up and get on with it.
---
That said, I don't ask for my stuff back either.
---
That’s awesome and I’m not saying that’s too expensive and you have the option and freedom to charge that price right now and everything works but I just want to sell more for less, nobody is saying that that is what they should be worth I just think the player should have the option to sell more ammo for less caps, because as a Buisness move it means higher volume of sales and product for me as the distributor
---
So it does help for the Collector possum challenge?
---
Turning them off doesn't stop people from buying.. just makes it harder to find
---
I personally like bolstering gear (or emergency protocols PA) over unyielding (for ranged that is) I feel squishy as hell with unyielding
---
This guy gets it. Bloody or anti armor too
---
Thanks for letting me know! I genuinely thought it was just me screwing up at first. I usually play solo, so that may be tricky, but if it happens again I'll see what I can do to rejoin the world.
---
Any low level?
---
Ive had it check off yea
---
Dehydrated? Starving? Each of those conditions come with a health loss.
---
Ah, ok. I'll have to seek out the scavenger outfit and see if it works with this one. Thanks.
---
Awesome, thought it was like the regular challenge. Thanks.
---
Cause you're a commie. If you were a true patriot the bullets would bounce off you.
---
I'd love to be able to launch nukes into the air and have them detonate over Appalachia. Like the silos bug out and just start launching, giving us nuclear fireworks.
---
No, it is not a good game design. It is i nerve to throttle players down and drive them to buy atoms...
---
My alt is a a 1str 1end low health VATS sniper. I don’t/can’t carry many stims and don’t have the health to hold a pylon very easily, so I get on the cabin and pop all the adds before they get close (1 shot kills on even colonel gutsy’s  at about 1/sec with my lever action) so everyone else stays alive longer and only has the pylons/imposter to worry about. As soon as the shield goes down I start hammering the imposter; at about 1.5-2k (depending on adrenaline) per sneak attack, with a boosted crit every other shot, and more if I can get an angle on the combat inhibitor, I take off noticeable chunks every shot. 
---
So, I feel bad not taking pylons, but I think I help in a different way. 
---
But I get where you’re coming from!
---
Yo that other one's way more kickass.
---
Question: Do the tamed animals attack fellow wastelanders? I saw a death claw at a camp and was like whoa lol Is it cool to be around fellow wastelanders live pets?
---
You're really trying to quiz me? I'm a huge fan of the series dude. I did tons of reading inside and outside of each of the games. I was ridiculously excited about the release. I watched streamers, read "beta" reviews, and played the previous games again to handle the excitement. I know the  stories, lore, etc. and I'm not trying to get into a pissing contest.
---
I'm really just here inquiring about a game you guys enjoy and I'm actively seeking a reason to join in. I'm not putting it down. 
---
But whatever. If this is what the community is like it's a little hard for me to get the interest back. I'm glad you enjoy this version of the wasteland.
---
I do the same type thing. A gift bag if you will. Decease cure, .38, 308, 10mm, water...
---
I just kill mine if it doesn't give me milk, then repair feeder and you have a fresh brahmin. Only takes 1 steel and 1 razorgrain.
---
Honestly feels like it's been nerfed in my experience and I'm level 204 and 138 on my characters
---
I agree but since it hasnt changed since launch, dought it will change
---
Have uniform and hat, but taking cap offers only
---
This is pretty much essential for power armor shops.
---
Guessing they’re not making as much through the atom shop so they’re making challenges tougher to get. This may not be the case but they’ve been listening to our suggestions and this has yet to be addressed
---
LDS94 getting back into it
---
Happy to help whoever with whatever
---
From this post I have found some people aren’t even there to kill the imposter. They come for the metal or come with no stim packs. It’s interesting.
---
I’m almost positive they could implement a way to shut them off so they can’t be used.
---
Just found one in a footlocker in the flooded trainyard. Footlockers seem to be a "trend," but search every mother lovin' container...
---
Yeah that works awesome too I just thought it’d be immersive/cool to make bulk ammo at the tinkers workbench since that’s already where you can craft ammo
---
I have a feeling rapid leveling parallels combat aggression. My sniper build drags through levels where I imagine tanks hit them quick.
---
Whitespring is best for flux. (And still good legendary farming.)
---
If you go someone’s vending, sometimes they’ll undercharge weapons and than I’ll sell em lol
---
I had the same problem ,I just skipped over it and completed a different challenge
---
It’s bugged
---
Wood? Fallen logs. You can also head to the lumberyard just south of Vault 76.
---
Food? Shoot everything that moves. Use the Overseers camp or Flatwoods to cook it. Chickens, squirrels, mutts, radstag, brahmin.
---
Water pump? (super mild spoiler alert)… just follow the main "quest" line for an hour or two. Do what it says... do all the assigned stuff in Flatwoods, you should have it before the game sends you to Sutton.
---
This is a pain in the ass
---
That feeling when you finally find another half-dozen .38 shells.
---
To make 200k caps? That's 33 days of making 6k a day, man. I don't even think Sheepsquanch has been out that long. Must be a prettttty good player trader I guess
---
‘Twas back in New Vegas I learned to do this.
---
I am... Perplexed.
---
So you can buy it from a player vending machine and it counts towards the collector challenge?
---
Because I had a handful of these in a mule, I dumped them in a paper bag, picked them up with my main and... nada.
---
I've only had the pylon prompt show up once, it might get bugged for other people too. What's the point of completing the sheepsqautch event though? After playing it a couple times and wasting sooo much ammo and stims to just have it lag out at the end and not get any reward, I've been wondering why people like this event so much.
---
I just found one in a footlocker in the flooded trainyard.   
---
I then ran down to the 7-11 and bought a california lottery ticket.
---
Musician is bugged as well I’m pretty sure many others as well I was discouraged by the amount of bugs introduced this latest patch I just log in to exchange my script and collect some caps.
---
I’m not even collecting those impossible challenges all for 10 atoms no thanks.
---
The game turn in to a chory mess hopefully they fix it I was having fun right before the patch
---
Found it, anyone need it in the next 10mins add me, rams_man
---
I'm almost positive they could do a lot of things. But most of that wont happen. Your best bet is just take the stuff out and store it since it takes stash space anyway, that way you can post them up again when ur ready and don't risk wasting caps
---
no prob!
---
ok ty. might be my next purchase.
---
I love this. Way better than "eating" it
---
I sell mine for free. I pick up so much I don't need.
---
Yes, yes, yes
---
Terraforming and use resources to “ rebuild” America
---
If it makes you feel any better......
---
Bethesda admitted in the patch notes that different weapons have different drop rates when they stated that they adjusted the drop rate of the Cryolator and the Gatling.
---
I can guarantee you that your odds of rolling a handmade are not 1 in 44........but you will get a lot of M79 grenade launchers.
---
Ambient music packs from all the other fallout games is something I would buy immediately on the Atomic Shop. Same with radio songs!
---
Iv just explored the airport. I’m very new XD
---
I just confirmed by logging in and yea, ive had 0 luck ever finding any of the tales of west virginia ones, and I bought two from a vendor and it checked off, but only the collector one not the atom challenges
---
I always get atleast 3-4 hits on it (both if there’s 2), then watch the Brahmin. Unless someone else is already protecting them...I find people are usually pretty good about that.
---
Literally just had this happen to me too.. so lame!
---
Well, like I said, hope it is friend :)
---
When it's nearly spoiled I'll eat a few of the buffs that I would use for my characters build then take the rest to the nearest vendor bot. It's a shame though that the food that provides the highest quality of a buff still only sells to their system for less than 10 caps when the time to get the ingredients costs significantly more than that.
---
It will help though, especially if they stop the current duping. Some people want them to figure out a way to make all the duped items dissappear...this is never going to happen. I just thought it would be nice to have some high value sought after items again...or interesting ones at least
---
Better then removing ? And building again ?
---
We've increased the drop rate of M79 grenade launcher and rolling pins to make up for it.
---
Not sure whats the "trick" around the caps, but probably you expended a lot of time in the game, I already had a decent amount of time (actually lvl 68) and I miss a lot of caps because all I got go away just buying plans or on TPs.....
---
For me its kind a joke how the splited every modification on plans that also had prices just too high... It kinda ruins the crafting for me, and looking how the legendary weapons got all the attention, for me the prices are just too expensive, at least the ones related to weapon and armor crafting (not talking about mods, which I also find more expensive that they should)
---
If anybody would start playing the game right now I would say "only invest on mod crafting, ignore the rest" housing incluided if you are not interested because is a hole for resources and caps for the plans for not really gameplay impact.
---
People can have mine for free. I only use a couple ammo types and I don't need the caps.
---
These are the people who decided that 40 item points is too much of a reward for exploring Appalachia for 316 days and 16 hours straight. 
---
They reduced the reward to 20 atom points.
---
Think about that, let's say someone is playing this game 3 hours a day and play it every single day, it would take them just shy of 7 years.
---
And someone actively went through the thought process and decided that 40 atom points is TOO MUCH of a reward for that.
---
Since that changed, a month or two after the game released, no challenge has surprised me.
---
Jumping on the me too train.
---
Well I like making her pay for not giving me the milk after feeding her all day. Plus don't have to go in and out of building menu
---
if you have a vampire's tesla - that'll do the trick.  i use it for the SBQ as well.  never die.  lots of XP and everyone gets their hits.  same at whitesprings.  had 2 and passed it onto a friend.  best way to farm in a "civil" manner.
---
They call you MISTER Gibbs.
---
Or just to price stuff right. I can't for the life of me figure out how much to sell a lot of things for. I've been considering just listing things as max caps and making a sign saying to shoot me an offer so I can get at least a basic gauge on pricing.
---
Bethesda admitted this in the patch notes. We do know for certain that the Cryolator and Gatling will not be dropping as frequently.
---
Oh, I thought by magazines OP meant the Unstoppables ones - which is the ones I tried.
---
Still, worth a shot. I can always get my mule to set up shop and try to buy them with my main, see if it works.
---
They absolutely should drop the energy resistance of the target to accommodate the ammo type. The anti-armor prefix on them is a total waste
---
I’m neither smelly, nor an ass. It was just a random name I picked years ago before I knew it would mean something here
---
Thanks I’ve been doing the erase method and still have some trouble getting milk of it , I got fed up and just turned the tv off
---
I accidentally started the encounter because I didn’t realize it was a “raid boss” and about a dozen people showed up to help. Then literally no one took any pylons. What is the point of coming if you’re going to do no damage to the boss? So I wasted all my stimpacks and died about a dozen times before just turning off my Xbox. Don’t really plan to do that event ever again.
---
No it’s a sudden drop and then a rise as it heals
---
... wait, buying them works? Oh my god, having a second account is even more p2w than I thought. I tried dropping them and that didn’t work. Time to add them to the vendor.
---
I mean, having friends does the same thing, but I’m antisocial.
---
I’ve been listing a couple hundred rounds at a time of .45, 308, 38, 10mm, and 44 for 0 cpr for people who wander into my camp and maybe needing ammo. More advanced types I sell for 1cpr.
---
Depower it
---
I was actually going to make a post about this myself a little while ago, i had a very pleasant experience there for once finally, there was 3 players and of course one had a 2 shot explosive shotgun.  So i was like oh great so much for loot.
---
When it came to the elites everyone made sure we all got a hit, it was actually a very nice for a change.
---
Best fix for this problem I can ever imagine reading
---
Feel free! I wish we had a max level SMG that used .38 rounds, I would give them away for free lol.
---
It's going to be one hell of a grind if they don't fix this in the next patch.
---
A screw bit attachment. Does more damage against robots.
---
There’s the medic challenge that you have to craft stimpak diffusers...that doesn’t exist in the game yet
---
Friends Welcome
---
Love those guys. Really helps me at such a low level.
---
thanks, the other player who posted in this thread that he is still having issues while loading in was also on xbox... can anyone on ps4 chime in and let us know how loading is for you?
---
Still leagues better than 3-7k.
---
For sbq goodness sakes! Did not know there was so much etiquette involved. I just always go in there where a bunch of players are fighting and go at it. I dont care if I kill or others kill. I stay pretty much rad free. I'm there to collect flux and maybe hardened mass. The other night I used executioners rifle and got her down and was able to get scorch brain or something like that. Not an outstanding prize for sure. Did not know if I was doing anything wrong/getting in the way, etc. Many other scorch beasts were killed by other players. I'm lvl 86, mainly stay away from scorch beasts. Occasionally greet a player but I play alone. And I'll continue to get in the fray, when I'm up to it.
---
Mine aggros if I get too close... It's my Brahmin! He moos like he took damage and runs away, same with other people's. Maybe it's the imposter outfit?
---
Ah my mistake.
---
Indeed it is confusing.
---
I guess in real life you can call yourself a collector only if you do the collecting from the source yourself.
---
If you purchase items for your collection in auction or from shops you are a fraud and an embarrassment for the collector community.
---
Can only get so many caps a day though.
---
Hey, could I possibly add you on PS4? I would love to hit the queen every night!
---
For sure. I just think it would be nice if we could do it from our pip boy on the fly instead of having to fast travel while you’re stuff is being bought and you’re at your limit. Or once you hit your max they could make it so they shut off automatically or won’t sell items that are worth more than you can except at that time
---
Do you have healing factor? I ask because I get the same thing some times. I will be doing something and then all of a sudden I will hear my heart beat. My hp drops and then healing factor kicks in and heals it. As far as I can tell it is associated with my food or water bar going to red.
---
Airport?!
---
Follow the Overseer's quest to her CAMP, then to Flatwoods, and do the volunteers missions in Flatwoods... that will both answer your questions, and provide what your require. Consider everything leading up to Flatwoods and reaching level 5 in the process to be the in-game "tutorial", I don't suggest skipping it until you've done it at least once.
---
Most often theyre overkilled straight away and cant be revived. I gave up after the third sheepsquatch of this and asked someone.
---
There's a clear difference between contributing in some way and running in circles though
---
Please beth bring back big iron
---
He’s not asking about nuclear winter
---
berserker is an effect that gets applied to you while you have the weapon. so it will show you the increased or decreased damage for everything else in your pip boy until you equip it, at which point it will adjust itself. the same works for nocturnal, furious, adrenaline, etc.
---
Good luck.  The tadpole quests are really really frustrating (and I thought really lacked fun and instead focused on wasting your time)
---
That would be amazing. Thought the same thing. Was kinda disappointed the first time I went to a blast zone and it's just orange sky and glowing enemies but no destruction.
---
Booze, chems and hookers.
---
Damn my contact lens!
---
I think it's doable if you do it on the edge but you're both gonna have to resign yourself to dying!
---
For a ranged build, making it a sneak rifleman build works very well with unyielding thanks to the massive agility (sneak) bonuses. You’re squishy if they detect you... if they detect you.
---
I think it's not allowed to post usernames here, I can be wrong. I reported him already
---
 build a brahmin pen at your camp milk it then store it rebuild it then milk it that should let you finish the challenge way faster
---
This would just end up being used to power level new characters.
---
Plans, mods, shotgun shells, plastic, fast travel.
---
Thanks. Helpful.
---
There are some seriously strange things going on with stairs right now. Maybe the sheepsquatch wasn't dangerous enough so Bethesda's introducing meta enemies for us to battle :-p
---
I’m so lazy I just leave crafting perks most time lol
---
I agree, run high rads for my health ceiling, radaway diluted when nuke zones over radiate, and PA in most places with high lvl mobs. But what non PA can you possibly use? I have full set of 1* Unyielding plus blocker perk  and it doesn't seem to do much good?
---
What a cry baby
---
Go sit in the corner
---
I believe the game started off like this but they took it away when they started the xp nerfs.  Leveling up my 2nd toon was a pain after the nerfs.
---
i buy every legendary idem i can find for under 75 caps and put them in the exchange machine for my 150 a day max
---
Everything’s workin good for me, sorry for ur loss we will miss you
---
***Butthurt alert***
---
Oh I didn’t knew about that!! But, if I want to know the real damage of this rifle which one I have to consider? At this point I don’t really know
---
I feel you.  The tadpole quests are so absolutely frustrating.  They just don't seem fun to me, aren't well explained, and just don't work half the time.  I was enjoying the game, but the fact that things that get added are time wasters, rather than fun content just frustrates the life out of me.  
---
Maybe its just me, but life is to short to play a game that spends just as much time frustrating you as not.  Games are supposed to be FUN.  It's what I spend my free time on.  If it's not fun, then it's more like my 9-5.
---
Long gone are the days of fallout NV and fallout 3. Bethesda should be ashamed of this game.
---
pew pew?
---
Does bolstering work better? Also use Emergency Protocols and other than an occasional radaway in nuke zones, I'm good to go.
---
It used to be like a fountain. Brahmin used to dispense the glorious nectar on command.
---
Then the devs thought 'this is too good'.
---
So they went ahead, instanced it and added a probability of failure.
---
Because fuck fuckity wank fuck fuck.
---
If they made them fun then we all will have atoms and won't need to buy them. But yea especially current one with Graham seems like a nightmare to do.
---
Not my experience but, hey, glad to see you go!
---
I didn’t know we could sell hookers!  Well hot dog.
---
For real.
---
Same thing for me, I grinded the whole day yesterday and didn't get a single one. Bethesda might have taken off the badge reward
---
It made it incredibly hard to survive in places like silos or west Tec and I burned through SO many stimpacks
---
Its probably just team deathmatch which is more like baby battle royal
---
#crymeariver
---
When you equip it, it shows you the real damage of the berserker's weapon with your current armor. Every other weapon will be wrong
---
Those are the numbers he used to get the numbers he presented.
---
Lol. I got one of my better weapons on that slow and over encumbered slog back to town when I cut through the Sundew Forrest and ran into that 3\* Legendary SM, so I don;t mind it that much.  As for launching? You're welcome. Takes us about 12-15 minutes on average, so it's no big deal, just want to give everyone the best fight they can have.
---
Huh I'll have to try this
---
You won't but you can still get wood pieces and for weapons you can get walking canes, lead pipes, pipe weapons, so yea plenty of weapons that are complete disappoints can still hit us.
---
I mean, you can. And many of us do.
---
But to come here to cry? That's a big no-no.
---
It's 100% bots. Times have changed.
---
Oh look, another person crying to people that dont care.
---
That's a neat trick. I forgot healing factor existed, I tend not to use it. Might try it out just for this though
---
What’s SBQ?
---
Did you honestly expect to be earning atoms for free with no effort in quantities that would let you buy out the whole store?
---
Because when I think of games without broken quests, I think Fallout 3 and New Vegas.
---
Vox syringed rifle
---
It's awesome that the kid enjoys the game. Good on him. I hope he keeps having fun.   
---
But yeah about the hating on Fallout 76...mostly no one cares anymore. The trend for trolling about the game has passed.The people who didn't like it have left and the diehard fans are still around. Meanwhile it's not worth trying to even have critical discussions/debates here because those left won't hear a bad thing about it.
---
As someone who both doesn't like massive parts of this game, but is also likes parts of it and is still playing (I've beaten every god damned fallout game, and I'm not about to NOT finish the main quest on this one) I'll admit that it's more stable, but still most of it's core issues are here and haven't been fixed. But that's because most of the games issues aren't bug related but are core gameplay design failures.
---
But what's the point at hating on it here on the reddit at this point? It's not going to change anything for the game, and it's just being a dick to people who like something just to be a dick. If you like it you like it. Meh. You like it you like it. Who cares?
---
Tell me, exactly what's 'workin good for' you?

I usually burn thru caps by traveling to different camps, and searching thru their items looking for deals. The travel expense adds up over time and you sometimes find something decent. I found a guy selling 24 stable crismon for 50c each. Also if it is a low level players camp, I'll buy something regardless just to throw some caps their way.
---
Still there?
---
What's your experience?
---
If a bloodied and non bloodied player shoot each other at the exact same time, the non bloodied wins. No matter how big the number is, it gets reduced so it does not instant kill at full health. It takes two to kill. The bloodied player, however, puts themselves at a threshold where they can be killed in one shot. So if the bullets land at the same time, bloodied boy dies while the non bloodied stays alive. You could use Serendipity, but you still have a 55% chance of dying on that first shot. Otherwise, they are likely to die at the same time.
---
It's alright, just had me confused is all
---
So true. How's your experience been?
---
Ok thank you so much, so with different armors I could increase the damage?
---
You craft it to higher levels at tinkers work bench
---
I tried, but got disconnected from the server. Any tips?
---
At least with a single player game there were console commands and work arounds.  With a multi-player game, if its bugged, you are SOL.
---
I think the word I used was ‘everything’.....as in the quests, the servers, the loot. The fun
---
Iv done the tutorial and I’m just level 7 after just following the “main” quests
---
I tried to reply to your comment, but the server disconnected. Sorry!
---
Too bad that event has me jaded. I don't care if they fixed it, the invisible body bug made me swear off that event
---
Worked fine for me and I did it solo. Maybe you should have good searched "how to complete the task quest"
---
Battle royale as we no it, no. 
---
But i still think them turning the second floor of the top of the world into an arena of sorts would be awesome.
---
Maybe ur Walmart connection can’t handle it I’d try Fios
---
you mean the devs?
---
I have *always* gotten the water purifier before leaving flatwoods (and I've played through the early levels with about 10 different characters)… you check your "notes" in your inventory for the plan?
---
Its in the game just not able to drop I had made a previous post asking about it and some guy sent me a dm about him getting it from the dev room and if I wanted to buy it from him. This is the photo he sent me https://i.imgur.com/SKARG4F.jpg
---
There is a super mutant fella that runs a sweet gig in the basement of Wes-Tek.
---
Those Assaultrons... they can do things mmmmmm.
---
The Impostor moonlights there too; the place caters to all proclivities.
---
I have 290 AP, it doesn’t much matter to me since I can get a whole mag off, and the enemy is long dead before I have to reload. I’d honestly take the better damage at that point.
---
I don't have doors to lock, or walls even....
---
What? What are you having trouble with? I might be able to offer some insight. I've completed a lot of tadpole and possum quests without any issues.
---
Edit: I've also completed the main quest line solo. 
---
I'm here to help.
---
100% better than FO76. This is the end of what could have been a billion dollar franchise.
---
I sometimes have crashing issues when in the pioneer scout area due to the amount of objects within the area.  Also, i recommend changing the tadpole uniform a bit, as it has a very close resemblance of the BSA(Boy Scouts of America) Class A uniform.
---
Not to nag, just a recommendation.
---
I just mean compared to other Fallouts everything seems so much louder at the base settings lol maybe I’m just old at this point
---
Well, that sucked. But it worked out in the end. Thanks for the help mate. And a shout out to the guy who camped right next to our suicide spot (River near Overseers camp) and watched naked men continiously blowing themselves up while throwing "confused" gestures every 10 seconds :D
---
I will however recommend this place, but be close to the shore or the water will be too deep.
---
I've run a silo twice as a Mistress, once with two friends and the second time with three. The Blade of Bastet cuts through the bots with sneak attacks, but those invisible assaultrons will wreck you once they find you. IMHO, without someone to tank it would be very hard. I usually offer to be the locksmith/hacker since I can sneak to the terminals.
---
they should monetize it..
---
2 slots for free and 75 atoms per slot up to 5 slots
---
tied to the character not the account..
---
Oh yeah, lemme just explain every technical challenge we have during development just because you feel like it.
---
-Todd Howard
---
You have the plague walker mutation. For some reason even if you aren’t diseased it acts hostile to brahmin.
---
I did that yesterday. Fell down in between someone's base and a rock wall with a waterfall. The only way out was to enter their locked building. Couldn't get out of that one. The owner was around but didnt respond to my emotes. Next time I get stuck inside someone's base I am going to find a bunch of mobs to bring back with me for a return visit. 
---
Don't lock me in bro!
---
Class freak barely does anything for you with marsupial. Just pop a rad x before you craft, not that that’s actually a real issue anyway since you should be using legendaries
---
What a pain in the ass! That moment when you leave camp, walk up to a lvl 68 super mutant, and realize you left Ammosmith and supper dupper on instead of Enforcer and Bloody Mess.
---
So jealous 😫
---
Not one person has even mentioned adrenal reaction and it’s pathetic
---
Any connection outside of lowest graphics setting is a problem. Did you know you can run faster and farther than other players by looking straight down at the ground while playing on the lowest graphics setting? If not, have fun!
---
I thought laser weapons don't benefit from armor pen mods or antiarmor legendaries?
---
Yeah I was gonna say I'm not diseased with it on. Thanks!
---
THIS IS MY TITLE
---
New characters are already power leveled this way, they just have to hit everything. Nothing changes.
---
Yeah. Play however you want to :-)
---
“Most” of my gear repaired. Always short on copper.
---
Best thread ever.....
---
Great, I found the one real person (i.e., bot) that hasn't had any issues with this game. Congrats!
---
I want a Nuka-Cola Thirst Zapper skin for the Alien Blaster!
---
1x-2x same as night scope
---
They do not attack fellow wastelanders unless pvp is initiated. Saw a deathclaw at a camp as well and that’s what sparked my curiosity of taming
---
(PC) perk loadout manager allows 12.... i haven’t used that many, but I have about 8 preset on my main (different weapon combat sets, exploration/weight reduction set, generic camp set, specific crafting sets for weapons/armor/chems. )
---
Can I have any good items you have before you rage?
---
I got speed demon I’m good
---
i mean, you are definitely old.
---
Ya it’s your garbage internet lolz
---
His skepticism is pretty legit to be fair.
---
Im the same but if you grind the junk needed to repair the auto missile turrets plug at least one or 2 rounds into the scorch beast and wait for the missile turrets to clean up. Defending it from scorched while it's working. The fissure site near watoga has a turret near it.
---
I never bothered with the TSE or the bloodied. I'm also tanky heavy weapons. Get yourself an anti armor gatling or 50 cal, and a vampire minigun. You'll do just fine.
---
&gt;  the guy who built his shop at the top of Seneca Rocks and then logged out while I was browsing,
---
hmmm… I've found a couple of those too.
---
Not sure if they are griefers/scammers causing you to fall to death to take your bag... or if they are just terrible merchants with zero common sense.
---
The sword is def worth hanging on to. I didn’t realize until after I sold it to a vendor bot long ago. Wish I still had mine ;(
---
appreciate the response :)
---
How exactly did you complete the 'revive team mate' part of the quest solo?
---
Okay. Its a combo of what I said above and people raging on reddit about the difficulty of new stuff that made me weary.
---
Where is that?
---
This happened to me once and I saw it happen to another player. The marker was over his head. It sucks bc you can’t even try to drop the camper stuff since they are quest items. 
---
Has anyone figured out what may be causing this?
---
Better microwave the potato again, signal's getting fuzzy.
---
&gt;People ~~playing multiplayer games~~ are stupid.
---
Great! thanks for the reply.
---
Yes. But it doesn’t seem additive, more like multiplicative. I tested one then both by attack an alt on a second account and checked his pip-boy weapon damage.
---
Also it’s a nasty griefing tool. At least before the last patch, you might not damage someone, but the debuff still took effect.
---
Yes, its normal. First 20 levels will beat you up for a while, get the lead belly perk so you don't get as much radiation when eating and drinking. Fallen logs will give wood and most towns and buildings have wood piles around them somewhere.
---
IMO, if you are not on the survival server, you can honestly play however you want to and have a blast
---
Yea we really need some new music, or even give us an option to upload a music playlist and take over a workshop that lets us broadcast it or even personal antennas we can broadcast our playlists and it will be up to player what they want to upload.
---
Let's do this? How did you complete the 'revive team mate' part of the quest? Is it possible to do solo? Also, did you have problems with the 'aid' components spoiling before completing the quest? How did you complete the crossbow quest? (or, perhaps you found the crossbow plans before another player picked them up?)
---
Eh, if the exploit to get no rads in a nuke zone still works, it’s doable ;)
---
Cry? Sorry, no. Just trying to save people dollars.
---
It's amazing that what gets upvoted in this sub is people being dicks to defend this game, rather than people trying to help other people.
---
Edit: I love that this got downvoted.  Just proves my point.  The only thing more frustrating than this game at times is the people on this sub....
---
Actually, never got any good items - sorry!
---
I mean, you may just be young my child.
---
Explore the low level areas and farm loot, events, side quests before jumping to next areas. Lvl 23 should be in northwest (forget region name) getting ready to go in southwest (forget region name lol).
---
There's so much adventuring to do. I was level 50 before going to second to last region. Take your time and enjoy the landmarks!
---
Early game is harder, yes. As to be expected. You’re getting your footing in the post-apocalypse ;)
---
oh no, i am infact *also old*
---
People are horrible.
---
Yes, such as unyielding armor.
---
This event should have its time extended honestly.  Other events that don't take long at all have like obscenely gracious time limits, like 30 or 20 minutes, but this event, which is the only time-sensitive event I've seen repeatedly failed, has the harsh approximate 10-minute time limit that doesn't seem long enough to get the message across to the players doing it.
---
I think most of the time people doing Encryptid simply just don't know what to do even though the game has it in plain text what you should be doing.  It inevitably just turns into a free-for-all disaster for the inexperienced.
---
When encryptd is up, go revive random strangers who go down.
---
Yup but odds are we will be waiting for awhile to get this fixed like how long it took for Lever Action Rifle to be fixed.
---
That's exactly the problem - the game COULD be fun - but it's not. It's really hard to get around the glitchy quest system, and how the servers get around dealing with multiple players using the same quest items.
---
Yeah yeah.
---
On survival and adventure you earn hardly any caps from PvP!
---
But if it was a combat rifle or radium you would deal more total damage before running out of AP. I have actually done the math on this. At 210 AP, a base damage comparison of the four comparable auto rifles puts the handmade about 80 total damage behind the radium and combat rifles. The handmade is an inferior Vats weapon when compared to the other two. The assault rifle is leagues worse than all three.
---
Ya it’s a little mood killing. Had like 5 people waiting and friend requests still coming in and he just logged off
---
Congrats, only 50 more levels until you have the build and situational perks you really want.
---
You won't be banned if you buy a weapon that was duped. You won't have it taken away.
---
If you feel that buying a weapon that might have been duped is supporting duping, that's up to you. But I don't want this kind of misinformation to spread.
---
I tried not only closing the crafting menu, but also server hop multiple times with no difference...
---
2 days ago I had problems with "placing objects" but all of those are only related to CAMP budget (its the only message it says).
---
Also, to clarify, I have 0% stored. All deployed (I know stored counts for the limit)
---
And someone needs to be there to spawn it. Just found that out the other day
---
Dude, take a break and go do something else you enjoy. Ideally something IRL outside, or something social, like a cigar lounge if you are old enough. We know the game is flawed, it will be fixed over a long time. Stay away for a while and then come back and stuff that was broken will be fixed, and new stuff will be broke. It's like FFXIV, ESO, or others at launch, they were disasters, but became legends.
---
Freeing two LCK points (the description on the item says 60% so like GwS lvl2) for... I don't know, lvl2 of some of the best perks in the game?
---
Yes, but get on today and get the survival challenge reward for the week. It's a tank/support style gatling gun, which sounds like it's right up your alley.
---
It really makes it hard to play with lower levels. I have to shoot things and run around waiting for them to get a shot off or kill.
---
Better then a legendary rolling pin😊
---
If they don't do something big for Halloween I would be so disappointed. The bombs hit America four days before Halloween, which is significant and has lots of potential. Imagine all the cool gear and weapons we could get from this event, it'd be great.
---
Omg best comment ever.  I award +64 internet points to you
---
Hello, IT. Have you tried turning it off and on again?
---
I'm gonna drop some spoiled meat for him if I ever see him.
---
Since the buffs, heavy weapons are strong enough to play without bloodied, especially with PA. Furious legendaries should be better against the SBQ, AA for the higher-damage weapons against common mobs. Bring plenty of Psychobuff to top up your damage against the SBQ.
---
Due to the fact that this game is entirely luck based I could get better items than you in those 40 3-stars. Did the person who bought one lottery ticket "earn" more than the one who bought a hundred?
---
This. Hacking all the terminals in the silo should take care of all your level 2&amp;3, maybe your 1’s too. Then it’s just finding some zero’s, which are the most common.
---
This just happened to me! Someone was using a mini gun that was destroying everything before I could get a shot. I started getting in the way, getting at least one shot then just moving out of the way. Missed out on 2 legendaries because of it.
---
Just 10 minutes ago, I picked up a quest item, fast traveled to where I was supposed to go, and the quest item disappeared from my inventory. In a single player game (and considering that I love immersion and following quests as they were intended to be), I would have simply console commanded the item back into my inventory. However, in FO76, no such luck. Go re-loot the enemy in a completely different location. Grind level 100%!
---
It's not just greedy bastards. I have 21k caps right now on my main. I will not be selling my nicer pieces in vending because even if I sold it for less than 25k, I will loose all the caps.
---
It is absolutely rediculous that 30 min of play nets you 1400 caps but you can't have more than 25k. The ratio of days caps to max is currently too small.
---
Good to know. My main interest is PvE anyway.
---
I don't, I'm sorry. I know it wasn't in a safe or anything like that.
---
Have fun!
---
Yeah :(
---
You can just implement it for 0-1. That sounds simpler than adding new items.
---
Sorry, can't read your comment on my Casio calculator.
---
Nope that's exactly the format my data is in. Nothing official just something simple I made up
---
I respect what your saying, everyone has their own preferences. I don't need rads to heal me if I 'm not getting damaged by them.  Staying alive in the zone hasn't really been an issue for me rads or no rads,  but it is an issue for low level players and bloodied players. The lower levels  will actually fight harder most of the time if the rads aren't killing them up as well as the add damage. Having a respawn point right where you're fighting is also a plus.  I'll fight the Queen in or out of the rad zones.  My point wasn't to precisely defend why we launch the way we do even though I mentioned that I don't really see any upside to fighting in the rad zones. My post was to try and get players used to actually looking at the map before they fast travel, so they can learn what the situation is before they go.
---
Same thing happened to me this weekend when I was making a second building in my camp. I couldn't make what I wanted, the stair platform got stuck, so I began trying everything to get rid of it. I ended up adding two other sets of stairs to it (to try and "un-glitch" it) that are also now stuck. I didn't want to pack up and move my entire camp, so I resigned myself to just having one (bigger) building and a janky-ass platform with a bunch of stairs going up to it.
---
Hoping they fix it eventually so I can scrap the monstrosity. My next idea is to try and get enemies to attack/destroy it, so I put some basic turrets on top. No luck yet though.
---
Lmao honestly mine was different and the bot took it down because it was “too vague”
---
This is the best time to come in fresh. There was a free for all massive dupe wave. The economy is taking caps again and is loaded with sets of armour and top gear weapons. If you have been currently playing this game and your a player such as myself who plays this game 10 hours a day It's time to retire my account. But coming in would feel different. Role playing the mafia and me a mafia boss in the most populace areas with the removal of camp griefing has just made our group rendered useless. I have everything I want now. Nothing's new and exciting the only thing that was exciting was blowing up over 250 camps in the last month and having no camp in Whitesprings. But the crybabies and casual lead extractor sitters and moral nerds made our group limp. Now for me it's boring.
---
Wait til legendary weapons are sold and traded
---
I'm even using the broken glass starter door so you can reach through the glass and use the chair glitch to get into my house but mobs stay out
---
If you wear the whole set (sword/dress/eye) the sword has 100% armor pierce on it’s own, and some of the highest base damage for a 1h in the game.
---
Either get the plans from on a table just outside a southwestern cabin of Pioneer Scout camp with a crossbow shooting range, or you can find one in places such as :
---
* A crossbow can be found outside of the Palace of the Winding Path, on a table near the archery targets, along with several bolts and a pipe pistol.
---
* A crossbow can be found in the outside building at Belching Betty, near Bernie.
---
* A crossbow can be found in a red open topped shipping container between Mount Blair trainyard and Welch. A ladder forming a ramp helps determine the correct one.
---
* A crossbow can be found in the basement locked storage room of Sons of Dane compound
---
As well as finding crossbows from dead enemies.
---
Yea noticed that too, really hope they fix it back.
---
You have to get up pretty early in the morning to catch me peeking in your windows.
---
I just want to know if they are going to patch and ban these people. Someone was telling me they werent going to do a ban wave, but i find that highly unlikely. Ive been dressing up as a cop with my buddies and "raiding" their little dupe parties when i see them. Its pretty funny, but id like to see a fix soon.
---
They'll just dupe those then is what I'm saying. Then they make super rare things like back in the parade and everyone complains. It's the communities fault but then again why is their game so exploitable?
---
Especially since the theme of this game is rebuilding America, with patriotic undertones from the tricentennial (1776-2076) and so forth.
---
I’m not for the rude shit either I just wish people didn’t try to tell people not to buy the game. I have like 10 things connected to my WiFi and yesterday I was on a single server for 6 hours. What do you want me to say?
---
Me too. TSE always felt cheap and bloodied seems lame. My current run is with the Bunker Buster if I wanna mess around and an Exploding Gatling gun for more serious stuff. The Gatling is just so fun and satisfying to me, but im looking for a good LMG to mess around with too.
---
You mean, join a completely unrelated quest where people are most likely to die? Sounds like a plan.
---
Jesus. Look at your Reddit name!
---
Yes. No luck. Next suggestion?
---
Loud equals funny
---
Very conflicting post lol
---
Indeed, it is super frustrating to get beat on just so your team can get XP.
---
Pssssst...they want you to buy atom....
---
Rads is how you do it. Diluted radaway and dirty water is how I do it, specifically. 
---
Also the Sunkissed perk is good for losing rads.
---
The chemist challenge is the WORST. Craft a serum? Cant imagine being a new player trying to get that one done. And do the Syringer parts of it even work? They didn’t with a bleedout syringer...
---
You should probably quit then. It doesn't sound like this hobby is giving you any satisfaction.
---
So true. Just hoping that we get enough keywords that google will direct people to this post. It so bad, almost comical.
---
I actually keep the gun around, as I have tons of ammo for it, and it's pretty good vs robots. Doesnt weigh much also
---
I think the bowl is back? I just crafted one in my camp yesterday.
---
Perfect......absolutely perferct.
---
...
---
It's not PVP, it's Survival Mode, in which PVP is introduced as a element of uncertainty during player interactions.
---
Survival mode is for a greater challenge, it isn't Fallnite.
---
Different paints would definitely be nice, but I’d like it if it’d be discouraged to build floating camps. They’re ugly, but building a normal CAMP costs me so much resources as I need to fix it every hour or so.
---
Yea both are pointless, one water filters are too much work to make, two ultracite ammo hard to make plus damage output for them only good on scorched then take a hit with regular enemies makes it a niche weapon where if you fight queen you use it but anything else you store in your stash.
---
It’s also still beta so take that into consideration
---
There is also one by the water pumps in the little garden in Flatwoods where you go to test the water. Its a level 1 shovel and I always grab it on alt characters when doing Thirst Things First so I have it in my stash for later.
---
Ok, so my last example is correct? The line where you have "objectName" is the map legend category for the coordinates below it?
---
Whats the total weight boost?
---
I found someone on the map.
---
Basically, revive an ally just requires you to revive another player. You could even go around asking people over microphone if they could go down for you. There are plenty of ways to complete it without any issue.
---
Yes, I want to help.
---
I'm curious.
---
Youre hooked up.
---
 GT: Mokey D
---
you guys need to learn that a lot of people do like PVP.
---
You need to unlock the in-game backpack from the Pioneer Scouts challenges before you can make the Atom Shop variants.
---
Well maybe with a cheaper fast travel you'll start making dick over fist? 😁
---
I've gotten the Wendigo and Bloatfly. I'm looking for Mothman though.
---
You're not wrong, but if the plans are already gone, you have to (1) server hop until you find them, or (2) find a random enemy that has one. 
---
At the point that I am at with this game, I have no idea what the 'Palace of the winding path' is, 'Belching Bettie' is, 'Bernie' is, or 'Sons of Dane' is. 
---
I do not want to have to resort to online internet forums to understand the basic mechanics of the game. Is this too much to ask?
---
Well maybe I’m not such a philanthropist
---
You’ve only got a skin from the atomic shop, you still need to do the quests up in toxic valley.
---
I think a different vending solution for Power Armor would need to be implemented.  Make it so players can choose to buy any piece on a frame, or the whole set with the frame.  Maybe show an interface that has a representation for each piece, that you can choose to toggle on or off, then finalize the sale and check out.  
---
Bonus points if the system displays the armor in world, rendered to look exactly how it will when you are wearing it.  Some kind of Build a Bear™ system but for Power Armor.
---
Super bonus points if you can 'load' the system with the paint schemes you know as the seller (Atom Shop obviously not included) and the buyer can pick and choose how each piece looks.
---
Maybe your experience is different than others?  Maybe because it worked for you, it doesn't mean it worked for everyone?  It's almost like human empathy is a foreign concept.
---
edit: apparently I can't reply for another 7 minutes - but:
---
Not sure where I was "forcing an idea down unwilling throats."  You have a massive misunderstanding of empathy, especially given that you end with "dog eat dog world" - thats the opposite of empathy.  Maybe I better just move on from this game and (definitely) this sub.
---
edit2: "But u R so rite I shud go back to skool to lern more tings".  Thanks for the strawman.  I'd love to engage on an actual discussion, but I can't with nothing but rude ad-hominem and strawmen.
---
They do, the recipe is a potential reward for the repeatables
---
Go to the lumber yard up north of The Forest with a melee weapon seeing they're all low level and just cream all the super mutants. You'll be rich in 308
---
You need to complete the scout quests and unlock it. That's just a skin
---
you need to run the questline to "unlock" the ability to craft backpacks before you can craft it (even the AS one)
---
I am maybe I won't get trash I want a tse it would be my first
---
Duly noted.
---
Works with scavenger outfit just fine
---
They do ? Lol sorry my friend was telling they didn’t for some reason lol
---
Just don't follow the meta. You won't be putting out the best numbers but who cares.
---
FML the one time I actually try to use pay to play lol thanks guys
---
What are the other bugged ones?
---
Total joke. I don't even look at them anymore. I go about my merry way, doing quests and the less boring events, and if that meets  a challenge, fine.
---
Yeah, that def sucks.I was jaded before that though with all of the rampant junk stealing mid battle. Which led to the sneaking, which led to the oh shit moment of finding out healing factor is op with the pylons.
---
I’m seconding WS. I got a crapload last night. It seemed like every other ghoul was legendary.
---
It would probably be similar to fallout 4 if they add them where they pick us up and they fly us to the location we want to go but to actually fly ourselves seems unlikely. Don't get me wrong I really REALLY want to pilot one but vehicles have never been added to creation kit that worked well since this game was never designed for something like this.
---
People should not spend their money on this game. It is glitchy, unfinished, and forces casual players to rely on internet forums to complete basic 'main quest' tasks. What do you want me to say?
---
Human empathy would be letting someone make their own choices and not forcing an idea down unwilling throats in an attempt to hurt a game many other people love, you give what you get. Dog eat dog world my friend.
---
Oh believe me, I remember the dupe Free for all. Its part of the reason I took a break.
---
Buy him a NukaShine, gets you out of a pickle, every time!
---
Source on the 95% of all players hating PVP?
---
The problem was it was acting as a deterrent for players to join in survival mode. None of my friends would join me on those servers, now they've lowered the reward my friends complain you can't make any money playing it lol. Never can make anyone happy!
---
I personally like living on the borders of the savage divide for the looks of the areas. Also keep in mind travel times - I try to live near the middle, and ideally slightly south as I find myself here the most.
---
And don't get caught out because some of those aluminum deposits belong to workshops
---
There is a hidden % resist that stacks with the numeric rad resist. On PA it’s like... 13% per piece (~75% with 6 pieces), on a hazmat suit it’s like 90-95%. That’s why you basically never take even 1rad/sec in a hazmat suit, and why even with 300+ rad resist outside of power armor, you take far more rads than you do in power Armor.
---
Sure am. Try turning my trash into treasure!
---
Collector due to the magazines, herpetologist, and medic right now.
---
And I quote Todd Howard, 'you can absolutely play this game solo'. 
---
Seriously, you don't see a problem with this?
---
Legend! With you in about 5 minutes
---
1. There is no pacifist mode on survival - if they don't have their gun drawn, they won't show as hostile but will still take damage just as they would otherwise.
---
2. If you're getting killed by spawn points, plant your base far enough away and don't hover on the spawn. Spawn invincibility defeats spawn campers and is essential.
---
3. Player turrets got a buff they needed in damage, but are still easy to destroy, esp at a distance.
---
Ah hell so, your set!
---
They fixed it already?  Bethesda acknowledged the problem &amp; said it wouldn't be fixed until Wednesday's patch.
---
500 caps is a steal considering it’s over 1,000 at vendors.
---
Edit: I might actually be wrong about that price though.
---
They are not allowed. Links to images only.
---
Does the map show you when someone is critically injured and requires help? No, it does not.
---
Definitely would make it better, personally just wished they increase lvl cap to make us want to farm for legendaries again since you know we all want max lvl stuff.
---
Faster hunger/thirst drain, or like decreased AP and/or agility, yeah. The armor reduction logically doesn’t make a lot of sense. For balance reasons yeah, but for immersion, no.
---
Ahh ok
---
No console commands on consoles, you insensitive clod. ;-)
---
I'm overly excited.
---
I would team up with ransoms all the time if this was the case!
---
Are you enjoying it?
---
4 star already exists as mods, when you add scorch killer mod from Firebreathers questline it adds the 4th star. But yes would love a 5th star already especially ones where I can see confetti fly everytime I get a headshot.
---
It's really not that hard to use an explosive weapon to shoot at the foot of an enemy and only inflict minor damage (at least 5% health I believe is the standard for loot population), then leave it alone until you're sure everyone else got their hits.  Let's say you're participating in Free Range.  Shoot the sheepsquatch (or two) enough to bump the health down visibly, then worry about the tertiary insects that relentlessly attack the brahmin.  Let BigJimmy2000 HAM out on the sheepsquatch while you keep the cows safe, which is where the real payout of the event is.  If one cow dies, your event loot table sucks.  If two cows die, your loot table is basically just another mutton pie recipe.  If all three cows die, the event is a wash.
---
Let's say you're a top-shelf DPS build.  My good buddy is a mid 200's lvl min/max bloodied build with a couple different god-roll gauntlets.  He'll sometimes bump up to full health and use a vampire's boxing glove when he's too stoned to remember if everyone hit an enemy.  He carries a dozen or so molotovs for events, just to deal baby damage and share with others.  He can easily kill a lvl 50 scorchbeast in one vats crit sneak attack and visibly chunk down the SBQ's health, but he just lobs a little bottle of gasoline at legendary enemies so other players can share the wealth.  I'm certain he could annihilate anyone he chooses in PvP, but his opinion is that "ahhhh maaaan, PvP is for boys with tiny dicks and no goddam self worth."  Our whole discord group laughed so hard because he's got the gear and natural talent to be in the upper 5% of all time, but he's just really happy kicking it with pals while smoking some quality weed in the evening.
---
Just to prove I'm not blowing smoke, he let me borrow [his gauntlet](https://imgur.com/GXcKxJ1) for a couple days so I could kill scorched and robots for atoms.  I don't normally run around at less than 20% health, but it was a real treat to use and experience even with a sub-optimal build.  Most generous online friend ever, and that weapon is crazy strong.
---
tl/dr: some players that are capable of absolutely crazy DPS are gentle giants.  They're not all wannabe warlords.  You have a lot of options to get hits on a 3-star without killing it outright.  If you just blast it with one shot, you're definitely a dick.
---
Oh, I was only going by what I read, I'm probably wrong.
---
Why do you enjoy RNG? Unless it really isn't RNG......
---
Idk maybe ask Alexa to uninstall?
---
Lol good damn thing I don't do challenge dailies. They sound horrible.
---
Maybe they have something planned as the Wild Appalachia content is ending with the appearance of the legendary vendor
---
Lol...I can be Appalachia’s next madam 😂
---
Pop another stealth boy and calm down.
---
Oh, is THAT why when I went to check the damage of an HR prime receiver the other day the prime receiver showed an increase of 40% instead of the 25% of the hardened receiver?  I was wondering if all of the info I knew before was wrong!
---
I read before the patch that the prime receiver on the HR was bugged though and that it would actually do 0 damage.  I'm assuming you're using it and it's awesome and doing a bit more than 0 damage?
---
It works, just have to make sure you stay undetected or you’ll die super fast. I find that activating the one that you spawn in front of, then going down the hill, and getting the one behind the house last, and ending up sneaking and chameleon on the roof is the best way. No robots stumble on you, and the imposter can’t bump or really see you.
---
Don't feed the troll. 'Nuff said.
---
I'm trying to make a point, i made two posts: PvP is perfect  - PvP needs improvement. Both are currently being downvoted. The post about a pet rock is currently soaring to viral. People here are special af.
---
Question. I have that but when I share it my friends show its known. But they cannot mod their backpack. Why?
---
You're correct
---
I know it’s just I don’t have a huge amount of money
---
Hope you kept those items my friend, you need them to craft the lvl50 versions.
---
Edit and if you didn't no worries since you don't need to wait till lvl 50 you can just run through it with an alt.
---
Well the good news is people are trading again. For over a month no one would sell anything for caps unless is was things like junk, ammo, plans etc. But weapons and armour where item for item. But the magic made more available again. The bad news is it devalued rare items. Our group was supposed to aquire a fashnuat mask. Have magic worked on it and we each of five members would get one everlasting gobstopper. Another group bought it for a measily 200$ and duped the hell out of it and now it holds no value at all.
---
1. Wrong, there most definitely is a pacifist mode. I even turned it on myself to test it, sure enough I'm invincible.
---
2. People like to fight around train stations, and now with the introduction of fast travelling to camp vendors, my point is as valid as ever.
---
3. Player homes are indestructible. I can literally hit a turret 1000 times and it wont destroy, while it can still shoot me.
---
Quick swapping a perk layout and hiding unused perks are the most request yet not addressed feature we want.
---
Really, no complaints about this game? None at all?
---
I’ve pretty much stopped picking locks or hacking computers unless i absolutely have to, it was to irritating always going in to apply those cards for just the one action then switching them out again afterwards.
---
First things first I buy stuff for my camp. Decorations and useful things.
---
After that I buy random weapons I might like. Bought a grognaks axe that’s about equal to my All Rise. Simply to get a change of weapon.
---
Guess people would be willing to pay for it. Let's say 2.99
---
You weren’t but this guy is, complain all you want. Don’t tell people not to buy a game. And if you want empathy, you give empathy. But u R so rite I shud go back to skool to lern more tings
---
I agree 100% but we would need to convince Bethesda that they can create better cap sinks instead of penalizing us for using fast travel.
---
I don’t think that’s a plan that will drop from an event or that you’ll just find out and about, I’m pretty sure you have to buy it. Reduced player vendor prices are probably your best bet.
---
All good man I got the gist of it  just made me chuckle a little.
---
If you see it selling for 500, grab it. You’re really not going to find it much cheaper
---
Depending on your level just fight super mutants and take all the weapons and sell them. The lumber mill at the top left of the map has quite a few and they’re low level.
---
No they don't need the money. They just want more.
---
Shareholders and financial backers care about 1 thing only. Maximize profit at any cost.
---
So you are saying that it would make the game more social?
---
Well guess we better start rebuilding America.
---
It's still in the game but you can't refill it at the moment.
---
Also it still works at other Camps if it was filled before they took it down.
---
Sorry if i wasn't specific enough - cheers!
---
It was amazing to see the turnaround for both 3 and NV. From vilified to idolised. Even the same wirh 4 to an extent. There has always been a contigent of fallout 'fans' who can't accept that the game has evolved. I'd have more respect if they were to say 'yep, the games evolved and it's no longer for me'. But they don't. They try their hardest to spoil and ruin it for everyone else.
---
It literally took me about 2hrs at most to finish that quest. I just asked a random player if he would jump off a cliff for me and he said sure then asked if I would jump off the cliff for him. We became friends. Lol
---
 So I was right you have no idea. Tell me what Fallout 76 is about? Why is everyone dead?
---
 This is what set me off: "It's no secret that this game is not so deep in storyline" Utter bullshit! You have no idea how deep this sucker goes.
---
  Its not at all obvious and you will not normally stumble across enough info to piece just the main storey together till maybe level 40 or so.
---
I think I remember you! I was a girl in a scout uniform who sat in the random chair in your yard as you stared at the back of my head. Loved the camp!
---
you can count in the enclave shielded underarmor (+3S if I remember right), but motion assist servos mod or whatever gives you +2S.. also, if you really want to minmax you can get a full set of unyielding armor that gives you 5/10/15 S (25/50/75 cw)  
---
Which means maximum is 75(active unyielding set)+15(underarmor) +50 (deep-pocketed set)+ 120 (extended backpack) = 260  
---
The cw for excavator PA with shocks is +210
---
a lot of bugs live on sticks
---
True. Im really just suprised how out in the open it is. Just mins ago i ran into a guy trading who had a dozen or more explosive lazers, of every kind. I think theres no consequence like the bannings before, and theyre making tons of caps, so why not
---
The idea of the badges are most likely to complete them while you explore and play the game, not to be completed in 3 minutes. So, my suggestion is to put the scout stuff on hold until you have learnt more about the game.
---
There are multiple tadpole badges and you only need to complete 3,if you can't complete one, try another.
---
100% agree on this but with recent things happening I don't think Bethesda would remove trash from legendary vendor or what purpose would have to not keep grinding in this game?
---
People have been saying go to whitesprings for legendaries forever.
---
I've been saying no, do events. 
---
They don't believe that they can get better gear doing census violence than by clearing whitesprings. Then they complain about drops. I honestly think it's just habit for them at this point.
---
Hopefully they address it with their player prestige system
---
 PvP would be much better if the aid/caps penalty wasn't so high.
---
Why would anyone "wing it" to learn how to optimize a build with such a high penalty?
---
OP weapon, decent armor and Stealth Boys does not equate "skill".
---
This. I’m 90% sure it’s one of two things. One of which is a straight up glitch, the other is sort of a glitch, sort of bad UI design, but both are avoidable if you know about them and are conscientious.  I only have 1 item lost, a long time ago, and now that I practice consciousness based on my suspicions, I haven’t lost a thing. 
---
So the first thing, the straight up glitch, is when you are scrapping/selling/dropping rapidly, the game can “grab” other stuff from your inventory even when it shouldn’t be possible. I saw it happen when i was speed-dropping junk to transfer to an alt- i was on the junk tab, but i noticed something “else” flash by. I start checking the other tabs, and a couple hundred rounds of ammo had gotten in there as well. Should not have been possible accidentally as i was only in the junk tab, thus a straight up glitch.    
---
The second thing is a bad UI design/glitch. When you drop/sell something, if you get a “quantity” slider, you can mouseover other things in your inventory before you hit accept, and it will drop the newly-highlighted thing instead of the initially selected thing.
---
Both can be avoided with conscientious attention to what you’re doing, and double-checking bags/vendors/scrapping!!.
---
Basically slow down. We shouldn’t “have to”, but until they fix this, it’s the best way to stay safe. 
---
At least that’s my impression based on my experience, because yeah, I’ve got 2 accounts, 10 characters, way too many hours played, and since I started playing mindfully of these potential issues, I haven’t lost a single thing.
---
I wish the trash cans and mail boxes would generate junk rather than being just another stash skin.
---
I’d love to power some more vending machines too!
---
I went to WS a few minutes ago, waiters are in "vendor busy" mode. It's patched.
---
1,500 to be precise
---
Wow your super lucky or you haven't mention getting 4 complete sets of 3 star wood pieces too? Seriously though I wish you luck all the luck that the RNG gods shower you with your hearts desire!
---
That's not much of a consolation but i'll take.
---
On yet,gamer tag  is xfdragon
---
Ahhh that explains it. Yeah, I didn’t try and fill it, I was just crafting stuff for the daily challenge.
---
I dunno, someday I want a glass house. This seems like asking for trouble.
---
This happens to me too. Pisses me off
---
This is where I went. Thanks again!
---
I usually throw that ammo in a bag at the nearest train station. I have tons of fruits and veggies and free water for people who come to my camp. Sofas, rocking chairs, beds. Come to buy stuff, stay because I murdered you while you were sleeping. I’m totally not wearing the skeleton costume crouching on the edge of the roof watching you...
---
The grind can be done through normal play. Doing 5 days will get you 7,000. Enough for the key card and then some. Hell, 18 straight days of killing and selling will get you to max cap capacity. It's really not an aggressively poor game to play. Nothing even needs to be purchased. All items can be found in the world so saving caps isn't hard.
---
Um... Check my history. I litterally praise other good ideas here....
---
Didn't mean to rustle your jimmies
---
Hes just worried since whats going to be released was already datamined and after seeing it I honestly dislike the new system, hoped they made it so I can buy those perks as mods and install them like you can for the 4th star instead more RNG.
---
Healing Factor, Vanguard, Sunkissed and Sneak.
---
You're not doing the build right then. You respawn with 70% rads. Adrenal Reaction, and bloodied are more effective at 80%+ rads. Nerd Rage is also only active at 80%+ rads. And since you're in PA you would also get the massive benefits of Emergency Protocols at 80%+. You should always be at 19% health or lower.
---
You need to gain 11% radiation damage every time you die.
---
I don’t need the armor as much for every day use because i run bloodied unyielding sniper, but i would only want it to have the resistance during the sbq events basically as i also have other rifles.
---
PS4 here anyone want to do the event tonight ? Need people who know what they are doing lol tiered of no one being pylons
---
No need to change your mind. You say it how you want, and I will continue on thinking you sound like a dingus. Freedom of speech and all that Merican goodness thanks to the Founding Fathers.
---
Wow thats a good idea too lol definitely like the junk idea. I wonder if all of this would muck up the build budget they give us
---
This is correct. Lots of people have decided it’s not worth the perk investment, but obviously it’s personal choice.
---
Whee rng
---
I dont use chems
---
Your damage will increase the less armour you’re wearing. Try unequiping your armour &amp; you should see the rifles damage go up.
---
It's true. All brahmin aggroed on me with plague walker (and unstable isotope), couldn't get any milk. I cured mutations yesterday until those two were gone, rebuilt my desired mutations (thanks again to all the budget serum sellers!), and now I do finally get milk!
---
S'mores, here I come.
---
I think it's more of a challenge if the SBQ event happens inside the blast zone.
---
There is more action from the mobs.
---
They should let us favorite perk cards. Favorited cards get listed at the front.
---
Indeed.
---
Scout quests are not main quest though. They are dlc
---
Only if your teammates are nearby, as in like a 2-3X the size of a campsite
---
This. I run a HW/explosives PA build. Demo expert is a no-brainer for me.
---
This is when the *real* XP grind begins, once you realise you messed up your build and have to grind levels to swap SPECIAL points around...
---
[](/angrytia)I fast traveled more than the control, tho only over small distances, I don't believe the control fast traveled at all. Sprinted as often as I could, and had perks unrelated to thirst as did control.  
---
Footage of both are linked in the post.
---
No, considering the scout stuff is new content not the main quest.
---
You just can't make up your mind, can you?
---
I've done the quest before and never even had the part to emote, drink, and eat. I don't know what triggers different parts of the quest or if it's just entirely random.
---
I don't think they ever said nor implied that
---
It was datamined a good couple months ago.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b0ng59/datamined\_new\_atomic\_shop\_items\_1303\_patch\_1108/?utm\_medium=android\_app&amp;utm\_source=share](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b0ng59/datamined_new_atomic_shop_items_1303_patch_1108/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)
---
Hah, have an upvote.  Manbabies, I'll tell ya.  🤣
---
**COTTON CANDY BITES**
---
Bite sized fun - try today!
---
*(no warranty in case of lost teeth)*
---
I only like RNG if its in my favor lol
---
Is 50 caps high???
---
and I don't even have the damn camera!
---
Depends on the enemy, really. A lot of wildlife and super mutants have lower energy resistance than damage resistance, so against the right enemy they can hold their own.
---
I do agree that the anti armor legendary should work on ER though.
---
The math is a bit fuzzy (ran out of coffee too early today), but Good with Salt is 90%, and the backpack is 60%, so your food will spoil 4x faster.
---
For me, my food barely shows any spoilage after an evening's play, so it would probably work out well for me.  But depending on how long you go between farming runs, it may be a bit more of a bother.
---
If you can swing it, bloody mess is a 15% damage increase for those 3 points, and there are a lot of other things you can use in there for VATS and other benefits.
---
Are you on Xbox? I saw a camp that had a 3 star furious Gatling plasma but I wasn’t about to drop 6k caps without seeing the other stars. I only have like 7k caps lol
---
Take my upvote sir for both your polite insult and your patriotism.
---
I'd you're running mistress, you'll have lock pick and hacker upgraded, hopefully. Take the stealth route and the final room has barely any enemies to fight at all. I get through silos with very little combat, and what little I do is mopping up whatever is left after turret hacking and such
---
Personally I dump caps on PA mod and serum recipe plans. I'll never make my money back, but I play mostly with friends, so it's handy to be able to make stuff for them occasionally.
---
I'd like some more rational caps sinks, but I'm not sure what can be done within the framework of the game. Caps are just too easy to acquire to make them that useful.
---
Random number generator. Basically its how random drops work
---
That's 3 weeks for a fix to a bug that makes selling legendaries at vending machines almost impossible...
---
Share it, have them click the plan even though it’s known and they’ll learn it. If you end up not needing it anymore I’d love to have it
---
Absolutely it would. Currently, why would I want to run West Tek or Whitesprings with a buddy if I have to make my build less efficient so “everyone can get a hit in”. Sorry but I’d rather run around by myself one punching every dirty super mutant I see.
---
Is it at 5 or higher in the SPECIAL tab in his pip-boy? He may have negative effects putting him below 5 overall; i think 5 overall is what it checks for. Find some agility buffs (food/chems/herd mentality)
---
I may be wrong.
---
How do you share a mod?
---
LOL...Ok, little Billy Gates.
---
Haha lol
---
It’s not consumed on use for some reason
---
Exactly what I was going for. Fuck yeah!
---
It’s not whether it’s worth it. Perks give them a boost so if you want more damage, use them. But if you’re dealing with mostly radroaches it doesn’t really matter.
---
Sorry! My photo gallery was full and it didn't save!
---
Merica fuck yeah !
---
1st part of the quest you have to kill shadow people.
---
2nd part is you have to eat, drink or emote around the fire.
---
3rd part is gathering dry kindling
---
4th part is gather objects from missing camper.
---
5th part is the boss.
---
 I have done it close to 20 times and have the dam thing memorized.
---
Yep.  I saw both, chuckled, and mentally scratched them out as not worth it.
---
I had three hours to play today so I just worked on possum challenges, which was far more entertaining.  With some team gifts of spices, flour and sugar, I made 9 s'mores for myself and two team-mates to eat and complete that backpacker segment.  Very gratifying, because I like helping others, but I'm still wondering where the bone scrap went......(did I feed my friends human bone dust that I collected while wearing a fedora?!?  #accidentalcannibal)
---
Haha. You must’ve been on top of something so the little vermin couldn’t reach you.
---
Yes... they did
---
For me being a bloodied deathclaw guy I don’t use anything really, just the caps and some stims... but it gives me something to do. My cycle goes kill imposter, stock store, buy cards, kill imposter, stock store.
---
lol everyday somthing new
---
I already know I have to do that. So far I havent found the grind too hard. To be fair I havent finished keys yo the past
---
For some reason I thought this was going to be about high-stakes poker in 76
---
Yup that’s the struggle.
---
Exactly. Filter by favorites.
---
I think it's ready when the bowl is activated again soon.
---
Will stop by to have a look at your shack then!
---
As a designed time waster, there are SO many things id rather waste time on than a barely working camera mechanic. That has fewer features than the old photomode. It’s bizarre. 
---
If there was more late game content it could be a neat feature, but it’s the majority of late game and its whole schtick is recycling content by taking a picture of it. Nothing new has been experienced.
---
Well, his heavy weapons comparison is primarily comparing two weapons with the same fire rate. So the DPS difference would also be the same as the base damage difference.
---
Lol. No!
---
You're meant to get three in one level up.  It's what I do.
---
Pvp is fine.
---
It’s HOW people are playing survival mode that is the problem.
---
I don't think we have the technology for something that complex.
---
No it doesnt. If you put on fireproof and the dense mod you can still be killed in 3 or 4 shots with an explosive handmade, shotgun, lever action, ect. You are just wrong.
---
Its pronounced ape-ala-chilichonga.
---
Does the sunshine meadow factory make sugar bombs??
---
That’s an awesome art style
---
When purchasing weapons I use the rule of thumb 500 per star
---
I prefer apafellatio \[apa-fuh-ley-shee-oh\] rolls off the tongue better
---
might as well just mule at that point lol
---
I use a 1* anti-armor combat shotgun, and an explosive gatling for the queen, and the game already feels easy. You definitely do not need to jump through hoops and sell arms and legs to get a full 3* meta setup, unless you want to go into survival and fight other people with full setups. But that’s F76 pvp I guess. For pve, I think you could get by without any legendaries without too much trouble tbh.
---
My health stays at 19% to keep everything active.  How am I doing my build wrong?
---
Ohhhhhh this is getting good
---
You can re-craft up to level 45. I completed after level 50 and received level 45 rewards.
---
And Blade of Bastet has rather nice armor penetration...
---
Apa lay sha
---
Okay, thank you!
---
/u/valseek
---
Give me. few... Trying to find your weapon.
---
Do you have an actual opinion on the matter or just objectively call anyone who is concerned with the lack of balance in their decision stupid? Effectively, this content has no purpose to someone who actively uses power armor.
---
Not really, there are other ways that dupers are using
---
Recon scopes are sort of broken since about... patch 6 or so. They put the diamonds on targets (if you actually get clear LoS, which can be tricky) but the diamond only shows when NOT scoped in. It also drops if you change weapons, but that sort of makes sense. 
---
The X-01 Recon helmet mod works perfectly though. It’s a hard choice between that and the targetting HUD.
---
And that's exactly what I have been saying what would happen. And I wanted to be proven wrong. :-/
---
made 3 posts, giving everyone the option to chose. If all 3 get downvoted i'll just retire from this sub cuz nothing gets done here. Go check out the pet rock post though that shit is hot af rn.
---
Yes it does I have several from there after taking it the other night in preparation for doing this and to get myself some Salisbury steaks, but they are rad free and you need the ones with rads for the recipe to make the brain bombs and the sugar roll, so they have to be collected in world.
---
Hold up im hearing all kinds of he said she said...do these mods have cons or not? One person I know with it the high capacity says it decreases your resistiance, not add it like some here seem to be assuming.
---
It's a step in the....uhhh......a direction.......with the finest.......ingredients...
---
Can't find the data mine thread that showed new utility items coming out but one of those items was a mailbox.
---
Edit found it [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/blrkwo/patch\_05\_new\_atomshop\_datamine/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/blrkwo/patch_05_new_atomshop_datamine/)
---
Yep that's correct - I add the terms to search for - they populate the legend and any matching terms get their data points map
---
Bloodied gatling or minigun can mow both down without a problem. All you need is a few stimpaks you will drop them fast.
---
Haha if your on ps4 your more than willing to come to the store/shack its literally in the ass end of nowhere but that's what makes it even better.
---
Currently a cheap stim seller at around 10-11 caps per stim, and drugs going for around 10.
---
Once i can expand into the serums they will be added in for around 400 caps per bottle, plan is to then open the kegs and bowl in the bar downstairs and just sit back and watch my customers pass out from all the moonshine or other beverages they consume or inject.
---
Oh snap. I wonder if they will be another stash or something more, functionally. :0
---
So now factor in all the possible legendary effects and upgrades that regular armor users have as opposed to power armor, not solely just in pure DR and RR but the combination of both perks available only to non-power armor users and those upgrades.
---
Come on not even close man
---
Oh dang.
---
I can't like this enough! I play Support / Medic in every team-based game I own, except this one. And it's (at least in part) for that reason. I would get nothing for being there to help the team, if I didn't explicitly, directly, contribute to killing everything. It sucks, and definitely even more-so when you're getting wailed on waiting for the rest of your team to tag...
---
Cant wait for them to fix it and the kegs. I hope i can just jam a buncha nuka cola in them :p
---
Do you have recipes for all the mutations you need?
---
You can buy recipes for serums 17500 caps each with max charisma. Even if you have all needed mutations now, they can break with patches (happened with adrenal reaction once) and it will be easy to craft and reapply them.
---
Currently wasting caps on this myself.
---
Well we NEED a damn pet rock dont you KNOW THIS!
---
Thank christ. You win the day.
---
Is it doing that for all the backpack mods?
---
Do you have a source/link for this? I've been looking for hard data on it but haven't had any luck.
---
Make it 25k and some idiots will absolutely buy it.
---
A trade off. Get over it. That's my opinion on the issue and your post.
---
I mean, I knew it was probably going to happen but I was able to help like 30 people or so learn it before it was stolen. Even helped someone’s 9 year old who just wanted to carry more stuff lol. So I’d say it was worth it, and if I can get another one I’ll keep going till it’s stolen. 
---
And I’ve had a lot of people asking me how to even get them so I’ve been able to help some people learn how to do the new content. Not everyone’s a patch note reader after all.
---
Just wish I could have kept going
---
I can tank sheepsquatch, but not while being a conduit.. 
---
People will catch on this is like that one boss in WoW where you have to be a conduit as well to make the boss vulnerable 
---
Holy shit that’s alot of caps
---
I love toilet humor. I’m 33 and giggle like a 6 year old when someone says “buttcheeks”
---
I think so, I’ve only owned the high capacity. I want to say yes but I haven’t read any proof yet
---
Nope. You are just saying unfounded BS. There were 2 secret ways. That's weren't on YouTube or face book or reddit. Both patched today.
---
Maybe your problem is, no one really cares about Survival.
---
Has now happened to me, I have a heavily defended camp too. I went AFK in bed while I chopped veggies for dinner for only 5-10 min, I come back and all 4 of my vending machines were destroyed, and one lvl 3 feral ghoul rushes at me.
---
I couldn't believe the damage, so I logged out and back in to see if maybe it was a mistake. Nope, all gone. I did a repair all from the camp toolbox, and to contradict what others have said, all the inventory being sold was remembered. So there is my experience, annoying yes, but not too bad in the end
---
Fuck, I was putting it off because it sounded like I had to do it 60 times lol. Now I’ll definitely spend the caps to start it
---
Same here, it's like an engine with wonky ignition now.
---
Armor: +30 carry weight (30 less than standard), 91 DR
---
HC: +120 carry weight (60 more than standard), -60 ER, -60 RR
---
Lead lined: same as armor but RR instead of DR
---
Insulated: same as armor and lead lined but ER
---
Refrigerated: +30 carry weight (30 less than standard), slower spoil rate (does not stack with good with salt perk)
---
I have armored and HC so I can definitely confirm for those two.
---
It's hard to say. At least even trash 3* have an increased value as scrip fodder.
---
Ive been going a bit under to hopefully incur sales. Hasn't worked great. I've got a pretty good 3* assassins bolt action pipe rifle that has come down considerably (first pricing was a "I wonder..." to which the answer was a big fat no).
---
Agree this Patch sent the stability of the ass , but for a price under 20 bucks it’s worth dipping at better times ( not this patch )
---
A Gram of what? That uncut Biffout?
---
The cash thing blows my mind....i saw this today and was amazed.  https://www.u4gm.com/fallout-76-weapons , litterally a site that exists and makes real world money from obvious duping
---
I just look at how rare / fun it is when deciding prices. Common stuff I sell for cheap; some 1 stars I sell for 350 caps, but some modded two shot weapons (one star) I sell for 1000 - 1500 caps. 
---
I see a lot of people who sell (or at least try to) their not-so-great 3 star armor for 4000 to 10000 caps though. 
---
Plans between 25 and 500 (building plans for cheap, some more unique marine plans for 500).
---
Thought it was ape-ale-chimichanga
---
The kindling doesnt have to be brought back to the fire on the initial gather step, only when you are on the final step to keep the fire do you deposit. It and depending on how much the bar needs recovery is how much kindling it will cost.
---
Praise to RNGesus!
---
Why would you need to follow a meta? Plenty of big PA wearing heavy gunners/melee builds.
---
Stop worrying about it and play what you want.
---
Build a brahmin feeder. Try to milk, if it doesn't give you milk, then kill brahmin. Repair feeder - 1 steel, 1 razorgrain. Try again. Rinse and repeat.
---
Have you ever played Call of Duty?
---
Think of that annoying kid cranking some shit rap music so loud the mic distorts while he whistles along and attempts rapping about banging your sister while the dog watches.
---
Lets not bring that to Fallout.
---
Atom’s judgement skin is the one I’m looking for.  Can’t believe they haven’t thrown that one in, would be an insta-buy for me!
---
Is census violence good event to do??
---
Again not really, they are on a griefer youtube channel, 3 ways of duping
---
Was just thinking of this yesterday.  Getting rid of ammo  @1cap/round is hard. Bulk would be nice.
---
Walk up to a Brahmin and hit the appropriate key/button to milk it. Bunch of Brahmin in Flatwood and you can set up a fertilizer resource in your camp.
---
Run around flatwoods, there a roughly 6-8 brahmin wandering around :)
---
Apa-lay-SERVER NOT RESPONDING
---
I have two extra Blade of Bastets, the vendor bot said they're too precious to despawn. Want one? PS4.
---
Yeah I’m weird with trading I sell a lot of things for caps that most people would consider trade only stuff. It’s not unusual to get 18k + for a great piece of armor or weapon that someone really wants... well , used to be easy lol. My sheepsquatch killing days will slow down I think with this new duping wave, but things will settle down again.
---
As far as the non legendary mole miners are concerned, I tend to operate on a first come first serve basis for them. Especially since more often than not, people are only ever there for the guaranteed legendary mobs.
---
For the legendary mobs, I'll pop out of stealth, do the "come here" emote, tag the mob, wait as long as possible for everyone that's there to tag it, and then kill it.
---
Sounds like I need to quit eating the sugar bombs I pick up
---
Thank you. Just trying to finish off some possum badges.
---
I've also encountered this. I had to remove stairs and place a roof or upper floor and then replace the ladder.
---
I hope Bethesda is aware of this new issue.
---
Man I’d love one! My psn is same as here if you want to add me and I can come to you.
---
Healing factor, adrenaline reaction, Nerd Rage, Dodgy, Emergency Protocols and enough rads to put you into under 20% health. Any range build with this setup you will dominate, any weapon is viable with just these perk cards and Serums.
---
Melee builds and non PA builds will need other cards.  PA is insanely strong for Shotguns and Heavy Guns since you don’t want to rely on vats or crits.
---
You can get around that by building a 2nd set of stairs to the next level so the floor is supported, removing the 1st set of stairs where you want a roof over head, apply a roof or next floor tile, rebuild the 1st set of stairs, removed the 2nd set of stairs.
---
It is dumb, but that is how I got mine to work.
---
Clean up current mess first, i.e. ban and delete, then bring out new stuff. Otherwise parasites will feast on your next hard work and kill it in no time.
---
Of course, lower than that, depending on Hard Bargain level and Charisma and Charisma buffs. I bought it for around 1,100-something.
---
If they were rich mofo they started it with 100k. Also, netting 10k profit from trading daily aint impossible. They might also start earning hard once wendor came out and its since when they did 16 sheepsquaches daily.
---
Nobody would be forcing you to listen to the channels. We need something new for the radio on the pip boy, it’s too bare bones right now and there are no new songs
---
XF dragon1
---
Master chief mind telling me why youre on this subreddit
---
I made like 20k in the first week :) used it to get great loot
---
What's your gamer tag that's mine
---
Yup. That worked. Thanks. I’ll hold it till my other friends get on. Then I can share it to u if you need it.
---
I forgot to mention...id love to see some use of my nuka machine to hold colas :p
---
No these people don't get any bugs, the game never crashed for them, it's all perfect and amazing for them
---
Would like to kno
---
I resolved this by turning on my bluetooth speaker and streaming SiriusXM's Octane while playing.
---
2000 caps and lots of ammo for a wood leg, thanks but just no.
---
Yes it does. I got one today about 2 hrs ago. Pray to rngesus
---
Don't worry about being embarrassed! I just learned the same thing about the "search" function on this sub the other day!
---
Yes and no. If you're teamed up, max of 4, you will still get the loot but no xp. However in events, if you're not teamed up, max of 4, you won't get any loot from the mobs others, not on your team, have killed. Which is why a lot of people have made this same post on here in regards to the 3* legendaries you usually see. Unless they patched that in 8.5, no loot in events for everyone.
---
If they wanted to, they could figure it out.
---
Go to the vendor station  above the whitespring stations one I forget what it calleds I think pleasant valley station , go to the right of it around the bush/ flower market on map n there is always a group of 3 in the little stream/lake
---
Noone knows what meta is, everybosy think its either bloodied if they are step behind, and tse if they are three steps behind. Its still forming TBH, and the environment evolves.
---
Yeah well I’ve only got about 25 hp
---
It’s not even out yet, build a experience before you criticize the new system that’s subject to change
---
Oh...looks like I just got some bad luck yesterday. Thanks for confirming
---
Atleast loot and a small percentage of xp from team kills.
---
AITA for not letting other lvl100+'s tag trash mobs in events? As someone at 201 I only want event rewards, to tag worthwhile enemies, and to not spend longer than necessary. Idc if there's someone 1Hing everything myself as long as they let everyone get a chance at what matters. Am I on the same page as everyone else? Or do you think it's just courtesy to let everyone get a chance to tag everything regardless of their level? 
---
To be clear I only do this in events. If I happen to be xp farming and someone else wants to join I swap weapons or perks to something weaker so there's a fair chance for tagging. 
---
Side note- I wish when people saw someone not shooting ghouls at WS's they're grouping them up, not just running into each building and not attacking for no reason. I understand it from someone new. Or someone who didn't play early on when WS farming like this was normal. But ffr when you see someone has 10 ghouls trailing him and on your map there's a lvl 7 close by. Maybe just follow the guy too, instead of slaying his followers. He's probably leading them to the 7 so it can tag everything with Molotovs. After it looks like the little guy has done a bit, slay away. Didn't take much more time, and you're not frustrating some rando trying to get his buddies alt up to a level it's fun to play with him.
---
And ninja with chameleon armor for the 3x damage bonus
---
serendipity...dodgy takes away your ap
---
Thanks for the offer! I’ve learned it, I just want another one so I can keep sharing it around 👍
---
Ive had times where I get it twice or 3 times in a row, and other times where I dont get it a dozen times. Completely random :(
---
Yep that will just about do it lol
---
Sorry, love to have your help.  XB1 here.  :(
---
Persevere my friend, you will get there!
---
Whoever made the 'creative choice' of requiring the 'aid' Royal Jelly for the recipe, set it up so it only spawns in two places and added the 'junk' one to the levelled lists of the honey beasts  needs an enema... delivered via fire hose.
---
If you're on Ps4, ill buy your aluminum, lmao
---
Yeah, but even Bloodied, if you're careful popping in and out of Vats is doable. I take a Pylon then jump on the shack and try to mow down all the eyebombs before they close in, and whittle down the Gutsies.
---
I know the Syringer ones in Chemist are bugged. Which ones are specifically broken in Musician? I've been unable to get Snare drum, Bass, or the Nukashine one, but haven't attempted others. Gonna test more later to see if anything else is buggy.
---
Serendipity doesn’t work in PA sir, also AP isn’t important in non vats builds.  They are just defensive points for dodgy.
---
Bad title for instant downvote, all good and valid points for later upvote.
---
I don't know about pathetic, but I'm a huge fan.  Free damage boost for relatively little downside if you normally run with some level of Rads.
---
I have a set of bolstering (up to 35 bonus Dr and er depending on missing health) combat armor, it holds up pretty well as long as mobs don't get a headshot
---
apparently, being in power armor counts as naked, got the points anyway
---
i notice if the game crashes or if i close it out instead of logging off that tend to make it happen
---
edit: to let you know for sure cutting the power doesnt clear it i always cut mine off when i don't want people to fast travel to my camp
---
I was really looking for apa CONGRATULATIONS
---
oh..i thought you were talking about low health unyielding build..my bad
---
I haven’t seen anyone do that event in like 2 weeks. Between the chance of a frozen loading screen, crash, or just bad luck with the body disappearing it’s not worth 2000 caps to try it.
---
It’s fantastic! If you’re using class freak 3 it has -12 health... that’s nothing for a whole ton of free damage.
---
Spawn camping should either be reportable as harassment or there needs to be a PvP exclusion zone around the train stations.
---
There, I fixed 80% of the issues in Survival.  Give me a viable strategy to make me immune to getting 1 shot poprocked by explosive weapons and there goes the last 20%.  And by viable strategy, that means I'm willing to use caps, armor slots, increased vulnerability to other weapons, and/or Perks to do it. Don't just unilaterally nerf certain types of weapons.
---
Apparently it works with deathclaws if you equip both of them, it doesn't seem to with mega sloths though.
---
You dont have to kill the brahmin. Just store it and place it down again, save your resources!
---
I agree the amount I have consumed is now coming back to haunt me like a bad dream
---
It's certainly showed me there are *a lot* of really amateur players who presumably used to happily play fo4 on easy and this is their first mmo. I just get the impression some people just *'get it'* with 76. Others' don't.
---
Lol the kid is cute I love how he sings the intro
---
I rather punish her for not giving me the milk
---
Don't know if they fixed it or not. But go to your camp. Make sure you have the 10% budget free. Place brahim pen down. Exit build menu. Milk. Enter build menu. Store brahim. Exit build menu. Re enter build menu (might have to fast travel and back) replace brahim and Mike then store again
---
Side effect is that people using buikds that relied on similar weapons and even their legitly looted less OP counterparts would be hit by that too.
---
Not possible unfortunately. If you're re on Xbox I could help you out
---
Fair enough!
---
Acoustic guitar and the ones you mentioned. I abandoned the badge after i figured those ones out
---
That’s the symptom but I don’t know if it’s related to food/water. I’ll pay attention to that later.  Yes I have healing factor
---
It's not even that the broadsider is too gimmicky. It's just awful...
---
Two months ago, I could expect about 400 ATOM a week in Challenges. That's about 120 from the weekly and 40 a day for teh dailies. Not bad for someone who does an hour or two a day.  
---
This went down to 200 at that time.  
---
Now I'm lucky to pull in a hundred a week.  
---
This ... is not good. I mean, I know you want o go to a Fremium-style game, where the money's from teh online store but ... yeesh.
---
It happened to me on a server disconnect as well.
---
Its ass. But I still play it.
---
Cause he's stuck on the radio antenna and needs some help
---
Na they need to. Or the worlds empty...
---
Agreed 100% I'm sure they woke up one morning and thought, hey how can we make this task as difficult as possible whilst giving the illusion that you can just snatch it up easily anywhere! I will adapt and overcome and I will complete this badge with pride
---
That looks awesome
---
Yes!!!
---
Thanks for the quick reply, that might be it because that's the only way I shut down my PS4. But it didn't happen before. Thanks, man. Still dreading putting 60 3 star legendaries up for sale. Now I gotta come up with completely arbitrary prices again. Thinking about basing it in increments of daily cap gains this time, that way it seems reasonable for players that don't know markets
---
No, you need some one to help, although they don't actually have to hold your stuff. As long as you rejoin on the same server, you can transfer items between characters. You just put your stuff in a container and switch.
---
I ran into this problem, only it wouldn't let me build a roof directly above the stairs.
---
I dont have an experience with the 1 and 2 but 3 is absolutely right.
---
If I really need to use a camp, I'll try not to be a dick and only shoot the turrets, or if I can I'll shoot out the power to the ones that require it so that I minimize destruction.
---
Now, you get the turrets to 0 health and they still keep shooting.
---
Ya out of PA I’d consider serendipity.  Also dodgy too if it’s a melee build.
---
What a surprise! You mean the quest isn't working as intended?
---
Well come to my vending because I sell my stuff way below value unless it's hard to get plans or weapons. Still I've sold some stuff well under other's prices and I sell what I can from daily grinding.
---
I'm a talkative player. If I am running WS alone, I one-shot em all and get on with my day. If I see another player, I pull out a dinky knife and juck em to get my hit but lead them out to the other player....all the while announcing my intention over mic. 
---
Still, sometimes someone comes in and "saves" me from the mob and runs it.
---
Was it Chally Moo Moo or whatever?  
---
She'll get separated from Graham from time to time. I see her far more frequently than him.

Happy hunting amigo :)
---
No definitive spawn point but i got mine from at the top of the lighthouse where the mothman event is
---
I’ve been nuking harpers ferry before the burrows came in.  Great way to get end game armor and weapons, but people have to keep loading in to get the enemies to respawn, I’ve fought 4 3* legendaries at Harpers ferry at one time! All super mutants! 
---
That day was glorious ✨
---
Did you ever get back on your character?
---
Yeah, but I was 7 floors up. It’s not that easy to build a second set.
---
I pick up all 3 pylons if I'm able to then use about 5 nuka quantums while standing on the roof. 
---
If pylons are taken I will tank her.
---
It sucks that moochers will always exist but it's easy to ignore them.
---
Gotcha. I'll keep that in mind and test out other badges as I'm wandering around; if anything else comes back incomplete after a few attempts, I'll reply here again.

I respectfully disagree with the other two commentators.  There is a way.  It involves some risk, but there is a back-door process.  Let me know if you are interested and I can DM you.

---
Yea I did after the next big patch from when this was happening came out everything was fixed it was something to do with the fermenter and a specific chain of events that just so happened to occur in my game
---
You contributions are great, you have my vote
---
i was trying to figure something like give drugs the bobble head length, and make bobble head 24 hours, but i like this too
---
Actually, very possible. The trick was actually explained to me by a duper many moons ago, who used it to smuggle his illicit goods. But, basically, join a world. Put item in box. Take picture of recent players list. Leave game. Search for player on Xbox directory. Join their game. If it doesn't work, try the next player. 
---
Obviously, test it on something you don't care to lose, first. But that's what I've heard.
---
You're saying I like ass?  👀
---
Never in my whole gameplay (lvl66) have i grotten so many legendaries as i did today. Think i farmed 20-30 pieces with only 2 server hops in the same spot.
---
Yeah I would love to be able to exchange a bunch of unwanted perk cards in exchange for a roll in my chosen special stat.
---
Hated for his honest opinion how sad
---
Oh, I forgot to add "Loot box," as the very last step.
---
I have tried this trick as I saw it mentioned in another post but it didn't work for me unfortunately, I even tried the 3 in  flatwoods and the 3 wild ones near my camp with no success, I press the button the brahim kicks but no milk, guess it's just not my night for milk :)
---
Why not show the inside the vault article that says that. Or a YouTuber with a video about the new power armor?
---
I got the refrigeration mod this morning, gonna test it when I get online.
---
And for the love of Atom please let me place the upside down slanted walls wherever they can connect to a wall!  Those upside down slanted pieces could make such cool things but all you can do with them now is fix the occasional odd roofing angle mismatch.
---
We damn yankees call it apple LAY chia
---
Read the patch notes.
---
that's the way I have to go, I see..but I'm gonna have to move some perks and points around.
---
..is the stealth route easily discovered, or do I need to research it first on line first to avoid missing something?
---
Still got a few bugs but not as bad as before
---
Instead of adding more emotes, they should just add text chat
---
You need someone to be an anchor to a server but on XB1 you can rejoin anyone with non restrictive privacy settings from Recent Players menu option. Any other system you need a friend to join. 
---
You risk someone finding your dead drop and looting the stuff though. I only move items with a friend. Server crashed doing the drop and rejoin method once. Lost a bunch of junk and ult. ammo. Never did it again with anything I wouldn't just give away if someone asked lol.
---
I've noticed lately it varies by server.  Server shop whitesprings until you get a good one
---
Nope sounds like a potato chip 👎
---
My Assassin's Mole Miners Gauntlet +40 Swing Speed 2\* 1000 caps at a vendor.
---
You seem to be spot on.
---
Phishing email perhaps?
---
yea it seems it tries to record your "shop inventory" when you log off and if that doesnt go correctly it loses it
---
Thanks :) was browsing for something like this idk how it miss it all I was seeing were complains about challenges and stuff I didn’t get lol
---
Not using automatic. No they have not fixed the damage bug had it happen to two days but I could not do any range damage what so ever with any gun.
---
"I will leave you alone once you pvp me again"
---
Finally popped my blacklist cherry lmao
---
I got a 3 star gatling but it wasn't too impressive. Resolute veteran I think it was called. Suppression, 50%reduced damage taken while aiming, 10% additional damage while aiming
---
I see what you mean. I like having all the weight reduction cards in lvl 1 on me (chems, armor, food &amp; drinks, ballistic ammo/energy ammo &amp; junk). Just makes everything weigh a bit less. 
---
Maybe a way to go. This way only 1 point will be needed in few SPECIAL’s
---
That's cool, man. Have to look into it. I've hit max caps twice from player vending but I still have never made 200k from my trades. Look at this guy's trading history, it's pretty obvious he's benefiting
---
I see chally in full sprint a lot but never graham.
---
Mmmm. Orangey.
---
Since I first got to lvl 50 I wanted a legendary grinder like in Borderlands PS. This seems like the same kind of thing: put in 3 and get out 1 of the same lvl.
---
I went with the armored one.  feels like walking around in power armor
---
I had wrote doing this off. Thanks for the info.
---
The only thing I’ve noticed is my quests take a little while to become active not a big deal though
---
What...?
---
I’ll test it with ya just shoot me a friend request when you’re home. Psn is veknilo
---
Yep....and prominent youtubers who do fo76 vids promote the site and get a cut of references.
---
Not seeing one on either email
---
Very much agreed!...would love that, make it like a receipt tape, doesn't need to be complicated, just who / when / what / cost
---
Thanks, man. Appreciate the quick answer
---
Ah yes my biggest oof moment of them all: 
---
Whitesprings- ferals swarming everywhere, I shoot someone on accident, he turns around and instead of clicking “No” I click “PvP”.....yeah he murdered me haha.
---
Also more emotes in general, pointing, laughing, etc.
---
Born and raised in WV...I pronounce it App-uh-latch-uh.
---
He’s right, it works. Takes you out of the fight but it keeps her vulnerable.
---
If you are interested, I posted my run on r/fo76guides under Granny's Cap Stash Run
---
Your crazy I have a lovely fiance that I know for a fact will give it back. ;) plus I'm on xbox but good try
---
this is the first im hearing of it..
---
I'll let you know though
---
Fallout 76 to my knowledge is way over 50gb
---
But your right - not all games* some do fit the disc
---
I’ve got one, one star for 1k but I PERSONALLY feel as it’s worth it. 2 shot LMG, I mean I NEVER get those guns to drop probably one out of a thousand and I’m not even exaggerating, so getting a two shot one I feel like is pretty rare. Maybe?
---
I found this one as well a few hours ago. 
---
But just a server before that I saw the same pack  Brahmin (same spot) with the responder vendor next to it. 
---
Only this time I didn’t see the trader. 
---
I was positive it was the Brahmin who followed the trader but couldn’t find him. 
---
Maybe someone/something killed him leaving the Brahmin all alone by itself
---
This is all I could here in my head after the first couple of words sorry! 
---
In West Philadelphia born and raised
---
On the playground is where I spent most of my days
---
Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool
---
And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school
---
When a couple of guys who were up to no good
---
Started making trouble in my neighborhood
---
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
---
And said "You're moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air"
---
maybe the  addition of the machine  is what opened up the duping method.
---
So, you completed the quest by asking someone to jump off a cliff? Totally normal...
---
I was just there like 15 minutes ago, it was there for me lol
---
You just told me you don't lose rads when you die.
---
You do. You go back to 30%, which is what I just explained. If you aren't noticing this you are not re-activating your bonus after you die.
---
Also what the other guy said. Rad resist basically does nothing in this game except lower the rad damage from a ghoul, radiation barrel or gamma gun. None of that shit gives me issues so -rad resist means nothing to me.
---
If you don't believe us try stacking a radshield with some legendary trapper or combat armor that has rad resist (garbage) mod. You can get well above a power armor rad resist rating but you will still liquefy in a microsecond if you walk into a nuke zone. The only thing that keeps you alive is the hidden rad bonus from PA, not the shown rad resist which is largely worthless.
---
How about having it accessible from a player controlled workshop with a radio tower :D, and closer to being able to build a track list, but maybe broadcasting their mic...dunno how we would want to do that
---
it'd obviously just be a radio station, wouldn't just be blaring everywhere...
---
Pack Rat Perk + Legendary Junk Weight Reduction is addictive.

Other than the legendary mirelurk kings getting way more tanky, no ;/

Edit: I logged off and back on and now the machine is back, sorry for any false info
---
U on?
---
Sorry to hear some db took your mod that is F’ed up
---
Odd. Platform? They're getting less common but I still see the popup multiple times a day on PS4. I probably join 3 a week since I'll only do it if all my junk is in stash and I'm not doing anything else.
---
Thats actually really good advice, I usually wear unyielding with one chameleon. Ill def switch that out for the event and eat some sugar bombs!
---
Like Station Vendors they sometime take a while to load.
---
It's dangerous, but it's possible. 
---
Here's the parameters, you need to be in a world of someone on your friends list, either ask them not to leave the world, orrr put your items you want into a world chest, check again that they are in your world and relog to other character quickly,  you'll have a about 10-20 seconds where before select to relog again, if they somehow log out within that time, you'll loose the server and your stuff. It's a very low chance, but if you have really important things, then maybe do a mule trade.
---
1 last thing. This is the only reason why I have onced lost my stuff and I lost good stuff. There needs to be someone within the area/region, I don't know the distance. Whether it's like, you are in the forest, so there just needs to be someone in the forest, or closer. 
---
If there's no-one in the area, the servers refresh all world containers and your stuff would be lost
---
I about 99.9999999999% sure I read on inside the vault they were exploring this so patience young one!
---
If you’re on ps4 I got 2 extra ones, I’m down to let you have one
---
I have an Emporium that only sells teddy bears. I have a souvenir bear that goes for 12.5k and a pristine teddy that goes for the same. As a joke lol. All my other bears are 10 caps a pop.
---
It’s happened to me twice. Once a few months ago and then just yesterday.
---
Thank fucking god I was seriously upset haha
---
Have you figured anything out?
---
Yeah assets have been taking much longer to load in, especially my CAMP. Even random world spawn loot and enemies have been wildly delayed at times.
---
Easily done with my 3* mop

You’re telling me to go buy a duped weapon? This is why the game is being ruined.
---
I'd be happy to do the same. I still need the imposter outfit. PS4 GT- chaos_theory_808
---
This is what the powered doors are for, they close after 3 seconds
---
Yeah I could do that but still would be much better if the ammos were like 90% lighter and not using too much slots. Or bethesda could just make energy ammos lighter specifically 2mm for me lol
---
rock an unyielding set to get better prices!
---
Tell me what you enjoy? Maybe I'll team up with you and you can show me a good time
---
Jesus you’re going hard on the guy.
---
Naked nukes, run in the border, take a rad X and spam like 5 radaways and both snap the picture as quick as possible.
---
Is there a good spot to remain undetected?
---
Yep game starts to be fun now you can use everything you come across
---
That’s exactly what happened to me when I had an Xbox (I’m now a pc, lads) there were these two wanted guys so I went and killed them and they had like 1000 of every junk in the game and they just kept on messaging me telling me to give back they’re shit or they’d just follow me around forever (at this point they’d already been following me around shooting me in the head constantly for the past 5-10 mins) (also this was when there was the bad pvp) it was so annoying to me and they were sending me threats (in game only lol) I finally gave up and joined them, asked what the fuck they wanted and they said if I give them there junk back, they would give me good loot and I just left the party blocked them on Xbox and on 76 and hopped of 76. Tbh I was actually getting scared that they’d be able to track me down irl but they haven’t found me to this day so idk. Edit no they actually had a lot of junk but it wasn’t as much as I said there.
---
Wow that's a real kick in the balls, lol.  
---
Might as well just have fewer challenges if the idea is to limit atom income.
---
Spawn camping is reportable as harassment, i do it any time it happens.
---
Well that’s how he got it, and regardless of your morals and values the reality is you have two options, adapt, or move on.
---
Pretty much same as you, all depends on the buyer too. I try and keep a balance of housing and armor/gun plans.  Armor guns sell randomly, but usually a builder will swoop in and buy the housing plans.
---
1* instigating gauss sold for like 900 caps in an hour. Have to keep cuting price down on 2* bloodied pipe wrech to 300 and still wont sell. Think second star is either limb or blocking.
---
In theory, but in practice, a lot of stronger enemies have near-equal ballistic, and energy defense.  So, any advantage of using energy weapons to take advantage of a perceived lower energy resistance is thrown right out the window with certain enemies higher-leveled like Gutsy robots, which have fairly equal defenses.  And robots are supposed to be weaker to energy weapons because they're made of metal, but they're all pretty strong against it.
---
The only enemies I've seen that apparently have a very large gap in their defense attributes are super mutants, but they still have enough to reduce damage considerably.
---
There should really be an AP-receiver or mod for most energy weapons.  I want to use them just to shake things up, but Bethesda isn't making it easy because of the lack of penetration to armored targets.  Unless you're relying on sneak attacks, or auto-criticals, which might even work better on ballistic stuff.
---
Oh sorry, didn't realize there's a difference between the quality of main quests vs. side quests
---
Some weapons are super fun but priced too low at the vendors. I have a 3 star death tambo that has +1 strength and the game says it’s worth 40 caps. It’s obviously worth a hell of a lot more than that.
---
I love how you’re basically defending and vouching for people who cheat. Way to go bud
---
Instead of swappable loadouts like some people want, I reckon they should just give every player one or two dedicated “crafting” or “utility” perk slots. Or better yet, make those non-combat perks work passively regardless of whether they are equipped.
---
The same thing I enjoyed in previous Fallouts - exploring, the environmental storytelling.
---
And here in particular, the interaction with other players. There are many possibilities.
---
I don't know, different people like different things.
---
Browsing Reddit = forcing an idea down unwilling throats.
---
Believe her.
---
I'd love to see the game in a tropical setting
---
For common things like scrap, aid, most clothing, I go with about half of face value. It’s more than the bots pay and less than they charge, so everybody wins. I do the same for most plans unless I know it’s something super rare. 
---
For legendary items I value them at roughly 300/star, unless it’s a really desirable item. I could see that valuation going up or down once we all get a little more familiar with the Legendary Vendor.
---
I have an issue with the Xbox OS or something. I can no longer use any mic with my system. I've tried everything while troubleshooting with support and couldn't fix it. So my only way to be talkative is to invite someone to a private party and through the Xbox app use my cell phone as a mic. So I can't explain anything to anyone without more steps than it's worth in most cases. Support determined my 3rd party headset somehow messed up my system and they had no further advice from there. That's been months ago and no fix yet. I really liked being able to chat up people too but Divine intervention took it from me.
---
Ok, main quest solo only. Totally get it.
---
Makes sense to me. Its a sellers market, and they probably want to scrip it the next day. So set it high. The value of an item is how much the seller is willing to part with it, not how much you think it’s worth.
---
Ghoul pirates
---
Yessir
---
I juuuuust got back into it since they nerfed the tse guns a couple months ago but I was a level 170ish so when I logged in I was immediately making a f*@% ton of money from setting up a vendor @ the whitespring I think with starting a new character it would probably be a little easier to make caps and progress thru the game considering your not paying for vendor priced items (for the most part)
---
You're doing Atom's work, child. 
---
Anything ever come of it?
---
I see what you did back there
---
Found a sentinel leg piece three star in a bag during a nuke at Whitesprings
---
So am i. Can u join me in mid if something. Gt AngryDylan001
---
Can you list all my options please?
---
How much you charge?
---
Fallout 76 is a good game, and that's a rock fact!
---
When they nerfed TSEs I lost it and dropped a TSE Handmade +1 Agi in a bag and rage quit for 2 months to main Anthem(horrible decision)  
---
 A: Regrets....  B: I like to think some rando picked it up and had a good day, rather than it dissapeared.
---
76 looks 10x better than the others so

Thank you! I'm playing on PC.

Sorry, didn't get any. Rng Gods were angry.

Whats ur gt game crashed

Have the head. Need the costume.

Hahah
---
A trade off for what? Regular armor already has the advantage, do you care to elaborate or just make statements without any kind of basis for your argument?
---
You mean like... the radium rifle?
---
You know what annoys me the most? It's not that this feature is missing - it's that we *don't know* if they're working on it, or if they've shunned it as not possible or anything. We have no idea what they know, or think, or do, and it leaves us calling out into the abyss with the same daily reddit post. It leaves me torn between constantly posting about *every single bug* I encounter - or on the other hand doing fuck all about it and just hoping they're competent. Fuck knows.
---
&lt;/rant&gt;
---
Bloody Explosive Power Armor Heavy Gun user.  I can one shot 68 super mutants with a BE Prime Gatling and melt a SB with a prime BE LMG in a second. BE 50 cal for the Queen.  I basically solod the Queen this weekend, a Level 40ish showed up and hit her a few times but I suspect didn’t do a whole lot.
---
Omg yes, all day yes. Pipe blunderbust? Yes please. Homemade sabers? Definitely
---
Fix it. Properly fix it. Make it never able to happen again if possible. 
---
Now upgrade the soft level cap. Weapons go to level 100. Mobs scale up. Your current level 50 gear is now not the best. 
---
It's a reset that will almost certainly happen. It's basically like an expansion or patch in WoW.
---
It was a bug but it seems to have been fixed. With the recent love that energy weapons have been getting it's much better.  When I was making my decision I took out a lvl 68 scorched crown with each and the AA was much faster.
---
Fantastic idea! I would be terrified of a power armored scorch army with legendary weapons.
---
The 2 garunteed Royal jelly aid spawns will only spawn for you individually once roughly every 20 hours. So get two and look again tomorrow.
---
The royal jelly that respawns on the road above 76 has always been the junk item for me.
---
Aid item
---
-Tanagra Town: top, to floor bathtub 
---
-Middle Mountain Cabins: grave behind main cabin
---
I never defended anyone, I told you cold hard facts you don’t want to accept, those facts are reality, like I said, adapt or move on.
---
My suggestion, buy something from someone that is valuable to them at an inflated price.  Still hurts them and will screw with the in-game economy....
---
ANARCHY, ANARCHY, ANARCHY!!!
---
To be fair, there does need to be priority calls so actually odds are we won't get both - at least not in the same patch.
---
I was speaking in terms of past Fallout titles. Unfortunately the setting of the game doesn't allow for as great a presentation as before since there's not much going on story-wise presently, and not much planned for the future. Sure, you learn a lot about the history and there's plenty to discover, but it's a narrow method of storytelling.
---
Again, I don't have interest in explaining myself over what I know about the game. If you knew me you'd know I do know a lot. I really just wanted a reason to come back but people took this question very personally.
---

300+ hrs and have yet to get a plasma grenade plan 😑
---
I was able to earn musician badge on Saturday (ps4). Which part wouldn’t register for you?
---
I've completed 90% (I haven't launched a nuke or killed SBQ, launching can absolutely done solo although SBQ can't) of the story and I am in the process of leveling up 3 different builds, all solo. Yes there are a couple of things I can't do solo but most of them are atom related. My experience hasn't been diminished because they aren't done. 
---
I will say you missed out on free range, encryptid and even Fasnacht. Where these can't be done solo, when the events were fresh they were an excellent community experience, now attendance is weak and the events aren't as much fun.
---
I hear Ash Heap quests but I still haven't found it.
---
The *whole* camp placement rules need to just smoke a big fat doobie and relax. There's no reason for them to be so crazy restrictive as they are.
---
thats awesome, it looks like it belongs there, without the new flags, you could think it was an in-game camp.
---
I was talking with my friend about this recently. GTA lets you pick facial expression and walking animation. Considering FO76 actually sells poses and emotes, I find it really weird that you can't use these features in more ways.
---
Whaaaat?!
---
Also PS4. Playing the instruments in Watoga, etc isn't counting.
---
If this is on PC then this could've been me, I shot a random bot going along thinking it was going to shoot at me and there was a dude in Power amour nearby 🤔 though the dude in Power armour was wanted so that should help figure it out
---
No. Like the gamma Gun. That it shoots round circles of cool radiation instead of radiation soaked rounds
---
Not bad.
---
I went back to 4 the other day and couldn't tell the difference between them
---
I hear ya. I just sold a 2 shot shotgun for 750. I have a couple other 2 shots under 1K. I sell 1☆ Instigating and executioners for about 900-1100 depending on the weapon
---
Whoever dropped it didn’t read it.
---
Tell him it's a skin not a paint
---
How do you even get the deaths claw hide. I scraped 5 death claw hand and it didn’t work is it just bugged or is it something else I have to get?
---
From Chicago.
---
It’s Apple-eh-chah.
---
For Wisconsin pronunciation just remove the e from the middle syllable and add like five As.
---
They nerfed all the weapons so much, that the the meta now is a stick. Which only drops from the SBQ, so good luck punching her enough to get her to drop one. There's only one person in the game right now who managed to glitch kill the queen, and he duped like 20k sticks, but he's charging like $20 rl dollars, so only his best buds have sticks, and they're all raiders.
---
Good luck playing with no weapons, when his "raider" buddies do nothing but kill steal, because they can do massive stick damage, and the rest of us are just using dull rocks. Then they start beating us with the sticks (thank goodness for no slap dmg amiright???), and call us stickless trash.
---
So, if that sounds like fun to you, then you should join our S&amp;M roleplaying group, the "Stickless Wonders". We meet every Tuesday, but don't accept invites from some guy named Mo0kish, he creeps even the wierdos out.
---
No shit... If you're telling it "find me another world" it shouldn't translate into "take 5 minutes of my life and drop me back into the same world"
---
It's an item named Death Claw Hide. I've found one killing Gulpers. I hear containers and especially meat bags, but I've only found the one in the Gulpers...
---
that's bad but I'm sure you'll get something good with the legendary vendor.
---
I like everything you’re saying but I would like to just chime in with a bit of devil’s advocacy. 
---
There is absolutely room for camera challenges as long as they are *reasonable* camera challenges.
---
“Take a photo of another player in the cranberry bog” is a reasonable challenge. “Take a photo of another player in a specific room of a specific location doing a specific action” is not.
---
“Take photos of 5 locations in the forest/bog/mire/divide/heap” is both reasonable and sets you up for an adventure.
---
“Take a photo of Grahm” is reasonable *only if* there’s no location or action requirement, and there’s a reliable way to find him.
---
No it was named “pack brahmin” that’s it
---
I’ve completed all of those from the ‘Can Be’ list plus  metal worker and robotics (turns out I had ‘sturdy robot legs’ plan learned. Picked it up again at Harper’s and it’s in my vendor boxes now.
---
I had my doors unlocked already.  I had to redesign part of my home so people wouldn't get stuck in the foundation.
---
PS4, EU.  Don't play more than 3 hours a day in the week. (I have a job).
---
If you persistently do the event enough times, even with low stats, your luck is eventually going to roll in your favor.  Yes, legendary effects and low health will help a lot, but I typically don't roll around while nearly dead and I've got good event loot.  Persistence is better than any legendary gear.  That's the pioneer scout's way!
---
Oh crap, I just realized I've probably stolen those a few times. I always assumed it was junk people ditched but I've found some good stuff in some of them. I feel kinda bad now :(
---
How? lol
---
It may be bugged for you. I went to the theater stage in the high school and it registered right away for me.
---
Platform ?
---
You can't give the camera away or trade it.
---
Losing battle bro, she's right. I have mine on my Ultracite
---
Actually it's a good way to go about it. Even in my first play through I set aside the main quest for a while and leveled to 50. Currently doing the same with other characters.
---
I find that activating the one that you spawn in front of, then going down the hill, and getting the one behind the house last, and ending up sneaking and chameleon on the roof is the best way. No robots stumble on you, and the imposter can’t bump or really see you.
---
Yeah the middle mountain cabins one and tanagra town are the ones I know about thanks to reddit I have never picked up the aid item version only the junk item version until I tried today but the several server hops just turned up a looted area each time. Going to do a whitesprings run then try again on another new server and pray to atom I find the bits I need.
---
I personally got the power armor edition so I know what you mean , I was blinded by fan boy ness and e3 lies ...
---
I was mad for many months until I just gave up and the sucker was just me all along
---
Athlete archer and hunter are the most commonly done  I would say.
---
I hate that the powered doors are only in the brick set...which I'd rather have it in Metal Building Set, also I prefer the Metal Industrial Door that is like a large screen door, besides I don't understand why the powered doors have to be so much thicker than the regular wall in the Brick Building Set...set's my OCD off the charts looking at it...
---
If your from Chicago I’m just glad your still alive bro sheesh!
---
Interesting. A friend and I went to the same spot and it didn't register for either of us so we assumed....
---
Maybe worth a server hop or two, I guess. Can't hurt.
---
Oh thank Atom
---
Well that sucks I was almost done with the leatherwork
---
People will steal anything.
---
Yes never pay over 1k per star ( unless really looking for something in specific)
---
I was considering doing this just to protect my bears from being scrapped (and other items that I keep hoping will one day be used for decorations)
---
&gt; Which is odd.
---
just out of curiosity what makes deathclaw hides hard to find?  Do they not drop frequently or something?
---
If you're on Xbox, can I trade you for it? I've been trying to get all the BOS stuff and that's now the last thing I need to complete the set.
---
At least I’m not the only old person here lol
---
True, but turrets and defenses set in the right positions stop that. My camp gets attacked all the time, but I have 3 missile turrets and 3 level 15 machine gun turrets, nothing gets passed them. Defences cost much less now, so use them. I also placed my camp in a very defendable position at the side of a cliff, so generally I only defend from the one side.
---
I'm not sure, I have be wondering the same thing and I am level 153
---
At least for my Gatling gun it's 50%. My quad exploding harpoon gun does double the damage my Gatling gun does. All 4 shots of the harpoon gun will not more her health bar. The prime Gatling gun literally takes a few frames of health every shot.
---
Appreciate the tip, yeah I just didn't have any reason to head all the way up there yet. I did recall from my first character (melee build) that Super Mutants in particular drop a lot of .308 ammo. 
---
I was just in a jam at the time, no lead, low level - my melee damage is quite poor at the moment (doing a rifle build). I was sitting on like 25 .308 ammo was worried I was going to flat out run out and be screwed.
---
I have a steady supply of lead now - regardless putting up certain ammo for sale at one cap a piece is still a smart idea. I'll probably dabble in it once I get my character further along (level 13 atm).
---
/rant
---
Great idea on the s'mores! So sad I'm not on Xbox righr now. Lol
---
People have claimed that you have to relog before it'll take effect. 
---
I've definitely seen a difference in spawn point after moving it, but there might be other factors at play.
---
Don’t forget to stock up on plastic ware while you’re at it. Good luck
---
Ofcourse, but i can only speak for myself here. When ever i see anyone around and i spot a legendary i always try to emote to have them come over so they can tag it with out me tagging the legendary 1st because as soon as i do i usually one hit the things and i dont always carry a tesla or any other weapon other than the ones i use as it takes up weight. But what gets me is when they focus on tagging the regular mobs 1st as i try to tank hits and die in the process of me waiting for them. What makes it more insulting is that they pick up my bag when i die and kill off the rest of the legendaries that i have not been able to tag.
---
So i always give the courtesy of emoting them to come over and point at the legendary, from there they have a few seconds to tag it before i blast the entire mob in front of me into bits.
---
They're very rare and you can only find them in containers (and very rarely in Gulpers, it seems). You do not get them from farming death claws.
---
It's kind of counter-intuitive. I don't know of any in-world location where one is just laying around. You can find Yao Gaui and Brahmin hides laying around in-world (tree house, iirc).
---
Trying to visualize the aesthetic for wearing a backpack on top of PA is ridiculous. The whole point of backpacks is because a significant amount of people prefer being on foot over power armor. It was intended for non-pa from the get go. PA does have an advantage over basic armor and some legendary armors on top of increased carry weight.  There are also talks of Legendary Power Armor parts in the future, though it's unsure how it will be implemented. If you feel PA is so underpowered how about just stick to being on foot then?
---
Utilize equipment/armor per scenario
---
Also you could have easily narrowed down that inane post to just a couple of sentences. When somebody like yourself is posting huge walls of text most people clearly don't care about, I can't help but think the rads might have got to your brain buddy.
---
Never give a sucker an even break.
---
And he despawned. :(
---
Thanks a lot!

[Here's your picture](https://i.imgur.com/TJgb7gv.jpg)

Yeah it would be better. You’re right right. 
---
I love the gauss. So I’m dealing as well with the ammo limitation do to weight
---
No comment on outfit.
---
Poster is *amazing* however
---
It used to be good when the 200% repair gave it extra damage, but it's worthless now.
---
I just want the look in my dark rider armor. Still doesn't work.....

Lol another one of these posts
---
 There is more story in Fallout 76 than any other Fallout game. I have thousands of hours in all the 3d Fallout games and know them intimately.
---
 You know nothing, that's obvious, but I have come full circle now. You should probably stay away.
---
Huh, weird. 
---
I'm hoping its all pointing towards new content. The Deathclaw Merchant as well. They're up to something back there.
---
I would like to see one in either Alaska, because of the war, or Hawaii just because I would love to see something aquatic besides Mirelurks and it would be a closed ecosystem.
---
It used to be able to be over repaired and do more damage but they removed it or the removal was bug, but this is s good video I saw showing the potential of it back when it could be over repaired: https://youtu.be/RVgK7-kIH4Q
---
I love this idea, I'm absolutely gonna copy it. Not even because I necessarily want tips, I just want to see more people doing it so I can tip them myself.
---
I've been looking for a camera since it came out and still haven't found it
---
for 10 atoms .... hahaha
---
Currently, if you’re in a group and a group member kills something you’ll get access to the loot as well, even if you didn’t tag the enemy. You won’t receive xp and I agree that some sort of area xp should be received when a teammate kills something. Should be given reduced experience while near a kill.
---
3 hours is plenty. Playing with other people that are looking for it makes it easier. Lots of people can still start it for free, including me on all of my 5 characters that haven't bothered with the quest at all.
---
CODE BROWN!!
---
Oh yeah, if I ever come across one you better believe I’m tipping!
---
Also, in PvP everything should be attackable, why else is it PvP!? I can understand camps being indestructible in PvE, especially for pacifists like me, but not PvP.
---
So I heard him outside Dolly Sods talking to the repeatable scout quest robot. He walked right by then turned left and went right to the campground workshop.
---
Absolutely, agreed 100%. My beef isn't with camera challenges per se,  because like you said they can be made reasonable. But what they're asking folks to do now is just stupid.
---
It used to be that way a month or so after launch, when team mates are nearby the kill area where another team mate made the kill, they get xp and loot from the mob regardless if they tagged it or not. Has not been that way a for awhile now though.
---
I just fast travel out, it's not worth the trouble. I'll go shop elsewhere.
---
Topical and funny. Well played. 👍
---
There's already something like this for loot.  There have been a few times where I know I didn't get a hit on a Legendary but it still drops for me if a nearby teammate hit it.  It only works for a certain proximity though, you can't just fast travel in afterwards and expect to loot.
---
Get weight reduction armour pieces got my nukes down to under 1 pound each most other ammo down to zero weight

That's why I sold my quad auto tesla rifle.  It was more of a liability than an asset.  Fun, but it would stop hurting enemies whenever it wanted.  "nah bruh we good for today."

This is the type of shop that would sell neon airsprayed shop logo tanktops with every 6pack and I would buy several. I bet neffs smells like burnt car parts.

I'm going to look into this aspect of the event further and do some experimentation.

This is so annoying... At one point it would crash every time you found a new world lok

Its sometimes hard to separate the love and the actual problems occurring. Constructive criticism should be praised not shut down.

Now if your referring to these click bait Youtube channels I'm...not so sure. They bring up some valid points, but they do it in this unnecessary sensationalized way...I don't think anybody needs that shit.

If you are on the same team you do get the loot as long as you are there when they kill the enemy, xp is the only thing you might miss out on! I can run whitesprings without getting a single kill with my mate doing all the killing and as long as I am right there as he kills them I can loot the body
---
What about a furious rolling pin. Youd be twice as furious. Lol
---
Love this.
---
i’ve completed 6 possum badges and just cant be bother with the rest
---
claw hide is nearly impossible to find
---
syringe is bugged
---
just grind the camp fire event for badges, more reliable this way 
---
(upvote for you btw)
---
My character was originally built as a medic and Charisma-based support class, but that doesn't work when it comes to loot and XP.
---
How is the Hunter challenge glitched ?
---
Came across a 3\* Queen near Kiddie Cabins and...eventually ran away. Was one hitting my bloodied melee and frankly I was there with the stupid quest on my mind (and bloatflies). 
---
This is how bad ass Deathclaw should be. I *shouldn't* be able to one-hit them with brass knuckles.
---
You must be new here.
---
In a bloodied pa build you can tank the pylon for far more than a couple of seconds. But eventually the squatch will find you and you will die.
---
How much are you thinking
---
The poster!!!! Yes!!!!!
---
Hunter? That's in Tadpole. I don't think that's glitched. I have no idea. :)
---
The list above is only for Possum.
---
Has been happening for a bit, at least since the past two patches. Still seems to work fine though.
---
Same honestly, it’s very dumb in my eyes
---
Devils advocate on this one. I actually enjoy some of the camera requests. I get some nice pictures here and there for my slideshow and do enjoy the memories from that. That said, they do need to add more ways to find a group like a lfg system if they want to make the other player involved ones, as well as increase the max picture limit so we can keep more memories.
---
I believe all sheepsquatches are legendary if that's any consolation. I'm sure it's not. I've been getting free range every time I'm South of the southern belle hotel. Hell, last time I got 2 sheepsquatches at the end!
---
There are mod authors making a Fallout: Miami mod (whole new story et al) for FO4 on PC!
---
And yep. it just works. :P
---
It’s the acid attack I think. I don’t recall if they’ve always been able to do that or not. I had teammates but they were getting destroyed also.
---
I still don't have a camera
---
Yeah, this is needed badly. I don't understand why it is the way it is. I want to create a support character but can't, because he'll never level. I can't run with lower levels without using boring weapons and running with higher levels just means everyone has to be careful not to one shot everything.
---
So I don't group with anyone.
---
It's a major problem for collaborative gaming.
---
3 star furious missle launcher, some guy dropped it during an event yesterday, took it and got some good scrip
---
Nope. It didn’t care about me at all. Just kept circling him.
---
Panda Diplomacy lives beyond the nukes, I see.
---
bloodied fire rate assault rifle
---
be tesla (prob duped, but whatever)
---
executioner fire rate handmade
---
For PvE there really is no meta. You just need to pick a build and build it right. Will you one shot everything with every build? No, but you’re hardly  going to be useless.
---
Its 60 seconds from what ive heard, not 60 times
---
It gives loot now if you don't get a hit in. I noticed this after the last patch. Idk if better to get xp or loot, but I can say no fear in the whole team hitting a legendary now since we all been getting the loot.
---
It also saw through my sneak startlingly fast. By the time I realized it could see me I was dead.
---
This is a good option, just gotta grind for trades and some people ask for too much because it's rare to find an armor with good dr and the effect you want. Hopefully this legendary vendor that will be added can add a ammo weight reduction effect for us
---
Right?  Nuisance to find but you could get them just by playing.
---
Seconds, not times
---
If you have the pro snap camera, you can use that to find the body. Just view through the camera until you see the imposter sheepsquach tagged. Then move around until it is removed from the camera tagging to give you the area where the body is located.
---
That’s a weekly challenge reward, not an event drop.
---
Change barrel mod, Beam spittler it makes breaking even faster
---
Archer, Athlete, Codebreaker, Cook, Entomologist, Hunter, Mammalologist, Medic, Swimmer
---
Yeah, I've talked with the guy who built the calculator and it's based on observation rather than datamined info so some of it is incomplete/needs updating/interacts incorrectly.  How all the damage multipliers interact with each other is still somewhat of a mystery... like he found that Bloody Mess, Adrenal Reactions, and Adrenaline are all additive with each other but not the other buffs.  Since I can't match the sheet damage exactly with my own calcs nor the website, I suspect it also has some extra calc like how the extra crit damage is calculated separately based on base weapon damage without the damage modifiers then added to the normal damage.
---
I wish they would just have less of them instead of nearly impossible ones that are just a slap in the face.
---
Come to me have some pieces to trade ps4
---
I would like stackable foundations, so i can build platform structures without silly floating.  While were at it, I'd also like an elevator, much like the lifts in the main series games.  
---
My favorite locations tended to be gunner camps in 4 that were built on standalone overpasses.
---
Will try that next, had it auto beam splitter and now it’s semi auto.
---
Have the caps need it all, bam ba lam
---
So it’s happening to me right now when the next patch hits I should be able to play again?
---
Same ! I've collected a bunch of gumdrops now but that challenge .... it doesn't seem to com back anytime soon. :(
---
There isn't a named quest, but there is a sort of hidden quest that involves the plant and eventually unlocks a storage dome that has the plans for the t51 nuka cola paint job. It also has some nuka cola themed clothes in there.
---
what about using letters at your camp to leave a message?
---
 "Contact me for PA crafting"
---
why not just put them in your stash?
---
I have, and you're lying lol. 4 videos b2b of you trashing the game.
---
TSE double barrel for 70 caps at a player camp
---
That is how I got mine.  Complete accident, but a happy one.
---
I sell all mine normally for 300, 1,2 and 3 stars unless I know for a fact it’s worth more but even then I don’t go over 6 or 700
---
Uh... knots grow on the north side of trees. Sheepsquatch knot shortens rope. Use a poncho instead of the firebreather carry. My CAMP gadget is a weather molerat. Did I pass?
---
Well i cant really read so
---
It's our current best option I think ya
---
Omg that is fucking hilarious!
---
second this, I sure as hell don't.
---
I have to do this about weekly.  Lol
---
It’s where TNT Dome key 3 is and it starts that quest. Other than that it isn’t part of any main quests.
---
What group would I be as a low hp high rad super high damage sniper that kills eyebots as they spawn in the distance as well as keeps ads down, but who can't exist near a slight breeze but can accidentally blow up the earth if I aim my gun too low towards the ground?
---
I remember when this game came out there were tons of arguments about this on here, I said back then and I'll say it again now that every MMO lite or squad based game I play or have played works this way and fallout is the only on that does not.
---
All of the arguments against sharing xp and guaranteeing loot for you squad fall flat because fallout is the only game that doesn't do that and all of those games aren't plagued by the problems people think this would cause
---
^ Yup. Like that.
---
Okay I understand now. Thank you.
---
I got a 3 star ripper job the other day and had a little fun with it for a couple fights then sold it to the legenday vending mschine. Fun weapon but currently crap damage.
---
A shitty camera at that.  Takes 10-15 seconds to register something on PS4.
---
Checked a few sellers tonight, it's totally inconsistent.  
---
I'll see a 2* furious grognak with "limb damage", but then a 2* medics machine gun with "vats crits heal", sometimes the second perk is showing, sometimes it isn't.  
---
Roll on patch day.
---
Reimplement. 
---
They had one during beta but sadly removed it
---
You’re serious
---
I'm at level 60, i believe. I can help you out with some quests, and my sibling just started playing too so they're at around the same level as you. We can do some quests together, if you'd like. The only thing is that I can't talk right now since my throat is swollen, so we'd have to do without voice chat. What quests are you currently on?
---
For Halloween there should be a super mutant in a white mask and blue jumpsuit with a knife that appears and watches you, kinda like the  mothman.
---
Nah, just stubborn :)
---
Psn? I'll check your stuff out. But won't be on till 9:30ish pm pst
---
I am on Xbox, I'll be back on in about an hour, my GT: BurkaBishes, if you can just provide the materials I'll craft you one, the materials I'm short at the moment are Ballistic fiber and florescent flux
---
I wish we could get a timer on our maps so we could see which ones are almost done or about to start
---
That was just a small part. Don't get mad because you couldn't figure it out. A lot of people here could have and would have helped. The game isn't for everyone I guess.
---
Moving it worked for people who came to my camp, they'd usually get stuck in my foundation but spawn just outside my boundary now.
---
I still need the head.
---
Your spawn point is different than others. Your spawn point can be changed by moving the camp device. However, visitors always spawn at the same place, the exact center of your camp. For me that is in a low lying foundation. Luckily the foundation is low enough that people dont get stuck, but it is hilllarious when 3 people are standing inside each other inside a foundation inside my base.
---
Found one in the glassed cavern last week I think and yeah. He killed me 3 times -.-
---
It happens to everyone. It's really Bethesda's fault for being poor at communicating this in-game. I wouldn't feel bad about it.
---
Make sure you use Escape Artist. That way you can slip back into caution quickly once you have engaged something.
---
If you have any "improved repair kits", you can use them on any crossbow not repaired over 150% and it will count toward the badge... ;) (SBQ drops them, or (ahem) buy from atom shop...   
---
A friend also suggested drinking booze to drop intelligence (with Party boy equipped)...
---
They know the game did horribly so they're doubling down because they feel bad that the game did such a bad job on launch. even now the game has zero end game content outside of the scorchbeast queen.
---
It's because they are all cheap knockoffs. Waiterbots have no clue what they are doing when they reproduce these weapons.
---
I found the tourist 4 times at Phillipi. Bonus is 3 other spawns are close by.
---
This post just confirmed that I know nothing about how this event works.
---
I feel like the gun smith perk (the one that slows breaking) doesn't effect laser and plasma weapons.
---
I've mostly left mine alone. I'm broken as fuck in real life, I want my character to resemble that.
---
My Furious pitchfork is a prized possession!  Great for RP.  Weightless and SS to boot so it actually comes in handy for trash mobs.
---
I think they are better as consumables - a good chunk of bobbleheads are as strong as a maxed out perk card, and them being permanent means some are just better in general than others (why would you use +2 STR vs. +20% melee damage).
---
Also, it would be yet another thing that players would switch around "Oh, I'm about to pick a lock - time to switch to my Lockpick Bobblehead to get the sweet spot...now I need to switch it to Caps so I can open that cap stash...Ok, now that I'm done looting let's switch to my Grognak so my melee weapons weigh 75% less"
---
Everyone would eventually have all of them, and all content would then have to be balanced with the assumption that players were going to be using "meta" Bobbleheads/Magazines, instead of it being something someone who is struggling with something can use to get an edge, which is what I would rather they prefer to stay: a short term bonus that you can stack with other bonuses to give you an edge in something you want an edge with.
---
Edit: they'd all have to be rebalanced too - let's say you're wearing 5 pieces of troubleshooter's gear and have the +15% damage reduction from them.  That's a total of 75%.  Now you equip "Attack of the metal man" and get 100% damage reduction from Robots.
---
3\* instigating / vats accuracy / +1Per sniper rifle.
---
Bethesda just can't track it probably I'm betting
---
And left Weapon artisan on instead of Demolition Expert
---
I've been trying to get this badge cause of how easy it is but the one challenge I can't do is taking the picture of a generator. Does anyone know what generator I have to take a picture of?
---
Been to Phillipi several times. No luck. :(
---
They have either insane hp or armor. Takes me just as long to kill as the queens do. They are never worth the ammo imo unless legendary. Way too tanky.
---
the funny thing is... they WERE ok- IF you over-repaired them, the damage jumped way up and suddenly was viable. But then they NERFED the over-repair damage bonus, creating the "automatic weapons suck" effect that used to be on ranged weapons, on the formerly OP Melee weapons.   
---
\#becausebalanceorsomething
---
Thank you Soo much, and that would be fine. I'm on all of the first ones still only a couple stages in to some. And do you have a discord or something like that where we could just text while playing on a different device? BHOMyGod is my user name
---
What armor do you end up wearing?
---
He goes through all the workshops, just a matter of timing it right.
---
Yeah I know but I'm a scaredy cat but I love the game itself
---
You mean the game isn't playing as expected?
---
Thank you sir.
---
This is where I'm at. It's almost perfect but some people have said the opposite.
---
Already got something better.  Respecced for Sneak/Sniper when I started playing again recently and the Grafton Monster in Heart of the Swamp dropped an Instigating +25% Fire Rate Lever Action a couple days ago.
---
I have been playing steadily since the camera came out. Just now found it this past Sunday. The only reason I found it is because I asked my lucky friend to go look for it. He finds it 1st try.
---
it drops from the huntmaster event, right?
---
i like your name too...lol
---
Well that's a game changer
---
See reply in post.  Did it wrong again...
---
Can I add you? Just came back to the game couple weeks ago and working on a solid melee build. Need to do more sbq events.
---
That's not what I said, you're trying to run before walking.
---
I cannot even fathom why you would respond to this post.  If you don't care, why respond?  My point is that new participants to the event understand why the Zone might be configured the way it is.  I was just wanting to inform the uninformed why fissure Prime doesn't have to be a bullseye.  You seem to be criticizing nothing except the conversation.  Not really talking about a contentious subject here for SBQ Goodness sake.
---
Nooo ! I missed it . 😱
---
I run bloodied meat hook, but I carry around a busted ass rifle for this purpose, tag and kite the legendary towards the others who haven't tagged yet
---
good point
---
Yes i do have a discord, sending you a request now. My discord will be in the request message.
---
Problem there is you'll get the people who fast travel in to get the reward but don't actually participate.
---
Well I don’t normally offer post-apocalyptic prostitute roleplaying, but 24,000 caps is 24,000 caps.
---
Well when you are every single conduit every time you do it because you don’t trust your team mates (plus the timer is already so short) and you only get a white wolf fedora, id just buy it from someone on here like I did
---
Northern California without a doubt.
---
If you hit the button to put all junk in your stash it puts mods also. Try checking stash.
---
Thanks much!
---
Rad resistance doesn't matter it's the pa frame hidden protection that helps, curious if back pack has it as well or not
---
I'm not getting that but I am getting alot of lag between placing a camp item and it actually doing it I havent played for awhile before today but it's been happening all day
---
I wouldn't mind them making it grindier, like kill 50 scorched with a railway rifle or craft 30 healing salves or whatever. But making them near impossible to do with such specific conditions, might as well not even have atom challenges in the game. Why bother having them if the goal is to make them so hard to do that nobody wants to waste their time just to get 10 atoms?
---
ah gotcha.  makes sense thanks!
---
That's hilarious.
---
Nothing came up for BHOMyGod on psn.... Go ahead and add Skellyassassin on psn, send me your discord tag in the message.
---
Ohhhhhhh I want even trying to do this one because if that task. Tyvm
---
Have you tried wiring your xbox directly to your router instead of wifi?
---
Gatling gun is slow and can be fired one shot at a time, not to be confused with the minigun
---
The current dupe method makes this too time consuming. It's not vary good at massively duping 1 item quickly. It's better at duping one massively valued item into a few copies. Thus, the flood of energy explosive weapons and BE/AAE handmades that pre dupe were valued at 25-75k caps.
---
