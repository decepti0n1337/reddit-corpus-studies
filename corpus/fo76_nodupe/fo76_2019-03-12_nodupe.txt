Are dudes gross and can fetishize just about anything? Yep you're right, that's it.
---
I found 1 today who would like to buy it for 2000c

Part of the code needed for launching a nuke. You need 8 from a silo (Alpha, Bravo, or Charlie), and then you need to decode it further.
---
If you haven‚Äôt found the Enclave yet, you don‚Äôt need to worry about it. They‚Äôll disappear from your inventory every week when the codes reset on Monday.

And on...

Oh God that would be annoying
---
Just break down armor to get the mods and max out your armorer perk you'll be able to do it yourself
---
Not just this but also, why do I have to lockpick my own air drop? I have over 70 I still need to call in. Not worth the bobbypins.
---
 The loot is also no where near what it was. I have been farming cloth and got the idea to start working on my stockpile of them. I get 5 prewar money now instead of the 20+ I was getting before. 
---
Nuke it from orbit, it's the only way to be sure 
---
I was finally able to do some testing, and combining Revenant, Mysterious Stranger and a single piece of Undying/Life-Saving armor absolutely works. So far, I have auto-ressurected with a 100% success rate, and the added bonus of a 2 minute damage buff than I am VERY pleased to report applies to the Chainsaw. 
---
Running a build that very much benefits from Mutations and Perks that shine at low health, this seems like it could be a nice synergy/insurance policy. Not to mention the fact that I'm super curious to see what kind of numbers you could hit with this factored in.
---
Based on my limited testing I have been able to avoid using Stimpaks altogether, simply face tanking 'til I die, then almost immediately popping back up in beast mode. Very satisfying. 
---
I log on to sell stuff and then jump right back. If I farm that stupid golf course one more time I‚Äôm liable to lose my damn mind. However I had fun for a good stretch of time with the game. I‚Äôm lvl 234 now. I got my 60 US dollars out of it so I can‚Äôt complain. And when they add new content I‚Äôll come back in and grind it until I‚Äôm bored again. 
---
A lot of these items have been on the best seller list on ebay for quite some time :-)  
---
Unfortunally beth did not delete as many items as they should have done...   
---
But they ARE possible to find, they are just extremly rare  
---
1 out of 216 three star legendary armour items have both sentiniel and assasin.  
---
(18 different 1st prefixes, 12 different third prefixes)  
---
To get two different pieces takes another 270 new items (80% to find one of the missing pieces)  
---
To get three different pieces takes another 360 new items (60% to find one of the missing pieces)  
---
To get four different pieces takes another 540 items (40% to find one out of the two missing pieces)  
---
To get the fifth and last item takes another 1080 items (20% to find one out of 5 pieces)  
---
For a total of 2466 three star legendary armour items
---
  
---
Out of the last 300 three star legendaries I have killed, 89 had three star items....  
---
Theoreticly about 40% is armour, 60% of the drops are weapons
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
So killing 100 three star enemyes gives you 11 legendary armour items with three stars on average  
---
To sum it up: To get 5 pieces senteniel/assasin means killing 22.418 three star legendaries... and that is for getting ANY combination of armour that comes with three stars (not wood) at ANY level...   
---
To get 5 marine pieces.... ...  
---
But it is random, so you might get it faster, or never at all, also it looks like some prefixes are more rare than others, so the numbers are probably quite a bit higher than these I listed here.  
---
So when you see someone with 4 of 5 pieces of armour with senteniel and assasin, you can be pretty sure they are using duped items (they probably have a TSE handmade and a TSE pump action (or combat) shotgun too)  
---
Perhaps some players get it around level 600 or something.  
---
NOTE: I don't say that you or anybody else having this setup, that is pretty popular, are or have been duping.  
---
I don't say you or anybody else have bought it with real money, but it is a fact that these items have been huge sellers on auction sites for quite some time.  
---
I do however say that you SHOULD be aware that most of the items should never have been in the game and by using it, you makes sure these items stays in the game and you gives yourself an unfair advantage compared to players that don't want to use duped items or players that enters the game now, as it is getting harder and harder to get hold of these items.  
---
They are currently priced a LOT higher than they used to be, and now a full set costs more than the game itself.
---
I‚Äôm sorry, I must‚Äôve missed when they ‚Äúencouraged people to break the game‚Äù, was that in an inside the vault or something?
---
i could have sworn it did. but would not be the first time i was wrong
---
No news for people with no sense.
---
does it release @12 AM EST on the 13th?
---
they absolutely have not said that
---
Wow very man hatey. Evey gender is the same 
---
They've been leaked a while ago as part of the Atom Shop. It's just a waiting game at the moment.

https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/at3pa0/so_bethesda_how_about_that_rejoin_server_option/egyl2f1/?context=3
---
The official account on reddit said 18 days ago. 
---
I believe when you have the mutation only you become visible for a short period after firing and you don't with the armor. 
---
I'd like to see a balloon attached to the bag. That would help. 
---
It'd be nice if I actually knew where my drop even appeared. I've got something like 50+ supply drop tapes because I never know where my drop will be. I see those quests and grab it if its unlocked. Figure its making up for the half dozen or so requests I've put in and never received. 
---
I inadvertently caused this. I wanted to test if the loot would change where I called the drops in. I started at the tower near Flatwoods. Some new player got to it before me. Took everything and became hostile to me. I never got to even see what what inside it. I killed the player that took my loot because it was not his to have. Not like he knew that though. I saw him freak out when he got wanted from it. I removed his bounty, got 5 caps an got two achievements for killing him. Left him his junk.  Definitely a way to trick people into pvp. 
---
The economy is not getting broken by overpriced items. Items are getting overpriced because the game has a broken economy. Let me explain, every day more credits are generated than flow out of the game, caps on credits is only a small part of the problem. This game has no major credit sinks, all working video games with good economy's have multiple sinks. This game has one a fee for travel that's it and it is optional. One way of doing this is to do instances that you can only travel to by paying a large fee to the game. In addition with player vending to buy or sell an item, a certain amount needs to be a credit sink or call it a tax. The good news its fixable, they just need to install enough credit sinks that people want to use and the problem will fix itself.
---
üòÇ it‚Äôs a little funny but I‚Äôd log out and redo. Kind of like poor Evan a reset should fix it. 
---
are you holding a bloodied, berserkers, nocturnal or other weapon with situational damage while inspecting other weapons?
---
Those effects show up when inspecting other weapons until you change equipment.
---
i jumped in this thread like white on rice..but..not ps4
---
No, the game is not balanced.  I would prefer it if legendaries didnt exist.  They do make pvp require a lot less skill if you have a good weapon.  I got all of my good weapons from people that were suprised when I killed them with my "normal weapons".  Sure fighting people with tse shotguns is hard, but once I changed my strategy I could defeat them with patience and precision.   Think what you want about how I play my game, but I've never shot a tse shotgun, nor played a melee build, nor ran power armor, and while the game might not be balanced, there is definitely a degree of skill required to be succesful in pvp. Again I dont see how being an asshole and roleplaying as a raider are different, especially since there are plenty of safe guards to prevent being targeted by assholes. 
---
ayy sorry bro
---
If you're throwning out the 45 I'll take it
---
[removed]
---
I hate those things. As a melee build it takes me forever to down one. 
---
It was just condition. I had never heard of condition affecting damage until today. I repeated it to 200% and it went back to spec. 
---
Confirmed it was just the condition of the weapon lowering the damage. It was down to 75%. 
---
Thanks for all the help for those that commented. 
---
What's your ign or add me, Aznavour-00
---
I dislike pve very much in this game. I'm not comin back lol
---
Calibrated shocks are borderline impossible to find.  I came across THREE jetpacks and only one calibrated shock for one leg.  I finally just gave up and paid someone to craft calibrated shocks for my ultracite armor instead. 
---
There's people on reddit who have the plans and will craft them for caps. 
---
Finding someone to craft X01 shocks is impossible because plans simply don't exist, as far as I know. 
---
I saved up enough caps to buy shocks for the T51.   Level 50 T51 is damn good armor. 
---
Jet pack is a little overrated in my opinion.  I mean if you can find one for the X01 then great, but I personally don't find it worth the headache of server hopping. 
---
Shocks are terrific because they increase your carry weight. 
---
That's the way it works. However, you get plenty of extra perk cards as you level up, so it's not that difficult. I currently have several perks at different ranks, at level 88. 
---
Deep pocket metal also missing. 
---
Shit miss read. I'm psn 
---
Ty for your time tho 
---
its cool bruh
---
Sorry, I shouldve really put PC in my title lol
---
Do you have anymore jetpacks or you sold them all?
---
Didn't use imgur? That's a downvote...
---
Anybody wanna do this on pc?? I would LOVE to have a girl gang kicking ass and having a good time üòÅ
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 and I‚Äôll take it
---
Pc?? üëè Please say yes lol 
---
Honestly, I'd buy this if my internet wasn't so bipolar. I'm truly on here because I'm a huge fan of the Fallout games. Plus, I like to keep track of the series as well as bethesda in general. I already know I'm going to get the comment of "why are you on here if you don't even have the game?" I simply want to keep track of the updates, etc
---
I‚Äôm guessing the latter. I haven‚Äôt played in a while but I‚Äôve never heard of a random cargo bot event, unless it was a‚Äôreward‚Äô for completeing an event.
---
If you still have it, I'll take it.  On PC.
---
I'll take it, on PC 
---
Yeah I do. taking the .45 or .44 or both?
---
Maybe we could get a cross-platform Discord going for like-minded women who want to play and trade and kick ass?
---
Sucks, man.
---
I have not encountered anything but a normal deathclaw yet lol
---
Ouch, you hurt me. Not. 
---
I love this idea!!! With all separate caps too. Not 200 for 10 vendors like whitesprings or how ever many there is....
---
get contractor perk. repairs, even fusion generators, cost almost nothing to fix.
---
Skiddy is a gent. Well deserving of that .45
---
I'm def down for that. I have a discord server but it's for my social media community. Let me know if you'd like help I'm all in! I'm always looking for fellow chicks to game with üëå
---
If you're surrounded by assholes...
---
You would have liked Redneck Rampage.
---
SnApE kIlLeD dUmBlEdOr.
---
Great Idea! Never thought of that, I would like being a roaming vendor!
---
Y√´s
---
 Pay attention. Go back and read the couple of comments before this one. ESO I quit.
---
Oh I see.   Ok. Thank you. 
---
Watch out when you go to loot the cargo. I had out of the blue last week a player one shot kill me at Whitesprings as soon as I started to open the cargo. I was in the process of unlocking it... as soon as I finished I was shot, killed and my bag was looted... went back and the crate was also looted... they waited perfectly... if there are other players around... watch out... I have started to notice that others will kill you when you are prone.
---
Did I just stumble upon the Maud's Muggers origin? ;)
---
Just the .45, my combat rifle eats it like candy.
---
I purposefully drop my loot crates by Flatwoods to watch the little ones murder each other. It‚Äôs like Lord of the Flies. 
---
I've been waiting for it from the begining, not only will I spend all my time there but I'll be starting a new character.  Do you have any idea how annoying it is to just want some friendly competion, but get toxic hate everytime I fire my gun at someone.  I'm so done with everyone thinking confrontation in a post-apocalyptic universe is a bad thing.  You hippies can keep your pve servers, I'm so fucking ready.
---
Yep, or a refigerator at your home?  That work?  Or a freezer.  Something, because it makes no sense how you can find meat in good condition just laying about, but as soon as you pick it up, it spoils in an hour.  It's probably been laying on that shelf for 2 decades \*roll eyes\*
---
I can do it tonight if you want. As long as I get my caps back. I also hate pvp.   Psn sneazel
---
T-51 just looks so cool. But I'm glad you can mix and match nowadays
---
 The system wants that tested blade you got from The Whitespring to make one.
---
Agreed. Who gets excited about steel? 
---
Ah rip. Perhaps Bethesda will change this. 
---
I'm split 50/50 on whether to label you a Raider or an Overseer based on that comment.
---
Take your time and do it right 
---
They moved the update back to add in the secret ending you‚Äôre looking for :P
---
I would argue competition is a GOOD thing, but you are entitled to your downvote, sir.
---
Thank you. haha
---
That‚Äôs my hope!
---
Could we get both :P
---
Na you're good. I was 50/50 either what you said or thought you misunderstood the date as being next week rather than tomorrow.
---
I have over 3k screws at this point. With me it's always lead, acid, and steel that I need.
---
.7 to 1:1 usually, others charge it for 2:1 but I feel thats too much
---
with the Mutation, you can stand.
---
a full set of Heavy Weightless Combat Armor with BOS/Shadowed and ultra-light mods is less than 10 lbs. you don't need 55 carry capacity from Deep Pockets to overcome the nearly \~40 base weight.
---
I will definitely give it a crack, just for the extra fear and tension.
---
If I'm correct the friendly competition you seek is on your radio, you just have to tune to it. Although you should be able to tell. Hmm...guy with gun away and waves hi... most pvp ppl think that fucker is obviously look for a fight
---
 I got ganked today. Interesting the Bloodied builds, I will study the situation a bit. ;)
---
 He took my junk. I would have thanked him but he would not talk. I have no room at all and just collect junk because its a habit. I have about 35 lbs of non junk and I have to bulk to put more in which ... its madness. ;)
---
 I put on the heavy stuff and followed him around, he could not hurt me, so after a while he left the server.
---
I'm working on alpha now and just crashed but I'll post when I'm done.  Should be about 15-20 minutes.  Or you can maniacally refresh nukacrypt.
---
Maybe someone was shooting it with Karma?
---
I kinda want to make an alt where I have a mobile griefing base that I deploy for every drop. At least do it until it becomes an issue enough to patch.
---
Imagine just forfeiting your base to instead have griefing turrets covering the package. 
---
Hahaha , I mean the base building aspect is almost a game in itself .. So Yeah. I have literally wasted Hours on top of hours finding the right place that allows me the comforts I want as well as the placement of each thing working just right. If one thing is off or not able to be placed, you can bet your sweet booty I ended up moving my entire base and re-doing it hahahahah  oh the agony, but so much fun as well. I am Glad to report that I think I have found my permanent spot and Wont be moving for a long time .. I HOPE!!! 
---
it wont respawn event triggered hordes (eg sbq)
---
On ws youve gotta clear everything. Even one enemy  will often prevent respawn. I have to take my mule through ws to get the respawn. Logging in doesn't push it. Running through the building does.
---
... -_- I‚Äôm not trolling your trying to troll me at this point

---
fuck supply drops. Mindin' my own damn business last night as a level ~18 pleb and "oh look a supply drop close by"
---
DONT MENTION THE FUCKING LEVEL 68 SCORCHBEAST AND PHALANX OF ABOUT 30 SCORCHED THOUGH DO YOU GAME.
---
I'm mildly out of the loop. What all is coming on the 13th?
---
Nope just wanna know why youre mad that people are playing a game you dont like
---
Ill build you a set for the required mats. Can sell ya whatever you're missing for caps.
---
Same ign
---
Still happening to me. Just fast traveled there today for first time in PA and it's crashing my whole Xbox. I didn't know about it being a bug until now. But I fast travelled there a few times and it crashed my Xbox everytime. 
---
Getting ANYTHING for my extra ammo would be nice.
---
Curious on the technique. Been seeing him around hemlock holes pretty often of late. Usually just pull my mule account on to hold him for others.
---
Don't worry.. Soon the radiation will become your friend.
---
I have 30 hp and 70 rads. I have no mutations
---
Sorry ii posted twice reddit was not cooperating 
---
Right, that's what every PvE player says, just use hunter/hunted. No, the pvp servers are the friendly competition I want.  In 700 hours of playing I've tuned in every session, and had enough players 4 times.  No pvp people dont think that, the pvpers want to fight and hope that shooting at someone will cause them to fight back.  I think the slap mechanic is stupid.  I hit you you can decide when you want to fight me.  Could be when my back is turned, could be when I'm in my pipboy.  Either way you decide when you fight.      You're asking if people will switch, saying you think they wont, and then stating that the hunter/hunted station is what im looking for.  It seems you already have presumptions made about the entire pvp community.  
---
If I sell shells, I go half to a quarter of what vendors charge. 
---
Anyone know how to make it stop giving me notifications about what‚Äôs trending here? I don‚Äôt play this game anymore, it got boring as there is nothing to do.
---
Fallout Sims with mutants, lasers, and power armor on the side
---
Supply drops are now bait for pvp raiders.  Just like workshops.  
---
-0- for friends
---
I got it thanks tho!
---
I've got a bunch of 1-2* heavy weapons for trade/sale if youre pc.

---
Strength has the most perks to increase damage.
---
Explosive helps (if its an explosive legendary) 
---
I feel like two shot should be buffed. Explosives are fine imo. The aoe is nuts, even without the perk.
---
i mean im excited about it, When i first heard it was in west virginia i assumed there would be moonshining 
---
We 3 can be friends.
---
At this point I just drop my extra ammo in random suitcases or brown paper bags. It‚Äôs mostly weightless with the Bandolier perk, but I have no need for anything past 5.56. 
---
Bless you child. Glad you got some goodies for defunding a low level. 
---
If they are on ps4 or xbox, they can just create a new gamertag to log into to play the game.  If they are on PC they can create a new account, possibly requiring a new game purchase, which is fairly cheap now.
---
It's really not that hard.
---
Of course there will be plenty of fighting either way, but it's two completely different mindsets. Sounds like we'll just have to agree to disagree that there's a difference between being required to build up your character in survival and having the choice to bring over adventure characters at will. 
---
Who physically goes to servers anymore? 
---
I tend to find bugs on my birthday too. ;)
---
Is that a good choice though? What‚Äôs the point of high stakes survival if someone can just go back to casual mode afterwards to stock back up. It‚Äôs not just a pvp mode, there are many changes rules. 
---
Perhaps its a bug, but the mutation doesn't trigger in hazmat suit for me.
---
Chameleon armor is sweet, esp with the perk. Multiple cham armor doesn't seem to have an effect. the perk does though (can't recall the name atm) I can go hidden while dudes are shooting at me point blank on occasion.
---
Will this affect the date of the March 19th content as well?
---
Work in x-ray, praise atom. 
---
I had this happen to me a month or so ago. A guy killed me while I was farming ghouls somehow. Probably workshop related. This same guy has griefed me in the past and I sought revenge. 
---
Killed him with 1 grenade and found 4000 plastic on him. It's the best feeling.
---
Circle couches, license plates for the wall, can traps, hanging oil lanterns, hanging plants, and a spotlight that works like the vertibird mini gun are just a few things I wish they would add. Also a pack mule gulper...it was my favorite mod in fallout 4.
---
damn, what a smart person you are...
---
Ok 
---
Noooo! I have one day off of work all this week and it was the 12th.
---
As a professional software developer myself. I‚Äôm impressed that it slipped by just one day. üòÜ
---
Cracked up the first time he showed up in his underwear. 
---
I can only speak for what I see on ps4 dont really watch the other markets.   .556 or .45 often sell for .5 caps each. Shotgun often sells for .75 to 1 cap each. Ultracite .556 or .45  1 cap each 2 if they really want it. Other ammo seems to sell for less than the cost to make it.
---
Great example of a working system. This needs more up votes to increase the chances Bethesda will see it.
---
I don't side with exploiters just to oppose Bethesda. I side with exploiters because bugs are always going to be part of video games and punishing resourceful players who take advantage of the developer's oversights is a shitty thing to do, especially when what is considered "cheating" is entirely subjective. There's dozens of camp tricks that could easily be classified as such (like stacking indestructible foundations), but Bethesda employees have shown their approval for here on reddit. 
---
Looks great dude
---
I think it occurs when an area is forced to respawn too often. Similar happens in Watoga if you kill enough Protectrons that Col. Gutsy's spawn instead.
---
It's most common in nuke zones cause people constantly make the ghouls respawn, especially in the golf club itself. The only other place I've seen this is in the Glassed Caverns and around that area with Protectrons spawning instead of Scorched.
---
Got so much I quit picking it up.
---
Make a rad arch for your camp if you have not yet.
---
Bloatflies. I want to know if a de-buff appears on players though.
---
Just dont blow up my base :( Im a dude with pink flamingos in my yard and theyre my best friends
---
I have the same issue on Xbox plus another, similar issue. My favorited weapons will unfavorite themselves. Only 1, and typically about 3 times through an extended (6-8 hour) play session. Maybe we can bring u/Ladydevann and u/lonevaultwanderer into this? 
---
Who doesn't include text chat?
---
I saw in the other discussion thread that while the item does not drop in-game, it is a legit item and there will not be any issues with getting banned.
---
I pretty consistently find it at the Watoga train station vendor. 
---
Have bought the mod twice once for a standard meat hook (a little discussed gem of a melee weapon) and now most recently a Vampire‚Äôs meat hook.
---
300-330 damage with level two in the 3 Gladiator cards and some glowing meat steak buffing me.
---
Good Luck!
---
BTW CM, I sent you a friend invite in game. I might be interested in buying a mutation from you, if that's ok. taknine .
---
It's not just you, duping is back, got server not responding and dced a few times today. Does not seem as wide spread as before. I was doing alot of server hoping.
---

F4 Xo1 Head and Chest with raider limbs.

I'm level 23 and I have no idea what that is
---
Hmm. Ok
---
The npc dialogue in any fallout game is better than the nonsense real life randoms vomit into their microphones. When they do talk.
---
Oh fuck me. Bullet in the knee. 
---
How nice of you, I just dump it at lunch boxes and suitcases  at RRs
---
All i want is blue skin for amor, PA and stuff. So be easy, no? I mean, take the current skin, run it through a Photoshop filter like "colorize" and select a nice blue tone. Ajust brightness and contrast if needed. That's it.
---
I really don't know why it seems so difficult to do skin for all the most popular colors, but that's because they don't tell us. I mean, maybe it's not that simple. I wish one of them would care to explain.
---
The east (Ohio) river really seems to draw a lot of camp builders. I lived in the area for a while and always had 3-4 neighbors. 
---
A game that is trying to encourage better player interaction by making it easier to talk?
---
I‚Äôm just saying the lack of text chat doesn‚Äôt bother me. I‚Äôve always found it an inferior tool for communications 
---
I have seen plans at one of the vendors. Maybe in Watoga. But mot sure. 
---
It usually shows up red for me. So i don't brother with it

Nuka crypt says it‚Äôs still unknown.

Belly tickling makes me aggressive. Much to my wife's chagrin.

Don't dispair mate,

I have played everyday since release and still playing.
---
It's not a huge deal I lost my knife you just move on I have plenty of other weapons to use.
---
Jump back in man this week new DLC is out I'm sure you'll find some joy
---
What you got plans wise?
---
Where are the plans for that in the wild?
---
Lol they‚Äôre all duped, it‚Äôs a duper jerk at this point because there‚Äôs a new dupe method and they‚Äôre making sure it doesn‚Äôt get out this time.
---
4?
---
The queen drops them or you can buy them on a trade redit site for about 500 caps.
---
Annnnd it‚Äôs broken. None of it works. Prepare for a similar statement that says ‚Äúthis is all broken, our bad‚Äù tomorrow at the same time.
---
I will probably switch if it is a new set of servers that requires fresh characters. I would love to restart the game on a zero-duping economy, with meaningful PVP.
---
5 caps for membership
---
No one buys ammo bro. 
---
Plenty of people just drop it like I do for others, anmoisnt a real trading comoditity

@ alpha ready to fire Captain!!!

Yup still looking.  I've got two left.
---
White Springs gives 30 to 40 if you hit the Station pretty well. And search your ass off.
---
Morgantown can be considerably more.
---
Toxic Valley is best for violet if you don't wanna fight a schorchbeast. But very little masses and HR fluid. 
---
Is it a monthly subscription or lifetime membership?
---
I'm curious if it still applies if you jump while sprinting. Since your AP still drains during that jump, I'm inclined to believe it does work in a sprint jump. 
---
Sprint &gt; jump &gt; shoot &gt; continue sprinting. Only limited by your AP and if it works does work while sprint jumping you've just created a play style for yourself.

yearly. lifetime is 25 caps
---
I use the first one I found, traded the second, and didn't even purchase  the third. I am truly sorry.  The really bizarre thing is that the all happened within days of each other, but I haven't seen them since. 
---
Well, 25 caps seems like a good deal to me!
---
Yes, ran into the pair in Watoga yesterday. They came in from the north and were heading west when I last saw them. :)
---
I literally switch guns through the quick select wheel.
---
Radscorpions and Mole Rats are totally unfair.  They put Goku to shame with their proficiency at teleporting around you.  I literally have my syringer stashed because my friend one hits most enemies anyway and I'd rather get a few hits in and chip them down for him than one hit it assuming I don't miss lol...
---
...you called out of work for a very tiny update to a game that adds a new quest and the ability to craft some consumables?
---
Im one.
---
Inb4 they add a bathroom meter and require us to relieve ourselves before the bar fills up and we soil ourselves reducing our armor condition.
---
One left!
---
Waiting in a silo 
---
¬†I just want to tell you both,good luck.We're all counting on you.
---
Yeah got disconnected once but that‚Äôs it in a matter of months 
---
Modders creating private servers violates the TOS, and it often gets shut down as has been done in numerous other games.
---
Regardless of the differences between eso and FO76, they were both created from a game designed to run as single player,  so they share a lot of similarities that I guess you dont see.
---
I was wrong about then being the same engine,  but that doesnt change my point they are similar stories of single player games turned into MMO games through modifications of the single player code.
---
Hopefully nobody that follows this sub. They'd be wasting their time.
---
Found a bobblehead in a portapotty at...  Uh..  Johnson's Camp place at the farthest south portion of the savage divide where there's that holotape of the guy who saw the initial nuke go off.
---
That portapotty was oddly detailed, I've also found a gnome in a portapotty...  most of them are filled with the rubble texture but a few of them I didn't stick around to really see.  You could just tell it was dirty with NOT rubble o-o...
---
Not if they want general news and discussion
---
Why not give an AP buff, you try working with a stomach that's screaming at you.
---
This guy.
---
Thank you for this (mister netabot). Made me lol
---
This looks very homey :)
---
That's right, your comment caused ALL of us to call in sick. I hope you're happy‚Ä¶ 
---
Why the fuck not?  I dont know about you but I enjoy taking a random day off and relaxing, the added benefit of checking out new content just sweetens the pot a bit.  I got the PTO so might as well.
---
Flight 209, now arriving at gate 8...gate 9... gate 10...
---
THAT'S WHY THOSE COLONEL JERKS SHOW UP????
---
Ugghhhh, half a dozen colonel gutsys out of nowhere is a nightmare.  Why didn't we just mass produce those and spam them at the Chinese instead of using flesh and blood people?
---
Omg. Thank you for this gem! I have started playing daggerfall again whilst I wait for new content 
---
Derp. My bad. Core assembly is just a mod.
---
I usually cancel my messages part way through because the topic has shifted. Keyboard is a bit better, but not by much 
---
Yea, that's kind of cool. 
---
Good luck! Is there a certain amount of time before each nuke in each silo regenerates after launch?
---
3 hours. 
---
PC? I have 500 RadAway
---
Most people play in party chat.
---
I am now! Other people‚Äôs pain is funny. 
---
What are some of the benefits you get with lifetime?
---
I‚Äôm bouta start silo 
---
Ps4
---
I love putting flamingos in teammates' bases, you're probably safe.
---
Thats okay.if you know anyone who sells them. I am interested in that and the calibrators
---
Before I go to the home screen. Add them as a friend. Send join chat message. Wait. I could be dead.
---
Yeah, used to be one of my stops to get this ingredient.  I was just really posting for large amounts, but thanks for your input
---
Most people are in party chat. Played over 150 hours never seen a mic over anyones head.
---
I think Whitesprings will eventually be like this. But let's not make it like ESO, little too predatory for my taste. I know you can buy with in-game gold but they try to sell mansions in that game for $100
---
This isnt Fortnite.
---
My group got it about a minute before we got the notification
---
Wait, looting someone's supply drop makes you wanted? I haven't played in months. Is this a new thing?
---
The varied interests of the silent always outweigh the calls to arms of the discontent my brother
---
Watoga and all of its buildings. Make your camp suspended nearby so the melee enemies cannot reach it.
---
I want chromed out power armor
---
i just got into workshops. Was thinking once i design a nice build at one I could blueprint it?? then it would be real easy  to build when grabbing same workshop in the future.
---
So what's up with the Mysterious Stranger perk? 50% of the time he spawns and deals an insane amount of damage while tanking everything, and 50% of the time he spawns almost completely naked and with no weapon OR hair and just punches mobs for no damage
---
Is that part of the perk, or...?
---
I'm not the one selling, that's ogregev (u/ogre123)
---
Thanks for the delay, took a little break from tracking and reporting when I hit 110 hours (I need an intervention)..  
---
it appears they made a small mistake on the Armor records, that forces a Zero value, so depending on which mod gets added first by the Server it either works, or doesn't :(
---
Nani, 300+ damage?
---
My friend said some guy made his for him. Idk why his has DR. He told me his does too. Maybe try scrapping it and making one, see if it has one then
---
Me because I use throwing knives
---
Ok, but don‚Äôt complain about the delay.
---
I would totally join you if I was on ps4. On Pc here. I had a guy explain to me what I should and shouldn‚Äôt keep in my stash for over 15 minutes.... like, let‚Äôs just go kill things my man. 
---
I think they should allow real life retailers to sell items. A Nike sweatsuit, kid rock t-shirt, Ironman power armor, MLB baseball hat... lots of cool options for players with great advertising opportunities for real world companies... and those companies could be paying Bethesda so they benefit as well.  Great for challenges too... 
---
Touche'
---
So stoked I stopped playing this stupid fucking game. 
---
Ahhhhh Come on guys! I had a day off tomorrow and everything!
---
who hurt you
---
Waiting in Silo Alpha haha
---
I think I attacked you at the ammo factory a week or two ago. Was a fun fight as I recall. I might have to come for a rematch. 
---
I saw this posted on Facebook and the comments were literally cancer. 
---
Same (except i have another later in the week but i was soo excited that it fell on a day i didn't work.)
---
This would be nice, but that isn't looking likely unfortunately
---
Are you on xbox, I have an x-01 torso w/ jetpack attached, will deal
---
Calibrated shocks, see my post : i knew they were more than a myth 
---
Did you get it?
---
I'm on ps4
---
How much do you want for the shocks?
---
It would have to come with a warning letting you know before you join so you can decline.
---
But the point would be to prevent situations where one person on a team has a bounty as "bait." You attack the person with the bounty and suddenly all their teammates are tagged in pvp against you and kill you.
---
Preventing Wanted players from teaming up with non-Wanted players would stop this behavior. 
---
I had that happen to me 2 weeks ago
---
Yeah this happened to me very early on. I had no idea I'd "stolen" anything until I got the wanted marker and the lvl 40-something owner showed up, pummeled me into a fine paste, and took everything I had. Yay, fun!
---
I dont have that much caps right now but ill give you all caps for jetpack and any shocks you are willing to offer. I thought they were a myth 
---
I'm more worried about camp budget build a machine might take, if it's a camp objet. But also, how would the plan be acquired?
---
Sorry if you misunderstood. I dont have the shocks. I want them though haha
---
Wait were they someone you knew or someone who was just helping
---
Imagine. You spend 7 hours with a group of high level players running the nukes and going crazy to get through the silos. A long shift getting through them.
---
You nuke everything.
---
It fades to black. White writing appears: "Level 2". Fades back in. You're all in Skyrim together on the back of the cart.
---
Agreed. The art work of the world, the thought behind the stories. The details you start to notice and start to wonder about. 
---
Take the red birdhouses. There‚Äôs a story there. But we may never know it in full. We can but guess. 
---
Depends if they balance Sentinel/Cavalier armor. .
---
You can build in it too! No point, its literally a blasted clean crater, but cool for an rp camp
---
Um. Right under the slot you put technical data in a cabinet. 
---
Some guy did something similar to me. He started taking my workshop while i was at camp, but because my weapon was broken and I got the workbench bug I couldn't repair it to go and defend so i was just chilling in my house waiting for the bug to go away. Lo and behold, the dude comes to my house and kills me in my defenseless state. I respawn fast and run to get my loot but it's already gone. Kind of frustrated at this point since I couldn't defend myself, I went on a quick material raid, repaired my weapon and started looking for him on the map. I see him travelling to one of my other workshops so I travel there fast, get there as he's approaching the workshop. As soon as he clicks E on it I headshot him with my bloodied Gauss Rifle and he's full of junk, so I quickly take it all and log out since i had no stash space.  
---
I log in 30 minutes later and the dude has added me to friends. Thinking he can't harm me anymore i accept and he joins me. I try talking to him in english but he just replies in russian and makes question marks, then repeatedly tries to trade me. When I accept, he requests my gauss rifle that I killed him with and whenever I declined or said no he would just run at me and melee me until i accepted trade again, desperate to buy the gun i used to kill him, lol.
---
Yep
---
I dunno. If they never release server code, then how exactly will that happen? 
---
If only we had smell-o-vision.
---
I'm constantly running out of .45 but alas I'm on XBox.  And late to the party.
---
Have 137 ultra cite .45 cal. ammo for sale.  name a price, we can haggle
---
I have no idea why Betgesda isn't planning to do that. Again, another obvious thing to do that flues over tgeir head.
---
Not me, not until my ps subscription runs out anyway.
---
Who gave you your parents password to the computer? This is like the 5th time I‚Äôve seen you shitpost comment tonight.
---
&gt; I have no idea why Betgesda isn't planning to do that. 
---
Because there are a lot of people that want to use the character that they have now.
---
What eva.  I do what I want.
---
I'm a trans girl, wouldn't mind joining. My voice (mostly) passes.
---
For me this is what I've been waiting for, Im excited to finally be able to jump in and play fo76.
---
I would like an emote to indicate I am laughing.
---
Forget the Moo-Moo. Give me a Meow-Meow.
---
Nice
---
You can tame animals and assign them to your camp using the wasteland whisperer perk and they will stick around indefinitely and take up camp budget until they are killed.

looks to be doing charlie right now
---
Sorry bro, wish i could help
---
Nope.  Still trying to decrypt and having problems with nukacrypt.  Sorry,fellas.  I'll still post when I'm done.
---
*boiled* with an "ed" not boiling, as in currently boiling, we have boiled water but not boiling water.
---
Thumbs up my friend
---
He also stated, ["Its 15k 5.56 ammo. I only farm super mutants and only use shotguns. It kinda stacks up after a few months."](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/as0aea/banned_im_the_900_hours_played_guy/egqzjry/?context=3)
---
Every time a random out of nowhere serious lag spike hits, I just shake my head and mumble, "T'was a duper I bet..."
---
This post wasn't asking for a discussion. It was asking for a circle jerk of hate hard ons.
---
You just more politely re-posted all the "Hey Idiotz, why do you dumbasses keep playing Bugthesda's trash like a bunch of idiot dumbasses lolz"
---
I can't wrap my head around some of them. People who proclaim that this is the best game they've ever played, favorite of all time, etc... if the mountain of slowly shrinking bugs is ignored, it's a decent skeleton of what could be a great game.
---
Everyone who isn't in love with this game isn't a "hater". The tone and timber of this subreddit was very positive prior to the big January patch. And TSE was only a small part of that.
---
It's gotten a lot better. But there is a LOT of work that still needs to be done for the game to be what a AAA game should be on day 1.
---
So THAT's what that was that was owning me that one time in the big. Damn that thing was annoying. Just a steady stream of kill-beam.
---
No i was actually trying to start a discussion and just see who uninstalled the game
---
If you have power armor, jet pack away or sprint like hell and then fast travel to your camp. (Not sure if it‚Äôs more fast but it is more effective.)
---
&gt; Calibrated shocks are borderline impossible to find. 
---
The struggle is real. I passed up a rare log in when MODUS actually had 2 of them because I didn't know Explosive Vent was fecking useless. I already had my jetpack. Figured Jetpack+Explosive Vent=fun. Not so much..
---
I think that‚Äôs just you mate, I as well am over encumbered and I use dying as a way of fast traveling.
---
Happened to my friend a few times and me once.
---
You are right! Worked perfectly. Thank you!
---
Timing is everything.
---
Got my first Explosive weapon at around level 100, haven't got one since.  Hang in there, I don't/won't trade for them, since the nerf and dupe purge, they aren't that great, but are still desirable for explosive splash damage via the perks.  Someone will make you a deal.
---
Its cool. Thank you though
---
Gotta luck out I believe
---
Where did you get this information?
---
I have one calibrated schlock for 1k if intrested wont be on tell tomorrow tho my psn is YoungSpud-san 
---
Samesies!!! 
---
Is Mercury in retrograde or something this weekend?
---
Thank you, and I hope someone has a extra
---
While i don't mind decorations for all tastes to be added, I would prefer if they start by fixing their stupid build system so i could spend more time building and less time fighting with their clunky system of "part of structure will be inacessible" and "the object is floating".
---
Again. That's not a discussion. That's a roll call for no purpose. 
---
A discussion would be "For those of you who stopped playing, or full on uninstalled, what were the main reasons?"
---
With all the duping that went on for months, the economy of the Standard mode won't bring any fairness in the short-mid term for the Survival mode. And PvP should be about fairness imo. 
---
Also, what will stop high level players to farm low level ones in the starting zones?
---
I mean, that could be an interesting challenge for low levels, but some people might rage like crazy about it.
---
Nothing. Not until the 13th.
---
One of us. One of us. One of us. 
---
For real. Your PTO is your PTO. Who says you have to do anything? 
---
By overseers camp
---
TSE's thanks to Bethesda's divine ~~stupidity~~ ~~incompetence~~ ~~inability to quality check their product~~ wisdom, they got rid of all TSE drops because they left a dupe exploit from Fo4 in this game AND encouraged players to break their game early, resulting in thousands of TSE weapons and endless crashed servers, so they then erased a bunch of them and left a few in to become legacy items, so if this game survives for 5 years, a TSE weapon will eventually sell for a crap ton because they're going to only get rarer over time because they don't drop anymore.
---
Assuming Bethesda actually legitimately squashes the dupe bugs ever otherwise they'll keep cropping up in droves.
---
So the basic issue is that the decoding process has to wait for the bunker to supply just a small amount of the keyword.  And it's not.  At least the server I'm on.  I have all 8 alpha pieces though, and they are:  A-0, B-8, C-8, D-9, E-7, H-9, O-6, Y-6.  If anyone else is more quick on the draw, help yourself.
---
Well, you learned a lesson, I guess ‚òπÔ∏è
---
I will buy that off of you once I get this jetpack. I don't have much caps and I have been looking for the jetpack for forever. 
---
I always see them close to Charleston fire department. Usually along the fitness test route.
---
What do you mean by suspended nearby? Anyway I'm not sure I can handle Watoga. Maybe my build sucks but I struggle against a handful of level 23 super mutants, largely because of the stagger of melee.
---
I have three civil war dress plans if anyone gets a different duplicate and wants to trade. 
---
So there is almost no chance I could get one that isn't like 20,000 caps?
---
Your good man its not going anywhere 
---
Thanks for disliking a legit method to have unlimited free food. Guess you losers really do only wanna play a game if you have to cheat at it. 
---
I don't even have this game. I'm subbed for updates and news.
---
Yup on PS4 and been getting it and I‚Äôm not over encumbered either 
---
Yea I just saw that. 
---
So what are we're getting then? 
---
People charge for ammo? I just give mine away
---
Thanks
---
Can‚Äôt help you with the second one but you can take one foundation and make 3 stairs and put a floor on those stairs. Put a barricade around the stair entrance and BOOm, you got a suspended camp 
---
I sell everything as buy one get one, so I guess half a cap each.
---
Only exception is plasma cartridges, ultracite anything, cryo cells, fuel, and 40mm.  Those all go for at least 1 cap each if not 2.
---
That sounds like a short discussion.
---
 "Did you uninstall?" // "Yeah" // "same" // "........"
---
We should get this. Ôøº
---

They need to be a random spawn, alone, static spawns like deathclaw island don't work. 
---
This holds true for a lot of things...
---
Carpeted ceilings is an odd feature.

This was a comment on a post about what you are taking about from like 40 days ago. Don‚Äôt know if it is the one you were looking for. 
---
If your on ps4 I have all the mods for handmade and I'll do it if free just need mats
---
The official strategy guide.
---
I just hit the xbox button and close game 
---
You can craft it or add me on ps4 Zan_Wild, and I can hook you up
---
I should‚Äôve clarified in my post, ugh.
---
XB1, sorry, but I appreciate the offer!
---
Oof then yeah man just gotta keep scraping you'll get it eventually 
---
It's like 2-3 hours of content though 
---
What is the exploit? You turn invisible when you stand still, and can take one step for every additional piece you have on. That‚Äôs pretty limited. 
---
That's...irksome. "Pay more money and we'll detail basic fucking game mechanics". 
---
Cool, thanks!
---
for half of the people adrenal reaction still dont work get your fact right bud..
---
I'd sell 500 shells for 450 caps
---
Oh god. Feel your pain. Got stuck in that water in power armor. Turns out I wandered through a sunken tunnel too. Frustrating 10mins and a bunch of radaway..
---
The grind keeps people busy while waiting for new content. It's not about reducing "OP players" but rather a way to manage time:reward with existing content so people don't get bored too quick.
---
I'm neither for or against. I can see why it's there.
---
That's actually a cool concept. I'd love to see that
---
I've collected many of supply drops and not once become wanted from it, let me reword that, I have found many random supply drops that I have not called in and I've also shot numerous down and never gotten a wanted level from them.  Thats interesting though, are you sure it wasn't something else that gave you the wanted status?
---
I suppose, but that's sort of been the thing with strat guides for a while. Difference this time is for some reason people haven't done a great job updating the fallout wikis for 76 like they did for 3, NV, and 4.
---
\*leans back in chair with a mug of purified water between hoofs\*
---
Let's talk benefits and 401k.
---
lol thats so fucked up but awesome at the same time. I need to try this 
---
As someone who's splitting time between Destiny 2 and Fallout 76, thank you. Now I don't have to choose tomorrow. 
---
Lady.  But yeah, there are over 200 combinations right now and I'm not hard testing that many.  Have to wait until at least one key letter is displayed to solve the encryption.
---
Oh sorry. When is a letter gonna be displayed?
---
I do not believe all those are going to drop on the 13th, but we do know we will be getting the brewing quests and camp items (it was talked about last week in the ‚Äúinside the vault‚Äù. It was actually really the only thing talked about.) I could be wrong. 
---
I have one, B
---
Its the "and appearing over several weeks" that was confusing
---
Bravo? I‚Äôm just finishing alpha. I won‚Äôt have time for alpha
---
Oh thank god, I can spend all tomorrow working towards the new wow race and wednesday with this. Absolute perfection
---
Not really, as you can already have suiciders, deathclaws, and even scorchbeasts as the camp attack beasts. 
---
Great flow!
---
Na, he's talking about the people who use any and every excuse to bitch about bethesda, especially the wonderful youtube idiots.
---
But I‚Äôll do bravo tomorrow if you got it 
---
Zan_Wild on ps4 I can probably hook you up with some 
---
Up in the toxic valley I usually find them by the black bear lodge just roaming around. Not entirely sure it‚Äôs a random spawn but they‚Äôre always in different places around there so I‚Äôd give it a look. 
---
They actually just nerfd the 2 shot explosive weapons unfortunately , and im on xbox my brotha but thanks for the tips!
---
Suiciders can already spawn as a camp attack they are rare and only happen in the divide for some reason. 
---
One of the first comments Bethesda replied to after the initial announcement implied that they might change that because of the immediate feedback saying new characters should be required. I'm interested to see if it does change.
---
I mean, it used to be, basic information like this? It was in the _manual_. This isn't a "strategy". This is a "game mechanic". 
---
It does not look like carpet. It looks like ceiling tile. 
---
for alot of players it still doesnt work get your fact right... and strange in numbers been broken since day one intefering with many perk cards
---
Hopefully they nerf the hell out of Colonel gutsy's because uhh I just ran into one, He one shotted me???  That's complete bs, granted I'm level 30 he was 52 but still that should not be a thing.  For an enemy that becomes aware of a player without even needing line of sight to be able to one shot you is ridiculous.  Bethesda is enormously dissapointing with this game.  It's a nice waste of time some days but others its just confusing as to how a "developer/creator" can release such a shit, broken, half-assed game to the public and it be completely fine.  I seriously think they owe the loyal players some kind of compensation because this is both pathetic and ridiculous
---
If they let you in I want in too. We can both sneak in if they say no. 
---
Can I interest you in 3 clipboards instead?
---
People book a day off work for a half hour appointment. Why not book a day off to unwind, recharge batteries, and play a game you enjoy especially if they added something to give it a new twist? 
---
No, sorry I thought you meant a letter for alpha.  
---
My current combo is B 8
---
Story of my life: If it's not, the planets must be aligning or something. I'll have to check into the moon phases as well before I sign up for my next few shifts in the emergency department. 
---
Can get medicated shampoo for that. 
---
on PC, i find if i manually switch my weapons (through pipboy) back and forth a few times, the switch works after that.... Not sure what triggers it to break again after tho, maybe fast travel is doing it
---
I'm actually excited that I haven't purchased this game yet. I'm going to get it at a decent price, and it looks like there will be some decent content.
---
I'm really excited I waited this out and didnt drop money on this game when it was $80. I'm going to get way more content and a significantly reduced price.
---
When in doubt, I blame Mercury. It makes no sense but makes me feel better 
---
lol there must be a .45 shortage on ps4
---
You've clearly never talked to a real ale drinker. Brewing is no joke to many. 
---
Shit new codes refreshed today. Cancel booooo
---
If you have max blocker, lone wanderer and some d m g reduction gear for ghouls you can farm Whitespring 
---
This is cool; More power to you. There are some pretty well known all-fem clans up and running on discord. If you reach out, maybe you could connect with them and pull in some more players too!  
---
Good luck, and see you around Appalachia.
---
Maybe they found a bug that would drastically increase drop rates but found a fix for it so instead of let it sit in the game for 12 hours they will fix it first....
---
Oops.  Wrong game :p
---
P.s.  t‚Äôwas but a little joke at the expense of our dear Anthem friends. (I be one of em). 
---
Cool cool. When will you be on
---
The weapon and pwa skins are the worst though. Like they are seriously going to charge 1400 caps for a shitty power armor skin that you'll probably use like once and then switch it back cause you realize its ugly as shit
---
In over 100+ hours of play with access to the bunker I have yet to see the jet pack or calibrated shocks. I gave up. I look when I do my vender run but I don‚Äôt sever hop anymore. 
---
I was able to buy one off my sister, but then she learned what they did and would not sell me the other leg. 
---
It really doesn‚Äôt. If you wanna are douche bags go play ark üòÅ
---
I'm pretty sure 5.56 isn't the rare ammo they were talking about. It's ultricite ammo, which is much more difficult to craft. Anyways, good luck. 
---
PC and I never freakin notice ot until I am swarmed. Grrrr
---
It will reveal all of them over the course of the week.  Don't worry someone will have one solved by tonight.
---
I think all new characters and NO legendaries. Totally balanced playing field. It would be fun to play PVP with out bloodied deathclaws and TSEs. 
---
I know there‚Äôs legendaries we get from the quest line... idk what to do about those
---
There's  a glitch that allows you to use that armor and remain perm invisible.  It is rather annoying. 
---
Thank you!  That's the one.
---
I've gotten all of them, but the key letters aren't displayed in the bunker yet.

Glad I saved that post with the intent to read that article at a later date now. Lol.

But I'll know. üòè

a couple times to me too. Also had a few times where i died in a nuke zone , and was allowed to seek revenge, presumably on the ghoul that offed  me.

Im working on charlie right now, if you are on PC i can supply you with keycards to throw at the problem :)

Alright. Think I found some last night. I'll be on a bit later. Dont wait for me if somebody else offers you them.

cool. glad I didn't call in to work yet. Will postpone my sickness a day. cough cough
---
Hey! If you ever got a spot for 1 more, I'd love to level with you guys. I have 1 53, and am currently leveling up an alt to try a new play style. I would still consider myself a beginner (because I play casually). Feel free to hit me up if you're on PC!
---
What is 900 hours guy's username..he got to level 45 in 4 days
---
Yeah, I‚Äôve had that happen several times now ‚Äî game freezes when I hit spacebar to quaff something from the Aid tab of the Pipboy. And this is after I‚Äôve been playing for at LEAST twenty minutes. Waiting does nothing; it‚Äôs permanently frozen and nothing else will respond in the game.
---
Can‚Äôt agree with this more. There are definitely going to be some bugs just like any other game with a big update but any delays to minimize these bugs are worth it.
---
Windows 10?  Make sure your Xbox DVR is disabled.

I have actually used this trick to ambush teams of bounty-baiters. You know, the people with OP gear and high bounties that go around ganking new players and then letting their teammates kill them to transfer the caps and scrub the bounty. If one of them owns a workshop, just put a marker on your map where you see them. Then contest the workshop, and fast travel/run to the marker as fast as you can. Doing so usually makes their whole group hostile, as anyone on the team of somebody who's workshop you contest is pulled into PVP mode with them. When someone is hostile to you they disappear from the game map, which is why you set a marker at their last known location before you do this. They are usually still there or close by once you get to where you last marked them. Then you have this whole team of people with no slap shield expecting you to be at the workshop waiting on them instead of immediately at their location stalking them. Have a crit charged and be ready to run in case they all have assassin/sentinel gear, but you can usually get most or all of them before they realize they have been had. I call this the "reverse-troll shuffle maneuver", and it is HILARIOUS when you pull it off.
---
Another I like is the  "Homeless Surprise". If someone you can't kill is griefing and has a high bounty, just watch the map every few minutes and observe where they travel to. Usually, they will eventually make a big jump to a place with no map marker. That's their CAMP. Put a marker on it, then travel to the marker to find where they live. Now, when someone has a bounty, breaking their stuff won't get YOU one, no matter what or how much you wreck, so you want to level the entire thing as fast as possible: Fat man with a MIRV, Nuke grenades, orbital strikes, whatever reduces everything they have built to rubble within a few seconds. Then just go into stealth nearby and watch the "Homeless Surprise" when the bastard comes back, realizes everything he has built is in ruins, and he is going to have to spend thousands of pieces of junk to build it back, because he was being an asshole. There is usually a lot of cursing. Feel free to taunt your victim and log out if you can't kill them, or drop them with a prepared crit from range and THEN taunt.
---
Have fun griefing griefers, my post-apocalyptic brethren. ;)
---
Sadly still on windows 7
---
You claim Bethesda encouraged the exploiting, but haven't provided any evidence. Oh, and I really need to point out exploiting a single player game only benefits that player without disrupting or spoiling anybody else's games. Having a manufactured (by glitching and exploiting) character in a game where legitimate players are grinding up their loot and gear is not going to be considered fair play at any point.
---
lol there's a manual?
---
This and "Feed the People" were bugs to  Bethesda, but good bugs to the players who enjoyed both of them. Both were bugs that were not game breaking, and benefited the community, got people together. They should be coming up with more "bugs" like these ones ;)
---
sorry try better luck next time
---
I don't mind waiting a day. I am very excited. 
---
Weird.  They have never one shot me, and run a light build.  
---
Yeh either buy plans from Harper's or wherever for 1800 or farm Berkely Springs every 24hrs for 1
---
Upvoted.  Good idea.
---
These rumors have been around for months. A little late on your testing. I don't find it relivent since patching/updates.
---
This isn‚Äôt related to this post but how does one get a faction next to name in comment section 
---
This is much better than letting it go. Take a day, first impressions can mean a lot. 
---
From what I can tell Bethesda put a really short range on these turrets for whatever reason. Super mutants especially will stand outside of that range and shoot your base unimpeded. I‚Äôve had to relocate several times because of super mutants with hunting rifles leveling my base. 
---
Off work and joining your world now.  Thanks again for this

---
What is your build?
---
Level 73 here and I cant get anywhere near that kind of damage
---
?
---
Try a lower resolution.
---
Just seeing this post and was wondering if you can still make the legs for 750 each with them installed?
---
You are the best, but I'm on PS4.
---
Hey did you already launch it?
---
You only need to be moderately close to them to use vats and you'll dash over and whack them also pretty much the only way to hit shit running around your feet.
---
Ok, I actually feel like I owe bethesda an apology. It's totally in that help section. It's laid out there in detail. 
---
If you are melee and plan on being solo a bit you def want max blocker from str and lone wanderer from charisma
---
I haven't used VATS in SO LONG so I completely forgot about this, thank you for reminding me. I forgot how far the melee VATS reaches.
---
My options, as I see them, are to waste time babysitting my base, have no base, or have one of those fuckstupid looking floating bases again, because when I had one, I never had these problems.  Never.  My base isn't even big or fancy, it isn't a goddamned wasteland mcmansion, it's a creepy little shack on a 4x3 foundation, and only one effing floor.  None of it makes any sense, and I'm not interested in building another ugly floating base, nor am I interested in relocating.  That fucking robot was not out of that turret's range, I know this for an absolute fact because guess what?  When a buddy and I were testing my newest """pet""" to see if its ai was *also* broken (spoiler: it sure fucking was!!!) my turret sure was able to hit my friend, and he was *way* farther away from the turret than the robot.  
---
For context: I tamed a yao guai and had my friend, who was also ***teamed with me***, travel to my base to see if it aggroed him.  It sure did!  Even though it wasn't supposed to!!!  And it made my turret *also* aggro on him!  Big thumbs up.  I don't care it wasn't damaging him.  That, at least, works as "intended".  I just don't want to hear the fucking racket every time one of my friends pops by my base.
---
Once killed a guy with 400lbs of scrap junk, 2200 of it being steel, 500 lead, 100-200 each of gears springs and screws. I have no clue why people would carry this much junk on them, ever.
---
Good job. The so-called griefers are mostly dimwits. Who the f with a functioning brain would carry so much junk while challenging others. 
---
Charlie is up.
---
Hey u/BethesdaGameStudios_, i just wanted to say that after returning to the game from a hiatus after some of the older patches, i'm having a lot more fun with the game in its current state. Very much looking forward to what you guys bring to it. Good on you for pushing through all of the hate
---
Yeah I‚Äôm watching the steam rn
---
44472900
---
They don‚Äôt want you to be able to get loot easy. Bethesda‚Äôs whole philosophy is that if they make grinding so hard it will prolong the game and increase its lifespan. I am totally against making the game 5x harder just to increase its lifespan
---
This is going to be a pyramid scheme involving the Scorched hive mind, isn't it?
---
I drop ammo I don‚Äôt need into the suitcase outside Charleston or another train station.  PC.  Enjoy
---
Im dying for this option. At this point im going to be forced to start over, since I don't want to level to 150 just to respec myself... 
---
At 50 now
---
Facebook marketplace?
---
Any store? Pretty sure it fluctuates from 30-40 bucks at stores (preowned) and sometimes drops farther. 
---
Dude, never call out of work for a video game. Stuff like this happens constantly. You‚Äôre just setting yourself up for disappointment. 
---
Wait.... you can respec at 150?
---
Asking for a QOL feature, that should already be in the game, to be a micro transaction is a terrible idea. That is the mindset greedy game companies want you to have. Instead just ask for it to be added into the game because it should be added into the game. Why is it necessary for it to be a micro transaction? Also some could associate that with pay to win. 
---
A lot of positivity in this thread, loving it 
---
I knew this game would be a mess at launch and being a huge fallout fan it was a big deal for me not to get this at launch. When the horrible feedback started rolling in my worries ended up being true. 
---
Despite the feedback I picked it up a few weeks later and it was very buggy and I found it disappointing. After the recent patches and giving it more time, I absolutely love this game. 
---
The world is beautiful (even though i HATE the blur effect), grouping up with friends can be fun, the weapons and weapon degradation are great, i love the C.A.M.P. system, and though a lot of the quests can be poo some are actually fun, and more. 
---
The roadmap also is bringing great changes and i‚Äôm excited for the future of the game. 
---
The game DEFINITELY deserves some criticism, but most of the haters are bandwagoners who haven‚Äôt played it/or played it very long. 
---
I definitely recommend picking it up, just wouldn‚Äôt spend more than $40 on it at this time. 
---
&gt;c
---
Survival players should get a copy of their current character, if they want, but no gear/items should cross over to survival.
---
We should arrive naked, like in the Terminator movie. This is hard mode, right?
---
Nice!
---
You don't have to be smart to beat up on a lvl8 character I guess. haha
---
Always at least one outside the Charleston DMV
---
Well I wouldn‚Äôt know much about the taming AI, but I guess my only suggestion would be try somewhere slightly more remote and where lower level mobs tend to spawn. I do agree however that the turrets need a serious reworking, such as longer range and improved target acquisition. 
---
Sweet!
---
Totally cool with me. I‚Äôd rather it be released correctly then rushed out the door so take your time.
---
yea, boiling water
---
I guess I forgot to mention Xbox.  GT whoafrenchtoast
---
What are you using?  A classic hard drive or an SSD?  Upgrading to an SSD might fix you're issue, albeit a very expensive fix.  You could also try reinstalling the game, maybe something went funky when you first installed that never got ironed out with updates.  Other than that you might want to look around for game stutter issues on Windows 7.
---
repairing/modifying energy weapons
---
&gt;!selling into vendors!&lt;
---
Take your time. I'd rather have it later and stable then now and buggy...
---
I chose my location for fast travel convenience.  I'm not moving again.  I like where I am.  The mobs that do spawn aren't really a problem level wise.  It's just very fucking frustrating to devote budget to things that *don't actually do what they're supposed to effing do*.  Oh, whoo hoo, they're going to change how turrets eat budget.  Do they plan on making the turrets actually work, too, or is it just a pacification patch?  I like this game, but I am really fed up with the bugs.  Every day it's something new, and because of the nature of the game (an online multiplayer title), I can't do what I usually do and wait for the modding community to do Bethesda's job for them (looking at you, UFO Patches!).
---
Nice!  Consider enclosing that fusion generator though.  The nasties often go for it, and before I enclosed mine the super mutants would blow it up,  Now that it‚Äôs enclosed they ignore it.
---
November tweaks, but have you tried them?

Hi!
---
I tried to server hop now for a left arm raider power armor in the toxic valley but power armors just dont spawn on new servers.
---
This makes me think that server hopping for loot doesnt work anymore.
---
Anyone have info how long the respawn timer is? Is whole loot on server spawning at the same time or every item has its own timer?
---
Lol.  
---
I just want to tell you both, good luck. We're all counting on you.
---
I sell off anything over 100 to the vendor. If you hit at least 13 cha you will get 2 caps per silver and I think 3 caps per gold. (Each point of Hard Bargain perk adds 3 to cha for vendor sales/purchases)
---
Silver is used in some armor. 
---
not as a consumable or item
---
This game is as soft scifi as it gets, I really don't think they put that much thought into it. This looks like an oversight to me, the power to weight ratio of plasma gun ammo is way off.
---
Turrets just don't work at times. I've had Super Mutants wailing on me few feet away from the actual turrets and they didn't do jack. Other times I've had turrets freak out and attack inanimate objects (like the car at Dolly Sod's campground). 
---
My favorite is when the turrets themselves randomly disappears from the house. I've had that happens a few times. I wonder why my crap's not firing and all the turrets have just gone (not destroyed, just completely vanished).
---
Whereabouts are you? I'm not sure what the price would be in the U.S, however I picked up my copy for 25$ at EB Games in South Australia about three weeks ago. 
---
Outside of Australia, I would check Facebook Buy/Swap/Sell groups and maybe Gumtree (if that's also a U.S thing). eBay, Amazon might be worth browsing as well.
---
Nope. Pablo Escobar is jealous...
---
your prices per bullet are way too high. and like CoitO9Tails said currently no one buys ammo all that much

You worded it as if you were taking the whole day off specifically because of this update. Sounding like you were so excited for it.

It's literally just an hour or two of content.

Nope, Pablo Escobar is jealous.

I agree with the fridge part but as for salting just use "good with salt" perk, reduce CND loss greatly to the point my food rarely spoils.

Hope you enjoy it, I‚Äôd have joined you and given you the tour but it‚Äôs almost 3:30 and I‚Äôve just turned it off lol. 
---
Anyway, happy hunting.
---
I've had this issue as well - the disappearing turrets. I've got 4 turrets and on the regular three of them just vanish into thin air. The only solution I've found is to 'store' whatever the turret was placed on and then as if by magic the turrets are also stored.  Wouldn't mind but I've still got space in my build budget as well :/
---
We'd rather you take more time and get it right than rush it and frustrate everyone! Thanks for the transparency on this.
---
I bet the atom shop updates on time though, eh?
---
yes its so annoying, im constantly fast traveling back to grab the items cause im always scared of a D/C
---
I was thinking it was a type of composting toilet and soil was filled (to compost excretion) in the pot. Thank God I couldn't smell anything from my monitor.
---
Dammit.  That's my kids birthday, now I wont be able to play til the 14.
---
Can't please everyone though!  I'll be there a day late is all
---
What confuses me about the turrets in 76 is in fallout 4 these exact same turrets worked fine enough, and they would actually kill enemy mobs who attacked your base, so I have no idea how they made these turrets do their job so poorly in this game. 
---
Maybe the next bug they'll fix is finishing their games *before* release and not using paying customers as beta testers.
---
Most ammo I sell 1:1 but everyone and their mothers want shotgun shells so I do 2:1.
---
I'll have to check if my turrets are blueprinted. I just know I've replaced the same rocket launcher no less than three times now. What's funny is when this happens the power cables leading to the turret are still there. So the game recognizes something was placed there and renders the power cable but otherwise acts like it never existed.
---
Seriously. I'm more likely to buy a game/DLC content upon release if it gets delayed due to needing a bit more time to get right. I hope this becomes a trend.
---
Selling. Honestly. 
---
On behalf of my non-redditor friend who runs that build (I'm bloodied heavy weapons/melee myself), I can answer questions if you have any.
---
Right off hand, i know he runs unyielding sentinels gear, and a few pieces add perception. Beyond that, not sure, but I can happily relay questions to him and answer on his behalf.
---
Everything is broken?  I don't know.  Thanks for listening and engaging me, though, I feel better about it now.  Yeah, shit's still broken, but I've vented my frustrations and commiserated with another person.
---
That only makes sense if games have to choose between either including text chat *or* voice chat. Since they don't, it doesn't really work for encouraging "better player interaction" and creates worse interaction for deaf players.
---
I prefer voice chat as well, but excluding one means of communication doesn't serve any useful purpose.
---
Thanks to RaininBullets for the stims and nukas.  Cut 50 lbs. from my stash/carry.
---
Also, HOLY SHIT does it take forever to drop ammo when you have 3k of a certain type.  Need a better slider bar for these instances.
---
Love how deep this went off op. 
---
Well done!
---
If we are on the same server,  my camp is next of the arch #1
---
My original building was sniper based but   Switched to heavy weapons as the weight reduction perk made it far more viable. Hopefully Bethesda will address this and add a rifle weight reduction perk soon. 
---
Just started my bloody build. The damage is insane with perk cards. My 1* bloody hunting rifle is getting over 300 damage. One shotting those damn super mutants is awesome. Like I said, I just started playing with it today. Have all unyielding armors as well. BTW, I did die quite a few times. 
---
Not if you fast travel away THEN relog
---
Caps
---
I‚Äôm mostly interested in damage output with a bloodied Hunting rifle. Is it worth a significant investment, or should I put those caps toward a semi-auto like a handmade or combat rifle?
---
Thanks, btw!
---
I drop there at least once a week too
---
Doing the move one card at a time thing. 
---
So is mine!  
---
That's why its #1, it was easy to find it..... under my camp, lol.
---
That's interesting, never bothered to read it either.
---
Never had the wanted for supply drops. Usually leave them alone and have never called in a drop. Only one I do go for is for nuclear key card. Have like ten cards lol. 
---
I do want to comment on the pvp Issue. I play only fallout. Have done so since fallout 3. Saw I have like 800 hours playing this game. (76). Never killed anyone unless asked to remove a wanted level. Keep pacifist on and ignore people who hit me. Will leave server and block the people who bother me. I just don‚Äôt want to do pvp. 
---
Please give these people their own server so I can enjoy the game. Recently tricked into pvp via workshop. Now I take workshop build a stash box drop all junk, get reward and do first defense round. Then I switch servers. 
---
Please make a server for those who want pvp. Or make a game option where those of us who don‚Äôt want pvp can not be attacked at all. Don‚Äôt want to be attacked by four griefers when very low on health after fighting an in game enemy. 
---
Thanks all. 
---
Hell yeah dude. Let me know when you get that Alt and we can start playing.
---
Yes please. I play with a mate and we just want to explore.
---
Two shot and explosive mods were each nerfed individually (though it was at the same time and for the same amounts) but that was like a month ago.
---
Explosive needed to be nerfed. I ran none of the explosive or shotgun perks and could easily one shot glowing with my tse. Now with 6* in shotgun and 5* in explosives its like 3-4 on the same. Which is better, imo. They were super op.
---
But two shot comes with a massive penalty to accuracy, and each round is worth 1/2 damage. meaning the shit accuracy usually makes 1 round miss, if not both.
---
IMO damage or accuracy should be increased on two shot weapons. 
---
Honestly I wouldn‚Äôt even be mad 
---
I'm not the person booking time off, just saying they're doing something pretty healthy and normal. 
---
and by worse interaction you mean almost none. it's so disgustingly exclusive. I'm not targeting you but agreeing and voicing my extreme displeasure yet again at Bethesda's gross oversight in this department.
---
Who the fuck do you think you are, seriously ?
---
It‚Äôs supposed to be the process of making it, boiling the water and adding the ingredients. Obviously it makes no sense considering you can make it with old water but still
---
Have you tried Google?
---
What about for those that can't hear. They get invited by so many MMOs. The real MMOs that I've played, have all had chat interfaces. 
---
Also some people find it intimidating to talk to new people. But a chat box makes it easier. Like texting. 
---
I'm a Bloodied sniper.. I one hit almost everything and am rarely seen. And if I do get seen I can usually fall back until I'm hidden again. SB go down in 5 or 6 shots, Mirelurk Queens don't fare much better. It's probably the most efficient way to play in terms of bullets and gear repair. Since you rarely get hit your armor lasts for a long time, and since you tend to die if you get hit more then twice you don't sit there getting your armor chewed up. The build is utterly useless in a SBQ fight though... It's only viable for that if you're in a dedicated group that has a plan for the Queen, showing up to random fight with this build and you'll be disappointed.
---
I remain invisible when playing with a team. No idea why as I don't have any chameleon armor on
---
Never played it... they really do something like that?
---
My first thought was pay to win. Lmao. 
---
What he said.  It‚Äôs definitely an exploit and not just a glitch.  I haven‚Äôt seen a lot of people doing it so there has to be a way,  
---
Im on vacation this week!
---
*dodges incoming tatos*
---
That‚Äôs not the armor, that‚Äôs an actual glitch that happens every once in a while.  Loading in and out usually fixes it.  
---
That's not a bad idea except instead of making the defend event triggered by another player contesting just make it so that to take a workshop that's claimed you can tag it and get a notification of when it's next defend event is so you can join it and try to stake claim in it. That way workshop owners aren't inundated with any more defend events than they already are. Workshop defenses would have to be made neutral so they don't count toward the contest and only player actions are tallied.
---
I'll be back on Wednesday night if you still need some assistance or basic questions answered. 
---
Oh yea happens all the time to me on Xbox1 also. It can be brutal when you need that melee weapon in a pinch and it‚Äôs not there!
---
Got it, thank you. So is this something they will still fix?
---
I've went there 12 times in the past week and never spawned one 
---
It worked I'm busy grinding other games

And they definitely aren‚Äôt using stealth boys? 
---
The fallout community is pretty toxic, it's just usually not bad.
---
Aye, you're probably right. The real issue is probably something completely behind the scenes though. Programmers probably do want the best for the game, but were most likely pressured by investors or management to push it out and meet deadlines. They have lives outside of work as well, hopefully. So as mad as I want to be it's probably a company issue. This game screams no passion. Not a lack of passion from the writers or programmers though, a lack of passion from the money side. These people just want money and they don't realize that big bucks come from big work. If they simply put more time and man power they could easily keep up with issues and updates. League of Legends is top 3 in the world with bi-weekly updates, daily hot fixes, and runs year round events, game modes, skins, characters and esports teams. Fortnight same scenario. Apex Legends, same story. The popularity of those game modes is only a small piece. They dump BILLIONS into creating something they deem as excellence and when they mess up, they own it and fix it. Bethesda is growing old. Slow to change, slow to update, and slow to communicate. Hopefully new management comes around, or a new work enviroment is created. Just something. Something is missing and it's very obvious. 
---
I've had to buy all mine. Level 110 now but getting a crap ton better drops now. Maybe it's an experience thing. I did get a TSE pump shotty from the White Springs station for 200 caps. Still using it just not as often these days. 
---
Hah this happened to me last week, I knew the codes were gonna reset that night but being in the UK I figured I had till midnight in the states - so plenty of time. Nope, 12:00 exactly - I'm still punching my way through robots and I get that little message that the codes had expired. Ah well, I wasn't that far in so it wasn't a big deal. 
---
TSE still drops, they just nerfed two shot and explosive. Additionally, energy guns can no longer spawn with the explosive modifier, as it made them shoot bullets instead of their default projectile.
---
That‚Äôs really helpful! Is the Queen a problem bc of the sonic attack, or because of the crowd? I assume that would be a problem for all of the Bloodied builds. As a person who runs this, do you think it‚Äôs worth 15k caps to buy a 3* Bloodied Hunting rifle? The other perks are increased vats hit chance and reload rate.
---
You'll die less and less as you learn the quirks of the build. 
---
Prolly just a guy thats pretty good. I dont think its a dev
---
That‚Äôs good information; thanks for sharing! I just dropped a one star Bloodied Submachine Gun, so I gave it a shot and really liked it. Now I want to lean into it haha
---
If you ever don't use that shotgun I will pay good money for it 
---
Seriously. 20 pounds for a hunting rifle eats up a ton of carry weight, especially if you have a side arm.
---
Tell ya now getting them this early is almost impossible 
---
Not sure if you know this yet but the triggers slide the numbers up and down really quickly!  Don‚Äôt have the use the directional pad only.  üòÄ

I hope there would be an option to set a visible marker of the vending machine to let everyone else know where it is located on the map. Not many people visit my C.A.M.P. currently.
---
Yah I didn‚Äôt even think about the resetting when I did the silo so there‚Äôs a hour waisted 
---
You can have an updoot, I know they are fixing adrenal but I don‚Äôt know if they are gonna fix SiN.

Lol, I knew I had to be doing something wrong as it ticked down 1 by 1.  Thanks for the pointer.

Idk why your getting downvoted. It's been like 6 months with 0 PvP fixes that are actually effective. So it is pretty reasonable to wonder what will actually get done in a day. 
---
You make me want to okay this game again, but I'm super low level 
---
In site charly btw
---
If you can grab a BE lever I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs the way to go.
---
Click-squiggle-click...You feel well rested! 
---
Sal's Grinder shop. I can't remember the town name but on the map it's where the little picture of a town is on the left side of the ash heap. 
---
150%.  We figured it out because of the timer we used.  Was over 4 minutes the player was doing this for.  Didn‚Äôt come uninvisible the entire time,  was watching the whole time.  
---
I drop weekly at White Springs. Everything but 308 and Shotgun
---
Did we ever find the suit I'm trying to make a constantine
---
Im up to 200 of each. Can't sell it fast enough. 
---
For me it seems to like to like to crash when I fast travel a few times quickly. Lately I‚Äôve been holding the steel mill and hemlock for making bullets and flame fuel on an alt and my base is down near the ash heap. 
---
So to save on caps I fast travel to my base and then fast travel to wherever I was when I went to defend/gather and it seems like that second travel is where it gets me with a crash.
---
I really want that backpack. I love somewhat or completely realistic survival games. Fallout is what I think could be a very realistic survival game, at least on PS4.
---
That‚Äôs site charly right?
---
Men. What's your point?
---
The meat hook isn‚Äôt amazing, even with it benefiting from 1 handed and unarmed. You don‚Äôt have room to equip all gladiator perks, iron fist, incisor, and martial artist. The power fist is better overall, and it can get armor penetration with the punctureing mod.
---
Dude your fucking amazing just saved my ass
---
I‚Äôve already started dying less. It was difficult to get used to at first, but now I don‚Äôt really mind tbh. I just don‚Äôt carry any junk I care about 
---
The SBQ is frustrating because you might deal high damage, but the DPS is too low on snipers to feel like you're making a difference. A good role for this build in a SBQ fight is crowd control. It is very chaotic in a Queen fight, so yeah those adds will sneak up on you.. It's easy enough to avoid getting hit by the queen, but that scorched fog crawler that's behind you will get you every time. Another benefit about stealth sniper is your SPECIAL spread is already tweaked for stealth commando as well, so you can respec to that for a SBQ fight.  I can't really speak to hunting rifles, all I ever needed was my 1* Bloodied Lever Action... With my Unyeilding gear, nerd rage, adrenal and other perks all procing at once it'll pull 975 base damage.. With a sneak attack critical at night... Well you can imagine... It's more powerful than most melee builds under the right circumstances.
---
THANK YOU VERY MUCH for confirming this. It's working right now again for some reason but who knows? Maybe it'll only work for 10 minutes. lol
---
Suppose I'll just leave this unequipped. Would be better.
---
"does someone need me to kick their ass?!"
---
I actually never found anything good there. Maybe one day I‚Äòll be lucky 
---
Very cool.  Just logged off, so no pics, but there's a spot just S/SE of the Devil's Backbone that was the last stand camp for some raiders vs. the Huntersville Super Mutants.  There's a holotape and a pretty sizeable camp, complete with a toilet sticking out over the edge of the cliff.  You can't build near it, so it must be marked in the files as a location, just unmarked.
---
Facebook still exists? I thought it went to Myspace land 
---
As you may have read, this isnt the one I‚Äòm looking for. But thanks for offering 
---
So, no it turns out Excavator gives 100 catry weight from full set + 100 carry from calibrated leg mods, making it the best armor in the game for mid play, as such you will have to do with kangaroo mutation only. By the time you save the caps for the mod and the perks needed you will probably have X01 and ultracite a well, you can make a choice, wear excavator with mods and switch to X01 or ultracite for hard battles (only the queen). I just hit lvl 57 and nothing stands in may way except for the queen, with a strength build and some mutations movement speed feels like a superman in excavator. I have Xo1 with calibrated legs and no jetpack on it but still working on those caps. You can find all plans for mods in Grafton store for excavator now, and wotonga has all plans for all mods on 45 51 and 60 PA. Hope it helps
---
Thats its normal spawn location. Found it there more than once. But it doesnt look as good as the yellow one 
---
What systemare you on?
---
PS4
---
Do the event 'Leader of the Pack' every time you see it; easiest way to snag low level legendary gear(3 guaranteed).  
---
First time tonight all I had were robots. 
---
Sorry. Xbox One here. Possible reason you have a level 60 ghoul is because a high level player went through there recently. Try waiting or hop on another server.
---
I've been there! Can't believe I forgot all about it.
---
I‚Äôm really glad lessons were learned from the launch. If it means a better release, then take all the time you need!
---
Thank you for the communication! At least I have the next two days off!
---
It told you PVP was part of it when you claimed the workshop. RTFM
---
I'm bummed. I'm a real life cranky old lady, but on XB. I'm also fond of 76 paired with Jameson and ginger beer.
---
All of these good ideas posted by players on Reddit. 
---
Bethesda: "I know what the players want - beverages!!!" 
---
To get xp, try some other missions in the forest region. The Mr. Messenger missions are relatively easy and provide decent amount of caps and xp. Also, claim workshops, craft items, orctry and team up with a higher player who will help you level up.
---
Ah good to know. It seems stupid that unique legendary enemies, especially the ones important to the plot, would be able to level scale, BGS should have thought about that one a bit more...
---
Well they are giving us separate servers once survival mode comes out and also it tells you that claiming a workshop opens you up for PvP. 
---
I do agree you should be able to opt out somehow but idk how that would work. 
---
Anyone have brovo??? In the same boat
---
Yeah, damage output is pretty nice. I need to work on getting some unyielding gear too. 
---
&gt;and he is going to have to spend thousands of pieces of junk to build it back
---
1. Open pipboy
---
2. Redeploy camp
---
3. Deploy saved plan
---
Thanks for dropping some knowledge, it‚Äôs helped me make an informed decision. Thanks!
---
I'll not be part of any club that would have _me_ as a member.
---
Sorry for the delay; he can't give me numbers right now, but says the hunting rifle wins by a large margin. He has a couple bloodied handmades on hand as backup, but his words were "99% of the time, I have the rifle equipped, and you never hear me asking for help with anything, even when I get three level 80 scorchbeasts, ghouls, and a hermit crab jumping me at my camp"
---
I can get numbers and exact build later if necessary, but I'm hoping the anecdote answers your question.
---
I‚Äôm on console, where I suppose everything should be optimally balanced to run decently since you sacrifice FPS and graphics. But I can‚Äôt tell you how many times Ive been smoked by invisible enemies while I‚Äôm loading into the environment.
---
Also, forget about weapon swapping or healing during a fight with 3 or more mobs melee rushing you. Sudden input delay has killed me more than heads-up fighting.
---
I‚Äôll try that out if I get the chance, but fast travel from Whitesprings to Flatwoods is pretty expensive for my 100 caps budget right now, lol
---
Just go to any river and jam the collect button for like 1 minute.  I've gotten so much boiled water I actually drink it instead of purified now, since you can't sell boiled water.
---
You don't know brovo by any chance? ?
---
&gt; I don't want to add another 'perk' that should just be a passive perk.
---
Ok, but it's still a bad look to ask for something that is already in the game just because you don't like having to make choices.
---
There is another downed vertibird near number 35
---
I‚Äôve done the same. I rarely PVP and had to exit pacifist mode to do it, but _he stole from me!_
---
Xbox button --&gt; home --&gt; exit game
---
I‚Äôm not sure what you‚Äôre talking about, but I noticed when my chameleon piece was broken today it still worked normally. 
---
Fast travel to your camp or vault 76. Its free.
---
Didn't see the healing factor in there. I will keep note of that. And I was unaware they buffed fireproof. So it actually looks useful now.
---
I've been farming whitesprings since 33. I went from 33 to 36 in one day (few hours) solo. If you have a decent build it is doable. 
---
If you have a costco card, you can get tricentenial for $30
---
Cool!
---
I have no issue with Legendaries dropping, but I'd prefer the toons have to be started from scratch. 
---
Pvp should only apply to to worship area. If they want to take it that‚Äôs fine I just won‚Äôt go and defend it. The problem lies in the fact they can start the capture then leave and hunt you down. 
---
As for cost to fast travel, look for a perk card under Charisma called travel agent. You will pay 30% fewer caps to when you fast travel.
---
Camp is at Whitesprings, but I‚Äôll definitely do Vault 76. Honestly I forgot that was on the map.
---
Had no problem buying stuff off of people so far. Only 240hrs in the game now. Got some really good deals IMO. Definitely changed my game play as I progressed. My most expensive purchase was 2500 caps and I know I over payed but I'm passed that. 
---
Capitalist pigs!  How dare they learn from their mistake!  
---
Go to the sidebar. Find "Community Options" and you should see a place to edit your flair. It'll come up with a list of options. Good luck
---
I‚Äôd pay for a 2-sided brick option. Why the fuck do I want white interior walls. Nothing cozy about that.
---
It's just flair.  You can choose your flair in the subs sidebar 
---
Yay!  It's dropping on my birthday!  Happy Birthday to me!
---
Thanks for the link.
---
Now kiss!
---
I saw it 2 weeks ago 
---
Great job! Would love to see this map with more sites as discovered!
---
what platform ill buy ur gold.
---
Haha, yeah, the anecdote is enough. That‚Äôs really good to hear. I appreciate you taking the time. Tell your friend thanks too üôÉ
---
I hope so!!
---
I've had that happen twice with fo4. It's random, but it happens üòë
---
Well how the hell else can I get my dick in there?
---
Loot drops are I think designed to create a point of conflict between players. Just like capturable outposts. 
---
That said, there being absolutely no warning that looting one will make you wanted to other players is unacceptable. 
---
A simple fix would be to add (PvP) to the name of the quest or add a dialog choice box "Looting this will add player bounty to you! Continue? Yes / No"
---
So what happens when a group of people find OP armor and weapons in survival mode and dupe those, and then only give them to their friends? Then everyone will be outclassed compared to them.
---
You can‚Äôt tell me they fixed duping because there‚Äôs obviously still new weapons being duped. 
---
I get where you‚Äôre coming from and maybe it will be even for the first week or so but duping will find it‚Äôs way into the survival servers, guaranteed.
---
Never on a first thread!
---
When you have to knock out 50% of your planned systems due to a dumbass exec changing your release date.
---
Think of another spot for your camp an the same area as Whitesprings, but not on the resort grounds itself. Bethesda is making certain areas no build zones and Whitesprings has bern a requested no build zone. It's not confirmed, but sonething to watch out for.
---
You got your very own Richard?
---
It's right by my camp so I go there almost daily to pick up whatever is laying around.  Nothing great but I've found a couple magazines there and always get a couple grenades and chems along with a decent amount of junk.  It's definitely big enough to be a marked location and has a piece of the overall story with the holotape.  
---
There's also a downed plane a bit further north the next cliff down and another shack near that I can't describe without going back.  Awesome map, gives me some new areas to explore.
---
Claiming a workshop also gives you a free fast travel point.
---
This. I accept the PVP aspect. But the new deal with 2 or more players on a team and killing someone who isn't actually contesting is annoying. But players gonna play however the game lets them. I haven't claimed a workshop in forever just because of this and with the nerfs, it's often just more effective to normal farm.
---
Ok thanks for the warning 
---
oh yeah if it was OG fireproof that was terrible, but yeah 45% fire and explosive reduction is pretty big. 
---
Yeah normal ammo wasn‚Äôt considered a ‚Äúrare‚Äù item so this proves nothing. On a different note if you wanna sell me some .556 I‚Äôd be much obliged !
---
its when you play really bad
---
I usually try to trade my shotgun shells for .556 or .45, selling it can be profitable but usually takes a while to find a buyer. 
---
Hmmm, it‚Äôs definitely not registering on all hats then because I‚Äôve been picking up all types of clothing/outfits for scrapping to complete that one, and just grabbing hats while I‚Äôm at it wondering if they count too. Anyways, I hope they add more.
---
The spot you have listed as Blake's Crater is the smaller of two craters in that general area. There's a much larger one just west of it. I can upload a map screenshot here in a few minutes.
---
Workshops suck anyways bro. The only good one is the ore collector one. You make way more mats by running around and farming enemies
---
no, I only gathered the pieces for charlie
---
I‚Äôm not a chick IRL, but I also tire of playing alongside dudes all the time. Willing to entertain mixed doubles?
---
I think mine says 19/76? I think I‚Äôve scrapped the civil war era top hat a few times trying to see if I can learn the plan for it :/
---
Can't believe they don't have a Stimpak option! 
---
That would actually make it useful. 
---
Read the fucking menu?
---
Yes. 
---
Usually I get by without having to repair my weapons until I just run across a random weapons bench in the world and I'll use that to fix myself up. Like you said, I always have the materials for fixing them up since they're so commonplace. 
---
An important perk though is Weapon Artisan. Rank 3 Weapon Artisan doubles your weapon CND whereas it takes 5 ranks of Gunsmith to make your guns degrade at half speed. I just find I don't really need more than  double effective CND. I think I can go just over 2 full SBQ encounters before my guns break, depending on how the fight is going. At minimum I can always clear one SBQ encounter before my stuff breaks, fast travel to CAMP, repair, and be ready for more.
---
Thanks for the advice. I dont have blocker on my build, but maybe I could find the gear eventually.
---
Past the bridge heading to the dead tree?
---
Nope 
---
Luckily this hasn't happened with fo4. So did it uninstall?
---
I used to book days off for midnight releases. I don't see the difference. Taking a mental health day to play a game you enjoy is healthy!! 
---
I will show you mine if you show me yours
---
In various in game sources. AMS was the sole proprietor of ultracite, they were the only ones who knew of its location. Ultracite was used to power Watoga, and the rights and supply were contracted to Hornwright Industrial and Garrahan Mining.  They made aggressive moves to buy out and forcibly secure sources of it, even forcing residents of Welch to leave the town. Upon discovering the method to produce ultracite, as it rapidly appears and subsequently decays in ore shafts unless mined, the Glassed Cavern was dug to utilize said process: nuking existing ore shafts. Watoga was simply built as a playground for the rich, complete with an automated waitstaff. The military never utilized ultracite as Atomic Mining Services was still in the process of securing a reliable source of it and marketing it. AMS was probably aware that if they revealed it to the military they would move to secure it under national security concerns: AMS would prefer a contract, and existing contracts with other companies would prevent this as the government would have to make multi-billion dollar contract buyouts. 
---
My biggest issue with this theory is that you take a lack of evidence discrediting it as proof it is true. Deleted terminal entries don‚Äôt prove your point in any way. 
---
I‚Äôm not saying anything yet 
---
So excited for this! The game gets a lot of stick for not living up to the fallout vibe but I think it‚Äôs great. The game is what you make of it and most true fallout fans still stick with Bethesda. 
---
Bethesda, can we get map icons for all of the fissure sites, like the one south of Whitespring?  
---
There‚Äôs one in the Forest south of Bolton Greens that I keep forgetting about until I wander into the area and get attacked by Scorchbeasts. Would be great to have a constant map reminder of where they all are located.
---
Your numbering is awful.
---
So there's a major update coming Wednesday. Do you mean something like that?
---
I wish items that were counted as stealing would be highlighted red. I shit my pants when I was looting around the junkyard workshop not realizing that since a player claimed it if I looted something I'd be wanted. Got a 5 cap bounty. It's really annoying that you get in trouble for something the game doesn't explicitly tell you is stealing.
---
Good to know ur fixing a problem now and not later but I except the game crashing alot so I won't be disappointed lol
---
Be constructive.
---
More than likely, yes. I've never seen an update more than 2-5 gb, unless you're disconnected from the internet for a while
---
I am. His numbering is awful. 
---
what vendor bot?
---
The random spawn one
---
This is ok. I have midterms to deal with. 
---
How do you team a tamed animal?
---
For me they always return to hostile after a minute or two.
---
It's a cool map and great idea.  Offer to help or make suggestions instead of calling it awful.  I'm sure any help would be appreciated on a project like this.  
---
It is kinda hard to read.
---
Scorchbeast souls that unlock the power to blast radioactive clouds at your enemies, among other powers.
---
I just don't bother. Usually drop the requests if I accidentally pick one up
---
Or being able to scavenge some kind of gland from it so you can make Scorchbeast weapons.
---
It's "kinda hard to read" because his numbering is fucking awful.
---
This also includes me and also my excavator helmet keeps going back to my inventory when I come back on.why does this happen?
---
If they add a Jacuzzi have to add bikinis.  Hot tub party!
---
So i should expect the update tomorrow? (Australian btw)
---
...
---
*goes to top of the world*
---
Well alright then, we agree, redo the numbering/color.  OP said explicitly that it's a work in progress.  Thanks for pointing it out.
---
Same. 
---
T-60. Ad Victoriam! 
---
You're not even company.
---
Yeah, right "*gives"*
---
Lol someone put all those there. You're welcome. 
---
Meeee!
---
Just go on r/market76 and post what you are looking for. Typically between  1k-10k caps. You will have one within minutes. I'm level 165 and just got my first TSE loot (Black Powder Rifle). I only have 2 points in luck and 3 in charisma, which supposedly makes a difference. 
---
And I have refrained from buying any beth games at least until they actually finish making this one, I can learn from my mistake as well.
---
I check it out every update and still find it in an unplayable state. Why would I play a game that requires me to log out and log in if I want my equipment and perks to work and has other very common bugs constantly when I can play a game that actually works?
---
Are you on discord?
---
Place your foundation on a Atom shop nuke topiary plant, and you can build off that. It's tricky sometimes, but it works. You can also put crops and basic water purifiers on campfires, so you can still have water up there. 
---
Why don't you redo it, Mr. Constructive? 
---
Seems to happen to me after switching to or from power armor. On XB1X also
---
Right I‚Äôve been using rugs for the cops, but did not know that about the nuke planter and foundations on top of those.  Is that like....stackable / repeatable? Such that you go plant, foundation plant foundation until you can get higher than a normal 6-8 stories?
---
Ask, maybe? If someone politely asked me if I minded I'd probably bounce. 
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
I just want more weapon skins. Hello golden double barrel
---
I've never really bothered doing it that way, but with the campfire trick you can put more foundations. I'm not sure if it would work, but you could try. 
---
I just start with the one on the nuke plant, and toss up some stairs and then the regular "second story" floors with stairs leading to different stories. 
---
 X01 jetpack - 2000 caps.   psn  - CLotUSvss 
---
Thanks for sharing brother!  I will give it a shot when I return to the game in a month or two!
---
Interesting. Thanks for the tips! I suppose the foundation stacking (pyramids) would also achieve the same goal of just elevating a foundation as high as possible, then potentially some roof floors. Will have to experiment. 
---
Seriously... you've lost a fan forever.  What is wrong with you guys???  I work in IT and I read something awful in your terrible post thanking the people that you broke that followed this game for nearly 20 years.
---
"Server stability is up 300% since launch".  First... are you fucking bragging??? Your launch was soooooo shit that in 4 months you increased performance 3 times???  That's not something to be proud of!
---
After all the shit you still cant deliever on time?  Agreed a day is a day.  But, Bethesda... YOU DONT GET ANY MORE PASSES.  you fucked the game and not because the story is pretty weak (it is).  Its not because you still haven't shipped my canvas bag I bought with that wasted collectors edition.  It's not because you didn't have the money.  Its because you are lazy.  Lazy money grabbers just like the others.  You could develop a new engine.  You could bring obsidian or outsource (even though you screwed them out of good money).  Nope.  You guys are just to fucking cool to admit... you actually need the people that got the game here.
---
Bethesa, you got my last dollar.  When starfield fails because of LITERALLY USING THE SAME ENGINE AS THIS SHIT GAME, I'll be sad.  Because you guys used to make great games. 
---
Have a people run the first 3 silos and co-ordinate to all launch at the same time, then have them wait in the launch room until it can be activated again a few hours later, that should shave the time right down to only the last phase of the silo
---
Wait, they're going to hardcap lights? wtf lol. 
---
There's a french discord? Are they only on PC? Now that my new headset is able to connect to both the Xbox and my Android tablet at the same time... Oh, i forgot, i'm pretty shy "orally" even in my first language.
---
Also, very nice build! I also built up there for a bit. :)
---
What gets me are people that go around making fun of other people's suggestions or just generally being jerks.  There is a thumbs up and thumbs down, but most of the time when I see something I don't agree with or whatever, I just scroll past. Some people seem to get enjoyment out of saying things that they know will make others feel bad. Guess that's the world we live in.
---
If you want something, (not plastic at Morgan town, there is a 20 hour spawn on yourself for each item you pick up in game. So if you cleared out Morgan town, it won‚Äôt magically be full again after a hop. 
---
Server hopping is for things like refreshing inventory in vendors hoping to get an item you‚Äôve been looking for but haven‚Äôt found yet. Triggering ‚Äúrare spawn‚Äù points in game hoping to get a certain outfit plan or armor plan. It‚Äôs a grind but has a similar feeling of legendary item hunting. You could play normal for 100s of hours and never naturally come across an outfit you really want. Hell you can even server hop for hourssss and still not find it. But when you do, üôåüèº
---
I‚Äôd buy a chromed/gilted double.  
---
As long as we get a solid experience with limited bugs,take as long as you need
---
Yeah there's all kinds of tricks, it's kind of amazing how limiting it all is and how many weird bypasses there are. I'm learning new stuff all the time. 
---
" 18+, ideally 21+ as we like to keep our luck maxed out with booze both in and out of game. "
---
Lol.. drinkin' and gamin'.
---
Recently doing this myself. I ranked up twice to three times daily going from the penitentiary to Grafton. Lots of supermutants scaling to your level (long as no-one else is there) and multiple events in each place. WS is great but I find myself going from high ground to high ground and enemies too high of a level. But pen and Graf don't really give as many or as good legendaries. 
---
Thank you for letting us know. This actually sort of works for me, as I actually have the 13th off! Can't wait to see all the cool new stuff!
---
Theyre usually in the comment sections as opposed to actually posting things now
---
Yeah, forgot about people playing as raiders, thoses girls could wreak hawok...
---
The item I saw was on one of the main groups on Facebook yesterday I took screenshot because it's so unbelievable 
---
Love everything. But I don't see a dog anywhere...
---
Why is it awful? Would another color be better? Another font? Another size? Should the sites be numbered in a different way? What way?
---
Why should anyone pay attention to your criticism when you can't even articulate it beyond "THIS AM BAD"?
---
Many challenges only become available after a prior challenge has been completed, and your progress is not retroactive. Scrapping hats is one of those. So while you may have scrapped many hats none of them counted until you scrapped the required number of chest pieces or whatever you had to do first. 
---
Honestly we don‚Äôt need so many perk cards for one perk and we should have been given 10 special points at the beginning like every other fallout game so we could build our characters the way we want instead we get so limited on how we can build our characters it makes the game no fun whatsoever I mean I don‚Äôt get how zenimax with only two mega servers has made eso one of the most fun games ever but Bethesda can‚Äôt make fallout online work and their fan base is literally telling them what we want to see.....yes I know eso launches horribly but within a year it was one of the best games out there because zenimax did something it‚Äôs called listening to their fan base instead of whatever the eff they wanted to do maybe Bethesda needs to take some notes
---
But Ebay do not sell a button for more than 10 times its marked price things have to be realistic 
---
no way i'll play pvp mode until they set max reward for your head
---
If you press and hold the map button, then scroll up to your name and click on it you can leave the server immediately 
---
Just wanted to say that I still enjoy hopping into this game every now and then and I‚Äôve noticed a lot of improvements already. I‚Äôm really looking forward to this update but glad it‚Äôs not getting rushed out. I still believe this game can be a great one!
---
TSE will be more damage 100% of the time,on paper.
---
oof
---
Hi, are u on PC? I'm looking for Marine Armor Helmet, can u help me please? :) 
---
And what about anti armor? I heard it does same damage (25%) like tse
---
I'm color blind ...even scrolling all the way  in ...red is hard to see... font is small ...needs a few point of increase. (Viewing from phone am a console player)
---
This change makes no sense to me, I absolutely hate it. During the stress test, BETA, and even early release, these were awesome. I loved to stumble upon a supply drop or call one in in a beginner area. They brought valuable supplies to low level players. They need to bring them back to their old glory, but with a new set of rules
---
1) they drop 3 items; a level appropriate weapon, a 10 stack of random junk, and a box of random ammo
---
2) the one that called in the drop should get better quality loot
---
3) the drop only lasts 10 minutes. I have never seen one despawn, their persistence seems unnecessary
---
Very drunk post. 
---
No aa will do the same damage as a normal weapon on paper. 
---
Extremely Sober.
---
&gt;find OP armor and weapons in survival mode and dupe those
---
Bethesda has been patching out the dupe exploits. Are there still duping methods available? If so, perhaps they could get off their butts and actually put safeguards into the game to prevent this. Like giving every item a unique identifier and if any player suddenly has multiple of a unique identifier, auto ban that player for duping. Seriously, other games do stuff like this to prevent exploits. It's not impossible if they are competent.
---
Mate, this is a fucking awesome idea. 
---
I have one small suggestion though, I seriously looked at the map for a few minutes thinking that you had re-uploaded a blank map. Then I realised... 
---
That colour red on that background is nearly impossible to read for people who are colourblind (which I am, Deuteranopia).
---
If it would be at all to do a ctrl A and change to white or yellow I would be super grateful!!
---
And in the background? Im trying to find which one is better now for high health build
---
It's the little details that make a game for me, and this was a beautifully poignant one. 
---
TSE will be better for PVE almost 100% of the time. PVP however AAE is your best bet.
---
So the anti armor is literally for stuff with armor haha i didn knew that, thanks!
---
Upvoting to bring it up
---
Have you seen the post about that guy who built a labyrinth and lured people inside to fight his tame deathclaw? On that post it was said that only monsters spawned by event will stay longer.
---
Yeah, they said they will reduce the budget cost of turrets and lights this upcoming update, but will cap lights to compensate.  Also thanks.
---
Happy Birthday! 
---
Then shut up already.
---
I wouldn't server hop if certain things were more regularly available. It took forever to get my second X-01 calibrated shock, and my brother actually ended up finding it for me. It could take freakin' months to find things "naturally", if ever. I've got 462 hours in game and I still haven't found the Furious shotgun of my dreams lol. Took down a level 50 3\* Mirelurk queen this morning and got a freaking level 35 1\* Mutant Slayer Leather leg. I mean really.  
---
Real talk fam is there a way to complete Overseer's mission? Its been bugged for me for forever. I have every holotape etc
---
Hi, I'm looking for Marine Armor Helmet, can u help me please? :) 
---
I provide you the materials, could you create 5/10? I want to learn the project by recycling them ;)
---
Except I didn't say "THIS AM BAD" 
---
I said, and now for the fourth time. **His numbering is awful**
---
Look where he labeled number one. Camp Venture. Where's #2? East of Flatwoods. #3? West Tek.  #4? His markers are all over the place, and on top of that they're in a small red font over a busy background.
---
Maps are only good if they're easily readable. His numbering is awful, the coloring is awful, the map is awful. 
---
Ugh that's so sad. 
---
This happens when you don't use mule(s) and you locate a lot of junk on you (Pack Rat) and not in the stash.
---
400, 600, 800... nm...
---
Yeah, there's normally a letter/note nearby telling you what they're about. 
---
In the Mire?
---
I'm currently trying to build mine on the toxic river north of Morgantown. I was finding the place to be peaceful and quiet. Comming from the river south of the dam were my camp was frequently attacked by muties, commies and scorched.
---
Alrighty but I'm going to assume it's gonna work well now! 
---
Imagine if they made us relearn plans or require mutations.
---
We should be friends. Keep an eye out for antinickel. 
---
Also: Moscow mules are a solid backup plan. 
---
Ew
---
These days, I don't think anyone will ever be upset about hearing from any major game studio, "we've decided to delay the release in order to fix issues we found." 
---
Shit post.
---
Hi, are u on PC? I'm looking for Marine Armor Helmet, can u help me please? :) IGN: raizo_ita
---
This!
---
They said it's coming in a future update
---
my favorite is the orange enclave power armor from fallout 2, i would buy it in a heart beat if bethesda added it
---
Yea but how boring would that be!!?? Lol.. That‚Äôs the first thing I thought tho as far as maybe a party chat. There is a dude who charges 500 caps and can do it in 15-25 minutes! So there‚Äôs gotta be a lot more players that have a team like his so I think it could be done.  And honestly for accuracy and time sake that‚Äôs probably the best way to do it. ( waiting in the launch room that is)
---
I've had radrats attacking the turret itself and it just sits there. I now just don't have turrets. I can build more stuff and not get mad that they don't work. 
---
I can imagine... Building a large structure across his path with ramp up and then making it fall in a pen like enclosed area.
---
One time i was at the airport workshop and Grahm just stood there and kept talking, heard all his little stories.
---
Nice work. Thanks for sharing.
---
Just a small suggestion: bigger (and clearer) numbers would help‚Ä¶ I needed to zoom the map in to titanic levels to read the numbers.
---
Good points. It shouldn't have taken until your fourth post to actually raise them.
---
You have to have Animal Friend and Wasteland Whisperer at max level, and it only randomly works with certain spawned mobs. I've gotten it to work with 2 deathclaws and a sloth so far. You can only have one at a time, though. And they're permanently yours until they're killed or the game loses them. You can't get rid of them, they take way too much camp budget, and they agro everything. Sometimes even if they die, they come back. I had one deathclaw come back like 5 times over 2 weeks before finally going away for the last month or so.   
---
RIP Steve. 
---
Animal Friend?? I haven‚Äôt seen that in the Perks list - is it Charisma?
---
You can tell if both bullets hit by seeing how much damage you do. If it‚Äôs half. Then you only had one bullet hit. 
---
If it‚Äôs non then both missed and so on. 
---
I'd like to see people dropping nukes in seemingly mundane spots.  
---
Half the fun is running around, wondering why the hell they chose *that* spot.
---
I said his numbering was bad in my first post. If you couldn't comprehend what that meant that's your problem. 
---
So, PC shouldn‚Äôt have it because it‚Äôs hard to use on console? Gotcha.
---
Can we get an in-game mic test please? I can‚Äôt tell if the game selected the correct audio input device or not so don‚Äôt know if people can hear me or not or are not responding to due whatever language I‚Äôm trying etc.
---
How/where do you find the number of hours in game? Is there a stats page I haven‚Äôt seen?
---
That sounds like a treasure location?
---
Got you beat on bad rng. 5 sbq fight and here's what I got
---
1.  1* junkies salvaged assaultron head
---
2.  1* junkies rolling pin
---
3.  1* junkies board
---
4.  1* cloaking leather leg (don't remember which leg)
---
5.  1* junkies walking cane
---
Not even joking, wish to hell I was...lol
---
&gt; Scrap hats
---
Team Fortress 3 confirmed!
---
Yeah, they're both under Charisma. And yes, I ended up something like 15% over my budget when I had my Deathclaw. I'm not sure if different tamed animals take up different percentages. 
---
It also took 4 DAYS for the budget to go back to "normal" after the deathclaw was killed and finally stopped randomly showing back up. Which means 15% of my budget was unusable for freaking weeks. I submitted a ticket to Bethesda and they didn't help at all. "are you sure your anti-virus is letting the game work?" " is your rig capable of playing the game?" \*rolls eyes\*
---
The second bullet from two shot does not deal full damage.
---
It's in the challenge tab somewhere. World, I think? 
---
I think crafting it is better. All you need is dogwood, which is north near the water park. All the trees with whiteish blossoms are dogwood. Just don't mass scrap your stuff. It scraps the dogwood into useless wood. And then you just need coal. Using woodchucker for more dogwood and then super duper =profits 
---
What‚Äôs an example of the Perk cards to take to make this most effective?
---
Unless you're a raider. Then it's absolutely a quest to hijack any supply drop you see.
---
Haha, right? Half the time I'm on an SBQ I can't even loot her when she dies. 
---
Yeah that's what I ment
---
Lol, used to happen to me about 1 in 3 fights
---
Claiming workshop in current state is walking around with KILL ME painted on your back. Random market-legendary-clad dudebro(s) will take a moment to see if you're baiting or just silly enough, then they'll kill you and take over.
---
Workshop PvP is a failed design. There is absolutely no merit to take over unless you are sure you can hold off attackers, and if you're locked and loaded, you don't need workshops. This might see a change in survival mode, but in current adventure mode? No thanks. I'll loot stuffs myself.
---
You don't need Wasteland Whisperer maxed.
---
I've managed to tame a Mirelurk King with just Animal Friend.
---
Is this like when you have a say, combat rifle, you loot another combat rifle, and it selects the new one when you hit the hot key? Cause if that's what we're talking about OMG WTF.  This has happened to me on PC numerous times and it suuuuucks. 
---
I think it'd also help if the numbering had black outlining.
---
Really? That's good to know. It only ever seems to pop up when I have both on, but if you don't need both that's great news. 
---
What‚Äôs the Level 50 achievement?
---
Make the swimming pool require something crazy like 200 concrete and 400 purified water.
---
Just out of curiosity... Has anyone attempted to nuke the SBQ?  Could be a quick way to kill her. 
---
I‚Äôm a customer that payed his hard earned money for a product he can‚Äôt use in a way it‚Äôs meant to be. 
---
The said product is getting fixed a bit over a period of time and the main issue isn‚Äôt getting fixed after 2 months. 
---
Now I‚Äôm sitting here reading all those comments about how nice of the developers it is, that they FINALLY do their job. 
---
What about you? What if you would give your boss the result of your work and it would be unfinished, full of errors and the same nes who your work was made for, can‚Äôt work with it?
---
Do you think he would gently pat you and say ‚Äûpls just fix it within the next months okay?‚Äú
---
And after every small step, week after week, he would come and praise you. 
---
My friend, we are not talking about a 10 man group of indie developers. 
---
We are talking about a big, rich company that ignores their own flaws (within the engine), sold a faulty product which still is in a bad condition, fixes their shit in a way that is insulting and is getting ‚Äûdick sucked‚Äú by their fans, who just eat the shit that is served for them. 
---
Look st this sub without heart shaped glasses. 
---
Almost every post is a piece of advice or an improvement proposal to the devs. day after day! this look like a good Game to you? 
---
I loved fallout 3/new Vegas and played 4 about 3 times, because they were just nice. They‚Äôve had their flaws, yes, but it was never that broken. 
---
Who the fuck do I think I am? 
---
I am a customer that got assraped by a multimillion dollar company who doesn‚Äôt get (or maybe doesn‚Äôt even want) their shit together and    still can‚Äôt deliver! 
---
It's cute that you guys think it wont be buggy now. :p
---
Years ago when on pc I used to find playing in window mode reduced my lag, I dunno if it's still a thing now.
---
What's the point of this post of showing us a spot if you don't want to show us the spot..?
---
Also might explode in your face! :p
---
My man, I'm still not convinced *you* comprehended what you meant. Or did you think nobody would notice if you just copied the criticisms my questions suggested and claim them as your own?
---
What did I just read...
---
I‚Äôll reveal the location in time, I really want to know if others have found it or if I‚Äôm the first, after work tomorrow I‚Äôll edit the original post to its location 
---
civil war suits sell for around 15 cap each and only cost one gold and cloth to make
---
Launch some nukes while you wait it's actually pretty fun and good for farming legendaries depending on where you launch. Farming legendaries seem to be the real end game for right now and it's pretty fun to gamble so to speak with the gear.   
---
And nukes are pretty simple.  
---
1. Get a Nuclear Key Card  
---
2. Go into the Silo and just follow the quest  
---
3. Come to reddit for the nuke codes and you're done. 
---
You can't be serious.
---
Interesting. Maybe they still scale the HP but not the damage resistance now. It used to be really easy with two people.
---
Yes I know. I was giving an example of how to tell. If the damage is lower than normal then only one hit. 
---
Just ramblings during loading screens tbh
---
I feel for you. That‚Äôs one hella long load screen...
---
It still costs resources, and a lot of people don't bother to blueprint or can't because they used building tricks like floating railings to make their CAMP look right, so you can't PLACE it even if it is blueprinted....
---
According to my pornhub research I disagree /s
---
Yes, I am on PC and can help. IGN: jchamlin
---
Oh man this sounds awesome! Makes me wish I played on PS4, but alas I‚Äôm an Xbox chickadee! (LadyRotRoh for anyone on Xbox wanting to do this!)
---
You don‚Äôt realize how incredibly entitled you sound. Like you are so important that you only deserve the best of the best and your time is way too precious to be wasted on anything other than a perfect masterpiece, anything else is trash and doesn‚Äôt deserve you respect.
---
This game has plenty of issues but it‚Äôs not crap, it‚Äôs decent, a lot of folks are finding enjoyment in it and it‚Äôs probably going to improve a lot. 
---
Nobody, NOBODY forced you to pay full price for it as soon as it came out. I saw it yesterday in store for 12 euros (that‚Äôs even less in dollars).
---
I prefer Glengoolie Black
---
I have it on good authority that when they fixed adrenal reaction, the radworms bug came back.
---
That‚Äôd definitely help lots, some kind of prompt like ‚Äújoining this player‚Äôs team will result in you gaining a bounty of ‚Äòx‚Äô , join anyways?‚Äù 
---
I‚Äôm LadyRotRoh and play on Xbox if you ever want to hang! Usually like to pair 76 with a glass of wine... or 5 ;)
---
There's a large "car windmill" in the Toxic Valley right where the rat is on this map (slightly NW of Grafton). It's a neat spot! I put my camp there.
---
Works fine on PS4; i have them shoot at stuff a kilometer away. You're not using nooby unpowered turrets are you.
---
i'm online :)  if I provide you the materials, could you create 5/10? I want to learn the project by recycling them ;)
---
Yea, there is a lot of problems and Bethesda isn't fixing them nor even trying. Game is still total garbage as quality wise, but we should still enjoy it and close our eyes from the problems. If you see anyone in the Reddit who find bugs or glitches with the game just down vote them. All game problems will be solved by ignoring them.
---
But basically have people play a game of "Guess where my camp is" first right? ü§î

---
If you've played solo this whole time, I suggest joining up with others &amp; check out team play.  I'll be on xb1 Wednesday evening(if that's your console).  If not, check with some randoms on your server.  Trade plans, look for a lower level new player &amp; give them a little back up. They will appreciate it.  
---
For example, the wife (lvl 148) &amp; I (lvl 129) noticed a lvl 5 near Vault 76 so we fast traveled to them so we could drop ammo, aid, &amp; some junk for them.  After they finally took what was offered, we jumped to Gorge Junkyard to a lvl 7. We helped take the junkyard for them &amp; set up resource extractors.  Then we made a set of deep pocketed leather armor, dropped more ammo, aid, &amp; other stuff. After that, we jumped servers &amp; kept playing.  
---
We didn't ask for anything in return.  It was like being Robin Hood for a minute.  
---
To be honest, I think the criticisms I suggested and you copied pretty well ran the gamut. But you could have meant any one of those things, or you might have meant none of them and simply been a troll. Without elaborating--without, as the other dude said, offering *constructive* criticism--your post was pretty much meaningless except as the pitiable manifestation of your continuing teenage angst.
---
I'm glad I was able to help you find your words.
---
No, I only have a marker on the Whitespring fissure, none of the others.  
---
The sonic attack doesn't do much if you have the Dense torso mod. A lot of the other stuff will wreck you unless you have full Sentinel gear though, and you'll often respawn inside the nuke zone.
---
Stealth won't do much in an SBQ fight because there will almost always be someone closer and unstealthed. You'll do more damage against the queen with a dpm rifle, so handmade &gt; lever &gt; hunting.
---
Serious question here and more of just curious how you‚Äôll handle this. 
---
What if you know get guys who identify as girls? Will you seclude them from your gang?
---
&gt; only verified stat we have cheaters only seem to make up about 1% of the player base 
---
You don't know how the ban waves works.
---
To be honest, I think you're an idiot. 
---
&gt; This game is to PVE orientated so not as much reason to cheat or need to.
---
So naive, so sweet, so innocent.
---
How many times do people need to shoot a predicable AI model with no surprises before they get bored? PVP is the only way to enjoy the game at it's current state. 
---
Right. Especially if I assume that one single day extra will make zero difference in terms of the end product quality. Can only help to finalize some testing to understand potential known issues or blocker bugs.
---
Stay away from higher lvl areas, dummy.
---
A simple message indicating the workshop is being contested. Options are challenge contest or forfeit. 
---
It‚Äôs not hard to program something like that and the author is right. They shouldn‚Äôt be forced into PvP if they aren‚Äôt interested in it.
---
If you forfeit then you wait and see if they are their for the workshop or just farming players for caps. 
---
There is a sound mechanic. It's a fact.
---
I've thought the same thing! 
---
In my head he's just some guy whos been cursed to appear to help travelers in need, uncontrollably materializing in front of them, gun in hand. 
---
So sometimes he'll be in the shower, or sleeping, or taking a shit, and be warped in front of a raging Deathclaw, forcing him to fight these things totally naked. 
---
You're a dullard and we're done here
---
ok thx ;) i wait you. how much for one? I need 2 :)
---
What's worse is when they decide your own base is now the enemy. 
---
Twice last week this happened - I had to remove fences, couches, and my piano. 
---
Did you film and report the player?
---
I'm sure you have pure intentions...
---
I'll do two for the price of one: 300 caps. Same service/price as the original poster received. :)
---
Dope!! I‚Äôll add tomorrow! (:
---
Nah. On my main character I triggered this glitch regularly. I hated it because it often hides your reflex sight, but it's obviously very powerful too.
---
I always wore a piece of Cloaking armor because the other two stars were good, so that might be related.
---
Give it away like everyone else. Don't be greedy. Enjoy selling NOTHING.
---
What platform?
---
One guy went into my foundation once. He was jumping up and could see his head through the floor. I tried same spot and couldn't get in there. I dunno, probably a way to do it.
---
PlayStation, I'm edit and add to the post, thanks
---
I'd ditch the X01 for ultracite or t51. The price you'd pay for them mods for X01 would more or less get you the plans for either of the other two. Also it sounds like you're running a bloodied build? If so then you want emergency protocols on your PA which like the shocks mods is super rare or super expensive.
---
I want to kill the inhabitants and destroy all of their belongings. 
---
I'm usually too shy to even consider trading, but I have a ridiculous amount of ammo I never use.  
---
Whenever I get around to it, I'd just sell 500 for 250. 
---
 
---
Ammo I use, if someone was desperate for it, I might sell some for 1 cap per.
---
It's about 15$ on G2A. 
---
Accuracy is way down on ts weapons too. Not a good mod for vats.
---
Thank you
---
I really appreciate your help :) thank you very much!
---
I wait u in game ;) see u soon

I think I just fought you for mount blair.

I agree with you (pheakelmatters) drops are useless. I use to think the drops were based on what level you were.....wrong answer. I am level 175 and did a drop request and got a level 10 hunting rifle. I mean......SERIOUSLY! I don‚Äôt the drops anymore. I dumped all of my requisition holo tapes (bottom of a lake).
---
There are still active duping exploits. There is no reset button on the duping economy, unfortunately. 
---
No it's not? At least, I don't see it. Only Tricentennial edition for $55.
---
Plus I'm not sure if G2A is worth risking the $15. Really shady business.
---
Try Kinguin then. Yeah it is shady but, the game is worth like 15, 20 bucks so it might be worth a risk. 
---
Don't bother. This used to work, but the BoS and Deep Pocketed plans don't show up at any vendors since patch 6.
---
booooooo
---
Yeah, I am pretty annoyed that this bug sill exists. The bug has been there since beta. I picked up a 2* assaultron head this morning and thought 'surely they have fixed this bug by now.'.... *fires*.... nope... there goes 500 fusion cells.
---
As you load into the game sometimes player placed objects take a second to load. So you have a friend baby sit the CAMP, you leave server, rejoin on your baby sitting friend, fast travel to them as soon you can open your map, and you might be able to walk through the foundations before they load into the world for you. 
---
There is no such thing as an impenetrable CAMP. 
---
Day after.
---
Todd did it again!  The mad man!
---
Did you not read my original response to this?  I was planning on taking a chill day anyway.  I'll be watching movies and playing fallout regardless of the update.
---
This is an outrage. I'm going to create a clickbait youtube video and pay off my months rent over this debacle. Shame on you Bethesda.
---
I'm online. Go ahead and join me.
---
Well at queen, I've tested a ts gatlin against a aa gatlin gun with the same buffs, got adren up and switched when the queen was down. The aa is better, noticeably faster on the grey damage. I ran the numbers myself
---
For a easy example give mob 100 health, 50 damage reduction.
---
100 damage anti armor weapon does 75.
---
Nerfed TS (25%), does 63 and is bad for vats (low accuracy).
---
The aa is better as the damage resistance goes up. TS is still better than 10% while mutated and 30% vs scorched will be on par with aa and surpass it in whitesprings probably. You take the same mob at 25 damage reduction and you get 94 from a TS, 87 from aa, and 99 from vs scorched.

I built my house in WS as well, but I found a small pond on the golf course. It's just outside of the nuke zone if WS were to get nuked (literally a few feet walk from my house to get inside) and a minute walk from the main farming area. There are a few different water sources in WS just not as close as where yours would have been. The pond is nice, though, and allows you to build a nice house. It also has mirelurks and sting wings that spawn (I've accepted them as my neighbors) for meat. 
---
I think they shouldn't have made the whole river a no-build zone, but instead made it so that you can't build your camp too close as to have an issue with missile camps.
---
I just mentioned this in another sub this was posted to. Not colorblind, but nearly impossible to read (on mobile).
---
(Gets lawn chair and beer)
---
Just here for the comments...
---
Same here. To blame is Strange In Numbers in my case. I get a 500 damage nerf on some weapons for some reason, going from 500 damage to 1000+ if I unequip it. 
---
I think the positive effects not showing up is just an interface bug though. 
---
I've tried a normal Lever Action Rifle and Adrenal Reaction kicks in eventhough it doesn't display it in the Effects tab. Bloodied Lever Action Rifle works just fine but without Strange In Numbers. Works sometimes and it doesn't work most of the time so I'll just leave this unequipped for the time-being.
---
XD
---
Ones fun friends run the exact build with bloodied hunting rifle. He has min maxed it so well his DPS is 1K standing and not sneaking. 
---
The only creature he doesn‚Äôt one shot is the Queen. Everything else üí•
---
Bloodied Unyielding build as well. 
---
Yeah I know that spot. We will probably be neighbors  as I don't think they will fix it. Thanks for reading my rant.
---
Just avoid East Kanhawa (sp?) station. No notes. Just a really really sad scene...
---
Its 2 AM and its genuinely what I expect as I play the game.
---
No not anymore. They‚Äôve become rare plan spawns and event rewards.

If you actually liked MMO's you'd simply team up on a big pacifist server. If you're the Amish of video gaming you still have to circle your wagons because we're all making a story together.

---
Well, in the event you do move, welcome to the neighborhood! Not a worry about the rant, as well. I haven't built a missile base, but I definitely understand where you're coming from. Hope everything works out for you!
---
If I could make a suggestion about the numbering. How about labelling regions with a letter, followed by the number that corresponds to a location within that region.  For example, the forest region locations are A1, A2, A3... and so on, and toxic valley would be B1, B2...  It would make things just a bit faster to find knowing what general part of the map a point is on. 
---
Good work.. My character just invested in New boots in readiness for new exploration.. Happy trails!

Really happy to see all the support for the delay. Hopefully this will encourage Bethesda a bit and show them that the fanbase really doesn't mind delayed product as long as it's worth the wait. Take all the time you need, guys. We appreciate the updates and seriously just want some quality updates.
---
Meh, set a timer on your phone, and play pipboy games until its time. Immersive as hell right there, just like waiting around at work IRL.
---
But seriously BGS, can I have Grognak and the Ruby Ruins for my phone? That'd be soooo doooooope.

You're offering nothing apart from being annoying.. Suggest something better or toddle off and go play with your Lego

What is the difference in lvls between your regular and legendary?

Haha more than agree!

I feel like this has gotten significantly worse recently for me. It used to only happen when my weapon broke, now it seems to happen all the time. If I repair it, if I sell other stuff, not sure what triggers it really.

I can help you out, I've got a full set of marine plans you can have or I can make the armour and mod it for you.

They are both level 45 so I'm confused
---
I'm gonna need a bigger build budget
---
mutations seem super random when they decide to work or not like speed demon for example sometimes just doesn't want to work on some log ins and all my weapons take ages to reload
---
You can still pick cards from strength. Just pick a point from PECIAL and then after you select that point don‚Äôt pick a card from its perks, look at the bottom of your screen to find the button that scrolls over to the different special perk cards (Xbox is RB/LB I think) and scroll over to STR and pick whatever card you want from there. 
---
Change your mind? Probably not. But go check out the Anthem subreddit and tell me who is a better community.
---
Ah, not sure, but was at higher levels (now 108)
---
it seems to go way beyond just strange in numbers, that negative effect for me w/ Strange in Numbers happens if I'm in a group but the only one mutated, suddenly gun damage is worse.  
---
But if I swap from all my BoS bolstering combat armor &amp; supporting perks that add more dmg resistance to say, a hazmat suit, everything seems to hit me for basically the same amount of damage.  
---
The only MAJOR reduction in damage I see is going from BoS Combat armor to power armor, then suddenly things barely touch me (but then I can't use my power fist for whatever logic that is) plus I hate being in power armor. It seems like the game left this cool opening to make yourself real strong in regular armor using perks/legendary abilities...but they just don't feel like they're working. Already confirmed for sure that the +25 RAD legendary doesn't do a damn thing, doesn't feel like Bolstering does, either.

Y'know this is a prime example why reddit doesn't deserve a manager. There are official forums. What, are we going to link the other threads with 100's of upvotes and 1000's of comments? OP wants us to redo all that work, repost everything, argue over every tiny detail again.
---
It's just a matter of time until these guys, the pacifists, the perk card whiners, or the "rejoin server" guys start with vote bots or multiple accounts to try and bully influence from Beth.

@ OP please reply to these 1000's of comments:

---
What do you mean by bashing? I'm familiar with the basher perk only.
---
Isnt the best way to get that to nuke corn?
---
For example, in my Excavator power armor, it says my DMG resistance is 331 total...but out of it with my BoS Combat armor (3 pieces bolstering 2 unyeilding) says I'm at 545 total DMG resistance...SUBSTANTIALLY more than my PA...yet things without a DOUBT hit me harder in my BoS armor than when I'm in PA. Something isn't right.
---
There are other unmarked fissure sites, like the one behind Fort Defiance or the General's Steakhouse.

I think that's the kind they mean...?
---
That is a very big if..
---
Farm Glowing Mass, Hardened Mass, and High-Radiation Fluid at Whitesprings, get Violet Flux with the Green Thumb perk equipped from Fissure Prime nukes, the mutated ferns turn into Flash Ferns which give Violet Flux, as do the scattered carnivorous pitcher plants and a couple of tarberry spawns in the area. Best way I've found, anyway
---
Good idea, but the lettering should be F = Forest, A = Ash Heap, T = Toxic Valley, S = Savage Divide, M = Mire, and C = Cranberry Bog. That way you don't have to refer to a legend to know which letter corresponds to which area.
---
A really big thank you
---
Exactly what the pips say:
---
If not in combat, +100% vats accuracy at +50% ap cost
---
Bashing damage increased by 40%
---
+1 agility 
---
But my basic level 45 with the same mod components I swear did 170 damage.  This legendary does 155. Had I known I was gonna get confused I wouldn't have dismantled my basic lever action I used before
---
A realy big thank you
---
dont know what power armor you are making them for but you can always buy the mods from vendors, thats how i got mine for the excavator PA
---
Shit post
---
I wish there were achievement/gameplay based ways to get every item in the game. Make them as difficult or laborious as you wish, but just SOME guaranteed way to get stuff. Make me slay a 100 scorchbeasts to get the X-01 jetpack plans. Just anything but hoping for the best for the umpteenth time running into the same vendor that just \*happens\* to be relatively far from any spawn point.
---
I really don't want to server hop. I tried it a few times but it's so boring it's not how I want to spend my game time. However, I would like to have some avenue of eventually getting the gear currently only available through low chance. I think I understand why game devs increasingly add randomness everywhere, but that doesn't mean I have to like it. As a player, putting content behind difficulty/gameplay/item gates is vastly better than putting it behind probability gates or grind gates.
---
Yes, I really have no complaints on content for the game.  I consider 200+ hours a very good amount of content for any game.  Very few games actually offered that much content for me.
---
Same. For me dying and respawning seems to do it but it's no solution of course.
---
You can't tame them as of now, there is a list of tameable creatures on the wiki

Ok, maybe I misinterpreted the post.  I thought it was a guide in order to provide information to those who are struggling with food?

Have you seen Clown Daddy's bloatfly army?  
---
Just roll around parts of Appalachia with your own bloatfly babies bobbing around.
---
Thanks! Hopefully it'll go on sale with the new update.
---
Hm. That's quite interesting. For me it doesn't matter if anyone is mutated or not; tested both things and when I shared the Strange In Numbers perk with a buddy of mine who was mutated as well (2 player team) he also got his damage nerfed. When I stopped sharing it, he also had his damage back to normal.  
---
Something clearly isn't working nicely together.
---
Btw, tried being naked without any perks and any possible things but the issue still persisted. For me as I've said it's Strange In Number's fault.
---
Agreed on this.  I think it was because the supply drops had content for each person who looted it?  Maybe the intent was for 1 person?   Just change it so it empties for everyone after the first loot or it disappears?   Remove the locks.  I don't mind if someone takes the supply box I triggered, the most valuable thing inside is water/food.  Everything else in those are garbage.
---
I have around 200 lol
---
If you hit Whitesprings and the train station across the street and get the power substation you can get 6 with green thumb, but you've got to get it all. 
---
but the loot was not even good.  Most of it was worse that what you can pick up everywhere you go.  I would much rather pick up clipboards/fans than anything in that box.
---
Delete this.
---
Thank you for raising this as a concern mate. Will share this with the dev team now
---
Out of power armor and at about 30% hp my bloodied build character has 412 dr 426 er, used to take very little damage before the last patch, and now gets rapidly pasted. At 20% hp it's closer to 500/500 dr/er, same result. Almost equal to x-01 power armor, but hardly does diddly vs .308 or 5.56 super mutants. Not even comparable to the protection offered by Excavator PA, which has dramatically lower DR/ER values. The built in PA buff hardly accounts for the difference. Something broke with the last patch in regards to armor.
---
All supply drops need to lose the locks.  Just make them lootable once if they want to go that route.   
---
no problemo 
---
I think you're confusing the demographic that play the game with the community that actively engages in discourse. The community on Reddit isn't the FO76 community as a whole. One part is people who play or have played the game and voice their opinions and the other are fans actively helping the game by immersing themselves in the idea of innovation for the future of FO76 by either continuing to engage with out exploits or stress to the server or offering constructive criticism. 
---
Don't like how pvp is right now? Then don't do it. Don't like how people treat you? Then ignore them. Don't like how shit gets nerfed? Well, tough shit it happens. They can do what they want to do, you do what you want to do. Why make a post crying about it all on here, we won't fix your feelings for you.
---
It's a conspiracy you people will repost this EVERY SINGLE DAY.

They already announced prestige that will change perks. Your role play challenge for today is you're not allowed to change perks at all - find a team member to lock pick or weapon artisan.

Some people say technical data, some say digging up treasure maps. Maybe tomorrow‚Äôs patch will address it. Or at least make it more clear where to find them.

I thought the same in the beginning. But I noticed something strange today. After I have found nice spot for my C.A.M.P with lead node next to it. I started building some necessities and a huge level 80 flying cancer rat decided to pay me a visit.
---
I yelled 'mi casa es mi casa, senor' waking my wife and by her look,i guess she expected the Spanish inquisition. But the rat continued to wreck my generators and extractor, so I decided to jump server. For the first time in my gaming experience, I reconnected to the same server, just in time to see the previously mentioned application's exploding into smithereens, while my level 30 ass running to Monogah town. Damn rats I will exterminate you.
---
I would! VeraMae is my ign. Pop in anytime! I only  know a couple other girls on here, and they don't play much lately...

Most of the time I‚Äôm frightened and shoot, at them.

I‚Äôll make the effort to look for the note.

Fwiw, there‚Äôs a similar scene in that movie, annihilation. The plants shaped like people.

I never said I didn‚Äôt like pvp. I literally said I‚Äôm all for pvp. I said it was broken but I‚Äôm not bitching about how it‚Äôs broken. I‚Äôm bitch about how people are exploiting the brokenness. Also I‚Äôm not bitching about trading I am also a trader. I‚Äôm bitching about how people are literally charging people 20K for outfits. 
---
You literally read what you wanted to read and chose to ignore everything else I said. You obviously want an argument because you‚Äôre probably one of the people I‚Äôm describing. Trying to argue with you is a waste of my time when your not even going to fully read my original post. Goodbye. 
---
I hope they let us keep our perk deck.  Would be kinda sweet to have an ultra low level with full bloodied mess or whatever.  Early access to those normally level locked perks would help a lot with leveling speed/tedium as I imagine we won't be able to redo the quests again for xp.
---
Could have been. I tried to take it, because a lvl 100-something had it, but he was hiding somewhere the whole time and so I could never find him and take the shop since it was stuck in "contested". I ended up fighting 2 people who were his teammates I really didn't want to, since they were only around lvl30-50ish, weren't worth the caps and were too low of a level for what I considered an honorable fight. They DID actually manage to kill me a couple times when I got really careless and under-estimated them. Then a bunch of 200+ people showed up and started wrecking them, and I contested the shop a second time, picked a few off, and got the hell out of there after getting ahead on caps. If that was what you saw then it might have been me, haha.
---
I would advise you not to split your choices so early. Multi-builds set you back pretty hard when you are building a perk deck since you are splitting your choices between two damage sources. Instead of maxing out the damage your rifle can do you are cutting it in half to increase another source. Get a setup you like for a weapon, find the minimum you need to maintain that setup and then see what you can do with something else with what you have left. This way you won't be stuck with two crappy choices for damage and ruin your game experience.
---
I can easily prove that YOU are toxic.
---
You're L100; you've probably done it all so now you want content. The logical purpose of these forums is for you to simply say: this is my gamer tag and schedule let's do workshop PVP with friends so there is content aside from griefing!
---
Everyone's problem solved right there, but instead forums are just for whining to you.
---
Do you see what's on the front page? 2 whiney posts about "server rejoin" that's been reposted 100X and just now the daily repost about perk cards. Getting a baby sitter from Bethesda was one of the worst things that could happen to this forum since the mods are too lazy to delete reposts it will become daily bullying.
---
You're also toxic if you won't just gather a pacifist clan; but you need mommy Beth to do it for you. Cobra Kai, never die!
---
Bought a 25p MMO with PVP but then complain when the inevitable laziness happens - toxic.
---

---
This is seriously impressive mate! Well done. A few locations I haven't explored yet

Let's be honest, the stuff was too strong and ya'll still suffering from a hangover :P

---
Here's the alternative take : Do you want Flatwoods gank squad? Because this is how you get Flatwoods gank squad.
---
Most "Death = Wipe" survival games have loots scattered everywhere evenly. Hot spots exist, but in no case you are forced to stick around certain location. Fallout 76 is *full of these.* I can already picture chameleon snipers taking potshots on Flatwoods church belltower. That and landmines on Overseer's C.A.M.P.
---
Survival mode should be a full-scale monster mash where you come loaded with stuffs, use / lose said stuffs and get back home with different bunch of stuffs. 
---
Forcing everyone to start fresh again will end up as vanilla 2.0 but more player gaps. Playtime will directly affect the power level- You have absolutely no way to go up against people who team up, play 8 hours a day and get gears from market, in such environment. Good luck surviving after level 5.
---
I would imagine it would be a trading up system. Maybe rocket league style? (5x of one tier item traded for 1x item of the next tier) maybe 3 instead of 5?
---
Honestly I feel they will reset our mutations, because if we go back to level 1 from whichever stage we go to, it would make unfortunate sense to remove them as I used to have all 18 (excluding herbivore) and the stat penalties were insane at lower levels
---
Well we find out soon, does anybody know if this first big dlc update comes with the legendary changes or is it just a trashy brewing system
---
Thank you!
---
They might not be playing it - but still a little annoyed having played full price for the game and deeming it still not worthy of such a purchase all these months on.
---
And fair play to them - the reddit shouldn't be full of everyone telling the devs how happy they are and how everything is fantastic.
---
It needs proper balance- there are people that love it clearly - and people that dont - and feel cheated (and rightfully so based on the E3 presentation vrs final product) out of their hard earned money.
---
This is not forum for discussion on what's simply fantastic about fallout 76 only, it's also a forum for discussion on why it isnt - it's a general forum for discussion on the game itself.
---
You do not have to be actively playing a game to discuss it.
---
By what you are saying, people should either post how happy they are with the game, or not post at all.
---
That's not how discussion forums work, nor is that of any real use to the developers.
---
The developers need to see complaints,and need to understand what the major issues are that put people off the title so they can plan forward to try and make corrections at a future date.
---
Progress so far on this front did not occur because everyone thought the game was great, it happened, and with some urgency at the beginning, because people thought it wasnt and were not shy stating exactly why it wasnt.
---
Same story right now with Anthem - a lot of changes have already been made due to the "complainers"
---
There is currently a boycott in progress over fundamentally called systems in the game and hopefully,as that continues to grow and get more and more attention, the developers will be forced to make corrections.
---
That's how progress is made on a title, by complaint after complaint coming to the developers attention.
---
So sorry you are not a fan of people criticising a game you love, but understand that just because you love it, doesnt mean everyone else does, and they have as much right to sound off on their feeling as you do to constantly feel the need to state how much fun you are having.
---
At the end of the day, the game will be improved thanks to those who choose to voice their complaints, and not those who criticise anyone who complains about a title that they bought with their hard earned money and actually like to play but not as it currently is (which again, is not what they were sold)
---
Hopefully that makes sense.
---
Long story short - embrace those who stand up to complain, as future improvement will be based on a lot of their feedback.
---
I was with 2 level 200's and a 60-something, fighting 3 other level 100-200 people that were openly taunting on area chat. I'm used to fighting that other crew with the loud guy on area chat. I guess it was a 4 way fight? Three teams and 1 solo (you).
---
Any case, I had fun and I'm net positive on caps after the whole shindig.
---
Rifle Gaming, who has been doing a bunch of nuke test, failed to achieve it.
---
That guy was hardcore, I always thought playing for 74 hours straight on an MMORPG was somewhat impressive when new content first dropped, but that guy went overkill.
---
On my first character I reached about level 23-24 in the first 19 hours of play but r to be honest I kind of just ran in any direction exploring and managed to kill some higher targets not knowing what to expect
---
Can you win the food inside?
---
I really hope he is not a wandering trader like Grham. Not fun walking around overencumbered with the trash loot you picked up in hope of finding him. Otherwise we can only speculate how the trading with him will work. I suppose one possibility is that he simply rerolls the item you want. As in you keep the same item and hope for better attributes. Another would be combining items, like trading two 1\* items for a new 1\*. In that case i dont think you would be able to combine lets say two 1\* for a 2\* item. Last i can think off, is the item you trade gets destroyed and you get to pick an attribute from it and reapply it to the weapon you choose. Lets say you destroy an otherwise crap explosive weapon and you keep the explosive attribut and then reapply it to your favorite instigating hunting rifle, so now you have an instigating hunting rifle.. This will eventually benefit trading cause even items with only one good attribute will have good a sell value to those searching for said attribute. Finally i dont think there would be a limit in how many times you can trade him altough it is possible to be limited in 1 trade per day especially if only one person can trade with him at any giving time.
---
Haha sure does but hence why it's on discord also

---
Yeah, and he had a buddy with a name with a bunch of O's in it. We fought them there, then they ran off. The loud guy's easy to take out with crits because he leans on his assassin+sentinel armor so hard. 
---
Originally I think we had a skirmish with you, then once I saw the loud guy I had to switch characters to my other PvP char because I knew his crew was going to roll in soon enough. We didn't quite know how long you were around. Dunno if you were there the whole time or if you left and came back.

I remember reading the announcement and it said you could take your existing character, but they suggested making a new one for that mode.

I got killed in Watoga doing the upload on the roof. When I respawn my screen is black but with all green overlay still there like tha compass and when I turned around I saw the crosshair go red when over an enemy. After dying several times, trying fast travel (the map still works fine) I had to quit the game and give up on my loot bag.
---
You are complaining about the way pvp is, and about how stuff got nerfed, and how stuff is over priced. You blame it on a toxic community and want it to change. Therefore, you do not like how it is. However, you can dislike something and like it at the same time. So I don't see how your comment has any validity here when you are the one who read my comment how you wanted it to be and not for what it actually says. And if for some reason this wasn't enough to explain it to you, then here is the dumbed down explanation of it.
---
I like pizza. I dislike under cooked pizza. That doesn't mean I hate pizza, it means I hate when the cook doesn't cook the pizza all the way. As for you, you like pvp. You dislike how the pvp is. You don't dislike pvp, you dislike how it is. I never said you dislike pvp itself, i said you dislike HOW IT IS. Go back to school if you still don't understand what I said.
---
Also, don't bother to reply. I won't find an intelligent conversation with the likes of you so I won't bother reading it anyways. I should have guessed as much fro mthe title though...so that one is on me i guess lol.
---
Lot of sad people out there.
---
^This is the way to do it. Any hardened mass, glowing mass, or high-radiation fluids I get at Prime are just a welcome bonus because I've already farmed enough to make the flux at Whitesprings (minus the cobalt and crimson and fluorescent I made there). Easy peasy. 
---
I thought the quest was later in the month as WW content was goig to be released over the next two months?
---
And i envy those who get enough paid time off to be able to piss it away on a videogame possibly releasing a patch that might not even improve the game
---
Your correct. It is a personal preference. Isn't personal preference what caused this to begin with. A few whiners couldnt deal. Honestly I just wanted to rant. Get a little feed back. Maybe some base placement suggestions. I don't have any expectations that this will change. I just miss my river. Sad I only have one picture of my old base.
---
I don't have any intention to play survival but, I think it needs a fresh start just so this sub isn't filled "wahhh, i'm sick of getting killed with duped gear" posts for weeks. It would be unbearable!

---
Did You check your internet connection? 
---
Ah Thank you my bad.
---
I just hope that the small percentage of people who are paying these stupid prices get a brain and wait for the items to come back down to a realistic price and the economy of the game will then level out to a usable one
---
It's the dumb legendaries that should be nerfed.
---
Let's say that you're relatively new to the game or took a break from the game. The oh-so-fair "Fresh start" happened one month ago and you're late to the party-
---
Then you're doomed.
---
Level 50+s roam the world with new legendaries. As soon as you hit level 5 you have to lay low and combat log just to survive. Stealth builds have better chance of surviving, but loud PA builds? Good luck dodging pulse nades and keeping up with repair costs.

The only thing this sub is capable of is downvoting.  No one is capable of engaging in a conversation with someone who is critical of this game in any way shape or form....so they downvote instead.
---
You die they get 44 caps they die they lose 15. Just farming people for caps. 
---
Sth is off with some mutations and perks.. I do not know exactly which are problematic but I do have sth weird with my stats sometimes too..
---
I dont know why everybody is making a drama out of survival mode. Just see it as it is , just a fun addition to the normal mode. You can switch between modes so why even bother making a new character. 
---
You want to pvp switch modes kill a few ppl, switch back. Nothing more nothing less.
---
Stop making a fuss about it already.
---
You're just not playing the game well. I know this sounds like a insult but all it takes is a bit of farming and a few perks. Weapon artisan and gunsmith go along way. This just may not be your kind of game. 
---
Probably not my kind of game then. I stopped at around level 50 and the game was becoming more busywork then fun.
---
Also on a desktop blown up to 200% of original size. 
---
Just impossible to read. Period.
---
Uh huh, sure you did. Any proof of this? Or that it was in fact his 14th alt account?
---
If the game had a new graphic engine and looked better maybe they could have added in all kinds of places some shadows on the ground, with no on there, just like in Hiroshima and Nagasaki where the shadows of people in their last moment were engraved into concrete and stone as they perished. That would be a nice detail i believe.
---
Diablo Paragon system is fucking awful. The only reason it doesn't destroy the entire game is because of the seasons system where they reset paragons and everyone has an equal footing.
---
The power creep on non ladder is out of the stratosphere insane. A paragon 6000 character is many hundred times more powerful than a casual or new player will ever be. That's bad game design through and through and 76 doesn't have, nor should get seasons.
---
What you asking is "lul I'm unemployed and/or bot there for I should deal 800 damage with the same gun someone does 80 damage with". 
---
Could be 'bait'.
---
You drop pacifist, slap the fella - which for extra points has no caps and no junk - next thing you know... headshot.
---
Thanks for delaying so its more polished 
---
I appreciate your candor.
---
Yeah at level 50 literally all it takes is two perk cards. You don't even have to keep them both active. 
---
It could've just been a young kid who didn't know any better?
---
Well, I don't speak Finnish, so I just tried to interpret the description in the above comment and on the Wikipedia page. 
---
On the other hand, something like "The Mysterious Cave" is a pretty cool name too ;-) 
---
The whole internet community is toxic these days lol. 
---
So that make us 2 
---
thank god, more quests to do, i was so bored
---
&gt;Ska vi supa eller ska vi snacka? 
---
I've heard it before ;-) 
---
I'm sorry, i won't be reading all of this, but since i started this game, i almost never fast travel to far away location, but i do to my camp, to vault 76, and after running to the foot of the savage divise, i fast travel to the train station. So most of my time in the game is spent running around (and building camp). 
---
looks like i‚Äôm getting a new Fallout DLC for my birthday :)
---
I know Bethesda have copped a lot of flak recently, a lot of it justified, some not. But after playing Fallout 4,76 and 3 Wolfensteins' i will give them all respect in that they really do immersion in the world of the games very well. 
---
Considering the guy would be -90 caps after this exchange I'm not sure he's farming caps...
---
Being evil has always been a play style choice. You could blow up megaton, side with cesar's legion, or lead a gang of raiders to take over the commonwealth. I don't think everyone is obligated to play the game in one specific way, like helping each other and singing kumbaya. You want to help me defend my workshop? Cool, thanks. You want to fight me for my workshop? Cool, thanks for the caps and junk. The wasteland is lawless.

Corn Soup Addict üòä
---
Love this idea I‚Äôm just coming up to level 40 and can‚Äôt shoot for shit but I‚Äôll throw my all rise into the mix if you‚Äôll have me. I‚Äôll add tonight, look out for redybrek 
---
Some people just aren't that smart. 
---
&gt; It's the dumb legendaries that should be nerfed. 
---
Nothing else needs nerfing! Unless those balance patches only apply to survival.
---
&gt;Let's say that you're relatively new to the game or took a break from the game. The oh-so-fair "Fresh start" happened one month ago and you're late to the party-Then you're doomed. 
---
That point would apply even if there wasn't a fresh start. So i'm not too sure what you're getting at there.
---
They want to PvP people and no one is interested so they annoy people into PvP even if they know the odds are stacked against them to ever win. They would rather die over and over again PvPing then no PvP at all. They may have even made a low level alt to increase the chances of you shooting back. If they kill you 1 out of 20 they would feel like they won.
---
My advice is to completely ignore their existence and don't shoot back. Eventually they will move onto someone else. I've had a guy do this for about 10 minutes before he got bored and moved on but they will move on eventually. You can also server hop of course.
---
I read the title of the post wrong... I read it without the "L" in "titles".
---
So of course I was intrigued and had to see...
---
Fair enough
---
Awesome map! I too, couldn‚Äôt see the red numbers at first, but there are already some great suggestions on how to improve that. This is in my saved posts now. Gonna use this next time I‚Äôm in the wasteland. Can‚Äôt wait to go visit Murgle. 
---
Yeah but the point isnt its quality, its that its easy to get... Beth just doesnt want us to get all dem 50 caps without grinding for an hour or two...
---
Actually I beg to differ. Melee is so OP in this game that you can very capably make a hybrid build incorporating it. I personally run a semi rifle/melee sneak build.
---
My rifles actually do about the same dps as my melee until my sneak bonus runs out, at which point melee pretty much does 3x the damage. 
---
Haha nice oneüòâ
---
Im on PS4. Been playing since day 1. Anytime someone talks through a mic, they have a little icon over their head.
---
If i meet someone with a mic on, thats how i know to turn mine on.
---
And I goa butt koad if ballistic fiber off him!!
---
Store it then place it again
---
Yeah any funny would be awesome as well like Belching, Smelly etc
---
What level are you?
---
43. The other player didn‚Äôt even render yet until after I died 
---
I wish I could remember where but somewhere I found a cute little bear with binoculars,  and a tree with initials carved in it overlooking a town and I got a in game screenshot. 
---
What makes it so interesting is that the spot is in an area that you wouldn't normally go to. It's just a random spot above a cliff, nothing special unless you view it from just the right spot. I'll try uploading a pic later. I only happened upon it after scaling down a cliff trying to save time to get into some town. 
---
That is actually a really really good question now that you mention it. We have Appalachia, an entire region based upon automation and infinite manufacturing nuke silos. Why didn't they just use the robots on the chinese? 
---
Noce one!
---
I did yes.  With video I took from my phone.  
---
Any pictures?
---
Also UPDATE:  ran into MORE griefer losers tonight doing the same exploit.  I‚Äôm seriously dumbfounded how they‚Äôre able to do this Bethesda.  It‚Äôs 100% well beyond the amount of time you‚Äôre supposed to come in and out of invisibility every time, even with stealth boys, even with cloaking armor when you‚Äôre attacked.  It‚Äôs truly maddening and needs to be looked at.  
---
It should get easier after 50lv. But aldo keep in mind that farming is an important component of FO ecosystem. 
---
50
---
I agree.  My character is thicc when I wear it. 
---
'Fresh start' all sounds fair and square but either you know its a terrible idea and you L2P'ed already, or you think it would give amy advantage to casual players instead of throwing them into a pit with rancor and without even ugly bone or a rock to defend themselves.
---
Yeah, a boy when he wears the nukagirl suit
---
Nah y'all need to make new characters for survival mode. I'd rather not play in the regular mode and have to deal with players who built up for survival, played on it a bit, then came back over to grief other players and me. You should have to make a new character for survival mode, separate the two. No one should be allowed to get a headstart.
---
Nuke silo for Silo alpha is in those small bumps to the east of pleasant valley station. I think towards the bottom, probably in the group of bumps 2nd from the bottom.
---
Just to the west, maybe north west of the butterfly picture in the toxic valley is the destroyed house where you can find a special item.
---
Just north of point pleasant, where the picture shows those mounds, are the TNT domes where you can find special items.
---
i'm sorry what? how was any amount of caps "hours of grinding" at level 1?
---
Each bullet rolls hit chance independently. One bullet does 100% damage. One bullet does 25% damage.
---
So you're not always getting the full 125% damage if you hit, this is especially noticeable at low hit chance because it could roll one of four outcomes:
---
A) None hit.
---
B) 25% hit.
---
C) 100% hit.
---
D) 100% and 25% hit.
---
Where most people expect (because this is normal VATS behaviour) :
---
A) None hit. 
---
B) 100% and 25% hit. 
---
Yeah my internet never has any problems with any other games :/ wired connection too
---
I can imagine the likely chosen system will be each time you prestige, you get to permanently +1 a SPECIAL point and can add an extra perk card.
---
Nope, it's toxic. Suuuuuper toxic. Any time I mention or complain about some asshole/griefer that I had an interaction with, sometimes a teammate or people here hit me with that, "oh but most people are nIcE" honestly WHO cares??? I've had too many run ins with shitty people that it's not so slowly starting to ruin the fun for me. I can't get on without being anxious that someone is going to find my camp and start wrecking it, so I'm constantly opening the map to see if anyone is close by, and I'm crouched at my camp whenever I'm there, no matter what I'm doing. What the fuck kind of bullshit is that, that I have to play like that to avoid assholes and griefers and bullies??
---
Was this posted on Twitter? I missed the announcement. 
---
Lets just say that we do have a fresh start. I am PvP oriented. This is how it would look like:
---
Day 0: our pack achieves levels 60 after around 9h of grind.
---
Day 1: we still don't have our sentinels and cavalier sets, but we can get the poors man version. We now have around 60% of total sentiassa defensive capabilities. More than rest of server combined.
---
Day 2: by now each of us contains anti-dodgy and anti-face weapons. Full combat proficiency achieved, we're now tweaking numbers.
---
Yep. Third day from the release, and we are ready  to fight against full godbuilds, but plot twist, there are no godbuilds yet and everybody is level 20, a freefrag. Fresh start? I don't think so.
---
I have some legendary marine pieces, IGN : Solcarnus#2831 I'll be online tonight 8PM GMT
---
Just on case check internet connection speed, there maybe some lag input, release and renew ip adress, flush dns.
---
I had the same issue when i played the game and simultaneously used the internet for downloading. Also i adjusted some optionswith sliders(mainly disabled field of view) and now things are better. Might wanna try it out (disable field of view, keep most slider options low and dont download stuff when playing).
---
Do you have textures set to medium? That 4gb card can't do higher than that sadly.
---
It would be very hard to go to Bethesda's servers since they don't exist.  Bethesda use virtual servers hosted on AWS.
---
Okay awesome ty im gonna try the sliders! 
---
*heavy sigh*
---
YOU AUTOMATICALLY ARE SAYING YOU'RE DOWN TO PVP WHEN YOU TAKE A WORKSHOP. STOP TAKING WORKSHOPS IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PVP OR MCFREAKIN DEAL WITH IT.
---
But soon you can't use all of your budget on them due to the light limitation.
---
I hope it works for you too!
---
Update graphic card drivers as well, check dx compatibility
---
I see your point.
---
But going to a location and picking up all junk there would net about 200 caps (If vendors had stock)
---
Are you saying they put 50 caps in the supply drops or is that the value of the sellable items?   I have not bothered with getting them in ages.
---
There's an even closer equivalent to that in the game already due to the scorched plague, those petrified green corpses that explode with radiation if you touch them
---
Missile turrets and a spotlight. You're welcome
---
I would love a fridge in my camp!
---
I absolutely will change to Survival. Hardcore for life baby
---
Well, how many times did he kill you then? Did you have Pacifist mode on?
---
I'm honestly not that bothered which ever way Beth decide to go for it. Salty players who get killed in PvP will always find something to blame it on other than them selves. "Fresh start" just eliminates "killed by duped weapon posts" on here. 
---
Hrm, I do not play PVP, but they should stick to their guns and enforce new characters to make the new mode viable for everyone who wish to partake.  Don't ruin it right out of the gate with allowing the flood of duped items mess it all up.  This is their chance to have a real competitive PVP game where people at least start on equal footing.   Eventually I can see everyone slanted toward specific builds here.
---
This. I run the exact combo and it‚Äôs extremely fun. 
---
So facebook *does* have a use after all.
---
Sorry, i'm currently rechearching how to do good things with their clunky building system, and your comment, even if it's a month old, got my attention because in the vid we clearly see shortcut on screen are from a PS4. Hope you don't mind my late reply, some do. Lol.
---
Yes, this would be a big change to the game, but this is supposed to be a big title, not a small independant title.
---
Unique identifiers on armors/weapons would prevent those from duping.  Not sure the solution for Nuka-cola, bobblehead, chems and ammo though.   
---
Upvoting for that catchy little poem 
---
Build another normal one with all the same specs and compare dmg
---
Wait so How did u get the plans for this
---
I bet they haven't fixed the nixie tube alarm clock outrage either.  Don't forget to mention that.  They ripped me off for a whole zero atoms with that one.
---
Well there was exploits for XP as well.  I would recommend new characters and be done with it.
---
The moaning about various game mechanics misunderstood by begginer players is so common in here that even if we'd have a separate game mode with absolutely no weapons, people would still complain about dupers. There are two good tactics when it comes to people moaning about griefers. You ignore em or you shoot em. Basically, when someone says 'I am not interested in PvP but plz do it like this', you can be sure you must do something completely different than specified by the PvE person.
---
Yeah that graphics card is completely outdated. With the release of the 20-series cards, a GTX 970 should be very reasonably priced now.
---
Yeah it was on Twitter
---
They wanted PVP right?   Everyone all massively pooled in 1 area is guaranteed PVP!
---
lvl 5 Gunsmith and lvl 3 Luck of the Draw are absolute staples in all of my builds. Dont need to repair often at all.
---
Downvote away, guys. Just make sure to come back and change it, ok? when this thing launches on the 13th with an article on IGN talking about how broken it is and how sorry the F76 team is.
---
But it isn't pissing it away. Consider it a mental health day. A day off where you will do things you enjoy. Many countries and professions have an unhealthy life to work balance and the toxic culture of working too much is bad for everyone.
---
If you're jealous of the ability for time off, seek the change for yourself. Change jobs, move, or vote for the people who want basic rights and standards raised. 
---
Thing is, I have a 970. It's also a 4gb card. Medium textures is my only option as well. 
---
Just think of them as molotovs without splash damage.
---
Some areas/quests require you to be higher level. When I was playing through initially I had to take a break from questing and explore/level/farm better gear. Went back later and breezed through the rest of the story with ease 
---
I'll totally buy into that, except instead of "Level 2" the words say "25,000 years later..."
---
They still haven‚Äôt put this in? No wonder this game is a meme.
---
THE FALLOUT CONTINUES OVER 76! FIRST DLC DELAYED FANS ARE OUTRAGED!
---
*Thumbnail of upset vault boy*
---
Yell for 10 minutes
---
Rince and repeat 
---
After I hit 50 I started redoing my special stats as I picked a bunch of random stuff. I just kept playing and moved points and picked cards I needed from there. It‚Äôs not the end of the world. You get stronger and better gear as you level to move stuff so it‚Äôs a win win. I wouldn‚Äôt start over and level 50 more times from scratch. It‚Äôs the same thing but you could have been 100
---
Where did you buy them at. Are you sure it wasn‚Äôt an eat-o-tronic which is different. If you got it off a player it could be a dev room item. 
---
I dont dispute the viability of any hybrid builds. I run one myself. But are you lvl 35 with only a few perk cards to boost your damage? He isn't late game, he doesn't have 3/3x3 rifle perks and 3/3x3 melee perks to throw on along with everything else needed. I never said not to do it because it is garbage. I said not to split the damage perks up, pick one and max it then do the other.
---
In years to come we'll gather around the campfires in our caves and underground shelters and tell the newcomers how those reckless fools "Pacific Rimmed" us that one time xD
---
But for sure the clock speeds would be alot higher than a 480
---

---
Cool idea but they need to focus on fixing major bugs and qol first.
---
I've had more success with Missile Turrets. Not 100% success mind, just more success than either the basic lvl 4 or slightly beefier lvl 15 machine gun turrets, which will blissfully continue to stare at the horizon while a mole rat headbutts them repeatedly.  
---
Someone once said that laser turrets were pretty spiffy? Anyone have any experience in those? I didn't want to waste points on science in case they were as bad as other energy weapons.
---
I run 1 charisma and the only perk I use is the one that reduces cap cost for fast travel.
---
Its such a stupid feature tbh. Not fast travel, but charging for it. I could see if it were lore friendly and was thru some tram to certain places sure. But its just a stupid excuse to drain your resources. Charging for stuff that was free in previous games is an ongoing theme with 76 but atleast this isnt real money. Yet.
---
You could be right there. I‚Äôll check after work later. It was a vendor. BOS I think üí≠ 
---
This has been broken since beta. Probably not getting fixed any time soon.
---
Yeah with the mirv glitch, it‚Äôs like a rite of passage to blow yourself up with daisycutter.
---
i would like to make a suggestion regarding your rules to place a marker. at least every location that has a chimes should be included.
---
I got the shits with the never ending loop of your base could not be loaded, so I decided to go see this base that was in my spot, only to find it locked up and only accessable to marsupials, which I am. Get inside and everything inside is locked too. So I did what any rational person would do and dropped a nuke on it, then took a selfie Infront of the rubble
---
If your in the UK I've seen GAME sell preowned copys for ¬£15 and smaller retailers selling for ¬£10 or less. 
---
That's awesome, thanks!
---
It was announced here on Reddit too.
---
No those mannequins are possessed, they left the note and the flowers. Don't trust. Don't knock over they will revenge one day.
---
I have the same problem, I got all the holo tapes but I I can not seem to get rid off that mission. The samething is happening to a few achivements that I never got from doing missions early on the game. 
---
by not fast traveling you just added 10000000 hours to your game play, good luck with that buddy.
---
A lot of these ‚Äúdouches‚Äù are people who got burned early on the beta and the special editions, tried to stick it out, and gave up because of the incredible incompetence.. Their comments mean they‚Äôre still here waiting for things to improve, and are still being disappointed about a game they were super hyped for.
---
How are you going to call someone who preordered and is still here with expectations a douche?
---
Yeah they stopped working for me too, so I stopped bothering about it. Now they are locked? So stupid.
---
This exactly man! My excavator PA is SO much weaker than my out of PA DR/ER. Even between 30-40% health I sit comfortably above 500 DR. Yet I'm getting absolutely slapped around all of a sudden like nothing.
---
THIS IS ADDITIONALLY with Empath on my mule, which is supposed to reduce 33% total damage to team w/ Strange in Numbers, who I keep logged in on a second PC AND him sharing Bodyguards 4, as additional buffs to me/my team.
---
The SQB should be hitting me for chips, instead I get 2 shot by super mutants half the time if Serendipity fails. 
---
Atleast the other guy admitted to not bothering to read the post lol
---
Ya know, if I was a cursed mannequin that wanted to throw some nerds off my trail that‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôd do. I‚Äôd put some touchy emotional note nearby so they‚Äôd never suspect what I‚Äôm truly up to. 
---
non-optional PvP...
---
Patch has been delayed to tomorrow.
---
I left because I think you were the one I couldn't find, and didn't feel right fighting your lower-level teammates, haha. I heard someone say "I need to switch to my alt account". Makes sense. I came back after the 200+ guys showed up. I've seen that group too many times. They aren't very good, they just talk a lot of shit and always fight by swarming you in a pack. I just kill 2 or 3 of them and leave before they can Zerg rush me, lol.
---
I'd be cool with that or something similar to a stash with a smaller capacity and can only hold foodstuff. 
---
Yea it sucks. My character is from the Beta and theres some stuff that just never works for me. 
---
Kinda wish there were more side quests. I may just be unobservant as hell but I have nearly every location on my map and its mostly just empty zones with a few enemy spawns. Very little lore. And when there is some its like one note that goes literally nowhere.
---
Ill admit though, finding the cryptid holotape stories like its a radio show always cheers me up.
---
Sorry I‚Äôm taking the vases for ceramic so I can bulk and sell
---
All in the lake and streams there is bloodleaf that turns when nuked just take a trip down there first and look around but Morgantown is good also good look 
---
I‚Äôve acquired an alien blaster!,anyone seen any ammo for it or aliens I can blast in the wastelands!

Will the Fasnacht-event last longer because of the delay?
---
Paging /u/Ladydevann
---
That's So. Much. .50 cal rounds.
---
Am drooling.
---
an AMD RX 480 outdated? I think you' ve switched it for the GTX 480 that it's yeah, very outdated! My rx 480 is 2 years old..
---
Did you just assume my nuka gender?
---
Nuka triggered.
---
I use an Rx 460 4gb an run on high textures, I just turn off all shadows etc
---
That's a good idea but I'd rather earn my heads
---
Lol ok bro you‚Äôre the one trying to prove a point without covering all your bases. Just pointing out #facts. Am I really your baby tho baby?
---
So they are are spying synths 
---
I‚Äôve had to completely ignore workshops because of this issue. 
---
I don‚Äôt want to waste my resources building them since I may lose them at anytime, 
---
If I do claim a workshop it‚Äôs literally for a short time so I can farm a particular resource for something I‚Äôm building. 
---
I‚Äôd love to spend hours building it up, maybe they could add a blueprint system so I can pick up where I left off when I last claimed it. I‚Äôd be turning those things into mini bases and claiming as many as I could. 
---
Please make it happen 
---
I would say its part of the game and the grind, but once you got the perks you need and you mark the material you need thenit becomes easier. After you mark the stuff your looking for it becomes much easier on the stuff you need to look for. I can agree with you about the maintanance you need to do especially what you need to look for. 
---
their is enough info online about the game that you could find out almost every anwser to the questions you might have. It has definatly become more easier and less time to keep your stuff the way you want it. 
---
Its a cool little idea, but literally all of the NPC's are mindless mutated monsters driven mad by radiation who want mothing more than to slaughter players and eachother. 
---
There are absolutely human npcs in this game. The Scorched, Mole Miners, Super Mutants, Wendigo, Ghouls. Mutated, but human. Its the most depressing part for me. 
---
Of course, only good little babies get sassages. I didn't mean that as an insult btw, we're all good little vault babies. I see how that could be taken as saying you're whining now. This next one's gonna be for you, baby
---
Making &lt;x&gt; weapons/armors - The Crafty
---
&lt;x&gt; Ghouls, super mutants, scorched killed - Mutant Hunter, maybe Purifier?
---
&lt;x&gt; Robots killed - Debugger
---
Completing faction quests - Title for that faction (ie Responder, General, Paladin, Sovereign Citizen)
---
&lt;x&gt; players killed - The Bloody, or some kind of Raider-esque title

Thanks baby üòò I hope y‚Äôall do it, problem is no one really knows how their system gets flagged so it‚Äôs really just speculation. Just trying to point out all the variables for science!
---
I am going  to miss destroying your C.A.M.P when I found a turret C.A.M.P at White Spring it got me more excited then finding a 3 star legendary ghoul.
---
It will kick you out roughly before the nuke touches down
---
I'd like to have character name displayed with tag for starters
---
Does that bug still exist where if you shoot a mannequin it creates a duplicate of itself?
---
Happened a lot with the golfer mannequins at White Springs.
---
I have 10 alts. 
---
If you liked fo4 for the exploring/building/scavenging then yes, its very similar. If you liked it for the story, then no. Fo76 barely has a story
---
Been playing since launch and all I have to say is I hope you kept the receipt 
---
I don't mind the non-npc that much.  You still get quests.  They just spawn from notes, computers, etc.  I really like the open world settlement building in FO76.  The perk cards take a little getting used to, but are a neat concept.  Give it a try.  I think you will like it
---
CORN
---
Imagination is a powerful thing indeed.
---
From what I‚Äôve heard, as long as they have server rollbacks then there will be duping exploits. A lot of people make real world money using these exploits and it‚Äôs tough for BGS to try to patch out bugs that have been a part of this game engine for years. 
---
If anything BGS has been working really hard on fixing these duping exploits, so much so that we‚Äôve had to wait this long for new content.. I think we all want it fixed so they can start focusing more on other things to improve the longevity of this game. 
---
Sadly it's nonrefundable. I hope it's not that bad. 
---
Lack of human NPCs wasn't a problem for me and I'm having a ton of fun since B.E.T.A. I guess if you can role-play, you'll enjoy this game a lot.
---
I was negative towards it when it launched but I really like Fallout and I wanted to give it a try. 
---
You going to buy the game to play to have fun by all means play the game you will have a Lotta fun if you going to buy the game to bitch on Reddit don‚Äôt buy the game
---
Yeah my shotguns damage varies hella bad. The math in the game is borked.
---
Deus Vult brother.
---
I dont have plans for it i got it as a reward from an event i think
---
X4205uckmyba11z420x The Enlightened
---
To be honest the story was kind of meh in 4 and the quests weren't as interesting as the locations themselves and the snippets of information you find in them. So I guess I should be fine then. 
---
Oh right, can the next people not just go back inside after that or do they have to wait until the timer is up before they can enter?
---
Not if you like FO4 for the base building.
---
Not particularly interested in the brewing, the fasanacht masks look great and any improvement to the CAMP system is appreciated.
---
Yeah, f#@% those early guys. Those loyal customers should be screwed over. /s
---
I bought it a few weeks after release and got it at the mid pice range. I regret nothing!
---
Totally agree.  The story is weak.  Maybe that's why I enjoy it.  I can just wander, kill and scavenge without having to find my kid, or start up some giant robot...
---
I did read your post, your thoughts were all over the place, so I decided to comment on your tittle, and yes i do think the game is beautiful but I will not walk every where again, fast travel is my best friend. lol
---
Hm, weird. I personally thought the story was really good in FO4. But yeah, 76 is fun if you like exploring and killing things 
---
If you have the game why are you asking opinions instead of playing it and finding out if you like it?
---
I think you can enter the first section of the silo but I really have no idea. The launch terminal is definitely inaccesible until the three hours are up though. 
---
It's a no from me
---
Yeah thats what i was thinking, but i guess at 1 point you run past the missile dont you... Which gets me thinking that you could leave somene in the missile room when you launch
---
Add me. My psn is my username. 
---
I picked up an explosive Tesla rifle from a ghoul in WS.  Lvl 40, but it‚Äôs pretty good.
---
It was solid but I didn't find it really amazing. I digged the side quests a lot except the Minutemen ones. 
---
Then don't play, if you suffer that much. Problem solved.
---
Provide some context and maybe we can explain how you ended up in PvP and how to avoid it in the future if it‚Äôs not your cup of tea
---
What exactly was the issue with it just doing 2x damage as originally intended? What fix was needed? They had and still have massively reduced accuracy as a downside already. Such a stupid nerf. 
---
What difference does it make whether you read them today or tomorrow? 
---
I agree with the minute men side quest not being great. They were really repetitive and grindy :P
---
I bought it abroad and was very excited and skeptical about it but I'm almost home so I'll play it today. 
---
Ignore them
---
PvP is shite, it barely functions and and the server is just too laggy at times for a fair fight. Also the power armour PvP nerf and others. Avoid it, your game will be better 
---
None....just something to do while we wait.
---
this was fixed, moving your camp no longer rebuilds everything without material cost.
---

1) No, that's a serious misstep. Not having human NPC's makes the world absolutely empty. It is essentially one big empty shell. That's it. Instead of having human NPC's to flesh out the world and story-line, you get to listen to holo-tapes. That is not a serviceable story-line. Hell, I'd barely even class it as a story-line. Fallout needs human NPC's for the world to come alive. When I go into Maccas, I'm not walking into a barren waste-land. So that analogy falls flat on its face here. This is probably the worst point out of your entire list. No human NPC's gives you no reason to give a shit about Appalachia.
---
&gt;He talks about engaging in PvP. To the  player shooting back, "Your attacks will be the first to do full  damage.". Not anymore. Both players have to attack each other, and then  full damage can be dealt. 
---
2) True, but it was still brain-dead for Bethesda to pull this shit in the first place. Didn't make the blindest bit of sense. As for your other part on PvP not making any sense, yeah. It doesn't make sense. There's no reason to get into combat with other players. You're trying to make up the excuse that "oh, but it shouldn't jsut be constrained to that cut-scene." That cut-scene was all we got from Bethesda. It's Bethesda's own fault for not giving any thought to PVP - how it was implemented, the lack of reasoning behind it, etc. That is on Bethesda. Bethesda could have given a good story-line behind PVP. But did they do that? Of course not.
---
3)  
---
&gt;He talks about player camps not permanently  existing in the world; if they did, how exactly would that work? Would  players only be allowed to place their camp once and then they're tied  to that server until the end of time? This is a mute point.
---
 Way to do that is not to make a game like this in the first place. 76 is flawed from the ground-up. No-one asked for an online Fallout. What everyone has been wanting is a co-op option for TES games and Fallout. Though TESO is infinitely better than 76 and even that has numerous problems.
---
4) Just because you enjoy it for what it is, it doesn't take away the fact that it's still a terrible fps.
---
5) That's a major issue. Loot you get shouldn't be heaps and heaps of levels further than what you can currently equip. This is just the very basics of competent game design. Though I think Bethesda have at least fixed that dumb little tid-bit now.
---
6) Power armour should be an end-game thing. I came across this problem in Fallout 4 as well - first 30 minutes of gameplay in Fallout 4 and power armour is literally just handed to you. You shouldn't have incredible gear just handed to you on a silver platter.
---
"This game is better wiuth friends": I hate this argument. **Every** game is better with friends. Even if it's something as shallow as Sea of Thieves - that would be better with friends. Hell I had a blast in a fucking golf game with mates. Shoving your dick in a blender would be "better with friends." Doesn't mean shoving your dick in a blender is a good idea in the first place. "it's better with friends" doesn't excuse said game being a shallow puddle of water.
---
And that's all I can be bothered going through atm tbh. Still complely exhausted
---
Most of the people bashing FO76 have never played it. You also get some dicks who say they have "250hrs playing this garbage" yeah if it was garbage you wouldn't have played that much. I don't think you'll be disappointed with your purchase.
---
happened to me yesterday when i i thought i was switching from my explosive shotgun to my super sledge.  it was not a good time.  Xbox One player.
---
Fallout 76 is like if you beat Fallout 4, but instead of restarting to get a different ending/perspective in the story you kept playing because currently there is no choice/consequence to the game. Though this will change. It's also as if you never went back to a city again and stayed out in the wastes, because there are very few "hubs" in the game at the moment
---
I wish I could close the stall door whilst sitting on the toilet. You can‚Äôt atm :(
---
People will complain that the story is weak but it depends on your idea of what constitutes storytelling tbh. I found the stories (it is more of a story  collection than one narrative) sad and compelling but I like stories I have to work for and find in the environment, not just exposition-ed at me by NPCs.
---
The gameplay other than VATS is basically the same as FO4 though so if you liked it for the gameplay you'll like 76. I loved 4 and I'm rounding the corner towards 300 hours in 76 now.
---

Ok so I‚Äôm picturing walking past a bunch of stalls selling stuff, here‚Äôs a mr Handy vendor, an assaultron, a Grahm-like mutant, and the last stall has a charred ghoul standing there turning back and forth in confusion before lunging across the counter to attack you. It‚Äôll be like making friends with that deathclaw for Rose. Just trade with him fast. 
---
Nah, if you want your boy to be a badass you've got to name him Sue, everyone knows that.
---
Well I guess it's not that bad then. Nicely put. Thanks! 
---
The lack of human npcs is very noticeable. However if exploring and crafting are the main reasons you like it, then you will love this. Ive just hit lvl 40 without doing barley any main quest lines
---
The game feels endless 
---
Well, this game has already a bad reputation and most people stop playing it after finishing the quests.
---
The playerbase is slowly fading out, and I see always the same players on the servers...  
---
If they make the PvP servers only for new characters, how empty will they be?  
---
Creepy picture but sad story
---
I got the bloody sub as well. I noticed since I'm doing bloody build 8 get more bloody weapon drops. My special stats are off the charts and I can carry more without PA
---
Probably the one from the main quest that gives +1 strength
---
Its more or less meant to be the ramblings of myself as I slowly lose my mind wandering the wasteland solo. 
---
In fact, the buggy ass shit effects my character, so I should write some stories up based around the occurences.
---
"The Super Mutant raiding party bared down on my position. I slipped behind them, firing my shotgun at the stragglers. Strangely the blasts of buckshot were replaced by the grunting of a woman. I blame the radiation for the hallucination, but then the most terrifying monster Ive ever seen comes out of the woods! Some sort of canine stretched and broken to an impossible degree! The air next to this monstrous shape barks at me and i feel teeth bite into my forearm from some invisible force."
---
If you don‚Äôt like PvP then please don‚Äôt insert your PvE ideas into it. If you want the majority of workshop griefing to stop then you have to let the people who want PvP to have the input on how survival mode will work, or else we‚Äôre back at square one. 
---
And trust me, the type of people who complain about that will complain about anything. 
---
If, so I will stay in Adventure Mode and keep PVPing in here, because I am not interested in losing my character that I spend more than 200 hours developing. 
---
You do have a point, but I intend to be mostly melee, rifles/shotgun as a backup. It seems to me, that without TSE weapons shotguns/rifles are less and less efficient as i level up. This is why i want to go melee (beside the fact that i like it)
---
You have no idea how much you are right, albeit accidentally, I suppose.
---
I understand that you mean 'this would not happen', and I assure you that yes it would, but it requires pack of people to spent hundreds of hours doing research and meticulously planning the thing, which we did, to the point where we even prepared PA-based PvP build that leaves sentinel people perplexed on why is the PA-dude unkillable. We'd actually be in a better situation as a gang if they separated these servers, but I don't need any more advantages, I want it harder.
---
Does anyone know if Wild Appalachia's first release includes player vending, or is that for a future update?  Is it a gradual rollout?
---
No problem, but that isn't to say there isn't a player central area. In the center of the map there's a place that's clean, patrolled, has several shops and all the crafting stations. Most people put their camps near here, so there's always around three houses there
---
That sounds like... fun.
---
&gt; Guns broke too fast. Fixing guns and armor were a nightmare 
---
My guns never break, they wear a bit but I've never had one break.
---
How many points ~~do~~ did you have in gunsmith?
---
I put scorch beast parts in those containers.
---
It‚Äôs simple.  You don‚Äôt lose your character or leveling but they wipe clean any duped items and let any player entering PVP respec their perks.  That‚Äôs a fair and reasonable request. 
---
Until they truly address those players and their duped weapons and armor there will always be haves and have nots.  Forget about more nerfs and buffs - just fix the root cause!   People wandering the wasteland with gear that you know damn well wasn‚Äôt acquired through drops or events need to be addressed.  If not, then they automatically get moved to their own server.  Problem solved. 
---
Love this idea! I'm on PC or I'd join in a heartbeat. Hope you find the badasses you're looking for!

---
Does the razorgrain at Billings Homestead count as wild, 'cos there's a ton of it.
---
Why people should play only PvP or only PvE?  
---
I think that the game right now is balancing both pretty well.  
---
If you have pacifist on and don't try to take any workshops you're pretty much safe.  
---
I'm not interested in a world where I'm always hunted, where I may lose everything or a boring world where everybody is untouchable.  
---
Use anti armor for queen because she has very high DR, use TSE for anything else.

When all is said and done, I have a suggestion if you want.
---
in your imgur post you could post a picture of the site along with a detailed close up of the map and the nearest marked location/ or map art.
---
&gt; Farm Glowing Mass, Hardened Mass, and High-Radiation Fluid from Whitesprings nukes,
---
And don't be afraid of being a scavenger -- check all the meat piles, even ones that are not yours -- you can get mass'n'fluids from other peoples kills.
---
i would love it if we had a proper raid system, even if it was just in event form. the enclave, brotherhood and responders all have their own faction-based events so why shouldnt raiders have something too. 
---
maybe for example a 30-45 minutes long event where you go to a specific location and clean the place up from all the loot while killing some mobs/people in the process
---
+karma
---
Oh shit my bad
---
I was thinking more of a game mode? Like you're gonna raid maybe vault 96? Then there's gonna be a final boss in the end that gives a random 2 or 3 star legendary and each person in the group gets one like in destiny 2? Smth like that 
---
Maybe it's just me, but the camps on 2 of my characters, despite being built within eyesight of locations, never get attacked.  The only special thing about those bases is that the resources I'm farming at each(water at one and Adhesive at the other) can't be visibly seen from the outside. I've also had basic camps with crafting stations and no resource production, that have never been attacked.
---
On the other hand, I've noticed that even if I don't have resource production of any sort at my camp, if I have turrets, then the camp is attacked excessively.  Camps with no turrets and visible resource production get attacked, but not as frequently as if I had turrets.
---
Wow awesome. Thank you man, that's really helpful. 
---
Talking about your overseer mission you have to launch a nuke to finish it
---
Do you use a particular tool to sort through posts like Lithium social media manager, cxsocial, etc on reddit, beth forums, etc? If not... bgs should buy one. Changes your (community manager) work life. Also Happy Cake day!
---
It‚Äôs not that bad. 
---
And here we are. 'Each to their own' in a condescending tone that implies other people perspectice on fun is somehow inferior. I am not saying people who don't PvP are somehow inferior, yet I often see how nonPvP people seem to assume inferiority of PvPers. I suppose your mental model of yourself is of a pretty nice person. I am afriad this might be unsubstantiated, as this is just yet another example of condescending bullshit.
---
Hold on, you‚Äôre telling me that you expect not to lose caps if you actively engage in pvp? Of course you would. That‚Äôs to deter the people that troll. 
---
I miss having SiN work but it‚Äôs not worth the damage hit 
---
that would be even better if bethesda put the effort into making something bigger like that. raiders need more attention as a faction imo :(
---
Tbf I actually enjoyed learning about what happened to.the different factions of Appalachia much more than finding Shaun. What made it even worse was the whole your son is missing but can you just clear this settlement for us quickly bullshit that Preston tries to pull on you constantly 
---
I actually love the stories in the game. The overseer stuff is meh but mining corporations, Sam Blackwell, and charleston flooding and shit are really good.
---
Yes :( well i think i have read somewhere todd said thus would be a forever game something along those lines lol
---
My psn is my username.  I'm level 72.
---
Aside from 2-3 side quests every faction just had boring repetitive radiant quests. 
---
Maybe that the legendary vendor will make an end to this. If we can sell/scrap our not-so-good legendaries for something awesome the market will collapse. Prices will ge back to normal because everybody can have access to the best gear and weapons. 
---
\*heavy breathing\*
---
Turrets are sketchy, I test them a lot when doing Workshop events because it's easy to judge their behaviour.
---
First, they definitely have a maximum range before they engage and it's not a long range, maybe only 30m.
---
That being said once the turrets have engaged they will continue firing beyond that range if the enemy runs away, up to 50-60m.
---
They are really handy for enemies that don't shoot back, any enemy with a projectile attack will happily stand outside the turrets engangment range and destroy it. In those case you need to run down and lure the enemies into range.
---
Yeah the douches are mostly on this subreddit I‚Äôm rarely ever on it And I‚Äôve already taken a lot of shit from people wanting to aggressively prove me wrong because of a minor mistake I made
---
Ah, okay. This just goes to show how little I use Ultracite weapons lmao.
---
Yes I see them inside buildings but there wasn‚Äôt an explanatory note.
---
Many of theses petrified corpses are inside building in various poses like they‚Äôve fallen and reaching up and out for help. 
---
They‚Äôre not mannequins. No resemblance of their former lives 
---
Does it imply that? Like I said, imagination is a powerful thing. I don't care about what you do in your free time, or your busy time for that matter. 
---
Yeah, I am a pretty nice person. It's only natural that you noticed it.
---
I did :(
---
Im talmbout the side mission though not the main one
---
Wow amazing Job I love the little unmarked stuff you find!
---
Same here (XB1). 
---
Look we all know it's just a reskin of xur from destiny, since Bethesda have basically become Bungie it wouldn't suprise me if all it does it add more micro transactions to get shit legendaries or, we end up with a system similar to the Halloween candy situation in which we have to horde large amounts of shit to get something random and trashy
---
I've done it about 10 times total and 3 of those times they were all empty, the rest they were full of loot. I even got the meteoric sword before they increased the drop chance for it, so i gave it to some lvl 15
---
The voice acting in 76 is some of the best voice acting I've heard in games. I'm an explorer in these games so my quests on fallout 4 went along the lines of:
---
I need you to fetch this item for me, oh you've already been there? I'll take that of your hands now
---
Something you'd like to say more directly?
---
The amount of uninformed and biased people are still way to high. Look at any F76 post on any other social media, and it will be filled with people complaining
---
Hey, that's a nice you loot you got:) Did you loot it before the explosive nerf came though?
---
I do the same, especially on my unarmed build. 
---
I can see them allowing you to scrap legendadies and depending on the stars of the item depends on how many legendary effects you get to keep. For example, scrap a 3* and get 1* mod to apply to another weapon. Something along those lines is a possibility.
---
However they choose to do it I hope its better than trying to barter with other players on the reddit market, the greed  in that place is toxic. 
---
1. More gun types/rolls is something commonly discussed here, more variety is always welcomed.
---
2. If you meant skins for PA and guns then why not as long as it's not stupidly overpriced. Personally, I like the clothes as I like to play dress up with my character but I'm not spending 600+ atoms on a generic looking apparel like pyjamas or a t-shirt.
---
3. Yes, team raids, coop dungeons, always a good idea
---
4. Custom mode perhaps, like lobby matchmaking where small atoms are the reward?
---
5. Never played ESO so I cant comment on their AI but I would love more complex AI decision making instead of them just shooting or hitting at you till they die
---
6. Server list, maybe, if it means the ability to rejoin a server then absolutely! Makes workshop capturing more worth it
---
7. No comment
---
8. Social Hub is also another common topic with the changes to pacifist mode, traders and maybe quest mercenaries will make this place their home, add it with your #9 World/Area chat then there is new life to this game.
---
No note mostly because it's explained in the main quest, it's a stage in the scorch disease. After being scorched for a long time you start to petrify in place and eventually just turn to dust, which is why you can sometimes see scorched in the same pose that wake up when you get near them
---
Not sure I've never nuked it.
---
Man. Man. You cannot just go and do exactly what  op is describing on the same post.
---
I wonder what type of player you are lol
---
Thanks! Hope they will add more content on year 2 
---
Cool ideas!
---
Been happening to me alot lately. Swap weapons and go to fists. Pull up wheel and weapon is missing. Freak out thinking I lost it and it will be in my inventory. What a pain.
---
Blaaaaack Diamond
---
Nothing shady about kinguin, used it for years, just requires common sense to know which traders are worth using and as long as you use buyer protection you always get the product or money back, so try not to mislead people.
---
Always a good sign...
---
Just a tip, if you make sure drop site v9 is out of the blast area you can do the while queen fight and  ot take a single drop of rads
---
This! I found an assaultron head the other day, grabbed all my fusion cells out of my stash thinking it will be a potential main weapon, fired the thing once and 350+ fusion cells gone!
---
Please fix this BGS.
---
Last weekend.  Made me scratch my head, but I don‚Äôt look a gift horse in the mouth.
---
There's a shack to the East of the crashed space station on the hill there(sort of south of the unmarked fissure over there) that has some good resources and spawns PA with 2-3 Raider pieces.
---
That's the only one I can think of for now, that's not marked on the map yet.  And unfortunately, I don't have any pics.
---
In what sense? I simply play the game with all the features it has. I build, I explore, I set up shop some times, I claim workshops and fight for them, I clear bounties...
---
You tell me, what type of player am I?
---
More content is already on the way, what the content after that like after 6 months, well that remains to be seen. An expansion is certainly expected, how and what is the question
---
Thank you, I noticed this and it'll be fixed in the next version. Also, two markers are marked 26 lol. Thank you for the help!
---
I might be wrong but i think you still need the materials (including the flux) to attach the mod.
---
You swap out your hands a couple times? Left, right, left right left? 
---
I‚Äôm genuinely ignorant here
---
Hey man I'll sell you my TSE Handmade for 6k if you have it (if not we can figure something out), I barely play that character anymore and got a lot of bang for my buck on it. It's fully modded with the best auto reciever, drum mag, stabilized stock etc. Probably worth a lot more now that duping is gone but I don't need that many caps and it has served me well. Add me on fallout, my IGN is Theopeo
---
I have a few tips to help you help you if you choose to come back to the wasteland.
---
Tag components for search in the menu screws springs etc. (The process for this varies by platform) It will put a magnifying glass on the items that scrap into those components in the world. You'll eventually quiver with excitement over every toy car, fan and typewriter you find.
---
Yoa guai have 6 springs each farm them. They almost always spawn in pairs. You can easily get 100+ springs in very little time through server hopping and fast traveling to spawn locations. There are a lot of guides explaining how to farm them on here and youtube.
---
Gun Smith reduces the wear on your guns dramatically. iirc it's 50% more durability. White Knight reduces damage to your armor. Survival is a huge part of this game. It's not for everyone but you can easily negate the worst parts of it with the right perks.
---
FYI Power armor has outstandinig durabilty and defense. You may want to get some I hardly ever repair mine.
---
Finally just ask on here about perks etc. (Be specific to your weapon or armor) It's a incredibly helpful community (most of the time this is reddit) so if you're constantly repairing weapons ask how to get better durability. Can't find balistic fiber ask for farming locations. Don't think your doing enough damage ask what perks may help. FYI Weapon perks are very specific they're locked to certain weapons and there are multiple perks per weapon type. It's not always obvious which perks effect certain weapon types.
---
You may know some of that stuff but I hope it helps.
---
As i said to another poster, its gotta be a random spawn, fixed spawns like the yao guai for the karma quest, or the deathclaw at deathclaw island don't work. Thats why i can't just hit the big lake by Grafton. 
---
I get where you're coming from. I let my gf design my alt character to look like her and when I play as her people assume I'm a girl and follow me spamming the heart emote, harass me or generally try to 'protect me' like some white knight. I quite enjoy having them drop me stims and other items and putting in the headset and thanking them in my deepest voice 
---
Stealth boys you don‚Äôt leave stealth if hit.
---
I actually started a video series on these types of locations (I have previously for fallout 3/4 New Vegas etc)! The maps stuffed full of these places! It‚Äôs just one of the things I love about fallout! Haven‚Äôt even come close to finishing it but your map will be a great help thank you! :)
---
For anyone who‚Äôs interested - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMhcgQ1v7o1lNweKBjsjERGHDAv0oTG8o
---
Seriously?? That's totally crazy, bro! lol Tesla rifle is genuinely a energy weapon, right? Now, mystery has gone even deeper lol
---
I am more exited about Necro class coming summer to ESO than I am about Vaults. Because high chances that these vaults will be same boring and same unchallenging and same broken as SBQ has been so far.
---
I haven't seen anyone/group in a mmo or mmo-like game go this far to testing a theory since RareHunters.
---
I still feel like it doesn't count unless you seal up the unmarked ones too.
---
Psn ooOKLGOoo88 cant play with mic unless it's late at night but I can always chat on here and play
---
Try another world seems to simply disconnect you and then connect you to the first available server. If usage is heavy, the world you left will have filled up and you‚Äôll get a new server. If things are light, then that can be the same server you just left. 
---
I experienced this over the weekend in the middle of the night. The solution is to select a friend from your list who is not on your world and then ‚Äújoin‚Äù them. 
---
Theres a survival guide for the game that is pretty useful
---
We don‚Äôt know if they can seal. If someone is willing to test it for us...
---
Nope, but there is a definite memory leak.  I regularly close out when I take breaks so I can free up memory.  Just become a habit.
---
If ya want PvP wait for the PvP survival mode
---
Such a dumb comment
---
What sale, game already costs 14.99 euros on PC xD
---
so you want him to play a game he thinks is shit for 300 hours
---
Stupid sexy Space-Flanders...
---
I am on xbox as well, I like you have played every other fallout game. With that said yes the game looks and feels a lot like FO4 but it is not. 
---
I would say have in mind what do you want your character to be and do, and go from there.
---
as far as farming goes, I would say collect from the get go, aluminuim, screws, springs, fiber optic, etc. does that I just said are the most need/used material for building gear and repair and it can be a pain early on the game. 
---
send me a PM when you want to play. I am in Europe but I am always down to play some fallout.
---
One time during the beta my turrets began attacking me.
---
I think the opposite. I think the loot should be worth getting wanted.
---
I know!  It‚Äôll take down bots left and right.  They may have fubar‚Äôd the change in one of the updates or just missed the Tesla.
---
gold you can craft the vault outfit and then sell it. 
---
Its fun. However be warned the bugs are plenty and glaring and will at some point effect you. They annoy me but I play daily. Grinding materials is boring to me however, I wish it was more rewarding and challenging to do events. Most are not very difficult and reward very little other than exp that even make them worth it. Killing three 100 xp ghouls typically gives just as much if not more exp as well. I also wish there were more unique quests /side quests and less dead end holotapes. 
---
To me once the story is complete the lack of NPCs becomes very apparent and the world feels very empty. As a solo player a fallout game with no companions even running into other players feels void of life.  And the robot vendors are still the dumbest form of trade they couldve gone with in my opinion. But i heard player vendors are coming. Just hope it isnt ultra restrictive while also not being extemely abusable. I think player prices should be effected by their charisma not whatever they choose. My own charisma is low for example so I should pay more than their listed price, unless we have the same charisma score. If theres is 15 and mine is 1 I should pay far more than what it would cost if theres was 5 and mine was 1. 
---
The one that adds bonus damage on subsequent hits? That one.
---
Hehe, I knew Bethesda would do a thing like that lol Never know, Beth will fix it right sooner or later. Keep your great legacy weapon well, bro:)
---
We can only hope for the best :/
---
Bingo!
---
But you'll find that most people on here happily ignore all of the problems, claim its already a near perfect game and don't see a problem with paying publishers for half finished projects which look eight years old.
---
I know it's the apocalypse and all...but you shouldn't eat bobble heads. Those things are a choking hazard and mole rat chunks are a plenty.  
---
Snallygasters drop tons of acid, you can find at least two in Toxic Larry's and there's at least 2 more at the farmstead in the toxic valley
---
saying just don‚Äôt play if you have a problem sounds exactly like what a griefer would say. Just a joke though I don‚Äôt actually think you‚Äôre like that.
---
I agree, the map isnt polished yet, I'm just posting it as I go. I didn't think of color blind! I don't know to much about the different variations of color blindness, I plan to make each area of the map a different color, suggestions on each?
---
Lmao, what system do you play on.
---
I am on Xbox and I am always down to team up and kill some stuff, maybe we can find the that crazy woman super mutant. lol
---
Hello mr deathclaw, say helllo to my \*guns breaks after first shot\*....... erm, i mean say goodbye to my stock of stimpacks..... 
---
If i can solo em(if it lets me try even if it isnt meant to be possible difficultywise), i wont be upset. Unless theyre not worth the time or invested resources. 
---
For EU, I'm NA :(
---
B for Bog.  Nobody calls it Cranberry.
---
That sounds amazing and way better than that hat that came with the fringed dress!
---
Best Friend Tabitha? 
---
Nah thats New Vegas ;)
---
Havent heard of a woman super mutant in 76, but sadly Im on PS4
---
&gt; I really want a chance to start a new character in a zero-duping economy, where every player is on equal footing. 
---
Really sucks for the people who farmed their shit legitimately
---
I hereby grant you the title of 'Curious pervert'.
---
All hail DuukDkarn the Curious pervert!
---
Why is power armor bad in pvp, does it break too quick? I feel like it should at least save you front being headshot OHKO'd? Or is it because it's too slow and bulky?
---
1) Not including NPC's, "a serious misstep", I thought so too when the game was first announced, but I don't think that way anymore. "When I go into Maccas, I'm not walking into a barren waste-land", yes, that analogy does fall flat on its face. I thought that my 2nd analogy about crowbars would help you understand mine.
---
It all comes down to opinion and what you were hoping for. Robots would have been a better word than crowbars. Let's say that player 1 really loved the robots in F4 and hated the human NPC's, and player 2 had the opposite opinion. Human NPC's as a feature were removed from 76; it's not a bug/glitch. Player 1 rates 76 higher, player 2 rates the game lower. So, player 1 would praise &amp; criticize aspects of how the robots are implemented into the game. Player 2 would do the same, but with more criticism on the robots and a lot of criticism about how NPC's aren't in the game.
---
I find the holotapes an interesting way to learn about the story/lore of the world, some people hate that, and I can live with that. The world is an open sandbox with shit to do and loot, and I enjoy that.
---
2) "As for your other part on PvP not making any sense, yeah. It doesn't make sense." I wasn't making that point, Rags did. The cutscene was open-ended, how players react after it is their choice.
---
3) Shots fired. Opinions.
---
4) Opinions. You think it's a terrible FPS, I can live with that. I think COD4 is an amazing FPS, some people might think it's a pile of shite.
---
5) Sell it, scrap it, use the parts to build weapons suited to your level, I don't think it's a major issue.
---
6) Should it be an end-game thing? Opinion. Your first set of PA is basic bitch PA, but then you can upgrade it with mods.
---
7) "  Shoving your dick in a blender would be "better with friends." " Now, that's a terrible analogy. I broke my leg when I was 11 at a friend's bday party, and it wasn't better with friends, it wouldn't have been worse if they weren't there. I see it as more of a statement than an argument. Yes, I know it's obvious, just like saying the moon orbits the earth; we know. If you see the game as a shallow puddle of water, then so be it. "You get out of it what you put into it", how's that for another annoyingly obvious statement?! lol
---
I'd agree with you to a certain extent, but I enjoy the game for what it is. The narrative is nowhere near as deep as previous Fallout games, but it's offering a different experience, and I've found that I enjoy both. It doesn't seem like you do, and I'm ok with that.
---
I think that Bethesda have learned their lesson that they can't ride on the coat tails of their reputation and release a buggy mess too early and expect people to lap it up. That's why I didn't get it at launch, and got it for half-price 6+  weeks after the beta launch. If the game was released in a mostly bug-free state, would you still hate it as much?
---
Tl;dr - opinions, 76 is offering a different experience than previous entries.
---
Oh man, I'm so glad to hear that y'all are still working on this.  Please please please keep us updated!
---
it's juvenile to think something is funny purely because "you're not allowed to say it"-
---
I have the same problem. I don't have my specs at hand but I'm also running a lower end machine.
---
I did a fresh install of Windows to solve a C++ Redistribute error on installing APEX and ran the game for the first time today. I'm level 96 so have played it plenty before without issues but suddenly my toon is suffering micro rubber banding, delayed input response, interruptions in movement, low redraw, low frame rate, low textures. Even with everything set on low.
---
I've got a 970 4gb, latest drivers.
---
I'm only using an old i5-2500k quad 3.3 with 24gb of RAM.
---
But like I said above pre reinstall I had zero issues. 
---
To me, it sounds like what a reasonable person would say. If they are "suffering" and "anxious" while playing, why play at all? It's a game, it's supposed to be fun.
---
I lost caps for being greifed dumbass 
---
1. Who wouldn't want more guns. 
---
2. As long as the clothes are unique I'll spend atoms. Beth plans on funding all future updates via the atomic shop. We might as well use it I'd rather buy cool clothes and power armor paint than have to pay for DLC
---
3. Dungeons are vaults. These are being opened soon.
---
4. PvP arena would be fun especially if it puts everyone on a level playing field. Same perks same weapons.
---
5. Never played ESO so IDK
---
6. Server list would be nice. I could rejoin the server I DC'd from when launching a nuke. Also may bring some stability if everyone is more or less local?
---
7. I don't see a need for this. There is only a few good farming locations. They are already crowded this will make it worst
---
8. Lol you want a safe space ok fine as long as Beth adds crayons and puppies.
---
9.
---
It‚Äôs kinda hard to ignore being griefed at my camp 
---
I like both a lot. FO76 has a bigger and more interesting world, I'd say. I never played a Bethsoft game for NPC interaction, so it's not something that bothers me.  
---
You find a whole lot of notes, books, terminals, holotapes and so forth - and many of them tell interesting stories in their own right.  
---
In terms of pure exploration with distinct and unique stuff to see and find, this is superior to FO4.  
---
The biggest downsides, to my mind, are the bugs and the performances issues. It has a lot of stuttering and weird little glitches.  
---
But, yeah, I definitely think it's worth it. Hundreds and hundreds of hours of content - if you like what it does well.
---
I didnt know that the scorched eventually become petrified.
---
But they‚Äôre not in a setting where you see whole families around a dining table having Sunday dinners, or in random gatherings like a picnic. 
---
THIS is what makes them different. They‚Äôre easily identifiable, and the roles they played. You can extrapolate from the scene who they were and what the setting is about.
---
My point is they look like ghosts, of their former selves, trapped or replaying a scene from their past like a memory. Hopefully it‚Äôs a pleasant memory and they‚Äôre reliving better days.

---
No
---
Its still a rinse repeat minecraft esque resource gathering game with no meaningful content.
---
Avoid.
---
Negative. Mods are an all-in-one package. 
---
Omg same (except protanomaly).
---
A dark blue or light blue usually stands out pretty well. Of course there‚Äôs no need to stick to one colour, could just vary depending on the background colour. I imagine a light blue wouldn‚Äôt show up so easily up in the central northern part of the map.
---
My PSN is Gefam. Level 87 and happy to help.
---
Why not try reading the link?
---
If you‚Äôve been playing since launch then you‚Äôve received more than your money‚Äôs worth in return.
---
Yeah, in Annihilation it was a different setting, it was in a peaceful place and the "disease" progressed much faster. I imagine we'd see scenes like that in fallout if the scorched plague was instant but since they go through a "feral" phase the picnicers all end up runinng around attacking people before petrifying. I loved that scene in Annihilation btw, with the flowers growing on the plant people
---
Dude what? I've been using the campfire glitch since it was first posted in a myriad of ways and I've never ever ever had it give me any sort of error on login that isn't explained by my camp space being occupied, like happens on occasion to most everyone.
---
They know what you did...
---
I'm very new to posting pictures on Reddit, imgur isn't my first choice for posting the map. Any tips on how to get it larger on imgur would help a lot.
---
I posted on other fallout boards, clicking the image brings it into a new tab and clicking to zoom increases it to its original size.
---
I used the largest and clearest picture I could so I could make the marks as accurate as possible. This is in the hopes of reducing the time it takes to find the locations.
---
Ahaa, Well i learn something new everyday!!  
---
That's why I stick to cheap champagne, taking the equivalent of a shot every now and then.  I get buzzed quick and stay buzzed longer without the hang over later.  Won't work for everyone, especially considering everyone else I know that drinks can't handle wine/champagne compared to something like whiskey or vodka.
---
Did you get shot by a chamelon sniper  while typing this ? You seemed cut off XD  it doesnt have to be a safe zone just a place where you have everything you need crafting benches and  a vendor 
---
Holy fuck.
---
Love how that quest goes from 76 to 7600. Like, why skip the realistically reachable goal of 760? No one is going to reach 7600 for like a decade.
---
Lol mobile I hit post by accident
---
Oh okay lol 
---
Thanks for the location!
---
Good to know, thanks. I bet it popped once I scrapped my 76th item of clothing...which was last night.
---
Yes
---
Honestly? They didn't say anything about the patch itself (Well if they did I didn't see it at all) they only said about the Wild Appalachia content.
---
You could use a VPN to activate a EU copy, unless that‚Äôs frowned upon. Idk.
---
Wrong subreddit to advertise on
---
How many caps did you lose?  What were the circumstances?  Can you provide more detail?  If you want input, please tell us what happened instead of some vague whine that doesn‚Äôt make sense.
---
I suspect the upcoming nuclear winter mode may give you what you're asking for.
---
Pretty sure Technical dispenser is part of the quest.
---
U-Mine vending machine sells mining maps that start a quest which rewards with various metal scrap.
---
Anyone know?
---
Temperature in clothing would be pushing it seeing as clothing is more of a cosmetic Choice than anything else. But I would love to see more fog high winds and heavier rain maybe more rad storms would be cool too. Give use a weather radio channel plz!
---
That scene scared me. The physics instructor who abandoned and acknowledged her fate. Casually walked into the glen and became one.
---
The ending when you realize what happened to her husband..
---
The price is per the market value when you highlight the ammo.
---
Sometimes players become bored.
---
I‚Äôm open to trades as well. Make me an offer.
---
The content is part of the patch
---
go outside

Hey  [u/MauroRox900](https://www.reddit.com/user/MauroRox900)  so I went through a lot of optimization,  and tweaking to try and get the most of 76 with my pretty powerful pc.  I found first off, understanding how fallout 76 does graphics to be super informative.   
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aqtokr/fallout\_76\_pc\_version\_graphic\_presets\_explanation/?utm\_medium=android\_app&amp;utm\_source=share](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aqtokr/fallout_76_pc_version_graphic_presets_explanation/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)
---
The TL:DR is that fallout 76 runs things at INSANE levels with any preset over medium. The best course of action to adjust your settings is use either the low or medium presets then change the other settings from there. DO NOT TOUCH THE SLIDERS, to put it relativity the medium preset is STILL over twice as high settings wise as high setting fallout 4.   
---
So if you're finding your frames are pretty decent, and you're graphics card isn't using more than around 40-50% of your GPU and you're getting a bit of stutter, I really suggest looking at using a reshade. [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/234](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/234). It does add around 20-30% gpu usage, but I found that it's fake motion blur setting actually hid stutter for me, also his preset really makes fallout 76 pop.   
---
hope this helps.
---
In my opinion should patch notes always be released together with the patch going live.
---
Same, Same. Pretty frustrating.
---
Pack Rat perk.
---
Most definitely a grifier that stolen the junk items from innocent players Workshops.
---
Even a gtx 1080 shouldn't use ultra, its really strange how the graphic settings work in game. [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aqtokr/fallout\_76\_pc\_version\_graphic\_presets\_explanation/?utm\_medium=android\_app&amp;utm\_source=share](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aqtokr/fallout_76_pc_version_graphic_presets_explanation/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

---
Looking at the Hardware side it looks fine, though the size and speed of the memory might be a bit of a bottleneck.
---
  There's lot's of good articles on game settings and what to adjust there to improve frame rates, and I'm assuming that you've already played with those settings since you mentioned adjusting the fallout76.ini file (you may want to look into building a "Fallout76Custom.ini" though, as it isn't messed with on patches etc. and supersedes the settings in the regular and preferences settings).
---
  With those two out of the way the next thing I would look at is what else (both programs and services) that you have running on your system and get rid of as many things as possible that might be pulling processor / memory / HDD / network access away from the game (these can have a huge impact.
---
  The last thing is to look at your Internet speed and what else you might be sharing bandwidth with if there are other computers / users on your network.  If it's not Hardware, Settings,  or Background services / programs it could be your connection (lag or bandwidth both download and upload) since all of the dynamic in game items have to be positioned etc. using information from the internet, so a bottleneck there can impact graphics as well.
---
I would first try running the game with all the graphics settings at minimum and see if you still have the issue, if you do then it that should eliminate your graphics settings as being the main culprit. If the issue goes away then start increasing you're settings starting with resolution and see what is giving you the performance degrade and adjust accordingly, if it doesn't leave your graphics settings at minimum (as they could still be a part of the problem) and start eliminating other software and services and see where that gets you, then finally if that doesn't help look at your internet speeds both up and down and Lag (I usually run speed tests from multiple sites as the results vary).  It can be a painful process to resolve, but it can be done you just have to be methodical.  Hope this helps.

youtube: BETHESDA FUCKS UP AND CANCELS UPDATE, GAME GOING F2P
---
The damage number is misleading because it doesn‚Äôt show the aa effect(which varies depending on the target). The practical effect is that the aa will hit harder against heavily armored things such as super mutants, while the 2 shot hits lighter armor creatures harder. 
---
The guns are fairly evenly matched. 
---
The alien blaster ammo can be found in TNT Dome #2 at Black Mountain Ordinance Works :)
---
Yet you still take you time to come here... Maybe it didn't work as well as you hoped.
---
PA has a hidden stat that reduces balistic, energy and radiation damage by X%. It‚Äôs like 95% for rads.
---
No regular armor will ever be as good, but you do get to play with legendary effetcs such as unyielding, weightless and such :-)
---
Woah - that's pretty awesome! If you like, I can add all these to https://fo76map.com/ (with credit of course)?
---
I think one of the problems was also quantity sometimes I would walk into town and fine 3-5 boxes on top of each other that's a lot of loot for doing nothing.
---
Such a great movie in general, not sure why it bombed so hard in box office. It had 4 great female scientist leads that had none of the hollywood female character tropes, it had a reasonable explanation for the phenomenon, a really fun exploration section with lots fo imaginative plants and animals (that bear almost made me shit my pants, haha), and a really creative and different ending that I absolutely loved.
---
However. I'd carry both to the queen fights. Because one will break and Two shot is likely to hit her highness with both pellets. Cuz she's a bigger girl. 
---
No thanks, nuclear winter has chapped my lips. 
---
They appeared outside my camp the other day. Yesterday I had Vlad &amp; Mia instead. 
---
Good point, I always have to repair my main weapon at least once every fight, haha.
---
I don't know how I didn't think of this, and I don't know why you don't have like 10million points for this comment.  But I gave you one, this is genius.
---
I also just came back from a long break. The work that's been done on QOL upgrades is very nice. 
---
"you made it to level 50" u from the south?
---
It's noticeable mostly on non explosive guns. The perk tank killer actually helps with rifles that are explosive. That's all I know. Seems the mods for armor piercing don't do much in the way of damage unless it's melee
---
I did watch the video, it was excruciating. It reeks of privilege and a general misunderstanding on what workshops, and whole of fallout 76 is as a whole. 
---
I feel like if they just made the turrets much more powerful a low level could at least stand a chance to defend the workshop/CAMP. high level characters should not be able to just ignore camp turrets, if the low level players damage doesn't scale enough, scale the turrets then. After all, they won't attack anyone that isn't wanted or instigated PvP with you.
---
Ad victoriam, soldier!
---
That was exactly what I was thinking. 
---
Keep an eye out for players in the area as they might be working together.   
---
I had a lvl 8 guy behind WS golf course pick a fight with me (I‚Äôm lvl 135, but at the time was around lvl 120), I blast him and his camp and all of a sudden two other higher level players who teamed up with him swoop in and it was on.  
---
"F" to pay respects
---
Nice and cozy!
---
After reading everyone's inputs I've opted to leave the shotguns where they are, and to max out the rifleman perks, invest in a couple more sluggers, demolition expert X 3, gunsmith and one point for another fireproof. 
---
Cheers everyone!
---
1) Just because it's not a bug or a glitch, it doesn't mean it wasn't a stupid move. You think the holotapes are interesting? Let me get this straight. Bethesda removes the absolute backbone for any game to work to a competent degree, they then substitute that with shit and you think that's interesting? Passive storey-telling is hard to do right and when that's the only form of story-telling, the difficulty in getting the viewer interested is heightened even further. Bethesda fell flat on its face on this. Hard. You saying "it's interesting" doesn't suddenly make it so. Stripping away the content from a game doesn't suddenly make it more interesting. You're going to have a real hard sell with that one.
---
2), Yeah, it was Rag's point. and it was a good point. You for some unknown reason think otherwise. You also jsut glossed over the part where I said that it's Bethesda's own fault for not giving any back-story to how or why PVP should be undertaken. That cut-scene was all we were given, so yeah. It is Bethesda's fault for this. If they wanted to make PVP an actual thing, they could have put some effort into it. But they didn't.
---
3) It's an opinion based by factual statements. Unlike yours.
---
4) No, this is not an opinion. There's a lot of dead-time in 76.  When I played it, there was a serious delay in toggle sprint, enemy levels had absolutely no pattern to it, AI is autistic as fuck (and I know the AI are still absolutely stupid) and then some. These are all things (and more) which combine to make not only a god-awful fps, but a terrible game. Saying that 76 is a god-awful fps is an observation of reality tbh.
---
5) When you were getting tonnes of weapons far above your level, yeah, it's an issue. It's bad design.
---
6) No, it should be an end-game thing. If you get given all this cool shit right off the bat, it completely takes away the reward of it. Bethesda has been watering down their games for years and years and this approach to game design is just a facet of their constant watering down of their games.
---
7) No it isn't a bad analogy. Every. Single. Game. Is. Better. With. Friends. You could play some of the worst games known to mankind and still have fun playing said game if you play with friends. I really do tire of this excuse that it plays better with friends. It means nothing.
---
I don't think they have learned their lesson. This is Bethesda we're talking about. They are lazy as fuck and have been getting lazier and lazier with each passing year. This has been evident in the way they approach cobbling together video games via re-using a lot of stuff from previous games. This is why we constantly see the same bugs over and over again in every single game they release. Because they are lazy as all sin and will straight up copy code from previous games and they keep on adding tonnes of stuff onto the gamebryo engine. The more they add onto this engine, the worse it gets.
---
Speaking of bugs, once again, this is Bethesda. Bethesda and "mostly bug-free" is like oil and water. USLEEP read like a bloody novel, you know that right? And that was for Skyrim. If you think Bethesda has what it takes to release a mostly bug-free game, you really haven't played all that many Bethesda titles. Bethesda have been given a pass previously for buggy releases because of the incredible worlds they build. But strip away all that, make it unmoddable and the reality of Bethesda titles is laid bare - as is the case with 76. 
---
Yeah, it's offering a shit experience. With that though, I'm offering to bed
---
The fusion core generator takes 100 power, but it doesn't have to come from the power plant. You can use any generators you can place in your CAMP as the power source, so just hook a fusion generator up to the core generator and you're good to go.
---
I started playing two weeks after launch. I recently started a new character and started to discover locations in the challenges. The numbers increased and from 2/5 I went to 4/5. But when I visited Grafton Dam and expected it to become 5/5 Challenge completed, I was wrong and got nothing. I guess I need a third character...
---
So the achievement is simply reaching the level? And it was somehow skipped for you? very weird, thanks.
---
The south of what?
---
probably the most cringe I've experienced all week
---
Are any of these random encounter locations? I've found a lot of crashed vertibirds and deathclaw nests that were random encounter locations that also spawn things like the trick or treater and civil war reenactor at those static locations.
---
If you can solo them, it is already big flaw. 
---
Do You have the house thing on the hill southeast of the crashed space station
---
RISE UP
---
ƒ∞ think you need to play the game for such things
---
There's a TRADING flair...people just don't use it
---
Patch notes: we needed more time to add more bugs to patch.  Patch now contains 110% bugs.
---
I don't mean this in a bad way, but if you're already one shotting most things on the map, why does it matter? Lol. I'd just keep a drum mag and enjoy the ammo capacity.
---
Best right now is to repair it to 200%. That makes a big difference. Then try to get mods like dual bar or flaming. 
---
&gt; Survival mode should be a full-scale monster mash where you come loaded with stuffs, use / lose said stuffs and get back home with different bunch of stuffs.
---
I've been in the same mindset as OP, wishing new characters would be required, but the way you described it actually made me excited for it lol
---
I found a scene the other day in a look out tower. A dead settler inside the top of the tower surrounded by baby toys, a pipe pistol a few inches from her sprawled out hands, looking like an apparent suicide. I couldn't find a note, but at the bottom of the stairs on the ground I found a dirt mound with wooden blocks spelling out "my angel" on top of it. Didn't need to find a note to put the story together. 
---
Brilliant. I have subscribed to this channel for a long time but have yet to buy the game, for obvious reasons. This is the first time, I feel like I should get it. 
---
This is twisted but brilliant! 
---
People in my Discord
---
Ok, it‚Äôs just I was shooting one down the other day.
---
What do you play on?
---
I love those ramblings of a madman. You should write them down!
---
Sure. You will like it as it feels like the same game but with different content.  There are some differences...
---
Junk
---
* FO4, you pick up and keep everything.
---
* FO76, you pick up select junk items and only keep minimal junk stash.
---
Weapons/armor Backups
---
* You only keep what you can carry around, do not store any
---
Character
---
* FO4 you build your character like you want and look for weapons that would fit that style
---
* FO76, you find a nice weapon and rebuild your character around that weapon.
---
Settlements/CAMP
---
* FO4 you can build whatever you want within the circle basically.
---
* FO76 you can build a small shack with a couple of turrets.   Or a decent house with no turrets.
---
Playability
---
* FO4, you can control your computer and play like you want however you want
---
* FO76 You can get PVPd, griefed at any time (rare though), server disconnects can make finishing quests a pain, sometimes disconnects can cause quests to be stuck forever and you cannot finish it.  (Order of Mysteries: Novice).  Not many have experienced this particular issue, but I have.
---
With the flame, long or double bars and 200% repair I can kill ghouls with it pretty easily lol
---
You seem to have a history of defending really shitty games
---
Survival mode pvp rules with no legendaries... if mods can make this happen when/if private servers are made available I will definitely be getting a PC just to be able to play that.
---
Well I found my next perk!
---
Same here. 
---
My MooMoos make fertilizer.
---
They have a chance to spawn in the shop across the street from the hospital in Charleston. Sometimes masks, sometimes sack hood variants.
---
You're kind of comparing apples to oranges tbh. While 76 is a fun game and great with friends its not really anything like 4. The gun plays pretty much the same, the crafting is as little better. Base building is really fun. The story and the quests? Well there is no story and the quests are mostly boring. There are some fun areas but most locations are empty other than enemies (no story about the location or lore for the most part). So if you're planning on getting it id say wait till its really cheap then buy it otherwise id hold off as there aren't many people left anymore
---
Far north of that shack, there is a ruined hut with all available teddy bears sitting in the attic
---
I mean, you can read basically any review of the game (except giant bombs because they labeled it too boring to review). 
---
More importantly you look badass while doing it. 
---
Oh, ok thanks
---
He makes a good distraction for the enemies lol.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
i'm sorry that happened to you.
---
I traveled to my camp yesterday to find I was in the middle of a rad storm.
---
I got it for about 15 USD so I think it won't be that much of a waste if i happen ti not like it. 
---
Again, you weren‚Äôt killed without you having to inflict damage. It is almost impossible to kill someone who isn‚Äôt engaging in pvp. 
---
If you have strange in numbers equipped and your only teammate leaves they bug out and wipe all positive effects. Have tested and can confirm.
---
I might be ok with a free, additional Lvl 50 reroll with all the perks but I'll be damned if I'm doing robot/overseer quests over again in order to level. 
---
What's adhesive used for?  I think I only use for repairing weapons and am never below 200 (bulk anything over 200)
---
No farming
---
No because they're obviously still subject to change
---
Yes, that is the one. Every molerat, alot of scorched and the close combat muties get a taste of it.
---
Everything you liked about Fallout 4 is here I think.  In a way, it's even better because I liked the same things you did, and didn't care much for the story.  The 'story' of this game is discovered through scavenging, finding tapes, notes, terminals, very little NPC dialogue stuff (a couple bots act like true quest NPCs, but they're the exception and are quite rare).  
---
Oh, i had forgotten about that perk...
---
I'm a L38 now.  I stated not understanding the perk system, loaded strength early (I still have unused points b/c I lack the right combination of cards) 
---
Not understanding te mechanic, I had no particular build in mind - once I semi understood the perk system, I started selecting  perks to compliment the weapons I had that were working well at the time.
---
As it turned out, that has made me a melee/sniper.
---
Some of my current perks are:
---
For melee, Incisor L3.  Martial Arts.  (IIRC, these are both strength - one ignores armor, the the other increased swing speed)
---
Also have a chest piece that gives steath for x seconds if you are hit.
---
For sniper:
---
Marksman hardended sniper rifle (dmg 90) and get the rifle perk that ignores armor (I think it is a perception).  Combine w/ (at least) 1 piece of chameleon armor.  This work wonders on mutants, especailly headshots.
---
Melee W/O power armor, my weapon of choice is a L35 death tambo. (101 dmg) or barbed baseball bat - this has a spiked rocket mod, but I don't have the perk to make it.
---
For some reason, can't equip the DT while in PA, so in power armor, Furious Fire Axe (79 dmg) or Vampire machete (50 dmg, plus heath regen on hit).  
---
I used the DT to take out a L42 diseased wendigo last night.  Twice.
---
It also does a respectable job on L68 glowing ghouls, (as long as there are not too many of them simultaniously)
---
I keep a combat shotgun on hand for bloatfies, stingwings, bee swarms...
---
YMMV and all the standard disclaimers :)
---
Looking at posts like these made me realise I should join raiders and shoot every person misusing the word griefer
---
While I‚Äôm proud of you guys for actually having the integrity to work on something until it works for once, why am I not surprised it wasn‚Äôt completed on time. Again, us the customers never told you or made you set the date on March 12. 
---
That sucks to hear friend.
---
I get the issue occasionally, but i can thankfully get around it by restarting the game a couple of times.
---
It only started happening to me after the last patch.
---
Did you try re-installing ? Using a vpn ?
---
Sorry to hear its still happening to you.
---
I've been looking for something like this for a while, good stuff. But impossible to read on mobile. Can only just read the letters on the right, never mind the actual map. Is there a higher resolution image somewhere?
---
Is your chainsaw lvl 50, all the ones I find are lvl 20. And I'm lvl 55
---
Your first mistake was calling in to work for fallout 76. Yikes. 
---
Really?  Its much more cringe to watch the fanboys make every excuse why this game is good.  Why people stick up for a multibillion dollar Corp that lied to its customers is beyond me.
---
BE rifles usually go for more than 2.5
---
True, this can funnel them into the same sport for a middle to explode them plus, enemys don‚Äôt attack he stash wall
---
You hit the nail on the head. I think it's stupid that 3* mobs drop anything but 3* look. Same with 2* and down. 
---
PC, can you re-link it for me?
---
I want to adopt Murgle.
---
Oh, I play on PS4
---
Oof
---
Re link what?
---
I don't even roleplay seriously, but it's hard not to enjoy the fantasy of playing in an area I used to live in.
---
Felt the same way when fallout 3 took place where I grew up.
---
I will have to log into my lower lvl and tfr caps to sniper build prolly can go to 4K with tfr
---
Thanks for the heads up. I just got a legendary assaultron head and was wondering if it was still glitched. 
---
Whoops misspoke on the linkage thought this was an inbox reply XD apologies.
---
Plz don't talk about coding times if u know nothing
---
Find out where his camp is and nuke the damn thing. 
---
Not misused. Absolute griefing. In my camp, they attacked me and triggered my AoE from electrically charged. That brought my partner on my team in pacifist mode into combat and they sat there stealth sniping us for caps and cleared out my partners junk for her selling run.
---
Had to switch servers to get away from them. Thats fucking griefing
---
I think the legendary vendor is intended to solve this problem.
---
I knock them over. They creep me out. 
---
Tacocatracecar. He‚Äôs a notorious griefer. 
---
I‚Äôve tried everything. I haven‚Äôt tried opening it since January though, there may have been a fix.

If you have the adrenal reaction mutation, it might be related to this: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/asqh1x/confirmed_adrenal_reaction_scales_its_damage_with
---
I didn't know I needed this until I read your post.
---
Now I don't know how I can continue without mounted heads.  Or my own in other people's houses.
---
You can find a Bloodied Explosive or a Two Shot Exsplosive, but not a Bloodied Explosive Two Shot. Bloodied and Two Shot are their own prefixes and can't be found together.
---
Are you, or a friend using strange in numbers?
---
I noticed my positive effects would disappear when someone DCed while I was using strange in numbers. It is easily fixed by re-applying the strange in numbers perk.
---
***I stopped using strange in numbers specifically because of this bug.***
---
Did you and your partner then discuss your favourite brands of tampon?
---
I've seen one spawn up on the hill west of Lucky Hole Mine, NE of the fissure, WNW of Big Bend Tunnel East, SE of the lookout tower and at the same elevation as the base of the monorail towers.  It's due east of where the monorail turns north before turning back east to go to the elevator.  There is a scenic overlook (concrete base) with some junk and a car.
---
No it isn‚Äôt, relog and block. It‚Äôs an online game I‚Äôm afraid. There‚Äôs always going to be that type of player but at least it‚Äôs a solvable issue
---
Where are the chainsaw mods?
---
That's what i have. You're welcome.
---
Yes, enjoy your game, see you around.
---
This here.
---
They are fun
---
 https://imgur.com/gallery/42IFmWz
---
Then something is wrong with your game, cause mine work. You're welcome.
---
I'm level 10 and my weapons keep breaking and I run out of adhesive fast. Also, modding the weapons I have requires it.
---
Yep, you have my vote
---
Right, need an RSVP before you aggro in Appalachia (‚óî_‚óî)
---
I think most folks stumbled on teh [Moonshiners Shack] early on and tried to activate teh equipment in it
---
Go to the rangers HQ in the bog. The garage out back spawns a lvl50 chainsaw.
---
I see them all the time in watoga traders
---
I read the reddit a lot. And there's a lot of questions that get answered, that people keep asking. If this was ingame, at least it's directly getting the information to players. 
---
It took me almost 40 times building and scrapping the handmade before I got the suppressor.  Keep working at it (and use Super Duper).
---
350? That's nothing. I lost every single FC I collected since launch just a couple weeks ago.
---
Wow, that is amazing! I envy you as a big fan of the FO series but probably the ways we play and view this game are totally different... I'm live in an island in far east Asia and wonder is they had a FO story based in where I live.
---
*Heart of the Enemy* is a particularly irritating quest to get disconnected from at the last stage. &gt;_&lt;
---
Sonny Tata!!!!
---
Had the same issue a couple of times, it fixed it self, no damage to friends list
---
Bloodied explosive is fine. As long as not shot gun, I need either handmade or 308 type. My build can max handmades and all rifles. Lvl 5 gunsmith and got all mods to make it super powerful
---
I want to start by saying I‚Äôm completely ok with the delay. Release the DLC in a good state 100%. I do however hope they go ahead and release the patch notes. I‚Äôve been itching to see them.
---
Was on mobile, now at work
---
I'm betting there will be new stuff coming with the patch tomorrow. Don't worry, someone will do a datamine when it drops ;)
---
Thx
---
I, too, am colorblind and though there were no markers on the map
---
It didnt for me, I was sat playing for around 4 hours with it not fixing. 
---
&gt;	floating base
---
I have an elevated base, but with proper pillars everywhere providing realistic support. A reasonable compromise. 
---
All I do is grind legendaries for my shop, you have to know where to look. Do you run the three Ws? Whitesprings, West Tek, Watoga. Lots of legendary spawns at each
---
Heck yeah!
---
That in combination with mutations would make building you character so much fun when looking from a min maxing perspective.
---
It's actually a great game. I asked for it for Christmas, probably paid full price and have played it daily ever since. Take your time, read all the notes and listen to the holo tapes. There are some epic stories in the game, the detail in everything is amazing.
---
The pillars never want to work when I do that, they complain about intersecting with shit that's apparently invisible.
---
Lvl 5 crook vs lvl 35 Boss
---
I've picked probably 20+ chainsaws up at the various locations and never seen anything other than a level 20. Level 50 would be cool. Do you have a screenshot o the damage with 200% repair?
---
The game takes Bethesda‚Äôs environment building and runs with it. Great big world to explore with cool stories from the past to discover within them. But as far as the deep choices and npc interaction you may expect from other fallout games, you won‚Äôt get any of that. It‚Äôs kinda just a foundation of a game that only recently found its footing. But the future seems bright. 
---
Is there another shop in Charleston besides the station and fire dept?
---
I just encountered something similar last night, except with protectrons. Responses said it's not uncommon for this to happen about an hour after a nuke has been dropped, probably something to do with the spawns having to return to normal once the blast zone clears.
---
People sell it between 20-50 caps each on the reg
---
Well that makes sense.  It does look like popcorn ceiling tile - because it sure as heck doesn't look very much like carpet.  I'm WAY disappointed in my atom shop purchase but at least I got it when it was on sale.
---
I play on PC at odd hours. So I'm either preventing my wife to enjoy watching TV or just chilling. Also I occasionally play before I go to work, while she is still sleeping. So it's not that easy. That's why I am up for text chat on PC. And the rare occasions I get to talk, I am bombarded by background noises from TVs, dogs, kids crying etc.
---
Best lead all month (and I'm not exaggerating) thanks bro. 
---
I've also seen the mods spawn in fort Venture. 
---
It's also used for making weapon/armor mods and a few explosives. 
---
If he killed the guy 6-7 times without being killed, it doesn't sound like this was a bait scenario though
---
No not with a vendor. Just the old world shops that have open doors is what I meant. One is a salon and one was something else not sure. The mask spawn will be on a shelf somewhere in them.
---
Yes, that is Furious. 
---
Regarding the bear, yeah. Holy crap. I noticed all the victims had their throats torn. 
---
You should check out life. Another indie scary movie.
---
I kind of thought that too but I thought it was kind of weird that what dropped was a lot of the exact same prefix legendaries. But maybe the game just got tripped up or something idk
---
Yeah the lvl1 turrets have very short range.
---

---
The crashed vertibirds and death claw nest are always there, I was sure to check them a few times to be sure. Unless they are just really reliable events lol, at that point I'll take them off the map.
---
Sorry, had to log out.  I'm on Xbox as well.  I will be on tonite around 7:00 CST, if you still would like this ammo and I can make more if you want.
---
On XB1 we can only hot swap 2 weapons so I hit left, left to confirm the 2 I want are ready.
---
Cool.  Let me know in the next 10 hours if you can't find the spot and I'll find it for you tonight.  It's only sometimes a snalygaster though.  I pass the area when walking from Watoga to South Mountain lookout (passing to the south of Big Bend Tunnel East).
---
It's easy to travel east in that area, but not so easy to travel west.
---
This is the game dynamic that dumbfounds me the most. Very few events trigger a 3 star legendary but you can get one star items from them? Who on earth designed that? 
---
Stars should indicate exactly what level loot will drop. You can still get total shit rolls on items but to fight a 3 star legendary queen mirelurk and get a one star wooden leg is just insulting. 
---
Here you go:
---
Port 88 (UDP)
---
Port 3074 (UDP and TCP)
---
Port 53 (UDP and TCP)
---
Port 80 (TCP)
---
Port 500 (UDP)
---
Port 3544 (UDP)
---
Port 4500 (UDP)
---
Where can I buy it?  
---
I am on XBox.
---
What platform? (not that it matters to where they spawn but I might have a spare on XB1...)
---
Thanks.  
---
Next time I am on for a decent amount of time (and a server that has been Nuked) I will farm my ass off!
---
Tfw you do get the legendary you want. And it spawned as a level 40. Whoa whoah.
---
Wahhh, I'm sick of getting killed with duped gear.   
---
PS4 :(
---
Ahh, sorry!
---
Also make sure you put on the green thumb perk just while you harvest to get double the amount 
---
eh, I'd say it's exactly like fallout 4 but no settlements. Instead there's a camp you can build mostly anywhere but around discoverable locations aswell as being able to load in next to your buds.
---
This is true. Failed at reading comprehension there didn't I?
---
I've been there like million times and never got other chainsaw than LVL20 WTF?
---
ESAD
---
Gods that place made me cry...
---
The content you find while exploring is nothing and boring if you compare it to the single player games. Would not buy. Don't get sucked into this unless you buy it for 10 bucks. And i still think you will ruin good memories of the fallout genre.
---
Lol yeah I see your point. I was just curious since all of the other shotguns I had didn't have the option to change to armor piercing. Was just trying to be even more efficient for things that I can't one shot. That was what I was trying to figure out hah
---
It's my favorite thing. Sack hood + Flaming Chainsaw = Wasteland fun.
---
Found it in one of the ski lodge buildings over by Rose.
---
This happens after the blast zone has expired; I will actually watch for the radius zone to disappear because then I can go in and collect nuked flora and masses/fluids without taking on rads.  As far as the robots go, I've also seen this happen on occasion.  About a month or so ago there were a lot of level 1 Legendary eyebots in the clubhouse.
---
I have Mods that still require flux to build them.  
---
Any idea where to buy plans/mods that don't need any additional materials to build?
---
I agree completely though.
---
I'm uploading as I progress the map. 
---
1. So people can help me find locations
---
2. So that when people do help with location it reduces how many people repeat the same location, helping me keep track of what I haven't located yet.
---
The numbering is literally the order I found and marked them, I'll be doing it over soon.
---
Any chance that those vending machines allow us to sell ammo? Still unsure why we can't sell ammo anywhere currently. 
---
Chameleon mutation - you can be invisible when you stand (if you draw your weapon).
---
Chameleon armor - you must crouch to activate stealth field.  
---
You must wear weightless armor or no armor for the mutation and there is no weightless chameleon armor (AFAIK), so when you say you can take a step per piece, you mean you can take a crouched step. 
---
Right?
---
I agree tha graphics/scenery is very well done, and I appreciate the level of effort put into it.
---
As for fast travel, I'm always overencumbered, so I can't.  The benefit is running across all the little critters that help build XP, albeit slowly). Bonus: walking everywhere does help with exploration and the discovery of new locations. 
---
Lack of fast travel ability is only bothersome if I am playing with a team that the other members can fast travel. 
---
They need to run an offer once the good vibe of the DLC hits, the only reason my daughter plays is because it was ¬£15, she likes a pretty camp, she spends atoms (more than her freebies).  
---
I wouldn't have shouted her a ¬£40-¬£60 game.
---
WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE FRED?
---
Cool. I had to pretty much abandon my main account  because I was starting to get a lot of really toxic messages and my kids use that account to play their Minecraft and Lego games and such and there is no reason they need to see that. 
---
My alt account is Manta__Man (2 spaces).
---
Going to rebuild my CAMP today back to pretty much what it is on my other character but than I'll hit you up on the friend request.  
---
It's VERY annoying, especially when you're building an elevated camp, come out of build mode, are now in third person and invisible and fall off the side of the building.
---
Ouch.  My new base is 9 stories above the ground on one side.
---
Okay good to know, thanks 
---
I'm sorry I don't.  I don't pick them up because heavy. I'll grab one next time is see one though. 
---
You have to be logged in for your resources to accumulate.   
---
I like that there is the church with a weapon bench and the alley behind the vendor bot with a chemistry bench, so you can keep scapping or repair as you clear out the place.
---
Hey mate, good job, didn't know for the fissure reopening since it didn't happen when I soloed this - I checked most of the fissures after the queen attempt and they were still closed, but as I stated in my post, my server was most likely bugged so...
---
I do have the whole footage which is 10 hours long / 150 Go big, which is way too big for my bandwith, so if you need a specific part just ask and I can cut whatever you need and post it.
---
Here is the French Discord btw: [https://discord.gg/Y5S6G9W](https://discord.gg/Y5S6G9W)
---
Exhibit A - Whiney Brat
---
Yeah 
---
Nice a reason to return! I didn't even know about this update! Nice suprise!
---
Thank you very much for your help! I think the ‚Äúmedium‚Äù setting is what I need to choose for a smoother gameplay..
---
Turretcampersayswhat?
---
Have two one is already promised to be sold but can sell the other if you want
---
Gotcha. There‚Äôs like a salon over there. I may have just messed up the spawn point by picking up a plan off the shelf. Only item I found over there. 
---
Nice. I‚Äôll try over there next. 
---
The correct term is assload
---
It's gonna be 15 lights? Oof. I hope it's at least 20
---
On PS4? What would you want for it? I‚Äôm going to check around a bit just in case I can find one but I may take you up on that. 
---
Coming here to confirm this is also an issue on PS4. Particularly after fast traveling or player death from my experience. 
---
And Super Duper when you make the Vegetable Starch.
---
I'm pretty sure those have to be in-game hours, much the same way your raw flux won't spoil if you log out at night and log back in the next day.
---
This seems related:
---
[https://portforward.com/fallout-76-connection-issues/](https://portforward.com/fallout-76-connection-issues/)
---
If you find one I'd buy it off you as well
---
I have one I believe on ps4 for free
---
On the mountain by location #9 there is many copper ore veins, and it is a great place to stay and overlook Appalachia, there is also a random satellite radio nearby made out of junk
---
I' ve just set the texture to Medium and OMG. It runs fine now. 
---
How the hell?
---
The resist on reload must be great on Black Powder weapons. Good find, man!
---
No, you buy the mods but you still need the materials to craft them.  I had to have both cobalt and violet flux for the jetpack on my T51b and yellowcake for the core assembly on my X-01, for example.
---
Whitesprings, search the sub for it...
---
I think the Ultricite was the exploiting ammo that was initially flagged, and the other ammo was listed to further cement Bethesda's case for banning him.  I mean it's all speculation, but that's what I think at least. 
---
What perk let's you repair 200%?
---
What aren't you one shotting? Mirelurk queen, sbq, and scorchbeasts? I could understand if the game was filled with difficult enemies but it really isn't. When I switched from Xbox to pc I decided I wouldn't player trade for weapons and armor (felt like I took some fun out of the game on Xbox by player trading myself into a demi god of the wasteland). I was level 120 something before I got a great gun. I was using a 1* vamp handmade and could destroy everything outside of the few enemies I listed above. Just me tho. I see a lot of people that wanna maximize their damage for whatever reason. Outside of sbq event, I go with qol perks over damage bc nothing is really all that threatening. Lol. Except for them damn mirelurk queens and that god forsaken acid spit. 
---
Completely agree. I'm tired of these rolling pins and meat hooks. Good lord, why are they even a thing? Like who actually has used them other than for lolz? 
---
Some of dont have the time or desire to do nothing but frind for legendaries. They should help with endgame. Not be the endgame
---
Meh, close enough.
---
I'm in the same boat and my psn is my username :) Feel free to add me 
---
Find something better to do
---
You can get better reload times with perks
---
I was actually about to say there's nothing else to do in the game except grind events or farm. I guess building camps is the end game haha. I agree they shouldn't be all there is to do
---
Good legwork! It might be nice to also see the random event locations since they are also unmarked.
---
At the same time if someone is streaming, you can watch the stream to see what's happening. I mean I am sure there are hundreds of thousands of people who have "afk-farmed" in mmos while doing other things in the background (like homework, which was the case for me 15 years ago) 
---
I personally haven't seen *any* mods that don't require you to have materials to build them.  Not all PA mods require flux, however, so those are usually easier to build.  Not sure which power armor model(s) you're running, but here's a handy reference for the X-01.  If you scroll down to the bottom of the page it lists the mods for each armor part, what the mod does and the required components.  https://fallout.gamepedia.com/X-01_power_armor_(Fallout_76)
---
I was the same during the launch. Watched all the youtube vitriol and was convinced it would be garbage.
---
Was finally worn down by my brother in law and picked it up (used). I've been playing daily having a blast. If you like Fallout 4, you'll like this.
---
If you're at all into role-playing, it feels *better* than Fallout 4 in a lot of ways, since you're not burdened with the "missing son" backstory, etc.
---
There's still some bugs, and the disconnects are annoying, but I'd recommend it.
---
Hope you get permission. I use your map a lot.
---
&gt;Fo76 barely has a story
---
It has more lore. There isn't an overall story unless you follow the overseer but lots of detail and lore has been built into the game if you take the time to read and listen. You learn about the Monsters, the FEV experiments, the clashes between miners and companies and so forth. 
---
I tend to think of it as a quarantine zone, where the scorched managed to push all remaining survivors out or kill them, even the BoS left and regrouped, leaving the unsuspecting survivors of Vault 76 to reclaim the land. 
---
You would be my hero if you do. 
---
Russian bots need homes too, you know
---
Thank you for your amazing help, my pc doesn't run so many programs during the game. Just Steam, Sapphire TRIXX, antivirus, Mouse software and the AMD Radeon settings.
---
BTW, I've managed that the "Medium" setting to Texture Detail is my solution. Even if it's not a beautiful graphic, at least I can play a smoother campaign! 
---
Again, thanks for your help! :D
---
My psn is YoungSpud-san I'll be on in an hour or so 
---
That's cool, congrats.
---
My idea of "fun" isn't sitting at Whitesprings killing the same mobs over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over. So I would rather buy/trade anyday.
---
Yup on PS4 and the other guy is paying 500 caps if you want it just message me and I‚Äôll add ya when I get home..happy hunting!
---
Enemy fire will indeed hurt you in pacifist mode.   Pacifist will not change that a single bit.
---
Pacifist just prevents \*you\* from damaging them.   The point is so you do not trigger PVP mode unintentionally.
---
Sounds like a kid that plays COD and never played FO before, but you have to be careful with these since most of the time it's just a group baiting you into PvP.
---
Before engaging someone who is harassing you, sweep the area thoroughly using VATs, if your perception is high you will find the high level buddies that are hiding nearby.
---
Very few players in this game pick fights while they are alone, specially against Higher level opponents.
---
If they are teamed, you can FT to a nearby location then sneak back &amp; kill their buddies.
---
Pm your psn and I can help out later
---
RIP mobile users 
---
Sounds like mine-craft is more your speed.
---
I also posted on /fo76bazaar. 
---
forget the caps...i have a Charge Card you can use instead!
---
For sure it's going a single Prestige for &gt;50.  A Lvl 51 and lvl 301 would prestige the same.
---
My friend has it and I have noticed how the Mysterious Savior is a extreme wuss.
---
But following percentage, my friend and I fight a lot and it usually shows up around *20%* of the time.
---
It's a quest location, so a lot of people will know about it.  My camp is just west of there, by the flagpole (Devil's Backbone area).
---
1) "You saying "it's interesting" doesn't suddenly make it so." - It's interesting to me.
---
2) "You for some unknown reason think otherwise." - Correct, it's called a different opinion.
---
3) I'm basing my opinions on my opinions. If you want to say that your opinions are fact, then go ahead; I doubt that you've spoken to every single person who is/ever was interested in Fallout though.
---
4) "Saying that 76 is a god-awful fps is an observation of reality tbh." It's not an observation of reality, it's arrogant to think that your opinions on objective topics are fact. I agree that it could be better.
---
5) Bad design (choice)?
---
6) Just your opinion, again.
---
7) I agree that it's a tired phrase, but it's true. I'd love to watch 'The Room' someday with friends.
---
8) Your last paragraph reads like a YouTuber's script. I think that 76 is the best map that they've created. Does it feel barren sometimes? To me, yes, but I've had a lot more fun than not having fun in 76. As I said before, I have an unusual fondness for inventory management lol.
---
This still all boils down to opinions (in my opinion). I think that you were expecting a different response, judging by your first response to me: " Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeey XD. Lol, Make yourself a cuppa beforehand, it's long as." I can live with someone having a different opinion on the game than me; can you?
---
I suspect that Bethesda has no way to log trades, thus no way of telling if items were in fact traded or duped. And are suspending people until they can implement such a system.
---
Can you guys test this theory? I don't know how you would go about it..
---
Nice work here. I haven't seen this discussed anywhere on this sub but there's a fun bloatfly cave way up north in the Mire. The cave itself isn't huge but it's full of dead animals so you could build a really gross cave base here. Always has around eight bloatflies and a few honeybeasts and is the best spot I've found for bloatfly syringer materials. Just run directly northeast from Freddy Fear's.

I believe it‚Äôs called fix it good. If your on PS4 I can do it for you if you need. Also dual bar and flamer are not currently in stores (maybe after next patch?) but I have a dual bar if you decide to buy one. 
---
It‚Äôs one of the raider faction camps you‚Äôre asked to visit during a certain quest chain. I‚Äôd like to add that their camp on the road nearby is also significant. It always has a pack of animals there and is filled with animal carcasses you can search with the perk for a ton of easy meat. 
---
Was that a jab at me? LMFAO how rude 
---
Thank you so much!
---
When you are on mountain tops like Seneca you can see regional weather effects happening, I would rather not be forced to carry a ski suit around. Besides I've been almost living in power armor for a while just to use fusion cores, it has its own climate control, maybe the ability to "power" wash out all the squeezed farts inside it. 
---
350+??? Mine fired my 3000+ when I tried it for the first time. Never fired another shot even though I collected a few of those heads later, including two-shot and bloodied. Patiently waiting for a fix so I could try it again but I‚Äôll only carry 20 cells with me and leave the rest in stash so I‚Äôll have some left if it‚Äôs still glitched. 
---
So you complain when they are forced to release a product that was 1/2 baked because of pressure to meet their deadline/release date, and now also complain when they push back a deadline because the product wasn't ready. 
---
How do they possibly win? Not tell us when or what is going to drop until it does? Because they tried that and this sub was livid about that too.
---
dropping a beer for the fallen homies is going to be my new hobby!
---
The Fallout community as a whole has always been toxic. It was toxic when 3 came out. It was toxic when NV came out. It was toxic when 4 came out. It‚Äôs toxic now with 76. 
---
The only thing that‚Äôs really changed about the community being toxic is that they do it on reddit now instead of other forums. Mark my words there will be plenty of toxic assholes with the next release too. 
---
Fallout‚Äôs toxic community. Fallout‚Äôs toxic community never changes. 
---
That's not a witch costume...
---
This is an amazing idea, but I'd just make the text a little bigger, make it white, and give it some sort of outline, but overall, this is really good.

it's only Tuesday. You'll find better. I have faith

You mean your post that has 10+ replies to it? 
---
You need the rolling pin to craft legendary oatmeal raisin cookies. 
---
Not all heroes wear capes - well done sir!!
---
I'd like to add my own input. It makes no sense to me why there are even stars on enemies. Why not just have legendary enemies and then they can drop whatever? Higher-level enemies have better chances of dropping better loot. Simple as that 
---
I'm on xbox, I have the flame mod I've been saving till I find a lvl 50 chainsaw 
---
Are you serious?  This blows my mind. I've been applying mods left and right without thought to material cost.  I swear I've done so when absolutely out of common things like steel/aluminum etc.  And now I'm at work and can't check this for myself.  Perhaps TiL and will be less cavalier about applying mods.
---
r/usernamechecksout
---
So you go farm caps and peruse Reddit markets over and over and over and over? Sounds fun. 
---
I just recently heard of this, so other than Whitesprings, are west tek and watoga doable solo?  Also, are these places regularly overtaken by the super elite solo players with the best weapons who can kill them all in one spray? 
---
Totally agree with this, plus I wouldn‚Äôt mind there being some actual real time weather systems. Like if it is winter in the Real world it can be winter in game. I mean right now the top of the world should be covered in snow, irradiated snow no less.
---
The key to said dome can be found in a locker at mount blair trainyard I believe.
---
Ah. Silly name. Never heard of them. 
---
scenes like this are what make the game so good at pulling at the heart strings....that shit is relatable unless you're a heartless monster
---
no
---
I removed my lights out of fearing a total camp pack up. Didn't want to have to rebuild.
---
I find it funny that the scorched are supposed to spawn in those awkward soon-to-crystallize poses, yet many players misinterpret it as a bug. 
---
Try the raider camps north of top of the world along the highway found one on a picnic table near some raider waterhole 
---
If he is random like Grahm people would search for him, and post holding him more often I would think.  I don't expect the trade in system to be as generous as the other user posted.  The example of 5 1\* for a singe random 2\* would be way to generous I would think.  I created a mule, then a second to hold the lengendaries I don't use and have saved around 1000 lbs of legendarily in the last few weeks since this was announced.
---
Yes, those too.  
---
THAT would be eerie as hell
---
I don't want to have people telling me I sound like a little kid because of how I sound on a mic.
---
I'm almost old enough to go and buy a beer, but I sound like a petulant child in recordings and mics.
---
I refuse to open myself up to ridicule.
---
That sounds like something a synth would say...
---
Collecting / managing resources is the point of Fallout games and won't be "fixed." 
---
My turrets have resorted to attacking me, they dont do damage but they don't allow to fast travel from my base as monsters near by.
---
tried Scrapping and remaking and the same deal
---
Yes people who play video games more than you will progress further in those video games. 
---
Played hours yesterday, out of a few dozens 3* I killed, only two dropped 3* loot, both were leather legs or something. All other 3* mob dropped only 1* items. It‚Äôs such a bait and switch game now. Seriously Bethesda if you don‚Äôt want people to get 3* items, that‚Äôs fine, but don‚Äôt mark the creatures as 3* to get people‚Äôs hope high then let them down. 
---
Get out.
---
I think you'll like it. Gameplay wise, this is the smoothest gunplay and fighting we've seen in fallout, and the new enemies are fresh and fun, and the returning ones aren't boring and have a few new tricks up their sleeves. The lack of NPC's was odd for me at first, but I eventually got used to it. Building isn't a required task, like in FO4, but it's definitely better, but it is more of an end game thing to build your camp into some mansion, as finding all the plans can be tedious and difficult. Exploration is fun, and I have enjoyed most of the game's new environments, as they all are very unique and different, each bringing something the last lacked. Bethesda is doing their best to remove all the bugs, but most of the game-breaking ones you heard about on launch are gone, so they shouldn't affect your experience. Overall, its a great game, and I think you will enjoy it.
---
Somewhere north of the Big Maw there is a small shack filled with bicycles and vacuum tubes. Place completely took me off guard. I found it only once, I cannot seem to find it again. Will have to upload the screen shot.
---
Especially since it‚Äôs been delayed. Things don‚Äôt get delayed unless something needs to change or be double checked before rollout
---
In order to recreate this glitch you have to have chameleon armor equipped as well as escape artist perk card under agility. You have to crouch to activate stealth then you have to keep moving backwards while going up and down standing to crouch. Hopefully Bethesda fixes this soon.
---
Don‚Äôt give in lady! That would set a dangerous precedent giving them instant gratification.
---
I'm all for it!
---
There are a few mistakes on the map though. There are two "26" red marks, and 31 Is listed twice.
---
I'll be fixing this when I update it with more locations.
---
No, they're not nearly as overrun as Whitesprings with players and once you do Mayor for a Day, Watoga itself isn't a problem at all. The building interiors are but 3s can spawn anywhere in the city, sometimes multiple. West-Tek is good for 2 spawns anywhere inside and maybe one outside, as there are quite a few around the area. By the time you clear Watoga then West Tek, Whitesprings should be free enough for you to travel over and retrigger spawns. Make sure you run the artisan shoppe patios/housing rows too, and check the employee parking lot behind the resort itself
---
Oh is that the REASON!? Well let me stop my work so you can read it before it‚Äôs done. /s 
---
So what I'd recommend is that first off, you need to increase the size of the fonts on the map by a factor of about 5 (about the same size as your size in the sidebar). Next, drop each point into a little coloured circle with a high contrast pair - black on white, white on black, yellow on black, green on yellow, etc. Then, you can post the pic to imgur if you like, or you can also p[ost it directly to reddit. But imgur works for a lot of us because we use RES ([Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com "also /r/Enhancement")  ) and with that you can actually scale and enlarge imgur files inline, so it's quite useful. Can't do that with reddit loaded images.
---
Different strokes different folks. I like throwing grenades in the air and pretending they're fireworks when they explode,  or using the flamethrower spinning around shooting in the air to make a fire tornado. 
---
That‚Äôs not a bad idea, it was a bitch getting my house positioned just right so that it didn‚Äôt conflict with any of the strangler vines or topography of the ground. I sure would hate to have to do it again because I had one to many lights 
---
And speed demon!
---
I make caps playing the game. I find legendaries, playing the game. 
---
I peruse Reddit markets occasionally, while I'm at work, and arrange purchases/trades for when I'm not. Like I'm doing now. So yes, I am most definately having fun not mindlessly farming at one spot for hours on end.
---
If you think farming at WS *is* fun, then all the power to you, which was my point.
---
Supposedly
---
I'd also like it if we could add a story to the name plates. "I came across this lvl 198 in a clearing at Whitespring. He had stopped to get a drink after greifing some lvl 10's. I patiently waited for him to get more into the clearing. I used my banked critical to one shot him." And below that could be the name plate [ bighairyballz69 level 198 ]
---
By posting the level of the PvP'd players we could laugh at anyone who only has low level player heads. 
---
Duping is back. The best part is, the npc vendors sell the duped items with an infinite stock after the player glitches them. God roll 3 stars that you have all been seeing are from a random vendor *cough* one people won't check often for 200-400 caps a piece. 
---
Just lost 7000 cells last night from a 3* quad I found.  üòí
---
But it would fit so well dont you think ? Not only would it drive home the fact that thousands, millions of people died within the blink of an eye, but their last pose burned into stone forever, remembering you where they were stood. The shadows of life. The dark schemes of a once living city that seemingly watch and follow you. 
---
God's work my friend. God's work.
---
If I quit to main menu and load back in it‚Äôs almost always a different server. 
---
If I use the ‚Äútry another world‚Äù option, it literally always puts me back in the exact same world. 
---
Normally my default running-around weapon, just for the extra 5 carry weight. Funnily enough, I have two stronger legendary ski swords that I use for heavy melee encounters, so I normally look like an angry chalet when I'm out roaming.
---
I always have a 5-star gunsmith on, and I go through durability pretty fast.  I just started repairing them to 200%, which does help a lot, but I've always felt that weapon durability eroded a bit too quickly.  (no luck of the draw though, already have too many luck points allocated).
---
That said, I tend to play in fairly small chunks, so I farm a lot, repairing isn't really taxing for me.  In fact, weapon/armor repair is one thing that held me back from buying the game for a long time, I really dislike that mechanic.  But it's manageable (keep a backup weapon just in case though!)
---
I mean you're grinding for a weapon either way. One you earn by finding yourself, the other you earn by trading with players. Depends on whether you're excited by wheeling and dealing or by hitting the lottery. I personally find a lot more gratification in finding things myself.
---
hopefully :)
---
So was it bad karma i took the blocks and scrapped them for wood I needed - I got's a barn to build...
---
I bet that recipe is..... &lt;.&lt; &gt;.&gt; legendary
---
This is what I don't get either.  Fallout has always been shades of grey and encouraged evil. But everyone who is so is automatically labeled a griefer.  I get the feeling people just want fallout minecraft, not an actual fallout game.
---
I really think there has to be something to all this... BGS wouldn't have wasted time on the graphics/animations of the fissures opening and closing just for it to be completely useless....right???
---
West of #5 on the mountains there is a little raider outpost the (once) spawn a PA 
---
Thank you! I'm not great with using Reddit, or imgur. First time posting pictures was about a week ago lol.
---
The main reason I uploaded was to spark people to help find locations, the actual map is a very rough draft of what I think It should be.
---
I'll use your suggestions.
---
Agreed. I've gone out of my way to fight 3* mobs that end up soaking bullets and give shit for loot. Such a let down!
---
At the south mountain lookout there is a note from someone who was living there saying 'they' took his dog and he's gone looking for him and if he doesnt return to pour one out for Rufus. When you go to the raider camp nearby, the Freakshow there is a man and dog locked in a cage and the dogs name is Rufus
---
Yes and no, it depends on what you liked doing in 4 to be honest.
---
If you where more of a ‚ÄúI like helping settlements and making impactful decisions‚Äù guy, then fallout 76 would currently be unable to sate you. Though that may change with future content updates (Wastelanders looks like the most likely)
---
If you where into just wandering about, exploring, looting, building up your own home and stumbling into the small stories told with the environment and terminal entries... then Fallout 76 is exactly that part of Fallout 4 taken and made into its own game. Of course your friends can come now too, and other humans are a bit less predictable since they are all real people.
---
Yep, exactly.
---
You dare abandon the hunt?!
---
 Joke. Besides that though I dont know... Cant you already befrend animals and make them camp pets? Idk it be right to just make them spawn ever hour instead of hunting them userself. Even then someone would just come along and shot them
---
I guess maybe it's just the unicorn factor.  Finding a 3\* enemy - especially when you're not farming for one - should be a special moment.
---
Of course, op remarks, it's a moment undermined by how they simply will not drop an actual 3\* item most of the time.
---
Added. If I‚Äôm not on it‚Äôs because I work nights and need to sleep daytime. I‚Äôll check to see if your on later.
---
I have a bunch of plans right now, maybe I have one you can use in exchange. 
---
Are your crops damaged? Most enemies attack crops first. How many plants do you have I used to have around 30 each if I recall it really hurt my camp budget.
---
Congrats! That is an awesome find. I still haven't been blessed with any explosive drops, but I killed two 3\* yesterday and each gave me a 1\* Fat Man. I guess it kind of balances out lol
---
Cool I'll be on in like 20 minutes 
---
oh absolutely....it'd be another level of depth to add to the already significant untold stories around the land
---
Oh ok I‚Äôll stay up for a bit. 
---
SSD can help, borderless windowed mode sometimes helps.  You're using a graphics card that was out LONG after Win7 was 'obsolete', not sure how that helps/hurts.
---
There have been a couple posts about optimizing settings (.ini file tweaks) that I'm sure could help - it was a longish post, see if you can track that down as well.
---
Yep just let me finish my breakfast and I'll be on 
---
I've never heard anyone ridiculed for the way they sound, and who cares what they assume, I'm 58, and no one ever assumes that I'm an old guy, but most guess that I'm from Texas (something about the accent they say).
---
Most assume everything from what you say, not the sound of your voice.
---
Could someone drop a picture of it? 
---
naaa...as long as you felt bad for a minute before putting up your walls.....it's like an organ donor, one's sacrifice helps another survive 
---
Shotgun damage is based on the number of pellets that make contact with an enemy. Each pellet acts as an individual projectile, and has it's own damage. Server lag, enemy level/health pool, and shot placement are likely your culprits.
---
I felt guilty taking all the toys from the top to scrap, but I left the blocks. I couldn't do it lol.
---
Okay so what do the stars even mean? That's my point. 1 *, 2 *, 3 *. They all drop random star legendaries. So why even have the stars on them?
---
Oh, sweet, I will have to check these out! Great job üëçüèª
---
The ones I notice are normally in beds, and just assumed it was a weird sex thing for the lonely single people left behind.
---
um.. Not really??
---
Carnivore can eat any meats from anything killed and not worry about diseases??!!
---
I have it, and I just bring water when I go out. Thats it.  No need to carry any food at all.  Just shoot something and eat it.
---
Or if desperate, equip the corpse eating perk and much on something that way.
---
Fire nado sounds dope as hell to be fair. Lol
---
What about VATS? Is it usually as unpredictable as free-aim? For me shotty's are unpredictable however using VATS brings more of a consistency.
---
My guess is that this game handles spread really weirdly (or it *is* just server performance based) and since VATS give you a garenteed shot from up close, every pellet hits it's target.
---
I've had this issue on xbox since launch.
---
This is the type of PVP exchange that can be very entertaining.  The open mics are classic.
---
I joined in a group a couple of weeks ago w/their workshop and some kid with a squeaky voice accidentaly shot me in the skirmish and said ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt one shot me sir!!!‚Äù   Too funny.  His voice alone was reason to give him a pass lol 
---
Betcha you've never met a 17-year-old who sounds like one of the cringy kids on GTA, either.
---
I'd be decimated, believe me.
---
Or I'm just overreacting, I dunno, both are possible
---
Well, the Meat Hook is one of the "broken" weapons in the game, so that's not necessarily a bad thing.
---
But yes, there is a lot of useless stuff that comes up in the Legendary pool because there are a lot of useless weapons in the first place.  No one would use a Pool Cue, Rolling Pin or Boxing Glove, but they come up with alarming frequency in Legendary drops because the odds of getting junk like this are at least 3x that specific "Pump-Action Shotgun" you might actually want.
---
This is on PC though. First time i've ever encountered it.
---
Brahmin &amp; other game animals are non-existent in some areas, besides it's only fair since the vegetarians get their Corn &amp; Tatos.
---
That is on my todo, and just got my first key card yesterday. Maybe I'll launch one this weekend. I've beaten someone else's SBQ, it gave me nothing.
---
Yeah... I'll probably end up spam farming Toxic Larry's. It's just rough - want thousands, not hundreds heh.
---
Yes and no, I'm looking forward to the roadmap. Just not sure there's a lot of extra content though.
---
If you make new perks, make certain the existing perks do not buff energy weapons then. 
---
Like Rifleman perks do buff Gause rifle.     Remove ability of it to use Rifleman/Commando and only the energy perks can buff it.
---
You got downvoted but I still think it's funny
---
Was just commenting so ya didnt feel completely alone with this.
---
Fab! If you need a hand with anything, let me know - I think it's a terrific and fun map.
---
Think about it tho. If you have a chance to get perk cards from legendary enemies people are gonna farm them. Places like WhiteSprings are gonna be the only place people want to go because of the abundance of them. If there is a limit of maybe 2 or 3 at one time that would be better but it would still draw focus to certain areas. Also what are some of your thoughts for perk cards, are they pvp based, are the pve based, do they have a passive ability?
---
I can‚Äôt tell you how many legendary 3* deathclaws I have killed at WS and have gotten jack shit.  
---
My best drop was SBQ kill and got a prime plan and a couple of X01 armor plans.  That‚Äôs about it 
---
I hope you have a good homeowners insurance policy those balcony railings don't look too safe.
---
Don't they represent difficulty? a 3* enemy is harder than a 1*?
---
If that's what holds you back then just don't ever play it lol ,a 1/4 of your play time is getting food making it and what not, it fun 
---
Good idea, I have not gone back to the Vault but I imagine by now it's all secondary toons instead of actual new players. I may be wrong?
---
Weapon Artisan, not Fix it Good.  Fix it Good is for armor and Power Armor.
---
I was wondering about this. If you put your camp there in that little barn or next to it, will the rare vendor there in Charleston still spawn in? Can you get banned for having a camp too close to a vendor spawn or train station? I really want to build this little bar &amp; grill right across the street from the station, and it shows that I can build a camp there, but I don't want to end up getting in trouble or nothing because it stops the vendor from spawning.
---
Thank you for the feedback...this question got downvoted so fast, so I am happy that someone responded.
---
I disagree, it's going to increase farming and grinding... The legendary perkis a good idea but not if it's a drop from legendary ennemies
---
I've seen the dual bar and flamer in Watoga Station.
---
For whatever reason, Chainsaw mods seem like a permanent fixture there, but it's random which one you'll see.
---
People keep reading their post wrong. Reread it and look at the text on the pictures. They are rolling these out over the course of a few months. ‚ÄúStarting in March 12 and appearing over several weeks.‚Äù
---
The only thing we are getting out of that tomorrow seems to be brewing and distilling. 
---
Having used it for what will be 100 lvls in a little while, I have learned to not pull the trigger in vats mode until I have 95%. When I am not using vats for perfect headshots, I zoom in before shooting. 
---
When farming uranium fever I take down the workers in two shots to head, or three shots to the body zoomed in. I am also using most of the cards you are, and enforcer if you didn't mention that card.
---
Any other manner of playing with the shotgun seems to waste the ammo for me. 95% headshots or zoomed in body shots are about all I ever do. I hope this was of some bit of help to you, and not just useless rant.
---
You want to access the 'Looking for Group' Feature either from the little badge next to fallout on your left dashboard menu, or the multiplayer tab on the dashboard, or the Xbox app on a mobile device. 
---
If you don't see someone selling it I would recommend creating a post to the effect of 'Paying Xcaps for flux'. Stay on your toes when trading though, flux is a junk item and can be stolen from you if the trade goes awry.
---
Awesome C.A.M.P. you have there!  
---
Check the dates on the picture they included in their post. 
---
Take my gold!
---
Thanks...  was that in the linked page?  I'm gonna save it.
---
As someone who liked the exploration, crafting and building in FO4 the best I did notice the lack of NPCs a lot. When they said every person you encounter is a player I thought OK, well there's still gonna be loads of interesting non-human characters. I was wrong. There are lots of generic robot quest dispensers, generic robot merchants, some AIs on terminals, recordings of dead people, one unique super mutant merchant and Rose, the only (!) fleshed out NPC who has an interesting character, a questline and a physical body.
---
Nope. Doesn't seem to represent difficulty at all. I have no idea what they represent
---
Recently? Lately I only seen long bow bar. It would be cool if it‚Äôs back. Luckily I nabbed a few of each and have been selling to those searching. 
---
That's an interesting way to look at it, and not inaccurate.
---
Unplayable?  Hardly.  That's extreme exaggeration.
---
I am level 140 and have 240+ hours into the game and mostly wear self crafted armors and have self crafted handmade.   
---
I can play it just fine?  3-5 shots on any mob and I can kill it.   I use terrain and mobility to out maneuver mobs so don't get hit too much.
---
As for ruined economy?  Duping did that already.    Why do you think people are charging 100k for 1 piece now?  Because Nuka-Cola duping flooded the caps...
---
If duping did not exist, the prices would be far lower than current prices.
---
This does not affect me in the slightest either because I never buy from players.
---
I'm gonna step back my previous comment a bit, didn't mean it to sound negative. I have both found/bought weapons, and I'm happy with them all. 
---
Congrats again, you got a great gun. 
---
ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è find a better way to relay. Your comment came off as sarcasm IMO. Like you were shitting on this dude for being happy about what he found. Didn't sit right with me. 
---
Thank you!  I am at the point where i can window shop Whitesprings and get 1 legendary, but thats only if its not over run or nuked or someone just running through it to clear it.  Also out of stimpacks but working on the pharma perk, its 2 star.  Using a melee build mostly.  Using a mole man claw thing lol, anyways, still working on the build, only about level 36 but progress is slowing down a lot right now.
---
Can confirm. I just started using a crossbow and noticed this problem. Based on my search you're the other person to bring this up.
---
I'm not sure how in the world Bungie could sue Beth... That's a ludicrous idea. I guess Activision should sue EA because BF and COD are both FPS war games right?
---
The patch notes will come out when the server is down for maintenance as usual. So yes, they will be delayed a day as well.
---
Yeah, apologies, didn't mean it that way. Haven't gotten through my coffee yet..
---
I'm not suggesting a direct damage buff, I'm suggesting that there should be anti-Energy Resistance perks so that they can at least compete with ballistic since they get anti-armour perks *and* a legendary effect, there's nothing like that for energy weapons.
---
''Tis a glorified Monday as well. I know the feeling my dude. 
---
I think he means the perks for armor penetration. Right now they dont qork for energy weapons.  All they need to do is either add a perk like tank killer but for energy weapons or make the existing ones effect ER as well. The damage boosting perks are fine and work as intended. The only problem right now is that if you have a laser rifle and a combat rifle and say they have the same damage the combat rifle can do more damage because it can benefit from anti armor perks where the lazer rifle can not.
---
The only time it should not work is in combat or caution. When hidden it should give you health. But I dont know about if your getting rads. Never check about that but I have like 9 mutation on atm 
---
I dunno, I imagine that they'd want you to go through the quest again. Having it be literally "go kill stuff to level 50 again" would turn a lot of players off. It's what I'll do, because it's far more efficient than questing (especially if you have a friend power level you), but I can't see a lot of people going for that.
---
I was gonna but I figured it be better if I tried to give an answer, at the end of the day 76 is a survival game like day z and 7 days to die ,if you can't enjoy the little things like getting food avoiding things that get you sick then it's not your game ,but if your good at getting material like in f04 then just while you're getting that's stuff then you might enjoy it ,I didn't like it at first but I got used to it quick 
---
What's the file path for the map texture and which BA2 is it in?
---
I can repair it for you, if your on PC 
---
Weapon artisan is what let's you repair it to 200% 
---
Currently they only show up at level 20
---
I wouldnt be mad if I could use all my cells at once and "final flash" the SBQ. But yeah that bug sucks.
---
Nope.  me either, my caps are going to buy those high price decoration plans from vendors!  
---
My hard earned caps going towards stuff I wont ever make!
---
You didn't even mention the level.
---
I've had a few very good rolls weapons... on low level shit. 
---
I've an explosive vampiric 10mm, looted by my explosive-specialized character. AWESOME. Except it's level 15. (I still use it because it's a very good heal actually).
---
I've a 3 star pitchfork furious with other nice affixes. Level 5. Too bad, would have done great RP tool.
---
And two days ago a 3 star grognak vampiric. Level 30. WHY GODS WHY.
---
This is 10000% true!  You can easily tell when something is being duped by looking   market place.  Trying to dumb everything for the patch.  Takes 30 mins of looking and you can tell what they are.
---
Well this went a little far. ....
---
&gt; Congrats again, you got a great gun.
---
Thank you, I will cherish it forever... I'm not OP lol
---
I am struggling to find the freaking plans for calibrated shocks for the X-01.
---
;)
---
Oh I see. thank you for explaining.
---
Save it and sell it to me when you get 500+. I'll pay you more than the vendor.
---
I'm guessing he will be a traveling vendor around the ash heap
---
You definitely won't get banned, but you may have your camp destroyed when people try to find the vendor and see your camp blocking the spawn. I don't thing people care as much about the vender as they used to, so you could take your chances.
---
Damn was hoping to play while WoW was having maint , oh well would rather you guys get it right over anything else.
---
It's a minor pain, but I just make 20-40 soups at a time, and suppementing it with crap you find, they'll last several play sessions without having to worry about it.
---
When I see a red bar in my AP, I pop some.
---
People say the vendor just respawns somewhere else. You wont get banned for putting a camp anywhere the game lets you put a camp. Also I know some people that will destroy your camp if it is there. So its up to you. 
---
Xbox One.
---
It is hilarious to spend the whole nuke zone time closing the clubhouse double doors on those bases. I don't take down the base, I just stand behind the doors and close them whenever they open. And when a swarm comes, i draw them around the corner to melee. Oh, the cursing messages I get!  Lol.
---
Bethesdians.
---
I realize it's easy to get meat, I keep Dog food on my Favorite wheel, and eat spoiled meat most of the time cause I don't bother cooking unless I need the carry bonus, but there are fruit &amp; veggies literally everywhere on the map, and most can be cultivated in your CAMP, so why not Meat.
---
The game does not check camp spot availability until after you enter the server. If you sue a very popular spot you will end up cycling through a lit to find (or not) a server.
---
Hey I'm back on now. Let me know when you'll be on so we can make some trades. 
---
Also a lot of people build there, so there is a far better chance that your camp will not be placed when you log in because someone is already in your spot.
---
I have a full X-01 armour set but cannot find the calibrated shocks anywhere.  
---
I have decided to build another set with T-60 legs!
---
I don't think the Overseer's mission is bugged.  I believe we have simply completed as much of it as we can at the moment but that there will be more overseer quests in future DLC
---
I don't really mind having my camp destroyed per-se, I'm just worried about the bot not being spawned in because my camp was in the way somehow.
---
Don't know but I know vats crit go through it
---
Screws and Springs are pretty common when you know what to look for (Desk Fans, Battered Clipboards).  You just learn to take them whenever you find them and you'll have plenty.
---
Gunsmith drastically improves the durability of guns, and Weapon Artisan allows you to over-repair them to 200% condition, in some cases improving damage as well.  Unless you're using an explosive weapon, you'll almost never think about repairing them.  For armor, Fix it Good repairs it to 200% condition and confers additional defensive bonuses.
---
I'm sure they would find a way, the current state of the industry anything is possible, I mean thanks to Sony cyberpunk might get overly censored and other platforms will be screwed over, Bethesda are being lawsuited and possibly sued over the use of the redfall name for ES6 so at this stage I hope it happens, they deserve what they get at this stage
---
I would reduce the size by 25% and decorate more but that's just my style. I really like the building design and location!
---
you're\*
---
I see.  Hm.. Well i have used the Plasma Gatling and it does very good damage without the Anti-Energy perks.  
---
But many of the other weapons are lacking.
---
The gause rifle is pretty good though, the damage on that thing outdid most rifles on just damage alone.   It seemed to do higher health damage than my best rifle as well when it hit, despite the penetration perks.  not sure if the gause rifle is using penetration or not though.
---
I like griefers. they present an actual challenge. 
---
About 10 each. I didn't see if they were damaged or not, but I will check!
---
Wanna come see my bar near there? Sometimes it can have trouble placing, but not very often. 
---
Just gets a lot of traffic and sometimes low levels build camps near there
---
I didn't think of that, thanks!
---
Oh. I thought it only spawned in that one little area there in front of the Train Station.
---
Just to clarify...I troll the whole map for the stuff im looking for..not just WS. 
---
I also enjoy team play, and the occasional PVP.  searching for rare plans/items is actually a lot like playing a slot machine.  You sit there for hours and hope you'll hit it big. When you do, its awesome. Diff. here is that it doesnt cost a dime to hit the jackpot.
---
I remember the shitter over the edge and it had a dozen bear traps around the perimeter I kept stepping on. 
---
Because, I would argue, that's not how it's supposed to work.  A 3\* should *always* drop a 3\* Legendary, not "This enemy has a chance of dropping a 3\* Legendary."
---
There‚Äôs a couple mannequins near Aaronholt Farms with a note that attacks us vault dwellers for leaving them outside to rot while we sat in comfort underground. Even though it‚Äôs just a game, and I had no choice but to spawn inside the vault, I still felt sad for the others. Why you do dis to me, Bethesda?!
---
They are still thinking what the "much more" announced for the patch is and can't find anything...
---
There are quests and events and objectives, and most of them are voiced over, there's just no physical NPC there to have a conversation with.  This can be a big turn off for some people but for other people like me it never really bothered us because you still get a story, you still get to listen to the recordings and read about what happened.
---
This is less an RPG game and more a survival game like Minecraft where you explore, farm resources, and build a base.  The focus is less on quests and story but there is definitely some there, it just isn't handed to you in cut-scenes and dialogues.  The detailed world Bethesda games are known for is there, there is a backstory and lore, and all the crazy creatures and weapons are still here.  Instead of raiders you have Scorched, which are like a cross between ghouls and burn victims they use weapons and will group up on you like super mutants.
---
The perk system is a little different.  I think there are more perks than Fallout 4 had, so you will eventually want to decide on what type of character build you want focusing on a type of weapon and whether you want to rely on power armor.  You can eventually get all the perks to switch between multiple builds it will just take a while to grind the xp.
---
Being a survival game, there is a strong focus on resource management.  Managing inventory because of weight restrictions will be somewhat of a hassle so you will likely want to use some perks that reduce the weight of things.  There will be times where you will have to sell or scrap a decent item instead of being able to just bank it.  Also maintaining thirst and hunger will be a constant though once you get a basic farm and water purifier set up at your base it's less of a hassle.
---
Being multiplayer you can't pause or save scum, when you die you drop all your junk items which other players can loot and will disappear when you log out, but as long as you occasionally drop junk off at your stash it isn't a problem.  Dying has never been a hassle for me and I don't even consider myself a good player.  I've maybe died only a dozen or so times in 100 hours of play and 99% of the time I've been able to run back and get what little stuff I dropped no hassle.  The game really isn't that difficult.
---
I haven't done much pvp and I've personally never had to deal much with griefers, I think only once or twice in 100 hours of play.  You do lose caps if you engage in pvp and another player kills you.  If you turn pacifist mode on and don't shoot at other players you have nothing to fear.  Players can attack you if you claim a workshop however as they designed to be contested areas, but if you claim one somewhere out of way from other people you likely won't have an issue.  I've only had one person kill me at a workshop and it was because it was one of the more desirable ones that produce fusion cores.  Most of the time people will leave you alone at workshops.  Most people are actually quite friendly and may even give you spare ammo and crafting schematics if you are lower level.
---
I didn‚Äôt realize that. Thanks for the information! That makes things much easier.
---
So... its just a variety-cooking thing, not a Quality-Of-life thing?
---
So mainly more content/things to do at camp.
---
Really good idea as I've thought before that there must be a lot of players who donvt go online to read about what's going on with the game and get confused when things change. Could be similar to how Halo games link to the Halo Channel. 
---
Just move ur camp and you should be able to build again
---
isn‚Äôt there an additional audible when the second projectile hits? 
---
Sure! I'll come check it out.
---
yeah, right? even faster reload by %15 isnt as good as +250 dmg resist. :)
---
a 3\* can regenerate more times than a 1\*.... i mean, if you don't 1-shot it in the first place lol
---
There‚Äôs an hour,  after taking the serum, where the negative effects are suppressed.  They‚Äôll be in full force after that hour though.
---
I know right? What are the chances there was a bug in their next update? 
---
Oh right, 100%. There was a one hundred percent chance there would be a potentially game breaking bug on their next update, just like every other update.
---
I'm slow traveling everywhere, but only because I'm encumbered (950 lbs). :(
---
Don't forget about levels... I got an instigating hunting rifle level 40... so close...
---
That's not how any of this works
---
I can read the patch notes outside too
---
It's the same on PS4 as well. 
---
I used the Boost app on Android and it let me download an HD version of your photo.
---
Tried that after failing to store it.   It‚Äôs just gone now.  Pretty sure it‚Äôs still eating up budget though.
---
gold for Speed Demon serum production
---
I'd say within the last month.  I know I bought a Chainsaw Flamer curious to find out if it was for the Chainsaw or the Flamer, and I ended up giving it to a friend who likes Chainsaws.  I would agree that the Long Bow Bar seems to be the most common.
---
When I said that 20 hours ago it had three comments (one mine) and one updoot. At the time it hadn't gained much traction, making my statement accurate. If you want to call me out on more non-static information, feel free to look at my posts the last couple of weeks where I claim to be level 23, then 50, then other levels. I must be so full of shit, given that if you saw me logged in this morning, I'm level 81. Heck, go back far enough in my post history and I refer to my wife objecting to things. She's now dead; how can she object to things?
---
Don't know what that is, got the best picture I could from Google and used MS paint to make everything else. Hope that helps lol
---
Nah, then everyone would complain about "increase the drop rate, hur dur, I'm not getting what I want"
---
Banned no, but presence of your camp will disable possibility to spawn rare vendor, so it's up to you if you want to risk your camp being destroyed...
---
I havent had this problem and have pretty much always ended up in a new world where my camp was placed when I load.
---
my camp is at a non popular location though. even with a steady brahmin spawn for infinite rib eyes when I go home
---
The Gauss rifle from memory is ballistic damage alone so it'd use Tank Killer and I haven't heard much from the Plasma Gatling cause people were complaining more about it breaking too quick though Plasma weapons (rifle, pistol, etc) I heard were very lackluster since they had to deal with both DR and ER. Similar case for the Shishkebab too though it had other issues to deal with as well.
---
Thank you so much for explaining this - could not find this info anywhere. Does he say anything after the hour is up like "oops, sorry about that" or is it up to the player to discover the negative effects of the mutation? 
---
Also I'm so glad that I don't have to purchase the serums to get a better form of the mutations as 19k is way too expensive.
---
&gt; What about VATS?
---
In VATS it seems to work fine 99% of the time, I think VATS concentrates all the pellets as close as they can be and increases their speed which offsets any server lag/inaccuracy which can fuck with the damage.
---
Your clan name could be "The Labiaraiders"
---
No thanks, I prefer the stability of the servers without them
---
Yes, it needs an official response. Hopefully, it will be something like "bans are not getting lifted".
---
How are their actions unjustified, though? This is like any other multiplayer game: you cheat, you get banned. It's simple.
---
considering there's only a Nuka-Girl mascot, no there currently is no male version.
---
not a bad idea for future content, though. maybe we find a prototype suit at a Nuka-Cola employee's house? ...nah, who am i kidding. they'll just shove it in the Atom shop.
---
Okay, so I got it up the tree above the junk node and I can indeed build 8 stories.  Next question: how did you build your overhanging roof?  It will only attach the bottom of the slanted one for me, not the top.  Did you use a half wall above the ceiling with a triangle rib and hang the roof from that?  In mine the out-of bounds area is just above the ceiling, so I can make an overhanging roof (I like the Frank Lloyd Wright style), but that's about it.  I can't go down a level because I'm actually built directly on top of the tree that the camp is in and it ends just below the 8th floor.
---
Xbone here: I know upon login, fast travel, and entering/exiting PA to check my alt weapon. Login and fast travel are more intermittent. PA enter/exit is more consistent. 
---
I haven't seen any unjustified actions. Just dupers and liars who have been proved wrong.
---
See the upvote button to the left? "This" is what that is there for.
---
Their comrpomised body systems cant handle the dose.  Its science.
---
Ok I'm on sorry for the wait
---
Might be talking about the liars like the 900 hours asshole who were proven wrong.
---
Ahh, okay. Someone said earlier though that it may just spawn somewhere else. Is there another spawn location for that rare vendor bot or does it only spawn there in that spot?
---
Troll comment keep it out of here
---
Troll comment
---
The Legendary Spawn rate is all over the Map right now, very server dependent, and unreliable, so WS on one server may produce only a few legendary enemies, while another server spawns them continuously (I've killed nearly 50 in under 30 minutes).
---
I'm not completely sure the number of stars displayed beside an enemy name means anything, other than that's how many character spaces were still available, since many non legendary (By name anyway) drop legendary gear (including 3\*).
---
I believe the Top Tier weapons were planned to be very Rare, but Duping destroyed all hope of balance and player trading as it was meant to be.
---
Hopefully the Legendary Vendor, and Player vending in the near future will help restore some of the lost balance, until then I will continue to farm &amp; sell legendary gear (Fair Trade Only) to those who can't find it.
---
Glad that doesn't happen to me! I would be forced to moan about it! (Probably on reddit.) 
---
What are you saying?
---
Oh I had 3 star Plasma Gatling and it was way powerful.  I could use it on 3 mobs and it would break.  Or halfway through 1 SB.   No doubt about that, but it did incredible damage.  This was 200% repaired and Gunsmith equipped.  No heavy weapon perks at all too.
---
I had my camp in that very spot and nothing happened.. well except the occasional mutant wreaking my crops. 
---
I just figure that cheaters represent a certain type of gamer... and an influx of that type of gamer is bound to change the feeling of the game.
---
Cool. Starting in close to 30 mins, I‚Äôll be on all day. 
---
GT: Rocky Two Milli
---
I‚Äôll be online. Come check it out. Hands down, best establishment in the Eastern Wastes. 
---
Free drink on the house when you show up
---
Yea, that's rough. Here's hoping it's better this patch.
---
lmao troll comment? You cheat you get banned, tough shit.
---
I'm still confused to whether there was a bomb drop in wv or not.
---
I would beg to differ as well, on the grounds that you don't need to max out your damage to survive PvE in this game.
---
One of my bigger regrets was doing exactly what you prescribe - maxing out Slugger and Expert Slugger as soon as I could.  No, the better move is to take one Rank of each, then of Master Slugger, and if you feel you need more, then take more.  But the diminishing returns are real.  It's better to spend 3 SPECIAL points for 30% damage than 9 for 60%, and spend your savings in something like Martial Artist or Incisor which will benefit all melee weapons.
---
Indeed. The lack of maturity in these people surprises me. If you fucked up, at least have the decency to accept punishment.
---
this is good info, i hope someone at Bethsoft is reading this!!!!!!!
---
Carnivores can produce meat at any weapon bench in game. Make a gun and shoot it.
---
That that is this that this is there for.
---
And yet, anyone who wants a TSE handmade and a full set of assassin's armor already bought one before they reset the duped items. Pretty much anything you want is still available on the market. To the rich go the spoils.
---
I first found that during the stress test, and legitimately had to put my controller down for a minute. 
---
hope you're very, very strong, because the MR gauntlet weighs a tonne.
---
Okie Dokie! Thanks man.
---
LMAO 
---
&gt;Seems the large volume of unjustified actions have been rampant.
---
Banning cheaters is justified keep your pants on and be glad they didn't permanently ban you.
---
&gt;TROLLS AND HATE MAIL KEEP IT TO YOURSELF. This is a legitimate concern and needs a official response.
---
Ohhh all caps you must be super cereal
---
https://youtu.be/h05YfP_8UsU 
---
You're welcome.  I would say another problem currently with energy weapons is plasma weapons are not hit scan and with server lag you can miss alot of shots that seem to hit.
---
Some people screwed this game early with exploits...if one decides to use the exploit rather than report it, then this is what happens.  No ban lift BGS! People that can abuse the game to such an extent are not likely to change.  They'll just find another exploit and not report it.
---
I have noticed a weird number of younger kids playing lately. last night i came across a level 13 who had the most pathetic camp ever. not even a bed. i'm not super high leveled (im in the 50's) but i brought him over to my camp so he could rest and get water and the like. then game him some supplies and advice.
---
the main thing i told him was not everyone is as nice as me so he should initially trust nobody. also, drop the 200 fusion cores he was carrying into his stash box... some "nice" other player gave them to him... don't know if they were duped or not but they were loading down his carry capacity so.
---
his older brother logged on and joined us. he thanked me for being nice to his "newb brother" and gave me a gun. i mean, the gun sucks compared to what i have, but the gesture was appreciated.
---
the point is, don't be an asshole just cuz someone is a kid. sometimes they just need help. and if they have a nice older sibling who will thank you with free weapons, bonus.
---
I have read that AA can do 38% more damage because of the penetration.  So its always better.
---
I can add this mod after 6pm EST this evening if you still need it. I think I have all the mods for Handmade, def sure I have Suppressor.
---
It does spawn. Ive seen camps there and the vendor.
---
^ this
---
I also enjoy the fact that they think the amount of time played somehow makes them more credible.
---
Considering duping is going crazy again it definitely won't be this week.
---
&gt; I've a 3 star pitchfork furious with other nice affixes.
---
Same, 40% swing speed increase and +1 str. It still sucks dick, don't be upset about that one.
---
the Red Rocket jumpsuit is exclusive to the atom shop, I believe. at least, i haven't found it in the game itself.
---
Ive stopped building much at workshops because of  the threat of random disconnects, now i make just a few turrets to protect the resource collectors, and some strategic spike trap boards, which work very well to section off areas, most enemies seem to be incapable of moving past them until they attack and break them
---
also, i found if you really build up a workshop then griefer/raiders really want to take them more than if you do minimal work on them
---
Yellow or white would stand out pretty good.
---
Its a great map mate and a great idea. Will definitely give people are a bit bored something new to do!
---
Just junk, toss them and go to [Cryptonuke.com](https://Cryptonuke.com) or whatever its called.
---
It was attempt at putting a puzzle in the game for players to solve before launching nuke. 
---
Same here on PS4. Can't tell you how many times my guy breaks out into doing the robot in the middle of a gunfight because I run out of ammo, switch to fists, realize I need a gun, open Pip and switch to a gun, realize my secondary is now set to fists, switch to fists anyway because I'm a moron, switch back to gun, open Pip and select my secondary gun to avoid the gunfight robot dance for the next 10 minutes.
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout\_Wiki](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_Wiki)
---
and while this isn't what you asked, i want to add you get 1 perk card per level but get a pack of randomized cards every few. after level 50, it's 1 pack every 5 levels.
---
Well, I only ever PvP when someone is wanted. I figure, if they attacked someone else... they deserve to die.
---
I give almost everything away, or trade it for items I want. 
---
I help randos whenever I come across them, if they need it. 
---
TBH... almost every player I have met in game has been wonderful. Maybe you get back what you put out, OP?
---
I like this idea overall.
---
I would say the Varmint Trap has the right angle on this; that is to say you should have a Small (Squirrels, Frogs, Ect) Game Trap, Medium (Rad Stags, Beavers, Ect) Game Trap, and Large (Bears, Humanoids, Ect) Game Trap. What actually gets "generated" by your trap over time would then be dependent on what region of the map you are in. Trap just causes the relevant beast to be spawned in it at the time interval; you are responsible for butchering.
---
I would flip the Chicken Coop to make eggs and expand the recipes to include some using Chicken eggs. If you kill the chickens for their succulent meat the Coop would need to be "repaired" to get more. Build cost would likely include multiples of several different vegetables for "feed". I would then make a "Pet Nest" in which you could gather eggs from relevant tamed animals (Mirelurks, Deathclaws, ect) over time.
---
Ignoring Carnivore mutants it would be a nice addition for the folks who like to be farmers, hunters, trappers, or otherwise self sufficient homesteaders.
---
You made this account post ban hammer and the first post you had was about freeing banned players. Are you banned? Seems it may be appropriate to tell everyone that piece of info while you scream that banned players were unjustifiably banned for breaking obvious TOS rules.
---
Also, I made a central column like you did of stacked stairs, then decided I didn't like it and attached a normal stair.  At that point both the normal stair and stacked stair locked in and I could not dismantle it.  I tore down the entire top floor, but was stuck with both the stairs and the stacked stairs (and anything in between them) marked as "item cannot be removed because part of the structure would not be accessible".  I think the regular stairs may have been supporting the stacked stairs.  (I didn't think to try to support the next layer of stacked stairs down with a regular stair.). So I had to move the camp to get rid of it.  I then spent an hour trying to re-place the camp in the tree.
---
Um... drop off loot before nuke runs?
---
That's why I always carry [a bottle of vodka](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Quack_Surgeon). Game needs [cocaine](https://twitter.com/eliyudin/status/897866437028700165), though.
---
1st content update is tomorrow.  Wild Appalachia.  Going to be brewing and distilling alcohol. 
---
If it makes you feel better, there was only a small period of time where food and water were problematic. I run speed demon, which increases hunger and thirst, and I haven't had to search for food and water in the last 170 hours I've played. I drink 90% purified water, and still sell probably 20 per play session I get from my 2 industrial purifiers. As for food, I have some perks into it to slow it down and such, but the perk good doggy makes a can of dog food fill probably 60% of your hunger meter, and recently just sold 42 cans of it cause it takes up space. Food is literally everywhere.
---
Possible method: put a bulletin board in Biv's bar. Wanna check out the latest news? Head down to the bar for booze and news. Yup yup yup. 
---
&gt; before they reset the duped items. 
---
This didn't happen. They deleted stacks of unstackable items, not necessarily dupes. The distinction is important.
---
Its not a damage rifle.   Its for giving different statuses to mobs/players.
---
xvx_K1R1T0_xvx_KILLME, the Named
---
rewarded for having to go through a million variations of the same name while creating your online profile.
---
I've had more than one "Oh shit!" moment where I run back to my base hoping turrets would shoot the mob of enemies behind me....and they don't bother. Pretty sure I accidentally made Comrade Turrets that think cowardice is a tool of the bourgeois class.
---
I have the melee speed hit thing on 2 star, maxed 1 handed melee card thing.  I do alright.  better and fast than with guns too lol
---
So is that the only feature? 
---
Tomorrow we get brewing and distilling if you're interested in that and survival mode on on 26th. Nothing too big until maybe April 9th imo.
---
Exactly, I can grow vegetables for Food Starch, but I don't need the adhesive, I currently grow some gourds for making Cranberry Relish, but usually just give it away, since I don't need to boost XP anyway, keeping a tamed animal is next to impossible, and eats too much budget.
---
Thank you so much ! tried to incorporate that homey feel as much as i could
---
Thanks man !
---
He was down by the Welsh station night before last. Dude gets around.
---
+1 couldn't agree more.  Just having the ability to buy power armor recipes was enough to get me back to playing.  Imagine if the loot went back to the way it was during the beta...  Was a hella lot of fun never knowing where that perfect item may drop from.  We just did as much content as we could. Saw an event spawn and ran to it lol 
---
Surprisingly i haven‚Äôt actually had any neighbours pop up! maybe we might run into eachother some day 
---
Thank you ! that‚Äôs exactly the feel i was going for 
---
&gt; doable solo? 
---
Everything is doable solo except SBQ. If you're having a hard time farming I whole-heartedly recommend making a melee toon and use it to farm up your other characters weapons until they can fly on their own.
---
Will survival be on a separate server?Sounds fun
---
People are bored the community used to be great now everyone thinks they are a good send and can do no evil  try to ruin others session then get mad when you kill them over and over. Lol 
---
Or you could just play Fallout 4
---
This dude posts nothing besides topic about unbanning the banned players and then deletes them when people call him out. fucking hilarious.
---
my only theory of it is that it's a non-hostile Mole Miner enemy. and that's cuz of the picture shown on the content image. other than that, my worst fear is a repeat of Destiny's Xur, while my "best case scenario" is an actual static shop like other vendors, but you have to trade in legendary weapons you don't use to buy new ones.
---
Going to bed hoping for offers when i wake up. 
---
After a while, you don't really notice. Drink/eat some soups and you're good to go. I tend to get thirsty more often so I try to keep some boiled water handy - or drink from water sources and then de-rad.
---
And one apologizing/ saying I'm sorry. 
---
No.. Lets not.
---
Server stability has improved dramatically since the bans started and keep the duping down.
---
Seeing the Commonwealth just only 20 years after the bombs drop would be interesting by itself
---
What else would the end game be? Looking at other multiplayer games gear farming is almost exclusively what endgame content is. That and PVP...
---
Well I imagine they're adding it to patch seven and that ought to introduce a new unmarked side quest called 'bug hunt' where you get to discover all the new little things that are broken in patch seven. 
---
I ended up being what you describe.  I'm 70% melee, 20% rifles, and 10% shotguns.
---
Initially, it was melee-shotgun.  The reason I ended up going with Shotguns is because of the Enforcer perk.  Almost every weapon has a perk card like Enforcer - a chance to cripple limbs.  For rifles, it's Tormentor.   But it just so happens that max rank of Enforcer has a whopping 30% chance to cripple a limb.  Not deal extra damage, outright cripple.
---
This ends up neutralizing a lot of enemies.  If you shoot in the general area of the legs, you *will* cripple the legs, and then they can't do much to you while you stab them.  If you hit the Scorchbeast's wings, you force it to come down.  Again, it's not about raw damage, it's about crippling.
---
Rifles were a late decision.  The Tesla Rifle (which counts as a rifle, not an energy weapon) proved to be a lot more efficient at clearing mobs than melee, and the lone explosive gun I've had for the longest time, a 3\* Lever Action Rifle, was a reliable standby for anything that required distance.
---
Can I have chickens please??
---
 Then I can open the first branch of Appalachia Fried Chicken! Then maybe franchise it to other players lol.
---
Ohhhhhhhhhh oh oh oh ohhhhhhhhhh! I want a tame yao gai! Really, look at all the trick bears üêª in history! And shooting my pack üêª bear could be hazardous for your health üòâ
---
I'm usually in a party with my friends I play with.
---
Oh or in a team outside of a party, both of which mute my audio towards all other players in the area.  The silent wasteland was a design choice.
---
Still helpful, thanks! 
---
and people say 76 has no story...
---
It's not really about being able to feed yourself, I can kill A Hermit Crab, Mirelurks (Including a Queen), Snallygasters, Dogs or Wolves, and Scorch Beasts from the roof of my CAMP everyday, it's about having CAMP items that fit the Carnivore persona.
---
We're looking into adding that in a future update,[stated here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/am3agv/fallout_76_known_issues_and_feedback/).
---
Don't buy shit at 20K, then. 
---
BUt as long as some people ARE buying it... then it will continue to be sold for that.
---
It's a consumer driven economy, 100%.
---
We've read your post,  you asked to be convinced otherwise. Now, people are trying to convince you... and you're angry about it?!
---
I literally do NOT find this community toxic. Online is mostly people helping others out, in game is mostly people interacting in "character", helping one another out, and exploring the world. So far, at 60 hours in, I have met exactly TWO people who desperately tried to get me to engage in PvP, by following me an harassing me. I kept emoting confusion, and they eventually got bored. I have met exactly ONE racist mouthbreather, who just needed to show me how many racist insults he knew, before he fucked off to bug someone else with this trash.
---
I haven't had to deal with people trying to sell shit for $20K.. because that's not the game I play. I haven't had to deal with griefers, because... well...  I don't play into their hands. 
---
Every online game will have people who seek to exploit it... because, well... that's people. What a bunch of bastards. But to say the community is toxic? Nah. You're looking for it, that's why you see it. 
---
If you seek it out, it's there, sure. But, if you look for the good? It's everywhere. You literally do get what you put out.
---
And so what if someone wants to sell their shit for 20k caps? Good on 'em‚Ä¶ DON'T BUY IT, and don't put such an emphasis on playing their game. Play your own game. That's the beauty of this sort of thing.
---
The way those turrets target anything on the ground in the first place is stupid anyways.  Agree, down with excessive screen shake.
---
i didn't know about the raider camp and freakshow.
---
i was happily hoping he found Rufus and they decided to leave Appalachia.
---
now I'm sad.
---
Put them in the atom shop. 
---
It takes less than an hour of playing for my crops to grow back.  17 hours, yikes.
---
Well yeah that's expensive but you can make that money back crafting serum for others or like a chem, craft the serum, take it sans the negative effects, then lose the mutation and take another serum when you want.
---
You will likely not find one without the "idiotic" players, since doing this is a major #ASSHOLE move.
---
These spawn spots are popular, and some dick dominating it with turrets is never going to be acceptable.
---
So the Salvaged Assaultron head is fixed in this next patch. As for the MIRV I'll have to look into that.
---
My buddies and I enjoy hot-rodding camps for newbies. I like to give away all of the (KNOWN) plans I have, ‚ûï any ammo I have no use for 
---
17 in-game hours. Haha. 17 real-time hours would be ridiculous 
---
Tomorrow! The patch tomorrow will be that fix for you. 
---
Thanks!
---
There's also camp budget cost lowering and buffs(?) to energy and heavy weapons.  Challenge tracking.  But actual new content, that's all.  But this is week 1 of new content.  There's a limited fasnacht robot parade on the 19th too.
---
&gt; for reasons unknown to me sometimes it can one shot a scorched at around 10m, sometimes not, sometimes it takes more than 2 blasts at point blank range, sometimes not. 
---
woah you're telling me guns actually do damage??
---
Go to Flatwoods with Butchers Bounty on
---
Its true, turrets are just not worth it currently.
---
Sometimes i can have enemies right in my yard, and i am attacking them, but my turrets just sit there.  Other times, like you said, they wont acknowledge when an enemy is outside my base shooting at my walls/generator
---
So, i removed my turrets, i have more build budget now, and i jsut put up crops/scarecrows around the perimeter of my base, and that works much better, now the enemies take their potshots at my corn, instead of my actual house.
---
I feel your frustration, but sometimes you have to work with what bethesda gives you.  And in this case that means removing turrets altogether.
---
As far as I know there was not, so this doesnt make too much sense.. unless its symbolic for other places where the bombs dropped or something like that
---
It would be nice to have variety, you can already kinda do this. I use the Brahmin Pen and have some Razorgrain growing, if you kill the Brahmin that comes with it and search it with butchers bounty it can then actually give you meat and you can repair the Pen for 1 razorgrain and 1 steel then repeat as another Brahmin instantly spawns.
---
That's fair but what would be cool is also a cannibal trap with a little cinematic for captured players.If that existed i would try a cannibal only playthrough. 
---
Silly boy.
---
So i launched a nuke last night after getting to the end of site bravo we realized the the code wasnt decrypted then we went through Charlie lol.  We found by the pumpkin patch ample corn so we launched the nuke there.  Only problem was only half of it got irradiated even though it was all in the middle of the nuke zone.  Fissure didn't even open.  Anyway i ended up netting about 80 raw cobalt n my buddy gave me about 50 he had picked up. Spawns of enemies were so low and hard to see the dead bodies so didn't even get enough mats to craft all the stable.  Ended up with about 16 using super duper. 
---
I walked all around lake Eloise n wasn't too sure which side was best to land nuke. 
---
Gonna have to scout Morgan town a little better next time. 
---
Anyway not worth launching a nuke near that pumpkin patch but the purple corn did look awesome.
---
Are you one of those floating turret houses at whitesprings that I always destroy? Lol. 
---
what platform, and why dont you want it fully modded ? :)
---
Define "unstackable item"? My understanding is they changed the qty of each item to X (whatever X is) if you had more than Y (again, unspecified) of that item. Across the board. If you had already acquired a duped item, you were unaffected. So basically my point stands
---
I agree.  The fact that Whitesprings *isn't* a complete no build zone is an inconsistency with the rest of the game, so I have little sympathy for those who might be barred from placing their CAMP there.  They knew they relied on a quirk.
---
Just run into Glassed Cavern with Butcher's Bounty and you can get all the meat you desire :)
---
My gourmond would love if carnivore could benefit her unique tastes and even better would be for her to be able to take a chunk of her last kill to enjoy at a later time.
---
Where are you seeing duping?
---
Psn: BOOM\_HEADSHOT299 level 26 or so if u want add me 
---
I'm not really moaning about it if I'm honest, it is a minor annoyance don't get me wrong but I get on with it and play around the problem.
---
I make sure my 2nd weapon is reselected every time I pop in and out of PA and also take note whether I have to re equip any pieces that don't appear lol
---
I observed a glitch that happened there when a camp was placed where you're talking about (it was just one random observation though, so it's not worth much in terms of evidence). What I saw was the eyebot who's leading the mongrels stuck up the tracks near there, right next to the cliff. They were moving but just sort of stuck in the location without proceeding down the tracks. However, seconds later when I crossed the red trestle, Grahm was walking underneath it on the road. So, it may glitch the spawn on the tracks. Really couldn't say for certain.
---
Hmm thanks for posting about this, I'll look into this more.
---
PS4, idk man. I am already feeling guilty to play as early with one of the strongest rifles
---
Np have a good one
---
Thankyou :)
---
19k? You're looking at the cost of the recipes, individual serums are around 3500 depending on charisma. By taking the serums repeatedly you can nullify the negative affects of the mutations, easier to make more serums than repeatedly buying them. But with the Class Freak perk maxed the negatives aren't that bad. 
---
AH damn, you play in the darkside LMAO. you actually made me laugh with the edit you did lol. well I guess whenever we can do crossplay I hope to see you around. 
---
Mix your power armor pieces, use mods you can find with other flavors of armor until you find the mods you want. I am using a mix of X-01 and modded T-60. Yusssss, I now have a jet pack! 
---
I don't know how big of a following it has over there, but you might check out /r/GirlGamers to find out who's playing FO76.
---
But I want to kill people
---
oh, to bad, i am on PC and xbox, would have done it free of charge :)
---
Probably someone else in here that will set you up i hope...
---
Everywhere. Started going crazy on Saturday. Hasn't stopped since.
---
Grats! I would happily maim someone for a drop like that, it is why I sneak in a snipe shot anytime I can!
---
I saw the ample blood leaf and some fire cracker but it was a little spread out n i couldn't get my bearings or figure which spot was best. Felt like spruce knob lake might have been better so gave up.  I did get a pump shotgun Prime receiver plan off a random scorch beast while searching and unlock all those locations down there so that was cool
---
It will be a full on pvp server without the slap damage restriction, you can take your current character over there and just pvp whenever :)
---
Thank you, I‚Äôll do that 
---
Moonsugar
---
I think it's around...  Well my total special stats equal up to 56...  Minus the starting 1 point in each one, minus 7.
---
49 are earned, you start with 7, for a total of 56.
---
The textures eat up your card's 4gb. Has to be 6gb, and even then it maxes it out.
---
Nobody in my team was under 60. That was the other team. We absolutely killed them for caps in the claim.
---
gotta ask: did you make up your username when you were like 13 or something??
---
I have an idea to resolve your guilt , get the gun and fight a scorched beast queen it won't feel too strong anymore.
---
lol deleted account already! Obviously we had a cheater here making a new account trying to fill the sub with rage over a legitamate wave of bans. Trying to make it seem as if BGS is responsible for illigitamate ban waves. CLEARLY, this proves BGS did right in the BGS Wave.
---
I find a lot of fun in farming for legendaries so I'd say have fun with that nuke and maybe nuke white springs charleston and farm for some legendaries &lt;3 I hope you enjoy your first nuke, it's a pretty fun experience the first time
---
FWIW, a friend used to have his CAMP near the bee on the map (in the middle of the Savage Divide, overlooking the Mire) and there were *always* Lv. 68 Super Mutants and similarly tough enemies that greeted us whenever we fast traveled there.  I'm not even sure where they come from, since it's pretty far from any marked location.
---
no, came up with it a couple of months ago. at 22. why, you got a problem with me or something?
---
The people I played with on Xbox would level any camp on that pond. I have been holding the vendor bot there, and someone spawned in with there camp there and the vendor bot just plopped over dead. Dunno if that's directly related to the camp tho. Personally, I won't necessarily level the camp there, but you may sneeze from me calling you an asshole. Lol. 
---
Can you point out where private servers violate the TOS? Because I see nowhere in the TOS saying they are against the rules. 
---
As for your ESO o FO76 comparison, that is where you are wrong ESO game engine was built from the ground up to be an MMO, no clue where you got the idea it was made for single player games especially when the only 2 games that used the engine were both MMOs, ESO and the star wars MMO. Where are you getting this information that the game engine used with ESO was originally for a single player game?
---
&gt;I was wrong about then being the same engine, but that doesnt change my point they are similar stories of single player games turned into MMO games through modifications of the single player code.
---
The engine in ESO was designed from the ground up to be an MMO engine. It came from SWTOR which was a MMO based on Star Wars. The only thing single player at all aboit ESO is that it was using elder scrolls lore, that doesn't mean it used any of the elder scrolls coding or parts of the gamebryo(name of engine elder scrolls use and used, now it is known as the creation engine) engine. Behind the lore ESO has nothing to do with the engine used by elder scrolls kr fallout games.
---
Well playing FO76 first then FO4 - I like both games, but I prefer FO4.
---
I'm kind of glad I played 76 first, otherwise I think I would have been slightly disappointed (if I went from FO4 to FO76).  
---
I bought FO76 at release full price (80 bucks), invested over 80 in game hours (1$ / hour enjoyed is a good ratio). However, I got FO4 GOTY Edition and was able to log 225 hours in three months. I enjoyed every second of that game. 
---
Basically, I think FO76 suffers from the lack of voice acted NPCs - the NPCs made me fall in love with FO4. I played FO76 because it was fresh and new - something to explore. But FO4 has that and tons more.
---
Regardless, the game is cheaper now - and with the new content coming out - I'd say it's worth a purchase. But hands down, FO4 is a better game.
---
I took an opposite approach to camp building, I found a quiet spot on the river and built a safe place for people to rest, eat and repair before heading back to the chaos lol. 
---
If no one gets you today - I'll craft you one tonight...
---
lol calm down there tiger69
---
Damn i was hoping it would be a full on survival reset with like expensive bullet costs with increased prices.Hardcore stuff
---
Laugh / Apologize / Kill Me Please 
---
Those 3 are needed
---
The Division had an interesting survival mode where it was during a blizzard and you had to collect warmer clothes or hop from fire to fire to stay warm. I'm wondering if this nuclear winter mode might have something similar
---
So...exactly like the traps that were in one of the FO4 DLCs. I second this. I can never find a rad stag when I need one. Addicted to that +20 carry weight and Flatwoods is too far a walk from where I usually need the extra.
---

Someone will offer you one sooner, but I'm available this evening to craft and mod one at no charge. I can give you some 5.56 ammo too.  Unfortunately, I won't be on until about 6pm central. Let me know if no one else answers the call.
---
I thought your character name was going to be displayed first time I played, was slightly disappointed when I named my character "Bully" and it was just my regular old account name :(
---
My first really good roll was a level 35 TSE Handmade, I've gotten many more since then and sell lots of great 3\* weapons.
---
AAE Dragons really wreck a Colonel Gutsy, so you got a great roll.
---
My advice would be to not limit yourself to only the rolls you get, because you will eventually get a roll that's great for someone else but not for your build/play style.
---
80% of the weapons and 40% of the armor I use on my main character are self looted, I will not hesitate to trade for the just right item I want while waiting to find it. 
---
Lmao. I like your leverage. Ima girl that flirts a lot. I did my first bit of role playing yesterday. Had too many meds and ammo, almost max caps so I went around pretending to be part of the great Appalachia sweepstakes. Was more fun than I ever thought it would be. 
---
hi I'm down!! mind if i add you?
---
Later in the year they are adding the prestige system for those over level 50. Which will set them back to level 1 in exchange for some type of bonus. 
---
Now the bonus is hinted at being special legendary perk cards If I read the roadmap right. Otherwise it could also be some new advancement system on top of perk cards but I doubt that.
---
Yes, I only want to shell out once for each serum recipe. Recipes are much preferable to serums for me.
---
Nope, no accusing happening here. Just pointing out the obvious üòâ. The bug is real and a no - trivial matter. I was more making fun of the quantity of redditors that feel that the venue has no room for positive expression. 
---
This post is fine, but the title is worded poorly. The drop rate doesn't need to be increased, I already get so many legendaries that it saps my drive to sort through them. What needs to be changed is the quality of drops that we do receive. 
---
As it stands there are 2 really good legendaries that work on practically everything, bloodied and AA. That isn't to say there aren't other good legendaries, like furious and instigating, but these two for example only work on specific weapon types. You wouldn't want a furious hunting rifle and you wouldn't want an instigating 10mm sub machine gun. Switch those around though, and you've got two nice weapons.
---
Almost every other primary legendary affix is bad. Some work in niche situations like a quad missile launcher but mostly everything that isn't the primary good legendary effects are too weak to be considered worth using. Furthermore getting a good 2* roll is next to impossible.
---
The real issue I have with the current system is that it's nearly impossible to get good rolls rather than to get legendaries. Our current drop rates would be fine if we had a world wide auction house so that everyone could easily and safely trade for the gear they want, but as it is trading is locked behind using a 3rd party application and gated with having enough luck to stumble onto someone who has what you want and you have what they want.
---
The loot system isn't a failure if you look at all the parts individually, but when put together it becomes woefully insufficient. And I know that the legendary vendor "is supposed to help alleviate this problem," but ultimately it's a bandaid on a broken dam. The way they were talking about the vendor, you need 2 and 3 star items to get 2 and 3 star items. And they could still be trash.
---
YES!!!! this!!!!!
---
Other players need to know that when I tell them that another settlement is under attack and needs them, that the message is coming from PRESTON GARVEY not my username.....
---
You want auto or semi-auto build?
---
Awesome! Yes, please go ahead :)
---
Everywhere is not an answer. Give me a location you've seen it happening or I won't believe you. I havn't seen it anywhere. Have you reported it to Bethesda? If no, why not? Is it taking place on a discord server? Have you witnessed it in game? If you won't report it I can only assume A. You're lying for whatever reason. or B. You're involved.
---
What platform do you play on? I can give you the flux you need, except florescent
---
It just gave me a perpetual loading screen each time, so I stopped trying to use it.
---
Right? I love roleplaying as a responder especially since I set up my base near flatwoods to be a donation center but people just come and stare at the bag for a while then bail without saying anything üòÇ
---
Semi
---
I was just thinking the same not long ago, but instead from legendary enemies they could be like end game rewards from like SBQ (Lets make her useful please) and Vault Raids.
---
You don't get banned for camping on a random encounter location; it just suppresses events for that location. Random encounters will keep happening all over the server, so you're not really depriving anyone of anything.
---
Yeah that would be super cool. I love the survival aspects to this game so I would absolutely welcome something like that.
---
I get excited whenever a rad storm rolls by, since they seem to be so rare. They don't do much to me but I still think they're cool. I wouldn't mind seeing the radiation bumped up to like half that of a nuke zone. And snow would be cool! Maybe it would slow you down and drain your hunger/thirst more? Oooh and like acid rain too or something. 
---
"My child has been kidnapped!  Meh, I'll get to it eventually" is not a terribly good story.
---
Rolled a one on your perception check
---
Thing is, Destiny did this from the start, loot drops could be a purple = Legendary engram, which was then unpacked to reveal a blue = Rare = not as good an item. 
---
This was *massively* unpopular, and they fixed it pretty quickly. Now you are guaranteed to get an item of the same colour as the engram, and you may *very rarely* get lucky and get a better quality item. 
---
Moral of the story: don't label the package as better loot than it contains, or people will be pissed. 
---
Yay! Added :) gt is ActualGarbage68, if you're not on now I'll send you a message for later!
---
This stuff is why I assume the players that complain about "empty worlds" are "Leroy Jenkins" players. 
---
If you take your time in Bethesda games (especially the FO series) these little vignettes are *everywhere*. The game is FULL Of stories, some spanning multiple locations, others, just little tales in one spot.
---
To help sway popular opinion, it is why they didn't even respond with that second email until pcgamer picked up the story. So they tried to sway the story to their side and it not being a scew up. Look at it like this, if the ban was legit don't you think they would have came out and said "on such and such date we detected you duping or exploiting" instead they doubled down with "uh you had too much ammo"  from the first email.
---
I mean by your linked testing the fact that account is okay demonstrates that the issue is ultracite since its the only ammo on the list not tested yet. Also it is the only ammo that don't drop from enemies which makes it rarer since it has to be crafted.
---
Totally agree with you. Of course for ‚Äúelite‚Äù players it will be more than easy to get a new character to level 50 for example. But what about the casuals who barely got their main character to 50? Are they supposed to start all over again at 1 and spend another 3 months to get their character to a certain level, cause they just can‚Äôt play 6-7 hours a day?? Forcing us to create a new character would kill survival mode for a majority of the player base. Remember, the people in this sub ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE for the FO76 player base!

Speed demon mutation and the reload isn't bad.
---
I've got a Bloodied/ 50% VATS criticals and I carry it with me every where I go. 
---
Your first sentence already doesn't make sense.  Why were they forced to release a half baked product?  What are you talking about?  I would have been fine waiting for a good product!  Your argument is flawed.
---
At some point you have to look around and go "Man there are alot less people in this sub and the game has only been out for 4 months.
---
For comparison Apex Legends (A game that was released with no marketing and is F2P) has 668,000 subs.  FO76 has 171,000.  I mean this game has crashed and hard and it's like everyone on this sub is rearranging chairs on the titantic.  The game, at its core is flawed.  FOR CHRISTSAKE even the Fallout 4 sub has 248,000 subs.
---
I really hope you enjoy the game, i mean that.  I want to enjoy the game, my girlfriend still tries to play it every so often but i hear the "sigh" and the "fuck it, i'll play something else" and it goes away.  This is just my opinion of course.
---
Thanks you guys are awesome!

Awesome!

Actually witnessed this last night and it cracked me up

I'm a hair over level 200. So when I approach, I hope the winner has area chat on cuz I come running in yelling "congratulations!!! You have won the great Appalachia sweepstakes!!! Please be patient while I drop your prize bag". The different reactions made it hella fun. Then I ended it with "the great Appalachia sweepstakes is not responsible for any injuries that may occur while using said prize bag. Thanks!!" Give a little wave, then move on to the next winner.

that's *mrs trash to you sir omg üò§

If it is a rng-based re-roll system, I won‚Äôt use it at all. I won‚Äôt collect and hand over dozens of legendaries for a 1:4000000 chance of a good weapon role.
---
I'm 100% a roleplayer in this game. What system you on?
---
Thank you:D
---
That's probably the best daily quest
---
Probably bc character names aren't unique, while account names are. Having your character always show your account name makes it easier for other players to identify who you are.
---
Exactly, people hating being lied to that‚Äôs all. 
---
What we need is more information on how legendary scrapping might work. Players are in hoard mode right now because content is coming and no one wants to lose out if changes happen. And based on the way most people got to keep duped weapons in singles, Bethesda could very much put in a new system that rewards hoarding things right now.
---
Oops probably should have mentioned that huh? My baaad! I‚Äôm on PS4 :) 
---
I actually like the meat hook, instigating version modded with 3 hooks and barb wire does about 320 damage per hit for me, not too shabby!
---
It would be lame if the attackers had no way of disarming it, as you describe.
---
But I could see something like this as part of a "I intentionally relinquish control of this Workshop" option, which short of disconnecting, we don't actually have.  Either someone takes it right away and gets all that stuff I built, or it resets back to its normal state after so many minutes.
---
Nah it's basically just what we've been playing without slap damage in pvp. I guess it can give us something when we're bored and we can just go there and murder eachother
---
Thank You!
---
This is so true. Once you level up a bit and progress your character it literally feels like the exploration and combat of Fo4 in a new world.
---
We will be updating with a third post, where he attempts it with Ultracite. Though he has actually already disproved this conjecture that picking up a dupers bag will result in a ban, as he couldn't even pick all of it up at once as per our second post. So 9HG is at least being dishonest about that, as you can't take everything from a container
---
More than likely they show the account name due to not having to police them as much.

If they allowed the names that we entered to be the display names they would have to have an entire team dedicated to reviewing those names constantly to ensure there game wasn‚Äôt full of trolly and controversial names.
---
By using the account names, most of this review system is placed on which ever gaming source the game is run through, be it Xbox, PlayStation, etc.
---
My favourite character, "Sandy the Clown" loves leaving loot bags for people, and then sneaking off to watch them from a distance as they find them... nothing huge... some bubblegum, a toy car, maybe a teddy bear, a switchblade, and a human pelvis...
---
Yeah. I always felt the attempt to give you so many things to do in the world, repetitive or no, directly conflicted with the attempt at urgency for Act I of the main story.
---
That isnt until april when you can decorate. Not tomorrow
---
I think you're going to get a bastard version of the Grinder from the Borderlands pre-sequel (Feed it 3 items, get one back- something like that). 
---
Judging by the fact that the little thing they published in the Roadmap about the new legendary vendor looks remarkably like Xur from Destiny 2 i'm not holding my breath for anything original.
---
Lol my toon is melee, just not finding any decent legendaries and I'm always running low on stims.  
---
And crouch
---
yes look at the fallout 76 wiki, and even just a simple google search should bring up things to do. I know thats what I did. 
---
More often than not, I'm in Party Chat as well, either with my team or while trading, but it's also easy to switch over to game chat when needed, and if set to auto you can talk to both your team &amp; others in area.
---
Text Chat on Xbox is cumbersome, and random team invites from someone your not talking to is a recipe for a wrecked CAMP more often than not.
---
well, you are right! its pointless as is, which is kind of what OP is saying...
---
hopefully someone at Bethsoft is reading this thread...
---
hahah is this for real!?  Next time I'm wanted I'm heading to WS Train Station
---
Last time I would jump in peoples faces and no one attacked...I went so far as to shoot a guy repeatedly in the head with passive on, thinking he'd get the picture...
---
So guns and armor are unstackable. The dupe would create more than one of the item but it occupied the same inventory slot thus stacking it on itself. 
---
Later on, after they got rid of stacks of weapons and armor as well as other unstackable items, they made passes at removing excessive item quantities that were stackable. 
---
Explosions?!?  
---

---
One stood out- What is Cheaters Camp? Is it an actual place or just someones actual camp? Or a common place for dupers?
---
I have to disagree. I‚Äôm all for having non-PVP ways to defend a workshop, but as long as PVP is the way it is, you should have to fight to keep it. I quit taking workshops during heavy play hours, so I typically don‚Äôt have to defend anything. But if someone were to take one, I would fight for it. If someone doesn‚Äôt feel like they‚Äôre up to the challenge of holding onto a workshop, it might be best to not take one for the time being. 
---
&gt;no story about the location or lore for the most part
---
You might want to spend some more time hacking terminals and reading notes.
---
Is there actually a solution to the maze? Or they are just trapped with a death claw with no way out?
---
No and Bethesda never got back to me on my leaked info as well.
---
The only thing I got was them forcing me to take their 500 atoms or some shit.
---
Seen it a bunch over the last few days
---
Serum recipes only go for like 2-3k now anyways
---
Anybody know the site alpha code yet??
---
Ty for letting me know! The question still remains about budgets and stash limits 
---
And packs of high-level yao guai
---
You can add me my psn is pappododo 
---
Just so u know im 13 so dont comment on my voice i can play on weekends and i live in  sweden soo different time zone but im sure we can work something out 
---
Yeah I‚Äôm not. As a level 49 with no fusion cores, I most certainly do not want the whole map irradiated.
---
Not just one star, most likely one star rolling pins, boxing gloves and wooden armor! I feel some items have a heavier weight than others. Also I feel I have gotten way to Many medics broadsiders.
---
No one knows yet, hasnt been mentioned at all. Most likely the week before it releases itll get mentioned
---
Copy that, sorry for misinformation. 
---
Honestly haven‚Äôt played much fallout since they keep butchering patches. 
---
Yeah exactly that. Like your son is missing man everything and everyone else can wait until you've found him lol 
---
Move your base to a copper deposit and set a resource generator on top of it. You will be swimming in copper eventually if you do this.
---
Youtube
---
Character names didn't required unique ID's. So impossible to change now since most people have the same exact character name. Lucky i researched this before buying the game and made my Bethesda ID the character name. But most people got baited by the fake character name creation to playing with a ID they didn't even knew was displayed which is impossible to change now.
---
I just wish I could name my weapons
---
we're currently living in an era where outrage has social value.  I think it started off as recreational outrage but now there are definitely people that have become addicted to being outraged and letting others know about their perceived injustice.
---
The fertilizer producer under Resources comes with a Brahmin.  That respawns when you...harvest it (not sure on time between respawns)
---
The more you open up the map and get more and better looting locations, the less you'll need to farm for it, and the more perks you get for maintaining weapon and armor condition the less you'll need it in the first place.
---
 Honestly above a certain level most people just bulk and sell it.
---
Cool!:)
---
I playing FO76 as a single-player game by choice, so the only price that matters to me is the Enclave vendor one.
---
Good to know, thanks. I'll just keep climbing levels then!
---
95% of the playerbase simply don‚Äôt has the time to create and level a completely new character for survival mode. Being able to play 6-7 hours a day is not the norm but an exception. You can‚Äôt ask them to start all over only because they want to participate in survival. So no. This is a very very very bad idea and i hope Bethesdadoes not listen to the small amount of players in this sub (compared to the overall base). This sub IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE for the FO76 community as a whole!!!
---
Next to Glassed Cavern, have a good time
---
I'll give this post 5/10 ghouls ... I want that damned circle off my map 
---
Where/Who are selling them for only 3k?
---
Farm power plants they all have generators for fusion cores. Just build a 100 power generator at 2 of the power plant workshops check them every 15 minutes and you'll have 15-20 in about an hour. Just remember to lock them and check them at 15 minute intervals they have a max storage of 3. 
---
I do this all the time it is the easiest way to get fusion cores.
---
The description they give in the little bit they've posted in the roadmap about it does sound *exactly* like Xur.
---
Awesome man, I‚Äôm gonna scrap some more still in hopes of getting it 
---
I imagine it would cause inflation.
---
At the new bar near VTU
---
Im not allowed to play today but i can accept the freind request as soon as i can ;)
---
Titles can be connected with Achievements. As it usually happens in online games.
---
I submitted my form with all the information required a week before the cutoff date and gave me a reference but no timescales or anything :S 
---
Wouldn't even be an issue if that hadn't nerfed the loot after release.. did you play during the Beta ? wish they would revert that lol it was fun as hell. 
---
some guy teabagged me over and over as i was repairing my weapons at WS last night, i just ignored him and went and made some dinner, when i came back he was still teabagging me, this was like 20 minutes later lol
---
My spot its not that popular. Most of the time I do not have issues with logging in however Sometimes on occasion it may happen.  But using this option definitely  made me spawn at least 5 times in same server, same time of the night, same spawn point, same fight sounds in distance.
---
Nah, my camp is a concrete block with a spotlight and two missile turrets. I built it so everything is inside an indestructible cup(Except for the turrets obviously), a cup that it is impossible to get inside(With/without bounty) unless you have a jet-pack, and if someone naughty get inside, I know he must be in power armor so I just one punch him. The only players I can't one punch are ones in Sentinel armor, this is how I better ensure that I can defeat them.
---
The only way inside is if you build stairs up.
---
they all take awhile, sometimes i wonder if there is a timer that is server side that limits how many u can acquire in X time.
---
Oh, they said it again today.

---
Right, I misspoke, it isn't my being in pacifist mode that keeps the turrets from hitting me, it is that they see me as friendly since I haven't attacked the players base.
---
 They might even be prevented from shooting directly in my direction since I'm a 'friendly', that would explain how I rarely see turret fire in my immediate area. If so that works to my advantage as well since the mobs come to me directly so with my back to the turret CAMP they find a safety zone in front of me right up to the moment I put them down with my own attack
---
Healing factor or the state change is fucked , only works now an then for me atleast
---
Oh, yeah I'm in complete agreement. The number of duped items still floating around the game is my #1 complaint. 
---
&gt;  Places like WhiteSprings are gonna be the only place people want to go because of the abundance of them
---
God forbid we do such a thing, cause it would really change the game too much.
---
/s
---
I was thinking same thing, with bigger challanges.
---
software is hard, people need sleep. we understand.
---
Yeah but at least xur occasionally had something people wanted, if this is some form of exchange service it's going to end badly

I'm still waiting for finishing an interior wall of the metal walls.  Put up some drywall, or a nice (NOT shitty) wooden wall.  Or finished interior like you'd see in a Vault.  Or anything nice.
---
I bet sneak damage head shot is sweet.
---
How is it a conspiracy if it's one of the most requested features by far?
---
Perk cards are a feature of the game, and swapping them out is part of the core gameplay abilities.  I don't care if you don't like it, it's part of the game as written.  Making it more convenient, preferably without impacting fighting, is simply a quality of life improvement that (should) have 0 impact on the rest of the game.
---
(being able to hot-swap cards in battle could cause all kinds of issues and shouldn't be allowed with this)
---
Where did you see "reset to level 1" ? I took it as "Reset your perks", but your point of view might be correct.
---
My concern is that with our account names out there we are more vulnerable to having our accounts hacked.  Instead of having to figure out both the account name and password they now only have to figure out the password.  Not necessarily an easy task, but still only half the effort required if two pieces of information are unknown. 
---
Awesome - the thing is, that bugger is HEAVY and you might find quite a lot of melee weapons that do equivalent damage for less carry weight. Check out ski swords in particular, but you might find something faster or with more damage for half the weight! (means twice as much stuff you can carry!)
---
They said specifically 
---
"Greetings,

---
very cool!!!!!
---
What a quote... what a book
---
Not sure if Rads actually have any effect.  The main issue now is that you will often get stuck in 'Caution' state (check by crouching when no enemies are anywhere near you and see what your state is).  If you are in 'Caution' or 'Danger' you will get no Healing from the mutation.
---
Yea. That's why I'll always think pvp is trash in this game. Lol. Good luck on your search. The above mentioned glass caverns wouldn't be a bad place to try. Cranberry bog seems to be teaming with activity most of the time. 
---
Be glad theyve doubled it since the game released
---
U have to be in game. Usually you can do 1 or 2 events, then the shit is regrown
---
Well fist toons take a while to get on their feet compared to 2 handers due to the fact that you can't really use power armor... I mean even then you can, there are power armor mods that allow your unarmed attacks to deal solid damage. The reason that's important while leveling is because until you get a very good set of modded legendary armor the hidden DR and rad res multipliers from PA are vastly stronger than they appear. I can have 2k rad res outside of my power armor and take 10 rads per second during a nuke zone meanwhile at 400 rad res inside my power armor I take 4 or 5. Same applies to damage resistance, you take substantially less damage in power armor regardless of what your DR says it is.
---
Besides, at level 36 you've barely farmed anything. Simply put getting legendary drops is the same as getting XP and if your level is low then you've hardly killed any mobs so it makes sense you don't have any legendaries. And I mean by not many mobs, you have to kill thousands and thousands of legendary mobs to get a few decent legendary drops.
---
That being said, the base damage from melee weapons is plenty enough at low levels. I didn't even need a legendary 2 hander to start 1 shotting high level mobs and fist weapons hit even harder. When I was leveling my melee toon, at your level I could deal enough damage to nuke zone mobs, my issue was surviving.
---
Totally need this, I usually can‚Äôt use mic, so trying to get someone to take all the stuff in the paper bag that I just dropped for them, is often extremely frustrating. 
---
hOw mUCh fuCKing work iS iT tO capitalize thE firSt letTer iN eveRy woRd, aNd wHy?
---
Also in the settings menu, there is a Help option that explains a ton of stuff
---
Open your map, hit L1/LT or idk on PC, to open your settings menu, than look near the bottom for HELP, its in the smaller case lettet section.
---
There is a lot of good info here or check out r/fo76filthycasuals for a more laid back discussion based sub.
---
maybe when you disconnect from a server it can detect why you disconnected (e.g. some handshake that you intended to, or if it was unexpected) then reserve that slot for you instead of giving it to the next queued / random joiner. at least for a timeout period long enough to restart the game (otherwise it could be exploited)
---
hmm you know, i kinda fell into the build without knowing it and had nothing to melee with, except this, found during my time at the mine getting some mutations.  I will have to look out for more melee stuff.  I have had the ski sword before but it was less.  i have a super sledge but am not high enough level yet.  i think once i can get higher level i will find more stuff that would be better than the glove.  
---
What? That is due to the weight changes. So no 900 hour guy easily could have picked up all the ammo he swapped back and forth because 36k ammo doesn't weigh too much. Remember he never had that much ammo they list. The issue is the way they did that scan could and did count things multiple times if you muled it back and forth over a 30 day period.
---
I mean even if nothing happens now doesn't mean they didn't wrongly ban him for their screwed up way of "counting" the ammo.
---
I would hope Beth is smart enough to change the way they do ban waves after the massive backlash from innocent people being banned by their overly strict heuristics it used. After his ban people even did the math and found out the amount they banned him for was absolutely within someone making it in a 30 day period. So I'm sure they did loosen those numbers because of that exact reason.
---
I mean hell look at how Beth even worded the "ban emails" they aren't even banned because they realize their way of banning would have false positives because fo76 doesn't have any anticheat programs on the servers.
---
Now I will be interested on the next ban wave to see if that account will make it through to see if they raised the heuristics or not. Will really see if they are learning and fixing things or if this is just a cash grab.
---
Purified Water and Canned Dog Food plus the Good Doggy perk.  You should never have any issues keeping yourself well fed and well hydrated.
---
Plus alcohol in this game actually cures thirst whilst giving good Strength bonus so keep chugging beers for melee buff and get the side effect of curing thirst.
---
1k while standing!? 
---
Bloodied Gauss is where it‚Äôs at.
---
did you perhaps equip a bloodied weapon, i noticed it will affect all the other weapon damages of non-bloodied weapons, i think it is a bug
---
Cool thanks. 
---
yeah that bunker buster is 40 pounds lol....  i immediately scrapped it
---
Yes that‚Äôs pretty good damage output, haha. Thanks for sharing!

As long as I would still have access to their gamer tag so I could block griefers this would be great
---
i think after the blast zone goes away, the enemies keep the nuke boost for a while afterwards
---
In a game where people are paper-bagging most 1 , 2, and shitty 3 star legendaries after you hit level 50, the loot in those drops is useless anyways.
---
Xbone: 1. I do not judge. If you are playing (and are not a honk head) I will help/play/team with you.
---
2. The game is for having fun, not ripping people for IRL stuff.
---
3. The people that give you grief are honk heads, anyway, and, therefore, do not matter. 
---
How did you get rid of the stairs?  I have a floating CAMP as well, but its tethered by those dang stairs.
---
This.
---
Yesterday I killed a 3 star legendary and got a drill.
---
A drill.
---
That's only if you believe him when he says he didn't have that much ammo, ha
---
Yes, the Brahmin from Fertilizer Resource can Produce Brahmin Meat with the Meat Gathering Perk (equivalent of Green Thumb, can't recall name) and searching the body.
---
The Brahmin will never produce Hide or Meat without the Perk.
---
Once you kill your Brahmin you will need to Repair the Fertilizer Resource with 1 Grain and 1 Steel.  Brahmin will instantly respawn when repaired.
---
But then he can't complain about them reusing assets
---
That‚Äôs good to hear. I just started playing around with a bloodied build, and I hope I can drop more useful weapons. The bloodied submachine gun is pretty ridiculous though; I‚Äôm hitting about 200 per shot. I‚Äôve been using it in Whitesprings and it cleans house 
---
I'm Not Saying It Would Change To Much Of The Game, Just That It Would Make White Springs A Place People Would Nuke Way To Often. It Would Push Away Lower Levels And Make White Springs A War Zone. I Have No Problem With The Idea Of Legendary Perk Cards Just The Way They Would Be Attained, And The Amount That Could Be Used.
---
It almost at a manageable level now thankfully, I could always use a little more space but I‚Äôd rather they increased the amount caps from each vendor so I can clear bulked items quicker. I find myself missing a day playing every few days to give myself selling time rather than enjoying questing as I would like to.
---
On Xbox, I have also encountered the endless loading loop when selecting another world.
---
I have also on many occasions found my CAMP location to be available even though it wouldn't place on Login.
---
I have tried several times, moving my CAMP, but actually putting it back in the same location, only to have it tell me it cant load on the next login on the same server, with the location still empty.
---
I am, 90% of the time, in party chat (xbone) and I have only very rarely come across anyone using game chat during those times I was not in party. 
---
yeah, but if you let existing characters in, alot of them are like level 200+ so it works both ways
---
‚ÄúYo but New Vegas is the best game of all time because it reuses assets‚Äù
---
I found a 3\* Legendary Fire Axe last night (can't remember whether it was a Level 5 or Level 10). It was an awesome weapon even for mid game but for a newbie i thought someone would be made [u](https://up.So)p. So i went to a CAMP in Flatwoods and found a player around Level 10, even used my mic to say i'm dropping you a cool weapon mate, right outside his door. He/She stood there for a minute, waved and then immediately logged out! I saw the CAMP disappear in front of my very eyes. The brown bag remained untouched!
---
So even with a new emote, i think some players can be intimidated by a higher level player whatever you try to do for them :-(
---
Based on the mere fact that swapping card will change your weight you will also constantly changing values to the server adding more coding , being a universal weight allows It so it won‚Äôt be abused or misused 
---
I had no idea you could even do that. Thank you so much for the info I‚Äôll have to try it out. I‚Äôve been struggling trying to find fusion  cores to finish the mayor for a day quest. All those major gutsy‚Äôs kill me in like 10 shots max
---
I have marsupial and healing factor.  Is it worth it to get more ot should I wait for the perl card that reduces the negative effects.  Surviving is my only issue, I run out of healing so quick.  I recently got a vampire double shotty that helps but lately rad away and healing are slim pickings
---
It won't re-spawn, until you "Repair" it, they must have changed something because you couldn't harvest the Brahmin before.
---
Lol AAA Dev doesn't even know what day the patch is going to launch last Thursday. Give me a break. 
---
It would stop me following players around trying to get their attention like some kind of deranged wasteland stalker lol.
---
My suggestion is at least change drop rates like this:
---
3 \* mob / 1\* item - 0% / 2\* item - 70% / 3\* item - 30%
---
2\* mob / 1\* item - 70% / 2\* item - 30% / 3\* item - 0%
---
1\* mob / 1\* item - 100% (there are some really crappy ones) / 2\* item - 0% / 3\* item - 0%
---
And most importantly SBQ should 100% 3\* legs no exceptions, too much effort to spawn her and to kill her. 1/5 times its even not possible to kill her if there are no 10 high level (50+) players. And I did not even mentioned game crashes (I had one right after we killed SBQ and moment I tried to loot her), server disconnects or disappearing bodys.
---
Last thing we need right now is increased legendary drops. Duper‚Äôs will just get ahold of them and make the economy even more shit. Let‚Äôs fix the duping problem before we get more legendary drops.
---
Once you learn what you actually need and what you don't need you'll start managing your stash much better. Apparel sells much better to vendors and is super cheap to craft (just gotta hop some random encounters and get some plans). Plus apparel doesn't weigh much. You'll learn that junk isn't diamonds and the more you explore and learn the map, the more you learn places to go get things if you're ever running low. Trust me. The stash management gets better as you become more experienced in the game. 
---
I'm about 2 hours west of Huntingdon, almost dead center between Huntingdon and PGH.

Green Thumb card for when you're harvesting, super duper rank 3 when you're cooking.  Make a little farm near a water source with corn/carrots/whatever, about 16 plants total.  Use good with salt card if you can budget it and stay out for long periods, totally optional though (food spoils slower with that).
---
There might be better crops to plant, I use those because they take up less space (I plant with rugs/mats so that the crops are off the ground and protected in my base).
---
I harvest when I log in, and have 40-50 soups (good for both food and water) to last me until I'm done or when I take a break i I'm playing a long time.
---
I personally despise games with hunger/thirst/repair features, but it's really pretty manageable with a little prep, so it doesn't put me off too much.
---
Because I named myself Logan Paul as a joke and I don‚Äôt want everyone seeing me as that, but actually though it should be an option but I think (at least on console) it‚Äôs so that if you want to invite them to a party then you invite them by the name that you‚Äôre seeing
---
Done and done. Enjoy the toy:)
---
That's the whole point. The devs are trying to drive player interactions here. Rather than just being a boring rote "go here, get this" quest, "Locate the supply drop" is supposed to be spiced with player conflict.
---
*It's your quest, but you'll need to get there first before someone else loots it! You may want to fight off anyone approaching your drop to keep it safe.*
---
*You didn't call it in, but that doesn't mean it can't be yours! Loot the drop before the owner gets to it, you'll be wanted but to the victor goes the spoils.*
---
Dare to embrace what the developers wanted from their game. Dare to enjoy a Fallout game in a different way than previous ones. This isn't Fallout 4.5, it's Fallout 76. 
---
Personally, I love when it rains indoors
---
As someone who did the opposite, i played fo76 before fo4 and i have to say - fo4 ruined fo76 for me.
---
Everything in fallout 4 compared to 76 just feels so much more impactful. Base building actually means a damn, faction hubs are awesome, having NPCs adds an amazing element to the game that i desperately think bethesda missed with fo76.
---
I originally got fo76 because it's multiplayer and pvp, two things which i like a lot. but from my experience with fo76 (level 135) there was rarely any pvp and at times it was the loneliest multiplayer game i've ever played. so i wasn't missing much with that aspect when i went to fo4

That mode in the Division was fun

Rifle and pistol are two stock types of a plasma gun. Check stock modifications on your workbench - some of them turn your gun into a pistol, some of them turn it into a rifle. 
---
It was tough at first, coming from previous FO and ES hoarding simulators, but you really **do not** need all of the crap you pick up. 
---
Get rid of junk weapons/armor. Sell chems you'll (in reality) never use, and flag materials you want for crafting/repairing. 
---
Don't waste space on missiles/mini nukes/magazines/bobbleheads, or the thousands of rounds of ammo you don't use.
---
800 is more than enough. I'm so used to 600 that I still kept mine at 500, which gives me 300 for drops I find.
---
Damn, unfortunately I'm on Xbox. If I had PS4 I'd definitely help you out!
---
 make sure your own weapon is put away. I even strip naked or put on the casual outfit.
---
&gt;  Just build a 100 power generator at 2 of the power plant workshops

Or just restart the damned reactor like they keep giving you quests to do, which is how you get the plans for the 100 power generator in the first place.

I assumed they fixed the assaultron bug

---
how would it cause inflation? They already have a money sink, when you buy stuff from vendors the vendors only get 10% of the Caps from what you purchased.
---
In a normal Fallout game, when you buy something for 100 the trader gets 100 Caps added to the store. But in 76 when you spend 100 they only get 10 Caps added. Inflation can't happen when Caps disappear.
---
You're Welcome I'm glad I could help and The Mr. Gutsys are PIA even in power armor.
---
&gt; I‚Äôve been struggling trying to find fusion cores to finish the mayor for a day quest. All those major gutsy‚Äôs kill me in like 10 shots max
---
Well there is a way to avoid that: &gt;!cower in a lift like a scared little girl, you don't need to come out to face the gustsys.  Alternatively drop down a couple of levels and you should be safe as well!&lt;
---
yeah, together with my T60 stealth mod. I crouch and im invisible. fun!
---
You should absolutely get the 3 main ones, twisted muscles adrenal reaction and talons. Trust me, you won't have a problem healing anymore when things die before they can hurt you. It's worth noting that the damage effects from these multiply together instead of just stacking which is why fist weapons do so much damage. Wait on adrenal reaction until the next patch because it's bugged atm and the fix is supposed to be coming tomorrow.
---
I agree but for other reasons. I don't even need a cool explosion or damage. I just dont want to always have to go around scrapping or moving around a poorly built camp. 
---
Wasn't my camp but ok. Only time my camp was ever destroyed was by nukes. I think most found its placement unobtrusive. Never the less that's fine. It's a part of the game I accept. I come home, grumble a little, repair, and back to the grind :)

No way, this isn't a radical new fallout game, there's no chance the devs would ever want to push the boundaries of player experiences or encourage them to try new things. Surely this is a mistake, we're playing Fallout 4.5 afterall, the devs want nothing more than for us all to treat this game exactly the same as all past Fallout games and play it as such.
---
You're just punishing players who have played the game legitimately more than those who cheated.
---
Then how about show both? Character name with user name in parentheses?
---
Awesome thank you, i never received any correspondance like this
---
&gt; There are still active duping exploits 
---
Are you sure about this? It doesn't seem like there is at all.
---
I'm surprised you use turrets over traps 
---
Hehe, someone voted me down.  Is that you Mark?
---
Old man thank you. Yeah I was a bit whiny. üòù
---
If you lock them, pvp is inevitable.....
---
Learn the Plasma Gun plan. Equip Scrapper for more materials back and the 2nd version of the Science card lvl 2 ‚Äú(energy weapons cost less mats to build). Build and scrap until you get all the mods you want.

I've immediately suggested /u/cumberdong might want to re-do his map using [fo76map.com](https://fo76map.com) but this is even better ;) I've even purchased a PRO account to try it, but immediately noticed you can only share/link a single location, not a whole map populated with lots of custom notes. Is that anything you might consider addind to the map?
---
I'd like this too, but like anything else, it would be used negatively by jerks trying to grief low levels.
---
The more time goes on, FO really needs some kind of karma system. Even if it's only cosmetic, there should be some way to see if a player is an ass or not, without waiting for them to shoot you.
---
If you do not have the plans yet by all means do the event. I have the plans. It takes 3 seconds to build generator and like 35 minutes to do that event and half the time it's bugged No Thanks too much of a PIA
---
No problem, I hope they will work with you more than they did with me, I may love their games to pieces but it's bad when Activision gives better customer support than they do by a long shot.
---
Yeah that's how ESO does it and it works. 
---
Oh definitely, but what about loot picked up during nuke runs. The fact is, it shouldn‚Äôt be a concern either way. The entire game is structured around picking up junk, including the provision of perk cards that explicitly allow you to carry more junk while running around.
---
Why even let the players choose a name then?
---
Ah, then it‚Äôs not truly floating! Google foundation stacking. Once you get the formula down you can build 100% off the ground. 
---
I just want an unclaim option. Sometimes I don't need the workshop for longer than an hour. Or at least an option that allows you to just let the attacker have it without engaging or having to worry about pvp. Most people trying to take it don't want the workshop they just want the pvp. I hate fallout pvp so I rarely claim a workshop just to avoid it but on occasion I be needing some crystal to make cryo cells and I haven't found anywhere I can farm it yet. So I'll usually take lakeside cabins. I never build more than 2 generators and two collectors. I won't even build turrets. Just what I need for the resources. And I'll server hop when someone attacks it. Lol. Pvp in fallout is the biggest joke ever. 
---
I can craft plasma guns but I'm at the point where I don't get mods from scrapping plasma pistols anymore since crafting a plasma gun gives you a plasma pistol. Is there a plasma rifle plan?
---
I've never been PvP'd at a workshop doing this. However if someone does steal my Cores I want a chance to PvP them. I won't get my cores back but it'll be satisfying to get revenge.
---
No, that's part of taking it feom someone else.
---
The current owner should be able to release the workshop ownership without having to hop servers, however.
---
I agree that the holo and terminal writing is pretty good, but I‚Äôd say the overall story and motivation for your character is embarrassingly weak. I‚Äôm hung over and missed the exodus? Really? 
---
There‚Äôs no town that everyone else congregated in? Really?
---
There‚Äôs no Dogmeat? Really?
---
Maybe I‚Äôm too old (and go way back to Wasteland days) but it seems that the idea was ‚ÄúEveryone‚Äôs crafting, trading cards and battle-royale-ing: let‚Äôs do that in FO4 engine!‚Äù
---
Okay will do.  Thank you.  I got lucky by getting marsupial and then healing factor.  I do NOT want to loose those two lol.  I will add those to the mix.  I appreciate your input.
---
I want a bug zapper for stingwings!
---
I don't think AWS allows Windows 2003 servers anymore.
---
Well there's already a place in the game that gives you some clues about a possible weather control system, in the observatory close to Seneca rocks, the U.S. government was developing a secret proyect to use the weather as weapon, It was called proyect ATLAS iirc.
---
So we can expect a weather control system as dlc in the future probably....
---
You should make it look like an actually airplane inside too 
---
He wanted to PVP. Not griefing 
---
Anyone else have The Flight of the Valkeries playing in their head as they looked at these pictures?
---
Scrapping a plasma gun gives you a plasma pistol? Hol' on.
---
More sources for caps=more caps you can get per day. The more caps you have, the more likely you are to pay higher prices for items.
---
I have maybe a 20% success rate in gifting items to low level players. They either don't get why I am being charitable, run away/fast travel, even using the mic to explain my intentions. I even had a lvl 4 throw a grenade at me for just using vault 76 as a fast travel stop.
---
A gift icon would be great, but people will also use it as a lure people into an attack. 
---
Thanks! It took 4 full rebuilds in 3 locations (plus multiple workshop sessions getting the technique down) to get it to something I was totally happy with. I still wish I had a bit more build area to make it more streamlined like my original concept, but for now I‚Äôm pretty stoked about it. 
---
&gt; I just bought the game against my better judgment
---
Huh?
---
I like the Varmint Trap and Chicken Coop. 
---
Why shouldn't Carnivores have a way to get some meat at the camp, like growing crops. 
---
That's kinda the point. Vegetarian gets the benefit of being a farmer, Carnivore gets the benefit of being a hunter.
---
It's much more common to find meat in the wild than vegetables.
---
My point was that anyway, whitespring is already a warzone, nuked almost permanently and under the hands of the highest level.
---
That's the best spot of legendary spawns , so people are there constantly. That's actually why you think legendary cards would be an issue. So it wouldn't change anything.
---
That was the most interesting game mode and i hope more games try to pull this off
---
Wait how do I get this barbed wire mod?! I only knew about 3rd hook!!!
---
Crafting
---
Question (baring in mind I‚Äôve only skimmed the map and haven‚Äôt went over it with a fine-tooth comb), is any double-checking happening to ensure than an unmarked location is static and not a random encounter, and also, if this blows up, will locations marked on the map that can ALSO feature random encounters (I.e. #23 crashed vertibird pond) be color coded differently? Thanks! And good work.
---
No you make rifles by adding stocks to your pistol, keep scrapping its not guaranteed to get a mod every scrap.
---
Preston! Get off the subreddits and go back to Massachusetts, for god's sake!
---
Of all the things to be concerned with.....the weather. Lol. 
---
There are only 5 factions of vendors. Each has a cap limit of 250. The most you can make in 24 hours is 1250 from selling shit
---
This be awesome! right now character name exists only so you can select who you are playing, its a line on a menu nothing else.
---
See the reply of u/Daedrael 
---
The stock mod decides if the weapon is a pistol or a rifle. If you don't get any more mod unlocks you're bound to have some rifle stocks unlocked to mod the crafted pistol into a rifle.
---
Thanks,  I appreciate the thought.
---
I honestly don't understand why we can't edit our maps and add our own markers. We walk around and can gather pieces of paper and pens/pencils, but we can't use symbols to mark places of interest on our maps.
---
definitely its legit...you earn the caps and can  buy what you like.
---
I personally enjoy the thrill of finding great stuff.  keeps the game interesting, but with soon to come DLC, I may need to spend some caps...we'll see. ;)
---
To be honest, it would be perfectly fine if people had the same character name running around. It would be uncommon enough where it wouldnt be a problem. And each character looks different it would be fine because you could tell them apart.
---
System wouldnt be bothered by it as the account would still be under the unique user ID.
---
Yeah I went that route originally but I still needed it to be a functional camp that I enjoyed spending time in. So it‚Äôs more personal airship than public airline. 
---
shit you right i forgot, carry on
---
Yes! Love this one!
---
I wouldn't mind this despite already being a radstorm magnet myself. I don't mind because I love that stupid sound it makes, like being stuck in one of those wavy noise tubes you'd get as a kid.
---
So I'm assuming the spot where I just found a crashed vertibot? Ha.
---
Also down to help.  Same username.
---
Oh man if only I could add that to the video! Would probably get taken down for copyright on YouTube though. 
---
I was down until I saw the username.
---
I've got three explosive weapons in the past month. Four of you count the bloody auto nade launcher with faster fire rate and crit refill. Plus many good two star weapons and armor. Plus some god roll low level stuff.
---
Loot tables seem pretty good to me. Of course, I ain't farming whitesprings. 
---
And most of those games have clear definable paths to obtain said gear. We will have to see how the purveyor works out, but unless you get to specify what type of legendary the grind will still be real. Like real enough for only a small portion of the player base to really stay
---
 When based and pvp could be fun if we all had the gear we wanted for the playstyle we wanted.  Then alts and builds would be a thing. Until then we are all beggars. 
---
And yes, player vending will help some. 
---
We need 3 star legendarys in rewards for completing events. The current events rewards are worthless and the dropped bodies disappear without any meatpiles to loot from. FO76 is a waste of time
---
Yea! those things do more damage to my walls than the Mirelurk Queen that spawns nearby.
---
Interesting, I don't mind the players, cuz, what they gonna do, destroy it? Probably, but I don't mind, I can repair a few turrets and a switch. I have a switch that turns the turrets so other players can farm in peace, but they don't take the time to pay attention to anything. Also, if it wasn't acceptable then why is it possible? It seem to me a more then acceptable thing.
---
I'd recommend **politely** posting an update to your ticket requesting a status update.
---
Why?
---
I'd be happy with less legendary spawns but drop better loot and loot that corresponds with the dropper...a 3* should drop a 3* legendary 
---
Not as insulting as 100+ queen kills with zero serum recipes and maybe 2 *** items. Meanwhile a friend has killed her maybe 25-30 times by his account and has looted 17 of the 19 recipes. It's become a running joke in our group. 
---
7 factions with 200 cap limit and the traveling vendor bot who also has 200 caps.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve tried that a few times. I even tried to lure a scorchbeast over to kill them for me which  worked at first. I couldn‚Äôt shake the [DAMGER] indicator tho so they kept finding me. Eventually I had to kermit suicide and jump off the building so it was faster to retrieve my junk lol.
---
I wonder if itll be a roaming vendor like grahm?  If not, its gonna be a busy lineup for this guy.
---
I agree finding is much more rewarding 
---
Makes sense. Definitely very cool
---
I'm assuming Sony has the same requirements but Microsoft requires your GT be displayed, which is why they're like that across all platforms, what's good for one is good for all, and all that.
---
Also why Sony's resistance to X-platform play killed it for XB/PC play anywhere.
---
Ahh. So probably the servers were pretty full and so you just got cycled back to the same server over and over again. Bethesda probably has some algorithm for determining when to open a new server and it probably didn't want to put you in an empty one right then.
---
Also, this explanation is why my 2 vampire's shotguns are my most valued items in my inventory.
---
Because reporting people would be pointless. They could just delete their character and do whatever they were doing.
---
I think you need to be level 20. I just got my player to level 15 and had level 4 makeshift warrior and it would not let me make a mole miner gauntlet until I reached level 20. 
---
Stupid I think! Bug maybe? 
---
RC
---
I think Sony actually mandates that for developers, if I remember correctly. Probably has to do with legal stuff and/or player accountability.
---
Haha! Gary.
---
For sure. The True Storms mod is one of the things that kept me playing Fallout 4.
---
Black powder rifles are too slow.
---
Yes , I found a place up in the north-east , A  circle pond that had a waterfall flowing down toward some other area, A crashed vertibird and a tree in the middle of the pond. such a beautiful spot.  I loved it. It would get attacked every now an again by the local wildlife, but nothing I could not handle. I built a Cool little bridge from the main house to an area I considered the sleeping quarters. It was built exactly as I wanted it .. even had a patio looking out onto the wilderness .. 
---
Ahhh but all good things must come to an end. When I went to pick up and move a foundation, it gave me the   "**Cannot remove Item,  Part of the structure would not be accessible**"  Ok, I have gotten this plenty of times , I will store/delete anything connected .. HA ,before I knew it , I had removed everything but my foundations .. And Then it happened. I still could not remove like 90% of My foundations "**Cannot remove Item,  Part of the structure would not be accessible"** constantly popping up. So, I had to wrap up my base and restart. I began rebuilding .. but this time I stopped halfway in and tried to remove a piece and got the same error .. So I packed up and went looking for a new area to build in .. Such a shame cause this place was perfect. I am a glutten for punishment though So I  might go back there and try again...   
---
Ya, 21 is a a bit low to go against a 60.
---
Thatit may not be a L60 next time, depending on who's been through the area lately - in that critters spawn based on whos around, or been around recently.
---
Last weekend, (first time I tried the exavator armor mission) there were several lvl 20 mutant in the parking lot, and a large swarm of L50+ mutants with auto assault rifles in the lobby.  Even in T45 PA, I died a lot, and never made it past the lobby.
---
Went back last night - no mutants in the parking lot, and a smattering of lvl 20's ghouls inside the building.  
---
Cleared them and got the plans...when the 3x lvl 22 mole miners showed up.
---
The worst was a L42 diseased wendigo that appeared as soon as I exited the PA station ( that also respawned when a L31 player popped in)
---
Make them drop only from legendary 3 star cryptids.  That way it will distribute the farming groups around the map. 
---
Definitely possible to implement given the future prestige levelling, would love these to be lootable once you‚Äôve prestiged with maybe a completely separate perk page with 2-3 slots for prestige perks? 
---
True true, but lots of them have fo76's type of gear grind as well, PoE for instance. The only conflict I have with the way fo76's grind works is that it wasn't billed as this kind of game. It was supposed to be a survival game and it isn't.
---
Yeah, looking at the numbers it would give you pretty consistent coverage across the whole range of health. It drops off a little in the middle but only down to 26.
---
I bought a switchblade that had vampiric, +2 strength (or endurance, dont remember), and a faster swing speed. You never know what goodies you'll find in a random shop.
---
I‚Äôm pretty glad they use account names. I was very high when I made names my character and I thought ‚ÄúDat Boi‚Äù was a good option.
---
It was on all so nope.
---
You mean besides spamming the get over here heart thumbs up wave repeatably until they decide the risk of immediate death is worth seeing what the crazy person wants......yep totally agree.
---
Sorry I don't have an answer, just a funny observation. I collect and scrap EVERYTHING. I'm always in need of screws, plastic, and adhesive, but never copper. I see posts asking for location to farm this or that and scratch my head thinking *I just dumped XXX amount of that.* Guess I'm gonna have to start paying more attention to what gives me what so I can answer posts like this. Good luck on your copper hunt.
---
I am buying them from the Enclave and I use hard bargain 3, grape mentats, sweet roll and have 4 charisma base, that gets the price down to 17800 caps for me, I‚Äôm also doing a totally solo vendor purchasing only run through. The caps mount up faster when your killing graffton monsters, behemoths, super mutants, whitesprings ghouls, walking instead  of fast travelling or using travel agent when you have to, use pharma pharma to get extra chems to then sell to the vendors to make 1400 caps per day and make a route of cap stashes to collect with cap collector 3
---
ROFL ü§£ 
---
thanks for replying, these bugs are there since launch. Glad one of them is getting fixed
---
Duping was possible. Possible does not mean acceptable. It is possible to grab the horde and lead them to the camp, then spam them with a gamma gun while they tear the camp to pieces.
---
People want to farm high spawn places like whitesprings. People do it in groups, letting everyone get shots in on the legendaries so all can loot. Turret spam makes that impossible, the turret owner is hogging all the legendaries for themselves as well as preventing respawns from happening properly.
---
It is pure selfishness. Not realizing it is somewhat acceptable. Knowing it and doing it anyways is a complete dick move.
---
The ‚Äútry another world‚Äù option has never actually worked for me. Probably 4/4 times it left me in a never ending load loop. I no longer even try. I click ‚Äústay on this world‚Äù then leave manually and rejoin.
---
Oh okay! But this answers my question thanks :D! My question was basically does vats allow the 25% bullet to ever hit or does that one just stray off everytime, you are telling me there are times when you shot and both 100% and 25% hit their mark, which makes me happy
---
Don't you put that evil on me Preston Garvey...
---
Fingers crossed not for a long time. 
---
I named myself Dat Boi after the 2015 meme of the frog on a unicycle -_- 
---
New Vegas was meant to be a quick cash grab. It just ended up being so much more. Took the series to the next step that a lot of people hoped would be there to stay 
---
\-1 point for no flaming chainsaw. 
---
Well a no would have sufficed.
---
Oh wow that's awful. I play in a team and without a doubt one of us nabs amazing weapons and armor and the other gets squat every time we do a whitesprings nuke zone. 
---
Bro I have an extra tinfoil hat if you need one bro. 
---
That's counterproductive. The best way to deter someone is to max the budget with cardboard vault dwellers. The more the workshop budget is maxed the more it costs to contest. No one wants to spend a bunch of caps for cardboard. 
---
Blow everything up and you just made the workshop cost a lot less to claim.
---
The problem was +100% damage was wayy too much and out classes every other prefix. There was no reason to ever run furious, junkies, anti armor, ect because two shot out classes them. Only exception was bloodied but a meta of two shot and bloodied with a bunch other useless prefixes is quite boring
---
What's stupid, IMO, is that we have to wait for a drop of *anything*, **at all**.
---
What I would rather have a robust, progressive, and explicitly *deterministic* means of obtaining whatever gear you want. 
---
The optimum approach, IMO, would be to make legendary effects equivalent to mods that you can add to any weapon you want, provided that you have the recipe and the base components. Recipes (all of them, mods or legendary mods) would be obtained as quest rewards of particular quests, rather than via random scrapping. 
---
That's not to say that you shouldn't still find random gear on dead enemies, but you should never have to pray to RNGesus to get the item you want, you should have a way of getting it via quest progression. 
---
Hand me a vampiric furious rolling pin and I will happily use it. I may even hunt down a chef outfit.
---
Ha! Not in the videos... yet! Maybe in a take on the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I‚Äôm sure Leatherface would be all over a dual bar flamer mod!
---
Harley Quinn makes my skin crawl.  
---
I have seen no proof thus far that people didn't deserve it.
---
And if you make stingwing fillets you get +2 strength
---
I think the worst part is that some stuff could almost fit. Like If you save Preston, and take the first Minuteman quest straight away, you get sent to Tenpines, and clear out Corvega. Which I always liked, since that's where the raiders in Concord came from. But why couldn't we just find something on the Raiders telling us they came from Corvega. Or Preston could tell us that's where they came from, and it's a pre-emptive strike to protect Sanctuary. That makes more sense in the story imo. I will find my son, but these people need my help NOW. I'll make sure they're ok, and I might just have some new friends.
---
Wherever there is baseballs
---
Fair enough! But judgemental but fair enough 
---
I could get on board with that
---
Make brass &amp; steel cartridge ammo with steel reducing a weapons durability faster
---
I've seen no proof they did. 
---
I've seen no proof they did. I got suspended for meeting a duper and asking how to do it, I reported him and the method.... But I had picked up a bag for him, would you consider that fair? Infact I have screen shots of the whole encounter and me talking to lady devann whole it was happening
---
Christ, I just tag so much stuff for search I end up picking up anything with the magnifying glass...swimming in most everything
---
Based on the drum for the weapon, it is an MG-42, or possibly an MG-2. The 2s were rechambered 42s that were captured during and after the war. But based on the feed ramp, it probably isn‚Äôt an MG-3. 
---
Just a note: If you have starched genes you can just play your luck and get mutations through rads. Get rads, gain a mutation, apply starched genes, cure the rads. Rinse and repeat. You may have to play your luck on getting the mutations you want if you are only looking for some but not others, but you can use this to get a nice start and then use serum to finalize. Saves a bunch of caps.
---
Alright champ.
---
You dupe, you get banned. too bad, so sad.
---
Meat hooks are the best melee weapon in the game right now, because they benefit from both unarmed and 1 handed perks. Really hope you didn't throw away any bloody / swing speed ones...
---
Risky clicks of the day
---
&gt;Well a no would have sufficed, some people didn't deserve it and fo76 could use the numbers...
---
How would you know? Seems to be a lot of players when I'm on. What you can't see them? Ohh that's right my bad I forgot I didn't cheat.
---
Idk about needing a re-release/total gear wipe.  This is all early content.  If Fallout76 continues on like MMOs in general, there will be content coming in the future that will outclass all of the current top of the line gear.  If I had to hazard a guess, legendary vendor will be the start of the final decline of duped gear and then the dungeons they've talked about releasing will probably be the start of better gear becoming available that will supplant the best of the duped gear.
---
Like with most/all good MMOs in general, there is almost always something to farm.  Granted, there is a point you can cap out on content.  Usually that's when people make alts or just take a break/lessen playing time until the next content release.  
---
At least that's my experience from being a hardcore MMO raider for years for a few different MMOs.  Granted, I've been done with hardcore raiding since 2012 and this is the first game I've played to scratch my MMO itch in awhile.
---
Food and drink are great, when you get the hang of what everything does you‚Äôll be cooking up a storm, glowing meat steaks for extra melee damage, sweet roll for extra charisma, iguana soup for extra luck, there‚Äôs something that makes you invisible in water, think it might be gulper slurry, tons of stuff for rad resistance, disease resistance, health and AP regen, just put your favourites on your favourite wheel for easy access and avoid the speed demon mutation as this will increase you need to eat and drink even further. Can-do perk can be used on all the bins at whitesprings and all the bear proof trash cans out it‚Äôs wild to get extra canned food and teamed with good doggy perk you‚Äôll end up with more food than you know what to do with. Also build yourself a water purifier ASAP so you‚Äôve always got a supply. 
---
I have had this issue too. Also being put back into what appears to be the same world.
---
Definitely open to this, 300 hours in and only had four, five maybe 3 stars.. Nothing decent either. 
---
Finding a great weapon is far better than buying one. I assume. The best I have found is a 2-star TS Furious Dragon.  
---
Furious. Dragon. Think about that. 
---
I have no issues with player numbers. Every server I am on is pretty full and since the banned players make up less than 1% of all players they won't add anything to server populations when and if they do come back.
---
I know because I have other account idiot.
---
&gt;Hence one reason the character in Tomb Raider was originally male
---
Take that back!  Blasphemer!   Shame!  SHAME!!!!!    (  ;p  )
---
So....you asked a cheater how to cheat and then picked up a bag of items gotten by cheating....and don't understand why you're banned...ok...
---
Yeah these seem reasonable, love the flora idea but they need to focus on lot of other problems first.
---
1st poster is right. Adding the right stock transforms it into a rifle, making rifle perks relavent. Also cam mod it into an automatic which switches perks to commando.
---
Oh wow that sounds amazing. Love this idea. 
---
This happens to me regularly...have to quickly stash it and replace it to get it to stop.
---
Without a doubt. I loved the exploring, crafting, building, and combat in Fallout 4 and Fallout 76 feels like the end game of FO4.
---
The human interaction is a plus.
---
The lack of human NPC's is a minus.
---
I just figured it was meant to be a repeatable quest.  Do you have confirmation that it is a bug that it keeps coming back?   Maybe one of the developers is really creeped out by clowns so another developer is doing everything they can to make sure there are always some people running around the wasteland in clown costumes?
---
A lot of ppl put lol but never really laugh out loud... But shit your comment made me laugh. Have an upvote sir. 
---
The only turret in my camp that reliably fires at anything is the aggro turret that spawns relentlessly in the shed thing I built off. 
---
So I just got rid of the other. Stupid lay abouts.
---
I've noticed in some other games with open worlds, they allow you to place 'point of interest' tabs on their map.  GTA V would be one example.  But these are seldom useful in these games, because there isn't really any way to positively interact with these areas, there's no resources,  or items you can collect that would be worth making a tab for.
---
Fallout 76 on the other hand is different, there are so many unmarked locations that have useful components, or other resources.  I think we could really use a feature for 76 that allows you to place a number of location tabs for points of interest that are saved on your map.  That way players can place one for when they find a location they really like, whether it's a good view or potential camp location, or maybe it's just a good place to find some food or junk.
---
I see a lot of  posts requesting this, as cool as it would be I‚Äôd much rather see new cosmetics in the atom store, will happily pay real money for some decent military gear (camo, urban, black etc). Already have the camo, blackbird and patriot pa skins bought with real money, some outfits to go with them would be awesome! 
---
Good news and bad news.
---
Good news: That song is in the public domain!
---
Bad news: The performances of that song by specific people are generally copywrited. Soooo.... If you perform it yourself or if you can find a janky rendition that no one will ever know you janked from someone, you'll never get struck. Lol
---
Cool hopefully they'll ban that one soon. Keep on cheating then whining on here. Bye Felicia
---
We already have this. 
---
It's called : Thumbs up emote followed by dropping stuff and you finish it by jumping up and down near it, or fire your weapon at it 85 times.
---
60% of the time it works Everytime
---
Many people have my first name. It would still be realistic enough
---
Happened here twice yesterday while trying to eat Brain Fungus Soup. I decided brains were bad and sold the other 40 I was carrying.
---
Along with the vendor we're getting, I'd really like legendary crafting. We have all these cool crafting systems in place... and they never get used for weapons and armor (besides power armor). Let me grind up my useless legendaries for magical legendary radiation dust (obviously don't call it that, call it something more lore appropriate) and then have legendary crafting plans for items. You could do 1, 2, and 3 star recipes. Hey, those recipes could be drops on new content bosses! Obviously 2 star should be much more expensive to craft and 3 star should be uber expensive, but at least then all these useless items would have a purpose, and I could feel like I was making meaningful progress. Plus, at least then I could at least guarantee the base item type and number of stars.

This cranky old lady sent you a friend request on PS4.  PSN:  yasicht
---
there's no problem with that =)  
---
just do it cyberpunk style: "coming when it's ready" and everyone will be happy!  
---
I trust naked players far less than armored/armed players lol.
---
Sure best as far as damage. But imo they look dumb as fuck, I'd rather use my all rise that to me looks better lol. I already have a tse handmade. I dont need more *broken weapons* 
---
Makes sense, other than food spoils so damn fast. 
---
I just eat dog food, with the food boost perk and the dog food perk, one can fills well over 50% of my hunger.
---
they lowered legendary drops from 100% to 30% the 2nd month after release. 
---
There was literally a plague people were dying from. Raiders. A massive flood caused by said raiders. Plenty to memorialize. 
---
It wasn't till I started tagging plastic that I found out you get it from packs of cigarettes!!! I thought it was only cloth. 40 LVs making runs to Morgantown Highschool and it was in my face all the time 
---
Shouldnt you be in r/Fallout?
---
Does anyone else only get garbage drops from legendaries? All I ever get are wood armor drops, pipe guns, shitty melee weapons. I want something cool for once. Give me a legendary hand made automatic or something damn lol
---
My mistake. But the vendor bot that roams is apart of the fact on in the South east train station. The name slips me right now. But still... 1400 isn't that much of a concern for inflation from selling ammo
---
Hate to break it to you, but 1 star bloodied &gt; TSE. That's how big the nerf was.
---
Are these random encounters or unmarked locations? The Unmarked locations can be found in the official "strategy" guide.
---
It's a survival game, this is something they have.
---
Becoming the most griefed player in Fallout: A Tutorial
---
I found this one awhile ago, I remember it vividly to this day. That‚Äôs some good story telling. 
---
Wait. Are you being for real? 
---
This would not help for the Mire or Ash Heap.
---
This. It would open the door to a lot more griefing. 
---
I needed them for the lead. 
---
I tag it for search for a while, it's every where. I found I was ignoring it because I was only ever looking out for screws/gears/springs scrap. 
---
Once I tagged it, I had a bunch shortly after. 
---
I mean white springs is the only place people go to now so nothing is really going to change there....
---
I want a rabbit hutch! Breed them and eat them.
---
I swore I wouldn‚Äôt play FO76 because I don‚Äôt like multiplayer but got an awesome deal on the PA edition so I bought it. 
---
I‚Äôm over 100 hours into it and I think I‚Äôm addicted. There is something about this game that keeps me coming back for more. I‚Äôve only met a few griefers but for the most part all of my encounters with other players have been wholesome. 
---
Get it, you won‚Äôt regret it. 
---
I've been playing with my friends who don't participate at all in online forums like this one on Reddit. All the hate-bandwagon stuff etc. completely goes past them.  
---
The only complaints they have is that they have no more quests to do and that the legendary loot is terrible. 
---
Because of this subreddit I know that Drills and Syringers are part of the legendary loot table even though they don't have legendary effects, something they don't even know (okay, I did tell them now eventually ;)
---
500 caps and a bottle of bourbon? 
---
u/ladydevann
---
Man I gotta check my tags because I swear I have plastic tagged but it doesn't show up when I pick up golf balls or cigarettes..
---
I‚Äôve seen this bought up so many times I think if it was an easy fix Bethesda would have done it by now. I would like to see this too but I doubt we‚Äôll see it happen
---
Sorry forgot my /s tag on the end of the broken weapons. As in they're fucking worthless. 
---
Bethesda has known this was a problem since day one. 
---
While I want to be rewarded for my efforts in game too, it's time to realize the developers are out of touch with the player base and will simply continue to focus on whatever demands corporate has placed on them. 
---
Same game, only the multiplayer will be in beta for a few decades until Bethesda eventually realizes that online games should go to the department that handles multiplayer.  (Namely whoever is overseeing ESO)
---
Honestly? No idea
---
Yeah, i really miss that fab True Storms mod for fo4
---
This is fantastic. One of my camps is at the "bus camp" 28 or 29 on your list and I used the Under Road for a bit too.
---
Another few I like ... 
---
\- The last monorail tower before the elevator you can build your camp on, and many do. Let's give it a name.
---
 \- South of Huntersville on the road is a Visitor's Center you can build your camp at. Several cans, tables, cola machine. Huntersville Visitor Center?
---
 \- East of Camp Venture is a set of two (ruined) houses you can camp in.
---
 \- You can build your camp at the first BOS transponder location on the bridge between Watoga and the Antique Shop.
---
 \- North of Whitespring, just passed the mutant area and before the trainyard is a bridge with some shacks / buses underneath it - you can build your camp there as well.
---
There are also other monorail towers like the Pylon you can climb and camp on.
---
There was a good mod for Skyrim that did this too. I'm also hoping that's the kind of thing they'll be putting into Nuke Winter 
---
I've actually noticed a shift ( I dont know if 25 luck is playing into it though) in the last week I have gotten a lot of 3* from 3* enemies. I've been making sure to take my time with them and letting the health regen as long as I've been doing that I notice I mostly get 2 or 3* from them
---
Might I offer the good word of our lord and savior...the humble melon? 
---
It fills water AND food simultaneously and regrows quite fast...With six planted I almost always have two or three available at my camp when I return.  Green thumb perk means I've got melons for days. 
---
Could also do what bloodborne did and give the play the option to which they would rather see
---
Tempting... well at least the bourbon üòÇ
---
YEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
---
This would be fun. 
---
I'd even like the ability to mix and match. Pants/skirts Shirts/tops, coats/jackets Belts/suspenders. That kind of thing. I love my Drifter outfit so long as I can't see the legs and shoes. So want the boots from the various jumpsuits. 
---
Actual location lol. Very funny place, if it wasn't so close to a fissure I'd consider it a prime place for a camp.
---
Wouldn't say worthless. My TSE .50 Cal Machien Gun is amazing for blowing up the circuitboards while clearing the silo. I literally keep it around for that express purpose.
---
No one like you Garvey... :)
---
Is it? My bad. It's just a possibility, of course. I'm sure it's something they've taken into consideration. I'd honestly be happier if we could scrap ammo, even if there's little return.
---
I‚Äôm pretty positive that what your encountering is simply a display bug. The mutation effects should still be applied correctly. I get the display glitch a lot but my mutations are always applied correctly.
---
Everyone agrees to include Bethesada...it is a bug and they are fixing it. It only started a few patches ago when they made mods stop breakng down to repair other components 
---
Just because you don't get as many "server not responding" messages  doesn't mean duping has been fixed. There were non-disruptive duping methods before that were fixed and current+active versions of them now.
---
I gave myself a cool name, so that's what people should see. WoW has done that for a long time. Friends can see your battle tag, but everyone else see's Joe the Barbarian. 
---
That's alot of weight to carry around for a single purpose. 
---
Made me laugh - Thanks!
---
After I retired as an adventurer, I tried my hand at adhesive farming. Totally not worth the effort. So then I tried my hand at crystal farming, and again it was a huge pain in the ass in exchange for little reward. So I guess it's back to adventuring once some new content comes out. 
---
My roving Civil War soldier is incredibly envious of you.
---
3\* are hard to come across as is and then you roll the dice on what you get. You can get a good weapon with a crappy effect or a crappy weapon with a good effect. I killed one in Watoga yesterday that gave me a nocturnal Fat Man- 1\* and one at White Springs that gave me a Mutant Slayers Fat Man- 1\*. Give me an Instigating or a TS Fat Man for the love of all that is holy!
---
Exactly we already have ultracite ammo why not others. And steel cartridges do deteriorate weapons irl. Idk would love to see these added for diversity for weapons and choices for certain occasions in game
---
yeah, but with the right perks/mutations, it packs a real punch.
---
Standing on a roof using VATS. its pretty cool.
---
Not for every situation, of course.
---
For the vertibird and deathclaw nest location, I'm about 95% sure they are static, I checked them a few times. Similar to the crashed vertibird in watoga. If they end up being events, I'll remove them. A event map would be amazing, but that's a whole other bear to wrestle.....
---
I hate you .. sooooo much.
---
There's another note with someone writing about taking the stuff. Are these a reflection of our play styles??
---
Right near the Mire Treasure #2 at the end of the rail line is a camp
---
I called it "End of the Line Camp"
---
Apologies :( 
---
Everyone agrees to include Bethesda.. What?
---
I adore WW2 military hardware and machines (makes Fallout all the more addictive). So this is really cool to me.
---
Why not show both then?  The character name with the account name.  Or have a way to look at the account name but have the character name visible as a primary display.
---
Hahaha you're so funny
---
Ramen!
---
Alright, cool. 
---
I‚Äôve never locked a generator when I farm cores, I start it up and get 1-2 then go do some things. After 20 minutes go back pick up what‚Äôs there and repeat. If someone needs some cores and it‚Äôs powered I don‚Äôt mind if they take a few... hell I even give them a few at times if they are super low and I have some to spare.
---
I carry lvl 5, 10mm pistol with 100 rounds ammo for the newer players. When dropped some understand most don‚Äôt.  Most newbs I encounter haven‚Äôt ever played a FO game and don‚Äôt understand. Just swat a few times like an idiot and drop the goods give a heart emote and shoot at the bag. Eventually they get it. My regret would be dropping a bag of goodness to an alt player. 
---
I also agree with having a KARMA level.  I gift a lot because I want people to love and play this game. 
---
Events based on in-game lore! One of my biggest beefs with this game is it's constantly showing me and telling me about awesome stuff that I can't play, that sounds a lot more fun than what I can actually do in the game. I mean PvP and PvE events, it'd be awesome to play the attack on Harper's Ferry, or the raid on the dam that devastated Charleston. 
---
Use port triggering not forwarding if at all possible.   
---
Maybe try the search button
---
Happened to so many times... it‚Äôs annoying 
---
You will notice the NPC's missing. Interacting with wastelanders has always been an important part of the story telling in Fallout. In 76 you have a shift in the methods that are used to tell the story. There is a bigger focus on using objects, scenery, notes, and other inanimate objects to tell the story. There are a very limited number of actual NPC's that fulfill any story telling in the game. Mechanics wise, this is practically fallout 4 but with real time vats and no NPC's. Crafting has been expanded but building has been dumbed down.
---
Settlements should be a thing. 
---
Maybe even in private instances, like your own managed vault. 
---
You mean like ‚ÄúPress Y to Search‚Äù like I would with an ammo box or first aid kit? 
---
You... you know she‚Äôs not really Harley Quinn, right?
---
I spent over an hour today just messing around in my house. I like to come home :)
---
For real, my man Skip has been purging the wastelands of filth and everyone thinks it‚Äôs EvilBrad3884. Dude need some recognition!
---
Hi Gary, it's me, Gary.
---
Yep - same experience here.  My guess is that it may be a perspective built from other games in which you attack everyone all the time.   
---
And you‚Äôre right, some would use it for evil purposes.  
---
fuck tha police frog?
---
Ya that was one I really wish I hadn't found the conclusion to. That and the abandonded cabin, I think it's called, the one with the mother who went out for something and told her kids to not unlock the doors for anybody but her. The cabin was locked when I got there
---
I wasn‚Äôt downvoting anyone?? I‚Äôm not even mad at the people posting. I said change my mind. I wanted a discussion why are you coming at me. 
---
I would want a character name redo then. 
---
What are you reporting people for anyway?
---
Terrible idea, shows a lack of understanding of the patch process.  The patch notes clearly won't match the patch if something is changed.
---
The scrapping of bulk is a bug?
---
We need a clapping emote too
---
Wow you must really be obsessed with me.
---
Kinda pathetic if I do say so myself.
---
Are you gonna sell a bloodied handmade for 500 caps?
---
It's a travelling merchant similar to Graham I believe. Just harder to find.
---
We should get mean from the Cow you can spawn when you put down fertilizer. 
---
damn he pulled the double-bro
---
So you used to be an adventurer like me?
---
YES YES YES!! but all we can do is hope :( 
---
Yeahp - I'll definitely be adding this feature! Do you have another case that you want to use it for (apart from /u/cumberdong's secret locations - which I can add to the map as a proper category)?
---
Thanks for the support btw :) 
---
&gt;  And steel cartridges do deteriorate weapons irl.
---
Oh I know...when I first got my AR I bought 500 rounds of some cheap Russian ammo and after a few 30rd mags at the range, the range officer came by and explained how "not awesome" they are for a gun
---
I'd love multiple ammo types with varying degrees weapon wear.
---
A displayed karma rating would be really cool!  Other players can glimpse you and know if your a tool!    
---
If nothing else, there is a static spawn point to pick one up. You'll roll the dice on level however. 
---
Depending on the wind conditions, the bombs on DC would have radioactive fallout in WV. This is with using the Tsar Bomba, expecting Fallout would have had stronger or at least the same "strength"
---
Try [this](https://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/) map out
---
Incoming more YT click bait videos trying to turn the 1 day DLC delay into another controversy!
---
Hah nice!
---
Hey where'd you get the plans for that nice and neat dresser in the captain's quarters? I've been trying to get a hold of that plan for awhile.
---
Fuck that lol, the other night i helped a lvl 14 who came for shelter with a hoard of mutants chasing him . I killed em , dropped some low lvl guns and stuff for him. Went for a smoke,came back and fucker was destroying my camp . Needless to say i ran after him and provoked him and killed him 
---
For example. I killed this one guy who had a 100 cap bounty. He then came and followed me with a full team and destroyed my base and kept trying to force me into pvp
---
You're  looking at 6k+ I'm afraid 
---
Seems like stuff is pretty reasonable on the Discord
---
Would be nice. I'm hoping the legendary vendor can make some of this happen or a legendary crafting system. There are lots of ways this can work...
---
Vendor sells (caps?) specific mods
---
Mechanism to trade existing legendaries for tokens. After X tokens of a type (ie, break down 20 bloodied weapons you get a 20 bloodied tokens) and trade 20 tokens in for a bloodied mod, etc.
---
etc.
---
But yes, deterministic.
---
haha...keep looking.
---
Quad AAE Black Powder Rifle=jealous, but i dont think that variant exists.
---
It‚Äôs the Purveyor
---
That sorta thing tends to be a bit of a trade off. the more customizable items are the less detailed they tend to be made.
---
This is freaking awesome, thank you!  I have some feedback for one of the locations that I don't see anyone else pointing out yet:
---
`18. Dapper Roach`
---
This location is actually an homage to "The Final Pam &amp; Trash Hulk" from Monster Factory's *hilarious* four-part Fallout 4 character creation video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_1jGnFt78H8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1jGnFt78H8)  
---
There are a variety of little easter eggs in the house relating back to the Monster Factory video (I won't spoil them).  Finding this location after laughing so much at the video was a delight.  It's awesome that the devs decided to include it in the game. My partner and I have Final Pam and Trash Hulk characters (shockingly accurate looking ones...) that we periodically wander the wasteland with.
---
I can only pay 2000 but I can pay with materials or something else on top of that
---
I don‚Äôt know why the scenario you suggest is any better than the inevitable high level players stomping on everyone. There is supposed to be high risk pvp. But it should also be a viable mode that someone could play all the way through. If someone wants to put a lot of work in and get to level 50 that doesn‚Äôt bother me. They will probably be in a different area on the map. And I believe they are reworking how the player visibility on the map works so it won‚Äôt be as easy to just find someone and go kill them anyway.
---
We really need a middle finger....I do badly lol 
---
Can anyone confirm this? Poor thing was already dead by the time I found it so I have no clue if I could trade with it or not 
---
Have you provided power to the lights?
---
Hahah madam if you‚Äôre sick of most dudes then let me speak for all of us by saying we humbly apologize for the inconveniences us men, as a whole, have caused the entire population of females. Furthermore I would like to elaborate and say I am not like these other foolish men, I actually respect women! I am a feminist and any man who gives you trouble will first have to get thru me in order to mutter their mere toxic masculinity words into the vicinity of your beautiful ear dear madam. Now madam if i may, just have a lick, just one small lick of your ear I am protecting, just one, little, *licks your ear starting from the top and swirls tongue with contours of ear until my tongue is deep in your canal* ‚Äúthis ith holw I‚Äôll protelct you madam‚Äù *my tongue still in your ear* I will protect your ears with my own tongue from these harmful words muttered by toxic males, for one in which I am not, and I will die before I surrender my duty/s
---
r/justneckbeardthings
---
Same, I like helping out new players cause I want them to have a good experience and keep playing (and 76 has far less early game guidance than other FO games)
---
I usually drop a decent melee weapon, a pistol/or a hunting rifle depending on level, and corresponding ammo. I'll usually craft them some armour as well. 
---
Alot of my Friends list is lower level players, so they could use my camp for fast travel and the water/junk there. I've noticed many of them helping out lower levels after they've leveled up quite a bit, which is nice. 
---
They played since launch everyday for hours dude no one gonna do that especially for this kind of game
---
yeah, whenever i get that message, and i choose to let it try to find another world, i get kicked back to the menu screen saying "this request was forcibly closed by the local client" whatever the hell that means
---
I also used to get those infinite loading screens as well
---
I think the right question to ask is how many bloodied handmades are floating in the market now. If there like 20+ with similar stats, I would charge more than 600 caps 
---
Another Subbreddit need your help.  I've subscribed you to it already.
---
But that sounds like you just want a temporary battle arena or something. This is the whole entire game being ported to hardcore mode. It seems like that will be wasted if people are just using it when they have good gear, and running away to gather them again. 
---
Came here looking for this kind of comment!!
---
I was staring at that monorail pylon last night debating on adding it, only name that came to mind was "thicc pylon." I'll add it lol.
---
I'll check out these locations today, but like I said in my post, I'm trying to avoid adding every ruined house and shack. I would easily be up to 200 locations if I added them lol. A house with 50 cat trophies? That's a location! A shack with a bed... not so much.
---
well that seems to be a bit of overkill...
---
IKR
---
Awesome! I'll wait for your update and then I'll try and get this sorted within a couple of days!
---
That's no problem, I can take 2k + some screws if you have any. I've just been giving away stuff since I started playing so I'm trying to at least start charging something so I don't operate at a loss all the time haha. I'm just happy someone gets to use it instead of it collecting dust in my inventory :). Let me know when you are home and i'll hop on fallout
---
This is a good idea simply because pvp at the moment is just a stealth boy spam. It would literally be impossible to get full sets of sentinel/assassin in the first month or so without duping. It would make everything feel balanced 100%. I'm down. 
---
Let's do it. 
---
But no one in this area died instantly in the first wave. 
---
No - search r/fo76 
---
hadn't noticed that, it could be handy for extra carry weight.
---
Okay, this is going to sound stupid...but I can't just scrap the ones I craft, right? I have to scrap ones I find, that have additional functions on them?
---
This info is in the big 76 game guide, I have the hardcover collector edition version. 
---
I found the obstacle course, number 2 on your map, it was cool to find medical supplies and a communication from the maker
---
Take of strange in numbers it‚Äôs bugged
---
And smashing things with axes
---
Build your regular wall and put a flat roof on it. Then extending out from it place a floor and a half wall on the end. The slanted roof should stick to the half-wall out there. Then you can snap the rest of the roof pieces to that one. So you'll end up with one side where the roof is even with a floor and doesn't overhang, but the rest will. In the pictures, its the spot where I've got the instruments out.
---
There is no legitimate reason to lock your base up to prevent other players from using work stations. People that do it are just selfish assholes.
---
Expect it to happen more often with the new pacifist mode and immune homes. Also expect a land rush on Whitesprings and vendor spawn location blocks. We‚Äôre never gonna see the traveling sales bot again. Trolls getting their home nuked next to that lake so it can spawn won‚Äôt be a thing anymore.
---
I'm ready now I can get on on like five minutes
---
Okay, my apologies. I did not mean to fill up the subreddit with posts that have already been made! 
---
So by charging 600 caps for a god rolled weapon makes the decent rolled weapons essentially worthless. You get a 3* weapon that‚Äôs not the most desirable roll, it sells for 500 to 1k.  If god rolls are 600, you‚Äôd have to pay someone to take them lol. 
---
You just need to shop around. I‚Äôm on Xbox and you‚Äôll find people on the LFG selling serum recipes for anywhere from 300-1k caps. Some people want way too much for their stuff and others are just happy to get rid of it for some caps. Just be patient and you‚Äôll find good deals. 
---
I like this suggestion but this topic is extremely overused and encourages players to grief any camps at whitesprings. My camp was destroyed by the river near the golf club because of this
---
Great, see you in Appalachia!
---
So let me get this straight. You‚Äôre trying to prove I‚Äôm toxic due to the level I am? That doesn‚Äôt make sense try again
---
Well... the thing I don't like about your approach is that it requires grinding *and* still some prayer to RNGesus. You have to grind out 20 bloodied weapons to get a bloodied mod, for example. If they're going to sell the mods, I'd rather just pay caps. 
---
I really *really* hate grinds. 
---
Fun idea
---
Theres 3 weapons that are seemingly useless and that is the Ripper, Mr.Handy Buzzblade and the Chainsaw.... HOWEVER!.. there is 1 perk in game that makes these weapons go from 0 to 100 real quick. "Overly Generous" makes it so each melee attack has a chance to apply 50 rads on your enemy. Well these weapons happen to have like 10 hits per second. So basically thse weapons do like 250 rads per second with this perk. 
---
They are the most overpowered rads weapons in the game. 
---
Nuclear winter isn't actually winter. It get colder but from blocking out the sun. Nuclear winter is more associated with crop failure and famine.
---
Holy hell are you salty. Show me on the doll where they touched you? 
---
Best melee I got was an Instigating war drum 1\* which is perfect for my build. Ballistic is my Ghoul slayers combat shotgun 2\* with additional 10% when aiming, great for WS. I have never had an explosive drop. 
---
that "market" value is merely a suggestion by the game. but since people do not care to bother with buying ammo you will have a hard time selling them. explosive ammo i see abandoned all the time due to the weight of each round. and other ammo eventually just winds up abandoned in favor of rounds they actually use (even if any)
---
a much better example of ammo selling rate was done by this guy, even if he was on X-box [https://www.reddit.com/r/Market76/comments/awacru/xb1\_h\_fully\_modified\_t60\_power\_armor\_ready\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Market76/comments/awacru/xb1_h_fully_modified_t60_power_armor_ready_for/)
---
Yes had a similar problem with Charleston but there is a temporary solution for Ryzen processors.  
---

---
Nono don‚Äôt get me wrong I said I‚Äôm all for pvp. I‚Äôm just saying the people who exploit pvp brokenness 
---
Yeah, once you have any floors or stairs connected to the stacked stairs, you can't remove them because the CAMP thinks they're not touching the ground, since the stacked stairs technically aren't snapped together to the foundation. If you miss-place any of them you've got to start from scratch.
---
Very much YES!!
---
Up vote!
---
No you craft them too. That‚Äôs just as effective. It‚Äôs what I do for armor to get their unlocks. If you have the plans definitely craft and scrap
---
I haven't seen one of these yet, but that hits me hard in the gut. It's a beautiful and poignant memorial. 
---
Have super duper and scrapper perks on too
---
Cant really expect to pay 3k for the best item in the game... pretty sure the 100k was for a set, seeing as sentinel unyielding is what sells the highest and its at 20k per piece
---
Had a level 2 naked guy wander into  my CAMP last night.  I felt like a couldn‚Äôt trust him!   LOL.  I tried giving him a bag and he tried to hatchet me.    So I guess I right, or the player simply didn‚Äôt understand the mechanics and environment yet.  
---
Funny note:  my camp is a couple stories up in a power line tower.  I was making him a level 1 hunting rifle and he managed to fall to his death.    I peered over the edge and looked down at his body.    Decided to give the rifle to someone else.    Left his bag there be he didn‚Äôt respawn to retrieve it.  
---
Gimme pictures. Gotta know how to make it prettier. It would probably look nicer if it wasn't so big at the top, but I needed the space for all the furniture.
---
Exactly. That‚Äôs just the nature of the beast. How many stores sell the exact same product at a higher price then another store?
---
It's not impossible to change, they offer a ticket category to change it, it's tucked away with the submit ticket function. 
---
I don't think my account name I type to log in should ever be shown to others for security reason, but they weren't interested in testing and having a feedback loop to address these kinds of thing along with the core ui and usability of the game so here we are
---
Think unsexy thoughts! Think unsexy thoughts!
---
It is so idiotic to me that the account name was used instead of character name. Completely destroys RP.
---
This would explain the popping up and down I think I might‚Äôve seen?  Was I crazy?  
---
Yeh me to, some of the outfits are a bit fortnite and I ain't down with that shit. No offense to those who play it, but it'd not my cup of tea. 
---
You mean to tell me, the MIRV detonation was never noticed??
---
If you name yourself

Just remembered we actually have those already, they're called heavy laser Turrets, :-)

It's a lot easier to get caps than it is to get really good drops from a 3 star legend mob.  If anything they could be higher. 
---
Anything new I can participate in that isn't PVP-centric would be great! 
---
Feels like I'm wearing nothing at all... nothing at all... nothing at all...
---
That was one option. Another I listed was simply caps for legendary mods :)
---
Time for a road trip!
---
Any animal farming type addition should have requirements for sustenance crops.
---
For example: if you want a chicken coop, it will require having 5 corn growing at all times to feed the chickens.  Those corn plants will be un-harvestable by the player, or harvesting them will stop the chicken production ...  something like that.
---
And, in keeping with the laws of thermodynamics and energy conservation, the food% gained from the chickens would need to be significantly less than what you'd gain from the corn.
---
Yep. I'll see if I can find some screenshots and save you time.
---
Because griefing? What is stopping me from just logging on to another character and pretending to be someone other than the person you just destroyed your entire base or took your workshop????
---
Yes! Only instead of taking an arrow to the knee I took "76's end-game content" to the face. 
---
I'd have rather had the arrow
---
I‚Äôm not 100% certain but I think I bought that plan from the white springs furniture vendor. 
---
I wouldn't mind seeing actual effects from the weather.  But the level of coding we're talking about is...pretty extreme.  You could add a chance to be struck by lightning during a thunderstorm.    
---
If not under cover, Calculate lightning.  Chance to be struck by lightning = 1/Number of individual covered by storm  
---
BUT: now you have to add in factors like "Tesla Coils on Power armor increase chances" and "Trees attract lightning" etc etc.  But those all can be accounted for with a tight enough algorithm.  Assign a damage value to a strike, and boom.  Extreme weather, take cover.  It can even destroy your base!!!  They would need to add more logic to "Roofs" though, because as it stands you only really have "Indoors/outdoors" and roofs might as well not even bother existing *(wear Power Armor during a rainstorm and you'll see what I mean, you can be inside the fire station on the bottom floor and still seeing the water hitting your screen)*  
---
Toss occasional map-wide events Like (these would affect ALL locations in the server)
---
* hurricane - The map now has to deal with high wind and heavy rain mechanics (when outdoors: throw projectile trajectories are badly effected and visibility is heavily reduced)
---
* Drought / Heat Wave - Thirst increases twice as fast
---
* etc etc (the more "seasons" we get, the more interesting map-weather modifiers we could end up with
---
To help differentiate between alts perhaps
---
This is way better. Character only is a bad idea. Would only encourage griefing
---
Nah fam i agree with OP. Duping sucked and was hella unfair to players, and just anyone tryna play due to server stability.
---
And their reasoning for it was god awful. "iTs iN tHe gAMe i mUst be aLlowEd tO dO iT1"
---
In the past, I've been able to remove stacked stairs by removing everything that touches them, but not this time.
---

I'll try to check it out.

It feels awkward doesn‚Äôt it?!
---
Roses are red.

Violets are blue.

Eat shit, crybaby cheaters.
---
If players are willing to spend 6000 caps on an item, people will charge that amount. Many people don‚Äôt want to endlessly grind for junk hoping to get a god role weapon. It‚Äôs easier in the game to farm caps than legendary items, so unless that changes, then prices will remain inflated. The only thing that may effect the economy is the new legendary vendor and that mechanic. If I can scrap legendary items to add effects to other items, then I don‚Äôt need to spend caps. 
---
Yea I think the best gear should be really expensive...I don‚Äôt like them getting cheap. It‚Äôs capitalism. It doesn‚Äôt usually support forcing sellers to allow everyone to get their products at a price everyone to afford
---
Interesting. So this is just another way of having it bug out on you. lol
---
Dunno, I've found enough that they go into the overseers chest in Flatwoods with the other basic plans.
---
I uh, hope they're not rare.
---
How can you get ripped off if the offer and demand dictates the prices? 
---
Yeah, the Marsupial and Bird Bones works but as you've said. Not worth the BIG damage hit.
---
yes, its super annoying, hopefully they should be fixing it soon
---
You gotta kill em slow and let them
---
Mutate. Knowledge to be gained from people that have been inhabiting these games and play them like a new DLc, helpful
---
To the rest of us who did nt buy any Bethesda games before
---
Yeah. They're trying to make it so it doesn't auto scrap but they turned it on so it can be used when building. Right now it's either or. 
---
Looks good man. I like how you did the bar. 
---
That sounds alot like a Saturday or a Sunday..
---
I roleplay as a Free Stater. But only because I hate the government in real life. It's a natural fit and I love 76 for this new faction.
---
I'm on just waiting for the friend request :)
---
griefing would actually help this game, like literally any remarkable change. 
---
This is due to being on multiple platforms, with each platform having different rules. I believe it is ps4 that requires any online game to always show your account name, so that's probably why they did it that way.
---
Ha! I think we should propose a ‚ÄúI‚Äôm coming for your ass‚Äù icon to!    LOL.  Got what they deserved.  
---
Dont forget all stealth nerfs thats been every update
---
I used my bloodied level 10 black powder pistol until 50 or so
---
hopefully player vending machines will bring some balance, for every greedy player, there will be some great deals i imagine
---
so, just ignore the deals you dont like and support the players who offer reasonable deals
---
you have the power to decide!
---
Fair enough, but now you're asking for balance in a game that... well you know what I mean.
---
Fair 'nuff. My bad... I posted, instant downvote, made the assumption it was you.
---
Yep. My lvl 28 turret (a gift - I can't build it yet) is on the job. It might wait until the enemies are a bit closer, but they never get to my structures.  And the enemies pretty much come from one direction in 120¬∞ or so radius. To be fair though, I live in an area with low level enemies.
---
An Ode To The Banned and the Downvoters.
---
"Here is the church, here is the steeple.
---
Dear God, look at all the salty banned people.
---
Oh yea, the market will be fine without them
---
Thank you for moving on to Fortnite and Anthem."
---
But, they can't destroy my camp. Also, that's why the switch is there, if you want, turn it off and so dose the turrets. And, sure, you can decide to destroy my switch and three turrets, get a bounty and try to get to the rest of the base, or you could leave to a different world.
---
Selfish I may be but turrets with a use I wan't! Complain all you want about my base your petty complaints about morality means nothing to me and with that, doesn't make me want to make me move it anymore then I did before! :-)
---
Spoiler alert. They're going to take an extra day and it's still going to have bugs.
---
My weapon of choice already got violated by nerfs. Hopefully no one else has to feel that pain.
---
LOL ...this is the perfect scenario. HAHAHAHA.. 
---
Yeah, that's childish, salty shit. in my experience... those guys want to PvP, but ONLY if they win.
---
Get a bounty, get shot... shrug and move on. You lost. 
---
Im male aged 23 but if you want someone whos quiet, helpful, poses for screenshots and stands around decorating camps all day.. id gladly join. I've got about 900 hours played now and the only way for me to have some fun is to meet new players. 
---
All my characters are female. I wear the civil war era outfit, the manta man costume and the witch costume on my 3 characters. Each one wears the black prospectors hat. Its the best hat in game no question. 
---
this sounds fun!
---
What weapon? 
---
The fact that you can see and know other users account username is a huge security risk. Even if you add a friend, it should not reveal account user name. Their needs to be a account user alias in additon to the suggestion here to show character name.
---
Yep - I end up picking the bag back up because I‚Äôve made low level weapons using my resources.    Can‚Äôt chance that the bag won‚Äôt be found by another player.   
---
√íw√ì
---
OMG! I completely forgot about that place!
---
Tse combat shotty
---
What do you mean by let them mutate?
---
Damn you got a lot of responses. Okay Ima join too and just hang out until I am accepted or Shot in the head and left for dead.  HAHAHA
---
Roses are red, violets are blue, they paid off their student loans, selling ebay duped weapons to you.
---
I'd like some Legendary Perk cards maybe from the new Vault raids coming.  That could be cool.
---
i didnt mind the duping as it didnt affect me, until i realized the horrible server instability was due to the duped items messing up the servers database calls
---
and once they did the great purge, i havent had a server disconnect yet!
---
i still get actual game crashes to dashboard alot though, but no recent server disconnects
---
and minecraft
---
Yeah that was a big slap on many players  üòû
---
and then what?
---
I used to do that, just build and relax. But having a chaotic, rocket throwing house is something I surprising find relaxing, but I have to admit, sometimes, not being attacked while you craft is nice sometimes! UwU
---
to be able to message each other
---
I'm definitely thinking about it because that combination of modifiers is impossible on any weapon in-game right now. :)
---
Seriously my goodness
---
Which is also a huge security flaw..
---
Really?! If you could post a picture of that I would appreciate it. Can't find it online. 
---
Before I started I did a search to see if it had been done.
---
Everything else has been said already. Why beat a dead horse when we can continue thinking outside the box?
---
We all wanted this before the game launched and now if they are gonna add it they need to let us change
---
I won‚Äôt be surprised, however IF they can at least reduce the bugs/flaws that will be great. So here‚Äôs hoping. 
---
I want something that attracts them
---
Indeed! I can't wait to have PvP changed. I like the fighting, but some players get way to toxic.
---
Now, time to scrounge Cranberry bog!
---
Rad storms converting plants to nuked versions is a brilliant idea.
---
My life entirely. The number of times low level characters have run from gifts is about 2x the amount of times they accepted.
---
If I saw a character named Preston Garvey, I would definitely kill him, multiple times, damn the bounty.
---
I'll check it out, seem like an interesting base, bees and mutants. Thanks!
---
Some people are not comfortable with using voice chat. What Fallout 76 really lacks is a text chat.
---
You do know that people still dupe?
---
Harley Quinn is the prime example of fiction writers turning psycho-sociopathic behaviors in young women into something ‚Äúsexy‚Äù. Some people are not ok with it.
---
You...you know that some people care about real-life things and not just fiction, right?

1.8 lbs? Bear Arms =)

You must be a low level with no good legendary weapons if you have an explosive 2 shot weapon the only cheats that could possibly give a person an edge on you is aimbot and god mode never encountered this ever. Plenty of dupers and glitchers witch are also on console since its all done ingame with no 3rd party software. The game is trivial and there is little to no consequence to death. Oh no you lose some junk and caps big whoop. Idiotic reasons to not include PC in cross play. Any reasonable gamer would want cross play on as much platforms as possible. 
---
Is that really necessary?
---
LITERALLY EVERYWHERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
lol
---
That'll do it!
---
That's funny AF but I don't think the OP is Salty They're just having some fun.
---
They could show a family name that links characters on an account and display a character specific name above that.  Black Desert Online does that.
---
Seems like a waste of the limited space we're given when meat is easily gathered.
---
That being said, I don't think this is a terrible idea. So long as it doesn't eat up too much of the budget, it would be great to be able to keep livestock. Possibly even getting cream from brahmin? There's serious potential.
---
You sir, are a cretin ballsack. I don't normally stupe to this sort of banter but you my boy have received a downvote.

It's not a freaking Monty Haul campaign.  Earn them.
---
RIP to all the plastic I've wasted doing this...
---
I disagree. If you farm whitesprings you honestly get too much loot. 
---
Not rare at all
---
It would give the natural resistance perks a meaning. I loved the mechanics in Skyrim survival mode
---
what the fuck
---
Oh, I know nothing, no worries there :-)
---
Although I thought someone would be taking ‚Äúcoding it roughly‚Äù as some sort of implied BDSM, still pretty cool to have someone keeping an eye on the numbers ;-)

I miss the "play dead" emote from ESO. Whenever people give me finger guns I should have the ability to play opossum and drop to the groun.
---
Agreed
---
There's a pre built building at whitesprings by the second entrance to the waste dump site along the fence. Its entirely in a build zone sk you can place your camp there. Description: when you first approach there's a small room that leads to the main room that contains a few supplies such as abaxo cleaner, a broom and some oil containers, it's a small room that leads to the main room and not a lot can fit in there. In the main room there's a two desks, a few chairs and a   drawer, not much large furniture can fit in here. Behind the large desk there's a wall safe. Beyond that at the edge of the room theres a small bathroom with a sink with a few stimpacks inside, a toilet, and I think a bathtub inside, its lit by a patch of glowing fungus. On the backside of this building theres a stairwell that leads to a rooftop lounge with a few beach chairs  and an overhead umbrella. This building isn't the best place for camping as theres limited space and often sits at the edge of the nuke blast zone.
---
lol, teabagging for 20 minutes! You really do have to wonder what goes through their head :-)
---
Hey man, we have plenty of loot over here at The Divison 2! Come check it out
---
Sorry, I should have been more specific. I *definitely* favor one option over the other. :)
---
Be cool if we got a power armour suit where you use nuclear waste to power it, would coincide with nuclear winter 
---
Yes. Yes it is.
---
Paddywop918 lvl282 almost always on. I have a mic and depending on your lvl got lvl 25 excavator with calibrated shocks and motion assist
---
Lmao it's up to her if she wants to respond. The ping just makes her aware of the thread 
---
I think you'd still have to repair them to get them going first. Just give an option to have on/off switch for safety. On - every workshop in the area gets free power to use. Off - melt down, resulting in a radiation zone encircling the power plant
---
I found a double ammo explosive gauss a couple weeks ago. Sort of disappointing since my AA lever action kills slightly faster, weighs less and reloads much quicker.
---
I log in to find broken concrete defences and super mutant meat piles almost everyday when it‚Äôs not scorched or protections, I put my red shower on my roof for fear of destruction but even up there it was being fired upon as if it was the most offending item to the super mutants so in the end I had to just keep it in storage, use it then put it back into storage, it‚Äôs a pain but rad showers seem to be like honey to bears when it comes to enemy fire. I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm not on your platform but hopefully someone in the community can help you out with the repairs
---
To the players who didn‚Äôt play as he should,
---
You duped a fair bit, then ended up in the shit,
---
I hope you get banned for good. 
---
I think you hurt the dupers feelz 
---
It can be a bit high. I was looking for a jetpack mod for my X01 and a player offered one for 1,500 caps so I passed on it. Ended up getting lucky in the Enclave bunker and got it for 500. It all depends on how bad you want something. 
---
I was shocking myself
---
I‚Äôve killed maybe dozens of three star legendaries and got only one three star drop by myself. Hell sometimes even when I kill level 68‚Äôs they don‚Äôt even drop level 45-50 gear. Feels bad man 
---
I heard somewhere this is true - because they said that if you make a new alt and name it the same thing as an older one, it will replace the older one?
---
I was shocked myself lol
---
damn bro, that's nice.  AA is king among ranged weapons, especially after the explosive and two shot nerfs.
---
YES! I had this same question and was contemplating on making a post about it too.
---
I expected to have my characters name used and not my Bethesda account name.
---
For general pve yeah, it's still ts for high health. I carry a load of guns so the queen has aa gatlin, ts gatlin. tse handmade and ts handmade for sneak build. Instigating Combat knife for farming. The market it's all about bloodied. Even with a small amount of rads you can add a extra 5 special with unyielding sets. Hardcore can do 10-15. I got lazy anymore use chems and food, drunk to boost, have so little hp to work with in my current build.
---
My friend is bloodied and he still dies on occasion at the queen because of the poison, but he gets good stuff. I can't really die, emergency protocols, born survivor, blocker and have supers binded to mouse. Don't even bother to jump out the armor anymore, mainly do queens for the xp and we always roll her now days doesn't matter who's there. She still has that glitch where she'll fly away if disabled in the air too long. Sometimes you have a clueless there with +50 limb damage who won't quit shooting her in the air and she will get stuck, won't land. I usually quit shooting if I see that and then she flies away off the map. The grenade, fatman guys are a kind of clueless too as she'll run away from the bunker if not disabled. Either way if she stays, we can take her down pretty quick, the aa is definitely better there. She's really the only mob that has the dr for aa, stabilized, endangerol to really shine. Even regular scorchbeasts die pretty quick to a ts.

Hi Gary and Gary, I'm Gary! 
---
The maze was solve-able but once the deathclaw started chasing them most people gave up trying to solve it
---
This I haven't tried... And would be too scared to honestly lol
---
Thats what I thought was gonna happen, and my friend thought that's what happened. For so long he thought I put my character name to my PSN. 
---
No wonder we can't find Grahm, the deathclaw ate him 
---
I had a stranger walk up to me in public and asked if he could buy the socks I was wearing. I asked him what the fuck was wrong with him, and walked away.
---
I‚Äôve experienced a lot of weird shit from guys since then, now that I‚Äôm old. Nothing surprises me anymore.
---
same here
---
The same thing that stops any sane implementation: when you block a player, it blocks their account without you needing to know their account name.
---
It would be harder to report griefers and cheaters.
---
Except top tier weapons no one is going to sell for caps, and if you spend real money on any in game item you are an absolute twat.
---
All work and no play, makes your deathbed regrets never actually living. We work to live and if we only live to work we don't only miss life but also it is incredibly bad for your health. 
---
Complaint from day 1
---
The devs were "forced" to come out with the game because management said it had to be out by the release date. You don't think the devs knew how bad the release would be. They knew it wasn't ready. And then they got to watch people shit on them as if they were the issue, when they really did do everything they could to put out a product in the time they had. Feel free to shit on the executives and board members that forced their hands on the matter, but not the people working hard to make the games.
---
And as for the dlc, the reason that they have the luxury to delay it a day or so is that unlike the release date, it's free content, so the higher ups don't really care if it comes out on the exact day or not. So the devs can do what they need to to iron out some issues. We will see what state the new content is in when it's relaxed tomorrow, but them delaying it should be seen as A GOOD thing. Not bad. It shows that the dev team has more say in when it's right to release something versus the higher ups that don't have a clue of whether or not the product is actually ready.
---
U know why i got more damage with tse guns with unyeilding armor at low health?
---
When I drop stuff for another player I use my mining helmet and shine the light on the bag like a spotlight. 
---
Suggestion above stated character name with screen name underneath or beside it in ()
---
I‚Äôm sure in reality it‚Äôs to curb griefers and scammers. 
---
Personally I've liked both.  Go into 76 knowing it has some issues.  I play it as a fun sandbox game with some cool stuff.  I played fo4 alot like this too.  I have heard the price has droped so I'd say go for it.
---
Really so that's what the observery was for, I didnt get a chance to explore it through fully but notice a few weather monitoring terminals. Is there a quest associated with this place?
---
25k caps if you want to be good at PvP.
---
That's pretty clever, I like it.
---
Granted I can see them not wanting that to happen at Charleston .
---
# We basically ALL wanted this from the start - a ridiculous case of a game company so blatantly ignoring the wishes of the vast majority of it's users...
---
What do you do?
---
About 40 queen kills with two serum recipe drops. Both the same....
---
So you have no way to know if you're going to go Wanted status until after you unlock it?
---
Great change, Bethesda. Really making the community feel loved.
---
I just put it up the hill a bit, near the hay stacks. Haven‚Äôt had anyone complain since I moved it from on the pond. 
---
It's pretty damn identical, so probably?  Do you have any friends to play with, cause that tips it from probably to hell yeah you'll enjoy it.
---
How about we just get a 3 star legendary weapon every 10 levels while we're at it.
---
Very common
---
Nobody would have sold their bloodied handmade if they couldn't have duped themselves an extra one.
---
It's not a god rolled weapon, if your dps is lower than your enemies dmg r then what's the point of having a bloodied weapon and if your dmg r is especially low you'll be one shotted easily. Most one star legendaries are specific to build and most 3 star legendaries you can buy at a vendor for a lil over 400 caps. It's about how much a consumer is willing to pay not how much you're willing to charge. The legendary stats act like a commodity, not the weapon or piece of armor itself.
---
Just throwing out an idea, what if the DR/ER percentage stats has been converted to hard stats instead? 
---
Like 15% has become a hard stat +15 or something.. 
---
I have had that since launch, is related to high ping. Only way to fix is closing the game and relogging. And praying that your ping stay low (good luck on high traffic hours)
---
I agree. I want each of my characters to be role played differently. I want to be a raider on a new character, but I don't want to get a bad reputation on my other characters. Each one will be played in a different way. I have decided against being a raider solely on the fact that I don't want people to come witch hunt me because they think I'm a griefer.
---
I hope they do implement something like that because it would add another layer to the role playing aspect and it would help provide security and privacy to those that wish to role play. 
---
And you can't even get your stuff back, since only junk drops on death. Stupidest fucking change.
---
You must be fun at parties!
---
FWIW I‚Äôd suggest that by writing off an actual, real-life woman solely because they like a fictional character whom you happen to dislike, you‚Äôre indicating that it is you who cares more about fiction than real-life things ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Honk is my "cuss werd" üòâ
---
Because you, and three other people picked stupid names, don't give 99% of the users what they want?  
---
Brilliant.  /s
---
I think they nerfed the legendary spawn rate ahead of the legendary vendor release to limit hoarding and mass trading. I noticed legendary spawns are almost non existent now even when I nuke Whitesprings
---
For what it's worth:
---
Take your time. Don't rush. The "content" of this game is in the terminals and holotapes. The stories are good. The voice acting is good and in some cases great (definitely a step up from Fallout 4 in many cases, but they had to make up for the lack of real NPCs). 
---
Your journey through the main quests / side quests will be filled with sad, depressing stories of people that didn't make it. It sounds weird to say this, but it's great. The lore of 76 is much darker than Fallout 4. The problem is, a lot of people skipped through it and didn't take the time to enjoy it like they would have if it were a single player game. I did this too on my first run. I just wanted to rush to end game and become powerful. 
---
I think it's this dual nature that throws a lot of people off. On the one hand, you want to play as efficiently as possible so you don't get "left behind". You want to get to end game and start farming for your uber 3 star legendary weapons and armor. The problem is, most people burn out doing this. I leveled a new character recently, and I made sure to explore every location, do every quest, find every story. I enjoyed that leveling process so much more. Sure, there are dull points (I wasn't a huge fan of the raider quests - Rose has amazing voice acting - probably my favorite in the game, and that's all that saved it), but for the most part, following in the foot steps of those who have gone before you (and failed) is really interesting, and some of the side quests like the whole Mistress of Mysteries chain are absolutely awesome. Free States, Enclave, and Brotherhood chains are also fantastic. 
---
The irony is that, although this is very heavily marketed as a multi player game, I think it's far better to play solo while leveling up and exploring the map. Playing solo I was able to really experience the stories without distraction, and I had a blast learning all the lore.
---
The one downfall, as already mentioned, is that there is no player choice, but that should change soon.
---
Once you get to end game, it's all about legendary grinding / learning plans and recipes to make more powerful gear. The legendary vendor update coming soon (will allow you to selll / buy legendaries for more chances to get good stuff) will help a lot with that.
---
I'm pretty certain you have to find this plan in the wild. I'm told it's associated with a random encounter near the overseer's camp.
---
Oh shit!
---
The sad reality is that the only fun part of the game is grinding for legendaries.
---
I feel bad for people who are grinding for caps just to buy all of the best weapons and realize that there isn't anything to do with those weapons other than to use them to grind for more legendaries.
---
I‚Äôm actually a fan of original Harley Quinn from way back when, not that anyone should have to explain themselves as to why they have a certain gamer tag. There was also no need to make that comment about wanting to join until she saw my user name. She doesn‚Äôt like my user name then just keep scrolling, no need to be rude about it
---
Very much agreed. HUGE missed opportunity here. 
---
"Pick your character name"  
---
OK...  picks name... plays game...  
---
# WTF Bethesda, you trolling us?!?
---
My buddy named his character ‚Äú(my irl name) hits girls‚Äù so I‚Äôm not 100% for this like other people.
---
Hmmmm Preston Garvey with a turret platform outside the clubhouse at WS? Yup, that'd do it! üëç
---
Except sometimes the ones you summon are locked. Also random supply drops from events are locked. So really you have no way to tell if you're going to get Wanted status for looting a locked supply drop, which is why I'm not bothering with supply drops anymore and why nobody else should.
---
It baffles me that people legitimately think that this was an oversight in Bethesda‚Äôs part. It‚Äôs like no, we are supposed to fight over loot drops just like many other games. The division for example has loot drops that drop into the dark zone. An alert is given to everyone in the area and the first player to make it there gets the drop. If he isn‚Äôt killed by enemies and other players first 
---
Lol "do cocaine about it"
---
They are the ivory grip of grenade plans. 
---
If neither of the other two generous souls can help, hit me up... ign Dethedrus. I can do all the mods for handmade and marine set (except dense cheat) as well as make the base items.
---
Yea but what's the difference between raiding and griefing and role-playing? Where is the line? 
---
Can't comment on your other post. I'll take the BOS legs 
---
Please be tomorrow it‚Äôs pretty annoying 
---
Didn't know that! And yeah,  you can dilute a regular stim, why not a super? Or just make those things able to use all 3 types. 
---
Holy crap, that sounds amazing. I didn't realize there was a legendary effect for DR while reloading.
---
With this being the case currently, how come we can't modify or edit our character name? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Me and my 1,700 caps per day worth of civil war top hats say no, the economy is just fine -lol.
---
I like having a bit of context to comments like yours. Do what you have to do 
---
You mean like, how IRL if there were two guys both named Bob, that would suck so hard, we'd have to restart the Universe?  
---
OMG, it's so awful, there are two Bobs now and I don't know what to do!  
---
\*runs away screaming\*
---
Seriously.  My username is a bunch of numbers, whereas my IGN is Mad Matchy.  Why come up with a cool-ass name if no one can see it?
---
I was stealthing a bounty when his Mysterious Stranger appeared. Hey could not find me.
---
Ripped off due to inflation. 
---
Yes please. 
---
You mean bloodied? You need adrenal reaction to optimize that build.
---
Happy Cake Day
---
Damn girl!
---
Because some people might have problems finding out who‚Äôs been destroying their shit and following them server to server
---
I got adrenal reaction, so thats why my tse weps are doing more damage? Cause they should be bloodied to do more damage ü§î
---
^this^
---
If you have low damage resist, you‚Äôre doing blooded wrong lol. Who‚Äôs gonna sell a god roll 3* to a vendor? Any 3* that are in a vendor are the not so desirable rolls I mentioned earlier that sell for less than 1k. 
---
I think the term god roll is going over your head a bit too. The prefix doesn‚Äôt determine if it‚Äôs god roll. You have to have all 3 desirable perks, not just bloodied with 2 perks that no one wants. Bloodied doesn‚Äôt make it god roll, but there are god roll bloodied weapons. 
---
The legendary perks are what‚Äôs wanted for end game optimized builds. Can you play end game with non legendaries? Sure but why would you when you can effectively triple your dps using legendary weapons?
---
Build and try a few of the actual grenades to see why the plans are pretty much worthless.
---
I would love for people to understand that Dr. Bojangles is the one trying to give them free stuff and stims, not xxX_LiquidDinner_Xxx
---
You can't send a Nuke to that area, I believe. The forest is not nukable if I'm remembering. 
---
I'd like it to display the character name on the map and in game, but have my gamertag show under the details. I don't care if everyone is named Bob in the map, I don't think they need to restrict and say, sorry... HULK is already taken. My point is, its just a setting and its not like in the really world you can only have one person named John Smith. We are only talking about seeing on a map and when you see them in game. Plus it might help with things like Stream Sniping as well.
---
Upvote 
---
I think the traveling merchant is in fact in the belly of the DeathClaw...
---
DeathClaws get hungry, eat a vendor, but the vendor was high in sodium so... DeathClaw heart attack!
---
\^fore!
---
Okay thanks
---
I know a couple people who use containers to stash stuff when they‚Äôre online when their stash is full. 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say anyone who locks their camp is an asshole, it‚Äôs their right as it‚Äôs their camp. It should be viewed as a privelage if someone allows you to use their camp, not an expectation 
---
Wait, everyone else isn't already festooning their quarters with cat posters?
---
What would Mr Pebbles think?!?!
---
I feel like a lot of people would take their Fo4 agression out on you
---
*Checks list*
---
It's /yiff... again.
---
Sounds like my least favorite part of the Witcher 3
---
i miss cap-mines... they were always very powerful and fun to pickup the pieces
---
It's cool.  I wasted all my fuel one time doing it for some new players after I gave them skull masks.
---
To clarify, I wasn‚Äôt suggesting there -are- errors, I was asking if anything is being done about that potential.  For instance, the ‚Äúhappy Halloween picnic‚Äù random encounter would possibly be seen by someone as an unmarked location because of how detailed it is, but it‚Äôs a random encounter and if you server hopped and went back to the same location it would be gone.  (Outside of the unlikely event you got the same random encounter in the same area)
---
The second part of what I mentioned is a personal request to ask if the unmarked locations that are also spawn points for random encounters could be somehow color coded to reflect this fact at some point, for parties interested in checking out random encounters. The example I gave was the crashed vertibird in the northeast corner of the map (the one marked #23) IS a static unmarked location, but it also spawns random encounters, (unique enemy spawns, the warden out for your arrest, tamable creatures, the two mr handys stuck in a feedback loop, etc.) And I can confirm this as I‚Äôve visited there dozens of times to help people find creatures to tame or replace my own creature when they get killed, and in the process you see all the other random encounters.    I can‚Äôt confirm that other unmarked locations are also random encounter spawns/ have them nearby but if they do, it would be great to find out.
---
Again, either way, good work.
---
My favorite part about Fallout 4 was the building. Hording materials and building up my base in new fancy ways along with settler management was very fun to me, particularly when layered on top of actual Fallout game play. Saying that, there are several things I love about Fallout 4 that I see in Fallout 76 and the building is part of it. I haven't really had the chance to play with other people, which I think would be more fun.
---
he could tell just from the sound of them firing? dang
---
I'll have to check that out. So your tse is doing more at low health with unyielding set? That's strange, I'll check the numbers later and see what's up. I can't think of any perks off the top of my head that would boost damage like that, but it could be.
---
Yep, that and coffeepots. GODDAMM COFFEPOTS HAVE PLASTIC. ^(those damn things are everywhere.)
---
Can't you click on a person in the World an do Invite and View Profile? That would show gamertag, other than that we can all be named BOB!
---
This one gets me almost daily, wasted so much plastic because of this bug
---
I appreciate your appreciation.
---
You look at this in terms of the artificial cap on caps. However, Bethesda themselves set a rough estimate for rarity vs cap cost. You can earn over a 1000 caps a day selling junk. No super rare weapon should be sold for less than a days gaming. Additionally, Bethesda sets the standard by making very rare plans cost 20k+ caps. Thus, it makes sense that we would think in terms of that. With all that said, the cap cap is actually keeping prices down, as any trade beyond the cap requires and intermediary or extreme trust in the person you are trading with.
---
I'd say this might not be the game for you. 
---
Didn‚Äôt think of that.   Cool idea. 
---
my alt is level 40
---
Happened to me three times this weekend while trying to eat Grilled Radstag.  Was wearing my Excavator power armor each time.
---
But he‚Äôs not even a synth
---
Gives a whole new meaning to charred ghoul.....
---
I don't know if I should be disgusted or impressed.
---
I see people running it solo all the time. 
---
"One 3* Legendary super mutant overlord can drop many treasures when one seeks the help of others"

---
My endgame is collect tech data, receive 10th field scribe outfit, try and spawn civil war reenactor, spawn the random traveling vendor bot, check the asylum and Appalachian Antiques for apparel. When that gets old, look at the vendors for cast off items. If AWOL Armaments pops up, hit it. Rinse and repeat. 
---
Awesome! I will see you in game. We can swap my 30 minutes of game time collecting junk and selling it for caps for your endless hours farming legendary mobs for just the right weapon.
---
I hope your camp is a rock-ridge-style-cut-out of the Concord museum block where all you do is stand on the balcony.
---
Yup, my pump was doing 434 or some with just 2 shotgun full carts
---
Just go there.  There's only a few weak mutants,  not a big deal...(laughs evilly)
---
The 25K cap limit and 1400 daily cap vendor limit are artificial restraints to attempt to keep the value of Caps "high" but in reality Caps are not worth much, and are just there currently in player to player trading to be a placeholder for real trading.
---
If players could easily and securely trade Items for Items in a secure, confirmed, trade window / box system, Caps would be abandoned all together when it comes to player trading, because at that point they'd really serve no purpose.
---
This.    Encountered a Level 25 sniper last night with tricked out gear...they didn‚Äôt need a gift.   
---
Well there is a perk you can get where you can revive a party member with a bottle of alcohol ....
---
I'll take a Synth any day over Garvey.
---
Boredom in this game indicates a serious lack of imagination to me.
---
Which is basically about the same as my explosive shotgun with all perks maxed out.  That‚Äôs an absolute joke.  
---
I think the idea is that if you're armorless, players realize there's no trick.
---
Thats funny as heck, this is true nerd life. Reminds me of waiting in line up at Gamestop for a few of those midnight releases back in the day, this is when the real gamers come out of the woodwork. 
---
Then Danzig will be Woah-ing across the Wasteland. 
---
Lol
---
Interesting! Did you build some kind of camp in his path? Love to see it
---
That makes sense. 76 is running much better now and I still play it. Fallout 4 just runs a lot deeper as an experience in my opinion. 
---
1st one is priceless and you should keep it. The next 50 are worth roughly 4 caps a piece.
---
ALLLLL of this! I would pay real money for it!
---
I am level 180+ I am tired of seeing a crowned level 60-91 Glowing / Scorched Anything. I need Legendary MOBs that give me a challenge. I need them to be worth my time. Not a YOLO hope you worth my time. More times than none it is a YOLO hope you worth my time. 
---
Trying to PvP them probably.  People are ever so sensitive about it.
---
Having your camp there will stop the vendor (and any other event) from spawning, so you may get your camp destroyed. Technically the vendor does spawn in other areas but the most common one documented is the Charleston station.
---
Mr.Fuzzy
---
Ftfy
---
It's a random encounter, you never see it alive.  It's just a dead deathclaw with that name.  Sometimes it is there, sometimes other things spawn like supply boxes, etc.
---
I want to say the other shop is the Laundromat... found some fairly rare stuff on the shelf there before if you hit it on a fresh server.
---
People have nuked Morganstown, that's in the forrest AFAIK.  You can't nuke near Vault 76 or the Overseers camp, but Billings Homestead is quite a way from there.
---
Killer hurricane that floods the map and drowns everyone that doesn't have aquaboy.
---
This made my day. Thank you for your team work on this. 
---
yup, I go to her shack look at every file and nothing. same with the others, no matter how often I talk with Chloe or Boomer the quests just never pop up. 
---
I don‚Äôt believe you can connect a doorway where you‚Äôre trying to put it, you would need to place it on the opposite side of that floor piece. 
---
My characters name is just NPC, I have another called Generic NPC as well 
---
I still get some friends list issues. Nowhere near as many sync issues since patch 5, but still some refresh issues. Have a friend that can't see their friend's list is a **huge** problem. Especially if they get disconnected if they're not on team with you.
---
It‚Äôs not worth many cap, but looks great with the raider hoods and a chainsaws!
---
I mean that is fair
---
No worries. I've posted before searching myself. Sometimes you just need to post before you forget!
---
Don‚Äôt know about that but whenever I come across dirty pillows, I chuckle because I am immature 
---
Serves me right for not paying attention. I wonder if anyone has put a spreadsheet together for this...
---
Faction titles.  BoS clearly easiest.  Raiders like 'Grunt', 'Eviscerator', 'Chief', 'Warlord'  So much faction stuff needs done :)
---
Oh adrenal then.
---
thanks guys..i guess i went there once really low level and just ran lol..heard its a pretty good legendary location
---
wouldnt be bullet sponges if they didnt nerf guns and almost refuse to buff others
---
You can solo it, but there is a high chance of being overrun at some point. The place isn't that large and so you can accidentally pull half the building. I have a stealth build and I died quite a few times learning how to take each room as I go. There is also a damn door that requires terminal use to open, so you can't sneak and sometimes agro the SMs. Plus the damn door closes behind you and can trap you if you get surrounded.
---
All that said. It is still a VERY nice place to grind XP, legendaries, steel, and plastic.
---
How many bullets does an enemy need to take befor it is considered a bullet sponge?  I can kill most enemies in one to three shots 
---
It's a random event that you can encounter, I've spawned it 5 or 6 times while searching for tameable creatures. He's always dead. I'm assuming it's a naming glitch or maybe it's meant to be an easter egg of some kind.
---
I placed turrets all the way around sanctuary i mean my defense rating on the settlement was over 900 i come back and Preston was like hey we had raiders come and steal our food. I was like looking at all of the turrets which were working fine. I think he was smuggling the food out of sanctuary to give to them or something.
---
Tesla is wonky- it crafts as a heavy wep but uses energy ammo and it just gave me the achievement the other day for killing robots with a laser rifle.
---
That's the biggest problem with the work around of having someone else form the team for you - it works once. I can't be doing that every time, and I don't want to text my friends every time I log on and ask them if they are on, too. They'd get a restraining order on me. 
---
I just want to log in and know if my friends are on and be able to invite them to a team. Possibly the most important MMO feature. 
---
I agree.
---
I was actually thinking that as I was typing this. I always cleared West Tek when my explosive shotgun wasn't a prayer shooter.
---
I would spec into that, but it would have to be designed in such a way that you couldn't just swap perk cards into it, it would have to be a real commitment (aka the new 50+ stuff they mentioned in ITV).
---
[Harold Smith](https://i.imgur.com/ONq03cI.jpg) approves of this idea.
---
Maybe take a buddy at 40, I solo it at 91 with no real problems, level 40 is the awkward mid ground between needing a team and being a one man army. 
---
Same!!!!!! Wtf???? Lol
---
Meanwhile the Grafton Mayor pops up even when you're in the surrounding areas... \*sigh\*
---
Nah he saw the steel cases 
---
How many bullets does it take before I say the hell with it and fast travel to the next spot?
---
My rifleman build is okay, and I never have trouble with west tek. I managed to get 3 pieces of mutant slayer armor from farming there, and it makes it a cakewalk.
---
And it's a delight. Seriously.
---
I have a furious plasma flamer and it's murder on just about everything.
---
If this new vendor spawns as infrequently for me as Graham does it won't be worth it.
---
250+ hours in the game and I've seen Graham exactly twice.
---
Hmmm... she is hot tho.
---
Yes? 
---
And everyone says there are no NPC's in this world. 
---
Not sure if Bethesda appreciates Adolf Hitler roaming the wasteland.
---
It's block for session. Meaning logging to another character will reset the session
---
I did it solo.... but not below level 40 
---
Must be the week for grognak 3 stars.  I got two of them and dropped them like a bad habit.   Too damn heavy and slow.  When I have an All Rise and my go to spiked fire axe (w/50% speed feature) and perks pushing it around 150dmg.  Plus it‚Äôs only about 4 pounds.  
---
This is still an issue?
---
All good points guys. 
---
Very cool man... love the piano room and the bar.
---
This is something other, bigger MMOs have had trouble with in the past. Look at games like Swtor, it ran for years without adding the level sync system, and while now it's a widely accepted feature that makes life so much better for everyone, it took a good deal of work, and coding to make it work. Games like Defiance have a similar system, but the problem comes when there is too big a difference of levels. While the system in Defiance is built for a game like 76, it has a few issues, the first being it averages the enemy levels at spawn. What this does is say, you have 4 lvl 10s, and a level 100, the 10s are gonna have issues with the spawns, and the 100 will breeze through them. At that point it's not exactly fun for either party. 
---
Usually, farming mats is best done from non-mob sources (there are exceptions).
---
If I remember correctly, I found that looking for light bulbs (uncommon), telephones (pretty common), Fuses, hot plates, lamps, and certain cans (tin?) worked pretty well.  Few server hops through Whitespring usually kept me in decent supply (inside and the building next to the back entrance).
---
Definitely tag copper in your junk menu to be sure to pick everything up.  *Try* not to tag too many things there, so you start learning what items have things you need, then you'll rely less on the tagging to recognize valuable junk.
---
Funny.....as I rifleman I just jump on the roof and leave if I don't see any legendaries.
---
Don't even get me started on going inside. After a few trips coming out with a good egg it's not even worth the load time to get in.
---
at least when destiny balanced weapons they did it separately it had a pvp damage and a pve damage it might have been easier for them bc pvp took place out of pve but were gonna head down the route of division balancing if this keeps up 
---
Crazy idea here. Make a new alt named Daniel then make another new alt also named Daniel to test it 
---
I mean if you can get it for free... 
---
A lot of times when that happens on load in you just change your weapon, reload it, then change back. Happens often when you enter new load zones as well.
---
True. I ground Whitespring for that transition and then added west tek once I hit 50ish. Super mutants are a little easier to take on once you have a build working for you. Until then ghouls low DR makes for an easier time.
---
&gt;it drops a 1 star item
---
A one star, low level item.
---
So frustrating.
---
yes please this
---
If you are below level 50, the really strong mutants (overlords, primus, warlords) won‚Äôt spawn, so it‚Äôs quite easy. I‚Äôd recommend entering through the back entrance, as that way you can clear out the mutants before entering the large open area.
---
If you were on ps4 I would have teamed up with you. Do you have pacifist mode on I have come across a bunch of new players that had it off and would shoot at mobs and hit other players and in return those players would engage in pvp.
---
Add me, IGN skinnyhb
---
Did someone get to you already? I can make you one right now. 
---
Are you? What does your divers licence photo look like?
---
Mine froze on a endurance bobblehead, grilled radroach, and nuka cola. 
---
I love Moscow Mules. 
---
Is antinickel your GT?
---
It's an excellent place for that. Plus you will never need steel again once you add it into your game. So many assault and laser rifles.
---
If you felt that way about 4, I think you'll like 76 more.  The main quest story in 4 was super meh, I agree.  FO76 leans heavily on the locations and text snippets to create an environmental narrative, rather than smack you over the head with a story.  And it does a \*really\* good job of it, since it doesn't have many voiced NPCs to talk at you like 4 did.
---
It's an interesting idea. Two concerns: 
---
1. From a **gameplay** perspective I think it'll be tough to get the rewards right. If it's too easy and rewarding, players wouldn't solve the codes and slog through the silos. If it's not rewarding, it won't be used anyways. 
---
2. From a **story** perspective, why? Why would anyone be nihilistic enough to destroy our precious remaining infrastructure in order to create a nightmarish landscape? Nuke drops on the fissures at least present a fig-leaf rationale of the ends justifying the means. Is there a good explanation that I've missed? 
---
well, i will travel halfway across the world just to tell you a settlement needs help, even though I passed the same settlement as i was walking to tell you about that settlement needing help.  But then after i tell you about it, I just turn around and walk back to my base.
---
The "try another world" feature rarely works for me. I've also noticed that the feature that tells you whether your camp can be placed also gives false positives when there isn't a camp there. I will get this message if there are players in the area and 95% of the time I can place my C.A.M.P. object in the exact same place no problem.
---
Some people wanna watch the world burn and not set a flame in your heart
---
Well from all my times hopping to that location, if a CAMP is in the vicinity (so by the pond, next to it, in the general area), it seems to prevent any of the random events occurring in that area, including the rare vendor bot. Most people who hop there to find a the bot and don't see anything spawn and then see a house by the area... well let's just say it gets levelled to the ground..
---
You definitely won't get banned at all! But maybe you'll get a bit of hate from others who hop servers for the bot. Maybe the house further up the track could be good? Since most people spawn up the hill when they Fast travel to the station, so having it slightly higher up may do the trick.
---
Not worth much but look pretty cool with the right hat. My fav is the patched suit with trilby hat
---
You dupe and cheat
---
A worst player I'll never meet
---
You made the servers crash
---
Bethesda banned your ass
---
You post on reddit
---
Hoping we'll forget it
---
No one needs ya
---
Bye Felicia
---
or has only one person with access / knowledge about the servers
---
I do to and they f-ed you up if you walked onto one
---
Quick thoughts. Do they censor character names? If the only person to view it, Bethesda doesn't have to have a profanity filter for it.
---
Stash your junk and go for it. I solo it all the time for toxic goo
---
Its easy to get by, just censor or redirect players into choosing a different name if they choose something innapropriate. it isnt hard to implement a name report system or a censoring system.
---
Farmed hundreds maybe even a thousand legendaries (atleast 80% were just one star sell fodder) by now but still haven‚Äôt ever found my own tse weapon so I agree.
---
I've felt like this should have been a basic implementation from the beginning. It inherently fosters a sense of roleplay, furthering immersion, group cohesion and replay value. 
---
I wouldn't say gamertags hurt gameplay, but they certainly don't add any value. 
---
Im on xbox right now, we can team if you want

GT: Iniquitous G
---
If an item is being sold for over 10k caps, it‚Äôs not worth it and you are being ripped off. If you go to the fallout 76 trade subreddit, god roll items go for 4-10k caps.
---
Do you have a magic sword named "Irving"? 
---
Blessed are his noodly appendages. 
---
What happened in Witcher 3?
---
Ah. The shuttle differences between Sheppard Shepherd. One's fervently a girl...
---
It may have been a misunderstanding... I had a team of 4 people keep attacking me and my base for what seemed like no reason so I messaged them and they told me I was in Watoga and stole a junk bag that dropped when some robots killed them. I was in Watoga running through to get the vendor map marker and then traveled out, didn't have anything to do with them at all... they were convinced though, followed me around, even server hopped to harass me. I can't imagine what other reason he'd have other than an imaginary grudge.
---
Remember back in wow when you expect these astronomical odds for a cosmetic legendary mount to show off to all your nerd friends? THAT is what extremely rare loot looks like. Something that die-hards can fill their time with to show they are true nerds. 
---
Filthy casual should not have to go through the same grind just to get a decent end game weapon for their build. It's just a deterrent.
---
Yeah this was my first char‚Äôs look
---
Dark Souls will do that to you. 
---
My suggestion is go back to vault 76 and keep in the forest for a bit then move over to the toxic valley and so on. Staying in those areas for a bit will help a lot.  Take it slow and don't rush off too fast. Find a few more weapons and mods to upgrade them. Find better armor and mod them. 
---
I searched your GT on XB but didn't come up with your name. Are there spaces or some other difference?
---
$39 on Amazon, though last I checked, the digital download was still $60, but the physical copy was $40...and the 'physical copy' was a cheap case with a slip of paper for...a digital download.
---
Not quite half off, but still saves you some cash.
---
This is what I am hoping and betting on! I have been buying every vendored 1 star I have seen since the announcement was made. If it works I am gonna be SOOOOO set. If it doesn't? all I lost was some caps lol
---
I'm antisocial enough that I didn't care that I didn't have a mic when I first started playing.  First time I teamed with an IRL friend, that lack of a mic became a royal PITA.
---
So I got one.  And I'm liking it in many situations, from trying to get a noobs attention to calling an out of sight team member for help if I need it to reporting what I found where during a building search...
---
  If the game engine actually paused action when a text chat screen was up,  I might be ok with it, although I would likely not use it much.    
---
  As it is, I'm slow enough making selections on the pipboy, etc.  Trying to text "Oh @#$@, being attacked by a L50 wendigo, little help?" on the PS4 controller and defend against the attack at the same time?  
---
Nah, gimme a mic.
---
Because that would make sense?
---
has anyone ever came back to you? appoint them as the general of the minutemen then follow them around and tell them they suck for stealing everything.
---
Cool I'll check it out, I'd love to use my chainsaw 
---
Looks delicious I prefer my ghoul well done. 
---
I have a western outfit with chaps if yu are still looking?
---
Hi Gary, Gary, and Gary.  Gary here, anyone seen my friend Jerry, dude isn‚Äôt right in the head.
---
I agree with OP.  I apparently missed the memo where the end game is actually the person who has the most caps is the winner.
---
Charging Up to 25k for a single piece of armor is insane. Telling players they have to max out multiple characters caps capacity to buy multiple pieces of armor is pants on head crazy.
---
There is not enough PVP in this game to make absolute min maxing neccessary. 
---
Also, there is no economy. This is a digital game with no true marketplace.  If we had an auction house, then we might start to build an economy. Right now we have players dictating the "economy."  That's not how that works folks.
---
Once I get all of my serums recipies, I will be selling them for less that 100 caps apiece.  Let's see how many I sell vs the guy selling them for 300-1000.
---
That depends on if it is assured that it will be the same number of stars that you get back as you put in. If the dozens of 1 stars that I got for less than 100 caps each has a chance to get a god tier? I will make that gamble
---
Repeat after me:
---
**Fighting over workshops is not griefing.**
---
**Workshops are the designated place for pvp.**
---
It doesn't matter if it's a level 1 vs. a level 1,000. Workshops are meant as a place that provide resources but leave you open to PvP. That level 8 opted into pvp. This is NOT griefing.
---
There are SO MANY unclaimed workshops on so many servers. If the one you want isn't available and you don't want to fight - leave and join a new game. That's probably what the level 8 did, which is smart.
---
It also doesn't sound like you collected a bounty, but rather, just killed him in normal pvp over the workshop (you get caps = to his level on kill when you kill him during a workshop battle). 
---
And considering you were able to one shot him, he was definitely a pve player trying to get resources, and was willing to participate in pvp to get them (I do the same thing). 
---
I get really tired of people assuming that any time pvp happens, it's griefing. Griefing would be if the level 105 went to that guys camp and destroyed it for no reason.
---
Easy: Word filter of all known racial slurs and number replacements for that stuff (like spelling it j3w for example), let everything else go because every curse word is already in the game. If I want to make my character's name Cunt that should be fine, if I want to make it the N word, not OK. 
---
I recently started a new character. About to hit level 20. The only place I find high level enemies is white springs where theres a never ending supply of level 60+ ghouls running around since everyone seems to hang out there. Just focus on your main and misc quests while you get a handle on what's going on. Pick up and scrap whatever junk you can find and only keep one or two weapons on you that you like. Make sure you're crafting as high level armor as possible since it goes up every 5. Dont attached to any one item in particular as you'll most likely find something better or become over leveled for your  load out.
---
Also, dont be afraid of high level players. Especially at station shops. Even if you're not using a mic, almost everyone I've encountered is more than happy to drop stimpacks, weapons, and most importantly duplicate plans.
---
Just try and have fun. Dont get bogged down. If you're not having a good session just take a break.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm not reading all of that. 
---
It's so sad the youtube reviews when the game launched. Some of those guys were playing on toasters too. There's some truth to the bugs but nowhere near what was posted. I remember playing on launch and thinking, wth they talking about. Nice thing is the golf course actually had feral golfers on it.
---
dunno, seemed pretty handy for that guy who got stalked by a whole crew of morons hurling homophobic slurs at him
---
not very. i drop them in the watoga station suitcase all the time
---
o shit waddup
---
In all seriousness, I wish they adopted this policy before release. Would rather had a last minute 3 month delay than the near-DOA game that we got. Still, it is _very_ good to see that they are learning their lesson that delays are better than rushed messes.
---
I'm trying to do quests most of the time, but usually run into those enemies whilst doing quests due to an event that a high level is participating in. I'll keep grinding
---
That is how it usually goes. Even big name companies like Cisco don't give you patch notes until the patch is released.
---
I'd have to change the name of the character I made that's literally named "handmade mule" that I made specifically to get the plans for the handmade rifle for my main account, lol
---
That's Carl he's just passed out on wasteland hooch.
---
 Unfortunately the same as everyone else‚Äôs. Colandergate is still a sore subject lol.
---
I want pictures or posters you can build in camps/workshops where you can choose from your photo gallery for what each one shows. 
---
Also a movie or slide projector that would cycle through your photo gallery. Maybe include a terminal control option that would let you decide how long each picture is shown as well as an option to toggle on/off for each picture to customize which one are included in your slide show. 
---
Sorry I dont support circle jerk thread like you
---
He should have just blocked them.  Instead he made a huge deal out of it and tried to ruin their lives.  
---
I like the rad storm idea converting plants to nuked flora for a short time. Since we're able to see distant weather systems it would be something that many players can possibly notice and rush to. Since rad storms seem to be very rare anyway this would definitely have the feel of a special event. 
---
Thanks I appreciate it!
---
It's hard for me to be sympathetic when this is a problem of your own creation and the way you choose to play the game.  Why is it my  "responsibility" to clear the enemies that "weren't worth your time"?  If you want another chance, clear them yourself.
---
This is not my observation. It appears as if every server chooses which enemies will be legendaries and which will not on the initial spawn. When I find X number of legendaries in an area, that exact number with respawn in the given area. When I hunt Watoga, the same enemies are always the legendaries in the same spot I killed them. If you find zero legendaries in an area, they will never ever respawn as a legendary. That is my observation anyways.
---
Think about it... you went into the vault when things were fairly OK, and then a lot BOMBS came and destroyed tons of stuff, pretty much killing off anyone left. So you come out an nobody survived, so we learn what happened from the robots left, notes people left, and the recordings they made. I find this an alright method for telling a story about what happened and now we, collectively are making our stories, together. That's something I couldn't do in Fallout 4. I like Fallout 4 for what it is an I love that I can jump in an meet people and play in this Fallout 76 world with friends.
---
.....\^five?
---
Congrats on level 100 :)
---
Power armor in pvp?! you might have gotten more DR by wrapping yourself in kleenex.
---
Absolutely agree with you üíØ. I only hope that more people are like you and are willing to make their minds up on their own.
---
yeah i know i can get swarmed there
---
My Preston Garvey sits in a dress all day, in the gallows, in front of an auto pitch machine.
---
Uuuh.. No ? It would throw others mods out the window. No point using anything else of AA then.
---
Energy weapons need a buff, though, it's common sense at this point.
---
Absolutely. I cannot see how a group would play with game without Discord (or some other app). 
---
Among my friends, we also have several people regularly encountering a crash to desktop bug on PC where you'll fail to reload the team world every time if you're still in the group. Therefore people have to be on Discord to let people know to kick them, or they're locked out of that world perpetually (until the team disbands).   
---
It's crazy how often we hear "I cannot invite them, can someone else try?" Usually the answer is no and the newcomer has to re-log, or we have to disband and reform the party. It's all crazy-town all-the-time. 
---
Thank you for helping!
---
Lol you think so huh? I can farm 2200 steel in a 1-2 hour farming session (super mutants at West Tek). I can get 500+ lead in 10 minutes by mining ore and processing it. Gears, springs, screws, etc, well, I have thousands of those stored on mules. They aren't super easy to farm, but with the stash weight limit being what it is, I could easily see someone having that much on them with pack rat, waiting for a friend to help them transfer.
---
Furthermore, steel and lead are not even worth farming at workshops due to how low the cap is for them to produce it and how long it takes. The only things worth farming are acid and fusion cores (only if you need them). 
---
These kind of assumptions are really toxic for the community.
---
yeah im a pretty experienced player..all my alts were at whitespring as soon as possible..but u have a ton of options there that help u in combat
---
Summary, I like 76, I disagree with bad reviews.
---
1.  I think the rewards wouldn't need to be any different than quest rewards now - plans / crap / etc.  But then you also have a temporary high-level mob zone to get XP/nuked flora/etc.
---
2.  Be anyone / Do anything = online Fallout.  Psychotic Raiders want to watch the world burn, nuff said.  
---
Have them only able to meltdown once in a 24 hour (real time) period so people aren't just constantly spamming it.  
---
They could give the power plants 4 states -  
---
Neutral  
---
Powered Up  (Now idea how long it lasts currently)  
---
Melted Down  (Lasts 1 hour)  
---
Decommissioned (Lasts 24 realtime hours - can't power up or melt down)  
---
The weapon could be neat for stealth gameplay, but it simply falls short in some ways.
---
As to your crystal issue. I find plenty in a Wade airport camp mcClintok summersville run. Always pick up any wine decanter or cut vase (cork crystal). Good luck happy hunting 
---
This game's patchnotes read as a long series of reasons behind statements like "and now I don't bother". Feed the People, Supply Drops, Cap Stashes, some perks....
---
yeah i might wait til 50..if im not in a team
---
Who the fuck is that joker anyway?
---
Yep mine crashes so hard it messes up my group chats....... IP gets all messed up
---
I reload my own ammo so it has always bothered me where are the primers?
---
What speed is the machete?
---
dumping on new stuff to already existing content is kind of silly, people are all ready just grinding legendarys non stop. These could be a cool reward for another high lvl activity. if only this game had proper MMO dungeons or a diablo 3 rift system
---
Woo! I just had to hop off to get back to work (dumb work!) see you in Appalachia soon. 
---
I bought a cool Mutant Slayer's Explosive Fletchette Harpoon gun just to have something to clear West Tek with, OP. Maybe try picking out something to help you cut them down? I actually wish they would make some of the other +damage against type weapons worthwhile, we need beefier baddies
---
Who? 
---
Its a walk in the park over there. Don't forgot to wave at the warlords when you are there. 
---
It'd help get through his day at work! I have to go into work today for like 30 minutes ayyy
---
Don't forget the Rad Toads, Mirelurks, and Anglers for Fish type foods. Baits to attract these would be cool in areas with some water.
---
Hahaha, you made my day! üòÇ
---
That‚Äôs not how it works lolol 
---
Very well put diary/log of your time in Appalachia. Makes me realize that I am not the only one out there enjoying his ass off in this game. I mean to be honest. I'm sick as a friggin dog today. . . But I still am sitting here talking myself into playing for a few when I get home to find some reactive plates for my excavator PA. Shortly thereafter I'm taking my happy ass to be early, lol. Here's to many more levels!
---
Gasp!!!!  I hade no idea wine decanter and cut vase give you crystal. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I've had so much playtime, and yet still so much to learn. Ty!!!
---
You can die and you will respawn with some decrease in rads.  Not sure if it's some fixed amount, or a percentage, but you definitely get some HP to play with.
---
I use meat hooks. I have 5 of the snazzy things. Only 2 stars though and seems like there's no faster swing hook to be found. 
---
You mean its not immersive to be born with names like "baronvon badash" and "lemmelickthemtoes" .? Lmao joking aside. I agree complely.
---
I‚Äôm glad you decided to look past the negativity and try it for yourself!
---
I used to request Drops very frequently for the low level players around Flatwoods, I wouldn't retrieve them myself, then I found out about the change that made players wanted for picking someone else's Air Drop, so now I just drop Supply Requisitions in containers around Flatwoods.
---
I think everyone should be able to get it, but it should also be level dependent;
---
* &lt; level 10 = 1 random weapon, 5ea. Water, Healing Salve, &amp; food items, 25 ammo. 
---
* 11-25 = 3 ea. Water, Stimpaks, food items, &amp; 25 ammo
---
* 26-50 = 2 ea, Stimpaks, Radaway, Food
---
* \&gt;50 = Treasure map for the one who requested the drop
---
Also, please remove Supply requisitions from high level Ghouls Loot tables, anyone farming WS has no use for them.
---
The entire game is sad because someone handed your ass ?
---
Are we missing a /s anywhere ?
---
Place the door first and then add the stairs.
---
There are workarounds for many of these issues, like stacking foundations and passing cables through walls. This posts is asking if someone's found a way to accomplish the task, despite being 'impossible'.
---
This is a spectacular piece of what a holotape should have been; incredibly suspenseful, dark, and eerie. Bravo, friend! 
---
Ok thanks
---
He is cancer in human form.
---
As am I. My point to posting this was to post positive!
---
Thanks. I'm quite certain I've tried it before, but will give it another shot and report back.
---
lol yeah lost me at "The year is 1996"

---
You just helped make my point.
---
If I don't clear enemies and you don't clear them.......who is going to clear them?
---
The reason I bring this up is because I watch players enter areas on the map, I check to make sure nobody is in the area before I take my turn. I see spawns walking outside of their zones when I arrive and no meat bags..... someone was here and they left. I sometimes notice one or two dead enemies but everything else is alive...... someone poached the legendary and left without clearing the rest. If I roll into the Whitespring and see a  bunch of level 20 ghouls and don't clear them you too will see nothing but level 20 ghouls when you show up next.
---
Just because this isn't a problem for you does not mean that it's not happening. 
---
Sort of related to this, does anyone know if there's a way to deliberately trigger the "get into my Power Armor quickly" animation?  The one where the character leaps into it?
---
Hey I have those. You can have them. IGN skinnyhb
---
Same lol. 
---
Dealing with players selling items you'll get crazy prices but for every person wanting 10k cap or more you'll find 2 others with reasonable prices. A lot of people just want to straight up trade items no caps involved but we don't have that option. Unless you set the price to zero which is pretty dumb. 
---
There should be a trade system. Set up an offer and either accept reject or counter offer. Seems it would be a nice addition to the game.
---
GARY
---
I'm not sure the Dev's can do much about NAT problems other than bigger more dedicated servers. Not sure if you know the technique: friend up on main screen -&gt; enter world together.
---
On a full server in monster hunter usually happens with at least 1 person, too.
---
I tried it once and it worked, but building is a bit finicky. Still, it's way better than it was in Fallout 4. 
---
You're asking a tricky question because... well, anti-armor vs. two shot... that has been [mathed out](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/asouq3/psa_anti_armor_is_actually_always_better_than_two/). I was involved in working some of those numbers and AA wins out assuming you have one of the higher end barrel mods attached. Since you're adding the explosive effect though... I'm actually going to say TSE is *probably* better, because my understanding is that the second projectile will trigger its own explosion... but I haven't looked into how explosive damage is calculated in two-shot, whether it's a % of the first or (much less damage) second projectile... that's actually a pretty in-depth question. I wouldn't trust the on paper damage numbers because it's not true to the actual damage. There is more calculation that happens based on damage resist and how that itself works is different for explosives.  
---
Assuming TSE is better it probably functions its best when aiming down the site. That was calculated to have the least spread. If one of the projectiles misses then the damage tends to go way down. This is an interesting question though. Curious what people's anecdotal experiences are with AAE/TSE of the exact same weapons.
---
Sure, how much do you want for them?
---
Yeah I know about all of those workarounds, how to make round buildings, how to place walls without foundations, etc. However, I haven‚Äôt heard of a workaround for this particular placement. Good luck! 
---
Might be your perks. 
---
FO76 is not FO4 Online, just like ESO is not Skyrim Online. As long as you keep that in mind and you are willing to learn new game mechanics and be patient with the games development you'll be fine. There's a lot of negativity on the forums and while a lot of it is deserved if you find a core of 2-3 friends to play with you can still have a good time. 
---
:-)
---
I won't be on for a few more days, but you can add me if you want help running quests or workshops. 
---
Mic or no, doesn't matter. GT is same as ID.
---
It's the same basic sequence every time.  Although one thing you can do is repair any Damaged Mainframe Cores you might have taken from a previous run, so you have a head start on that objective next time.
---
Have = free in slang English
---
West Tek is where I farm my steel / gunpowder (and if I'm lucky, the occasional 3 star). It's entirely dependent on how strong you are. If you're using an optimal build with a decent legendary you'll be fine.
---
Because Bethesda is so cripplingly incompetent they're deliberately broadcasting half of your login information to their half-assed web-store.  
---
The atom-shop is 100% feature complete and working as intended though!  Don't forget to make those microtransactions!
---
Not sure what happened to my previous comment. :0
---
This is a fantastic piece of dark government secrets; 76 style! Thank you for converting the terminal entry into a holotape. Bravo, friend!
---
Can someone give me a TL;DR on whats expected to be on this DLC?
---
You should probably get a bigger pot.
---
Console?
---
yep if you have no perks its going to suck. also you need mods for it, add in antiarmor plus a better receiver.  plus the somerset is an anti-armor legendary. you would need an anti-armor legendary handmade to compare.
---
Yes thank you, someone already made me one
---
Especially because some people gamer tags are kinda cringey and embarrassing today outloud. Like mine... 
---
Changing these behaviors of the NPC's and plants would be really difficult and could cause more harm than good in terms of bugs. As cool as it'd be, I don't think they'll add it in
---
Who?
---
You do realize you can currently get anti-armor on laser weapons and it does nothing for them right? I have an AA + FR gatling laser that is worthless because the AA doesn't affect energy armor.
---
And for the record, even if it DID affect energy armor, bloodied would still be better, and two-shot is only a little worse.
---
Anti-Armor is already too powerful, and I say that as someone who had amassed quite a few Anti-Armor legendaries.
---
You're better off not knowing. 
---
Lol, I figured that was what you meant. But I don't mind giving you something in return. Anything you're short on, or need at the moment? Besides the aforementioned TSE's etc lol.
---
I noticed on Whitespring runs that the same ghoul will be a legendary on every run depending on the server. Whether or not it spawns as a 3* is RNG.
---
Even if your observation is true it still matters. I myself no longer care to bother with a 1* super mutant or a gutsy. If I don't kill that 1* there is a 0% probability that it will spawn as a 3* when you get there next.
---
IMO, the drops are fine now.   I prefer not getting whatever you want easily.  It encourages different builds and trading among players.  I also realize not everyone would agree with that point of view.  
---
I do agree that if you want something specific, it will take quite a while, but the new legendary vendor should take care of that issue.  
---
Dupes ruined the economy, more so on PC than on console. 99% of the good items in the game are dupes.
---
Just sign on quickly and take them from me, I signed off to spend time with my baby, so let's do this amigo :-)
---
Let me guess - OP was your troll account making its first post and you switched logins to play the white knight.
---
IT IS TROLLING BECAUSE IT IS REPOSTING
---
Exactly
---
He‚Äôs one of the youtubers that actively hate mongers on 76 for views, because none of his other content is interesting enough to pull in viewers. His 76 stuff is just a constant stream of lies and hate 
---
Well played....lol.
---
Are you running it as a rifle or pistol? Because I think it can go either way depending on the grip... rifle seems like the better choice for perks though.
---
I‚Äôve got mine as a rifle but I still need to get more rifleman and tank killer perks to maximize its damage. 
---
What‚Äôs your damage showing? With 30% rifleman and 15% bloody mess I think I was around 35-36 but I know more perks will help that.
---
Oh, sorry my bad. I'm at work until around 4pm Eastern. 
---
Prepare uranus for a new wave of nerfs and bugs. Calling it
---
I need to do mysterious stranger yeetus
---
Opens a discussion about PVP - cries about the reply being too confrontational. Judging from OP's reply he doesn't even understand english.
---
You can bypass the radiation chamber. There's a door that can be picked inside that room with the broken pipes. Terminal to unlock the bulkhead doors. Then at the launch terminal, if you've launched in that silo you don't have to put in the code, just the card.
---
Because server hopping into a specific building in a specific area that everyone else is already doing is really healthy for the enjoyment of the game.
---
It's really stressful for me because there's usually a person already there, or some turd with a turret farm and you compete with each other, then repeat. If you spawned them (they spawn once for each person that joins the server) that means the other players are literally stealing your kills. 
---
Also all the ghouls are invisible for about 30 seconds while the game loads the graphical assets.
---
Awesome thank you!
---
Why the downvotes? He's right 
---
So did you intitnate PvP or what did he just come up and one hit you in slap damage?
---
I see tons of potential for DLCs in this game, things like this could all be part of a Hunter/Rancher/Farmer DLC, that could add Traps, Lures, Animal Pens, and expanded Farming. along with additional Recipes, Hide Armors etc.. 
---
Can‚Äôt tell if sarcasm or..
---
But max incisor perk gives extreme armor penetration, that man prob has a nice specialized build.
---
Your X01 is aluminum foil in melee combat 
---
You're toxic because you're whining rather than creating a fun event. What's wrong with your English skills? What specifically are you struggling with?
---
Because somerset special is a badass piece.  one of the best quest rewards in the game and you get it so very early.  Half my early playing days loading screen shots are rocking that pistol.
---
Yeah I'll never forget that time when I couldn't revive a teamate and I had +20 stimpacks. 
---
I get that diluted stimpacks could be too weak to revive someone and you can make 2 from a single stimpack or even 8 with the help of perks, but at least super stimpacks should work.
---
Maybe nerf it an amount then but then actually make it have a use for energy and radiation weapons?
---
I haven't found any quest there yet, but place seems to be already set up for a event similar to the power up energy plant events...
---
So I'm sure we can expect weather control as a future dlc
---
It ruined the economy, made caps worthless on pc for high end trades, and made it so that everyone could pay to win by purchasing duped items on ebay. I quit for over a month until they get rid of the majority of them.
---
I've got a full set of Mutant slayers and troubleshooters armor, I also have a mutants slayer handmade and a troubleshooters handmade. I hunt mutants and gutsy. I still don't see the point in clearing an area if there isn't anything there...... it's just not worth the trip to the work benches to repair all of my stuff and the ammo 
---
The Somerset Special is just a really nice mid-tier weapon.  It was a go-to for my first 40-50 levels too, even though it was a measly Lv. 15 or whatever.
---
I just server hop to reset enemies so I can get exp and level up 
---
Essentially the same experience I got. I started playing Fallout 1 in 2000, and have played every Fallout game since. This game has been awesome and a blast.
---
It's ok, I'm MTN time, he should be napping around then. I had to check my loot to make sure, reactive plates mod for excavator PA on hold for you today. Take care.
---
Sometimes it works correctly for me, other times I get the looping loading screen. On PS4, by the way.
---
3-4k
---
xD
---
That‚Äôs the sad part it‚Äôs POWER Armor not Blackbeard‚Äôs gun shield 
---
5k
---
Was going to ask this too... Glad someone beat me to it... Need to change this Bethesda otherwise what's the point of creating a character name if you can't see it on the map
---
That's true. While it is an obvious plot hole, you could just imagine that they popped in from a parallel universe where nukes did drop on Appalachia. Or, maybe there were mini-nuke bombing raids that didn't wipe out large areas.
---
Good deal. I'll look you up when I get on today. Thanks!
---
Power Armor.... Lol
---
I used to camp just south west of top of the world in the woods, by a lake, I‚Äôm sure some of you know where. Little green leaf icon on the map. Anyways, near that body of water two Brahmin spawn, even after you camp there. I‚Äôm sure if you found other animals you could camp near them and use them for food. Steaks every time I logged in!
---
I'm not saying they shouldn't show character names, but they still serve a purpose: If you have multiple characters you can more easily distinguish between them.
---
i have roleplayed a bit, using a soundboard rip of prestons actual sayings, i just hold my mic near as i reply , it really confuses some people, really angers others heheh
---
Is there anything else youd want for the handmade? Ive been looking for one for ages but i dont have sentinel on any of my stuff
---
&gt;  the only cheats that could possibly give a person an edge on you is aimbot and god mode never encountered this ever
---
I consider holding a duped TSE to make you a cheater. There are probably 100 PC players with TSE / Sent Assn to every 1 on console.
---
I run WestTek solo but imho it's nothing special. Yes, you CAN run it solo. Yes, you should make the trip. But you kind of have to be a dual specialist that can switch between sneaky and tanky as needed. It's not hard to hide in the shadows and pick off a few muties and their doggos but one mistake and every single high level super mutant in there -- and there are dozens -- will zero in on your location and kill you until you die from it.
---
It's kind of fun to poke around all the terminals and labs and crap for all the lore and such but the loot is incredibly meh and it's so easy to turn yourself in circles and get lost. Sure, there's lots of aluminum and chems and such, but and medical facility will have that. Yes, there's a legendary mutant or two but there's way easier ways to farm legendaries that aren't nearly as deadly. Like nuking Whitespring and running through the clubhouse in your underwear. But hey if you're interested in bottling up liquid death for a chance of inducing a random mutation there's no place better than WestTek.
---
So yeah, when you feel confident you can take on a horde of level 68 super mutant overlords singlehandedly while cornered in a decrepit mutagenics lab for the sweet sweet reward of unfettered access to giant yellow vats of toxic goo and a two star junkies lead pipe then go ahead and take on WestTek by yourself.
---
I agree, AA *should* affect energy resistance. absolutely.
---
Bloodied is better only on the bloodied build. I don't like this playstyle, at all, because I don't want to be either a sitting piece of meat counting on luck and sentinel gear to protect my ass at 20% hp, OR being OSed by a ill-timed melee attack aka server lag.
---
To each their own build.
---
It affected all platforms. 
---
Sounds promising, thank you. My wishlist of imprrovements to the system is a long one. Starting with fusion gens less than a floor wide...
---
After reading a lot it says that they are almost the same and if they have some damage difference is practical nothing so we can say that AA and TS are most powerful weps for high health ingame
---
That's good info. I'm going to level up tank killer now that I have an explosive combat rifle. 
---
Nah, pc
---
Does your handmade have an auto, or semi-auto receiver? Either way, you're going to be scrounging for 5.56 ammo constantly at your level.
---
Rifleman perks are in PER, but cost a lot to max them out (9 cards for 60% dmg add)
---
If anything, the economy has been massively deflated by duping. It should have been virtually impossible to buy a TSE or assassin/sentinel piece without throwing your entire cap limit at it, given the difficulty of acquiring good items versus the difficulty of acquiring caps. 
---
I've personally accumulated over 80k caps by vendor trading. I've found a total of five explosive weapons, none of which managed the combination of good max level weapon and a good first star. Explosive isn't even very good anymore, but you get the idea.
---
I have no clue but it can be alot.. 
---
Wow you‚Äôd think the haters would get tired of it by now. The whole road map mostly silenced them but I guess there‚Äôs still a few that remain.
---
I can get it up to 240ish and yeah it's pretty fun to use 
---
TS &gt; AA without mods, AA &gt; TS with mods. I ran all the tests and numbers myself, can confirm. The difference varies slightly depending on how much damage each bullet does because damage resistance is weird. TS has a lot of other disadvantages with recoil/spread etc. You're asking something different once you add the explosive damage thoughand I'm kind of wagering TSE is better because of the second explosion.
---
I killed a 3* glowing rad stag and got a 1* trouble shooters pipe pistol I was pissed
---
Knock down health. They will rapidly heal to full health. Think this can be done a couple times, maybe just once. Then you kill them. 
---
I know pretty much what each junk item breaks down into but was just wondering if I here was a place that spawned more items with copper than others kind of like sugar grove has a lot of fans, clipboards, and globes for screws.  Also didn't know if there was an enemy that drops copper like the deathclaw a drop gears/blk titanium,Yao GUI= springs/acid, and wendigos drop screws
---
I had my CAMP there for a long time, it's a good spot. The only reason I left it was because my tamed sloth kept attacking everyone that would walk by, then setting off my missile launchers. Really wish they'd change it so tamed animals only attacked people actually attacking your CAMP, but that's another topic. All in all, good spot, even saw Grahm there once. Definitely got a lot of player traffic, so it could be a greatplace for your setup.
---
It says that when both are full modded the difference is minimal like 2-3 more damage,
---
Thanks SO MUCH for this suggestion, I've been running bloodied and it's made the high lvl game so much more exciting for me, this is pretty much exactly what I wanted!
---
Oh no no, he had the workshop, and I killed him and took it. There is no innocent or guilty players in a workshop. Just workshop PvP, and smart people who don‚Äôt carry half a stash worth of junk in a PvP zone.
---
Also the pack rat perk is not an excuse or even a legitimate justification to be carrying that much shit around, it‚Äôs just simply moronic.
---
So talking about AAE &amp; TSE yep i think is still better tse
---
I couldn't even sell a nice ts gatlin plasma. I think I read somewhere this same thing, about like a guass rifle and tank killer and they addressing this in the patch. Have to wait and see.
---
I meant that perk would work, but gun mod won't. Concentrated fire helps alot too. It staggers
---
I‚Äôd say you will. I love 76 and I loved fallout 4. There needs to be more quest but it looks like that is coming tomorrow with the new DLC. Now that they mostly have the bugs straightened out it should be awesome getting all these DLCs for free moving forward!
---
They auto heal. I always let them. Thought that was common knowledge. 
---
in front of an auto pitch machine-
---
you mean like T-Pain?  "Im on a boat mothafu@#$a!"
---
Because I don't have the perk for it, what enemies have high ER?  Robots?
---
this is correct.. it takes like half of the work out of it probably.. who would down-vote this? 
---
however, I'm not for taking it out.  I do like the suggestion of displaying both for the sole purpose of deincentivising grief. Maybe the character's name as the main display name, followed by account name in parenthesis, or access through the social menu...  
---
i wouldn't think there would be cross naming issues because we should all have things akin to uuid's attached to each account/character combination
---
my user name is stupid and hard to remember, but Barry, Other Barry, and Other Other Barry would love to make their presences known
---
I wonder if it will be a simple break down item to mods or an RNG component with a new currency to get a random re-roll. I would love some choice / influence and not just RNG. 
---
As I repeat constantly with all these new survival / MMO / looter shooters. Just copy Diablo 3. They allow for cosmetic re-skins and I think a fair re-roll of attributes on items. 
---
I'm down for this simply because copper seems to pile up in my stash
---
Half the time I just bulk it and sell it to a vendor
---
Glad you're enjoying the game though! I just started myself and now I'm obsessed.
---
Thought it was just me! I was showing off the game to my friend to try and persuade him to get it and everything was going well till *that* loading screen took about 30 minutes...
---
Because it‚Äôs not like that for console games.
---
I agree! Great game and I'm still having a great time playing this.
---
There‚Äôs a few good quest. The main quest line and one done by the women author are pretty good. It‚Äôs different than fallout 4 but I really enjoyed the story.
---
My idea of fun is to find, in some remote lacation, hard to defeat 3* legie and get from that item I want. 
---
&gt; Because Bethesda is so cripplingly incompetent they're deliberately broadcasting half of your login information to their half-assed web-store to everyone on every server you join.
---
I don't know about Xbox or PC, but my PSN Displayed name is _not_ "half my login info".  The displayed Name isn't what I use to login to the network, or even to my Bethesda account.
---
Slow, bulky, loud. But the biggest part is that by using power armor you‚Äôre giving up the opportunity of having 15 legendary effects. There‚Äôs so many different reasons of how those effects make regular armor superior to power armor, so I‚Äôm not going to go into explaining each individually, but look at a few and I‚Äôm sure you could eventually figure out why regular armor can be so much better.
---
This forum isn‚Äôt just for creating *fun events* 
---
Plus theirs more to come. I‚Äôve put in more hours with 76 than 4 and that‚Äôs not about the stop anytime soon. Having areas locked away with harder monsters to kill makes it feel like morrowind. I like the perk cards better than 4s system as well. 
---
If you want a real crystal farm, go down Lucky Hole Mine with excavator armor. I only run it for the lead, but there's nearly as much crystal. Probably 200 raw.
---
i would suggest summersville to train your character..its just super mutants the highest is level is a 16..will take about 10 mins to clear..they drop good loot and have decent hunting rifles..on top of the roof there is an armor and weapons work bench..so even if ur overencumbered..its good to scrap all the weapons that u dont want..i believe a hunting rifle is great for low levels because it has pretty good damage output..u can serverhop..and do it all over again..they drop screws and caps too
---
I had someone clear out whitespring with me the other night. All I could hear was rap coming through his headset. The Only reason I didn't mind is because he reminded me of Bumblebee in his yellow PA. 
---
On second thought I think if they made gridding more possible this game would turn into rust 2.
---
He actually used to have some pretty good theory videos back in the day.. 
---
now it‚Äôs just the same old same old garbage, glad I unsubbed 
---
I used to think the same thing until I tried it. Now, I run around all day in power armor using a bloodied .50 cal MG. I use diluted stimpacks / radaways to keep my health balanced at around 15-19%. With crafting perks I can turn 20 stimpacks into 100+ diluted, which will last me a very long time. Adrenal reaction heals you quite often when you're low too. 
---
Personally I love the thrill of it, and I can take 2-3 big hits in full t-60, even when sub 20%. During SBQ, with psychobuff, adrenaline, nerd rage, bloodied, and adrenal reaction going, my .50 Cal can hit 350+ damage per shot. With ultracite rounds it goes to 400+. If I DO die and get a revive, revenant kicks in and I get an extra 50% damage, pushing me over 600 damage per shot. Even with 10 other people not really contributing much damage or literally standing around doing nothing, I can visibly see the queen's HP melting off when she lands and I lay into her. To me, it's well worth it.
---
ahhh yes u just reminded me..i can handle the mutants..the mutant hounds are a problem for stealth
---
Could be lag related. Sometimes the servers take so long to process things especially at the queen. We laughed about this the other day looking for her meat pile. Most everyone else left and it pops in. Some of those like health regeneration is lag.
---
You know you done fucked up when your own turrets attack you. 
---
Would love the explanation for FO4's scene where there are 5 mannequins surrounding a headless body in a bathtub, 4 with machetes, one with a plunger.
---
The head is in the toilet.
---
Outside the bathroom is a skeleton embracing a mannequin on a bed.
---
Never found a note.
---
Love finding these things, but I doubt this example is one of mourning.  Still, I left the scene intact...
---
Changed your mind?
---
I mean, if you're melee, you don't expend any bullets, so if resource efficiency is the motivating factor here, relying on Handmade Rifles seems questionable...
---
just....wow.
---
Brotherhood of steel, enclave, first responders, raiders.... players have brought the factions back. Like I run a brotherhood of steel group, so we run military patrols, help wastelanders, sometime fight enclave groups.... but all we have is initiate paint....
---
Word, im all for this. Ballsdeep69 isnt getting the recognition it deserves.
---
I'm at the point to where I almost don't pick up twos unless they're really really good
---
It's pretty balanced across the board, which makes energy weapons really lackluster in general. Queen has 300+ for example. Also keep in mind, Stabilized perk (45% armor ignore) is required to make heavy weapons good, and it doesn't apply to gatling laser or gatling plasma.
---
Ah right, didn't think about the fact you're losing out on 5x3 legendary slots since PA can't be legendary. That makes a lot of sense.
---
You could at least put in a tiny bit of effort before denouncing all PVP, and whining about no content.
---
I‚Äôm about 7 I think. I should be on later if you want to add me Vulcanthropy
---
Read my post again I did not denounce all pvp. I even said I like pvp. I said I‚Äôm bitching about people exploiting pvp. And also I never once complained about having no content. Read my post before you try to criticize me
---
Thank you for the information!
---
Does this have an effect? Never been an issue with my minigun, but now I‚Äôm playing with an Instigating Gauss Sniper, a lot of legendaries are getting 1-shotted. 
---
Honestly the negative reviews are from people set in their ways about how a game should be. I mean sure Fallout 76 has some issues but that‚Äôs to be expected with any game. I personally am loving my time exploring Appalachia as well and I‚Äôm happy to see you are too! 
---
TSE‚Äôs are almost all garbage now. Come spray me with a tse shotgun and watch it hit me over and over for 0 dmg. How? Because a simple armor mod and perk cod prevent it from doing any dmg. Anyone who knows the most basics of basics of PvP knows that one, but nope you‚Äôre just some noob acting like he knows what‚Äôs going on when he doesn‚Äôt know shit.
---
Shut up you‚Äôre just butthurt you‚Äôve gotten your ass handed to you several times, maybe if you actually learned a thing or two instead of spent your time fucking whining and crying, then you‚Äôd actually be able to defend yourself properly.
---
I honestly have no idea. I dont use weapons that one shot
---
Anytime always happy to lend a hand
---
Uh, that would make everything basically naked against melee weapons+perks.
---
I don't think you carried this idea all the way through. 
---
Also, leave my AA weapons alone.
---
Some happen to me all the time. Probably 6 times last night alone. 
---
I'm at the point when I'm only taking 3* for the purveyor. 1* and 2* are dropped off at whitespring station
---
I don't see myself ever getting to that level.  While I don't use them, they are something that can be sold for caps so to me they're like cash.
---
I gifted that away and regret it later....
---
I see you have my camp site listed! #36
---
I always called it the trapper shack, but I like man fisher hut more now. The ambiance and sounds there always make me think I‚Äôm in far harbor. I even wear full trapper gear on my character.
---
Now If only I had that lobster cage helmet... a man can dream
---
Whats the alpha code?
---
Maybe youll think twice about pvp on from now on. Smart players have griefer measures for players like you. 
---

---
I'm gonna be that guy. In the fallout universe they have Nuclear Fusion figured out and use it to power everyday things. There is zero risk of a nuclear fusion plant melting down like a modern day nuclear fission based powerplant. In addition to that modern nuclear fission plants don't blow up, they melt down meaning that radiation leaks into the surrounding environment a la Chernobyl and Fukushima. While it would be cool for Charleston to turn into S.T.A.L.K.E.R it's not accurate to the Fallout Lore 
---
The line in the sand mission is annoying because of this, I think it would be a lot better if it just didn't fire at ground-based targets, it is anti-aircraft after all.
---
Also, how does it have the strongest attraction for VATS ever?  I've sun entirely around to VATS-lock onto the ASAM instead of the scorchbeast I was looking at so many times!
---
Well, there's the Bob cats.

---
I can see this as a good thing with some strict limitations to prevent more of the same issues that have occurred with other legendary stuff, such as;
---
* Only 1 legendary Perk Card can be equipped (does not require a slot like regular cards)
---
* Unequipping or Equipping a new Card permanently deletes the existing equipped one.
---
* Legendary Cards cannot be dropped or traded (like quest Items)
---
Cards could be things like Weight Reduction Perks, Class Freak level 4 (No negative Mutation affect when used with Class freak level 3), No Weapon/Armor Degradation for &lt;Insert weapon/Armor type here&gt;, Super Chemist (50% more when used with Chemist), Master Chef (Double results from cooking).
---
They should not be anything that drastically tips the scales for any particular build type, or that can stack with anything else creating a significant advantage,
---
FWIK, every once in a while, the server kill all the enemy in a certain cell and respawns them, probably including a legendary. 
---
The only way I see it happening is if u craft thousands of items constantly to the point it can be confused with duping
---
They had confirmed here that you can't. Lots of people tested it too, people who claimed they got banned by crafting were absolutely lying. 
---
I have 2.7K hours in Fallout 4, but have a pretty mediocre opinion of fallout 76.  You MIGHT like it.. others do. chances are, though, that you'll burn out sooner than you expected.
---
It really doesn't matter if it's bugs or server lag, it's something that bethesda has to fix. 
---
The odd bit about health regeneration is that i was able to trade with whitespring vendors, was able to craft and do pretty much anything without any lag, it's just when i shot any random mob that the game decided to heal it back...
---
It's not even the first time when it happens... I need to get myself some screen recorder so next time i have proof too...
---
There are settlements. The workshops you can claim and raid.
---
Isn‚Äôt this the standard across all multiplayer games on all platforms?
---
yeah or maybe an option to send cargobots to new players? might be really cool!
---
Imagine trying to flex skill on a game that requires absolutely none
---
Traits of someone who doesn't actually play any competitive games and feels big by abusing overpowered weapons in an unbalanced game.
---
The thing is tho energy weapons need some sort of penetration to be even close to par to its ballistic counterparts late game. Especially if it's an automatic weapon it you're better off punching with 1 strength 
---
I'm in the same situation at level 96. I am keeping all my level 45-50 3 star items and dropping/selling all my lower level, one and two star items at Frederick's in White Springs.
---
Mostly it'll be practice that makes you better, there are a few short-cuts you can take, but they don't cut down too much.
---
I can do it in about 20-30 minutes now with some practice, with most of the time doing the launch prep since you can't really speed that up at all.
---
But that would make the game more "fun" and less of a grind to get legendaries.   
---
To be fair though. I'd respect Bethesda Austin a lot more if they did this to make players happier. I hope they do something like this. 
---
Constructive criticism is one thing. The OP is talking about people who haven't played in months (or ever). The game has had 6 or 7 updates since launch so if somebody hasn't played since the first or second update (or even the beta) most of their complaints will be out of date or just plain wrong while nearly everything the never played ones say is useless since they don't know what they're talking about.
---
At this point you're not naming the character you're naming the save of that character. Neverwinter shows character names and usernames are shown when you inspect someone. That system seems to work well.
---
Loading in around 25-40kB/sec. Playing in game around 10kB/sec. Barely anything really.
---
My turrets attack me more than anything else. Especially when I get into a PvP scenario in for the of my camp the damn things start shooting me!
---
I run solo all the time 
---
We killed an alien outside my fiance's camp. For me it dropped to the ground, for him it glitched and stayed upright. So, naturally, we posed around it and took a picture. I love it!! But I don't have it because mine worked correctly. I would love a photo sharing feature! Or even a way to hang our pictures up in our camps.
---
Issa joke
---
Thank you! Although I can't take credit for the bar idea. Someone else posted their C.A.M.P. here with a very similar idea a few months ago.
---
Was the frame you put the armor on, yours?
---
But the minutemen were literally just "help settlement need help mark map go help". Other factions had multiple raidants.
---
This is an emote, if you payed 20$ for that dumbass christmas emote bundle.
---
Sadly not :)
---
I'm level 34 and had a lvl 20 2* explosive combat rifle drop the other day. It's other effect is Medic -- heals you and your team when you hit with crit. I really like it. It's my first weapon where I feel like I can defend myself fairly well.
---
I didn't realize how rare explosives drop. I was just given a level 35 3* Vampires explosive revolver. Even though I have rifle perks, I sometimes pull out a revolver (I have an executioner's revolver) for certain situations or as backup. So I'm looking forward to seeing how this explosive one handles.
---
Saw graham for the second time ever three days ago and he didn‚Äôt have a single thing I wanted to buy :( feels bad man 
---
So your argument is that everyone should use a melee build so we can one shot everything?
---
Isn't that basically what my OP was about?.... making stuff easier to kill?
---
It's a lot of fun, really. Stay away from guides and videos, just get out there and explore.
---
There's an epic one that spawns occasionally with a troup of supermutants at the bog town workshop.
---
If he's not there you can clear the bog and check again later.
---
Ok well thx
---
I think "DLC" said for upcoming content is too much. Maybe after 3 months, when it all rolls out, you can refer to it as first DLC, but right now. More like a patch.
---
Thanks! I think that floor overall turned out the best of the three, and yet sadly it's the one I go to the least. Part of the reason I'm going to move and build something new when the patch comes out is because this house is just too big to be practical. I only ever use the bedroom and the workbench room.
---
What plans have a data cap? Is he hot spotting off a phone? My brother used his phone for xbox one time played for like 3 hours and almost used half of our mobile data for the month (40gbs total). If that's his plan I'd advise against it.
---
Explain to me how an auction house would stop player from dictating prices? 
---
+10% Damage boost. It's literally in the next line.
---
You know it.
---
Glad any bugs are being fixed even if we gotta wait a day, excited to play when it drops!
---
Considering they used to fall apart after 3-4 reloads, I'd say it's a good fix to an existing problem.
---
No, sorry man. Took me 3 months to get it myself haha!
---
You sir, had the honor of being the first person I sold something to. It was even sketchy with the bug, but you didn't rip me off, nor did I rip you off. It was a good experience.
---
He's too busy farming outrage over anthem.
---
Which ones are done by the woman author?
---
Lots of good ideas in there, but ultimately I got bored by the quests. It's just dumb that they try to get you to expect to finally meet some survivors all the time when they outright told us at E3 there are no people and all you can expect is another holotape, another (often boring) terminal or another robot. The voice acting is superb, the woman in the closet gave me chills.
---
I played about a hundred hours, had some fun with friends, dealt with the game breaking bugs and ultimately just stopped playing because I got bored. Never finished all the main quests, but at least I did launch a Nuke and beat the SBQ. Maybe I'll come back in a few months.
---
That's just for automatic tho right? I can't bring it up on my phone right now
---
Ah sure, no worries man :) ill try find one of the items u want :p
---
Awesome info just wanted to make this type of character. Completely demolishing everything with bloodied build getting boring 
---
Its a random encounter, I guess they named the actors wrong though, so the deathclaw that killed everyone is named traveling merchant, my bet is it was supposed to be a live deathclaw and a dead guy, but it got mixed up and forgotten.
---
Not just that. The connection between you and Bethesda‚Äôs servers is completely unencrypted, so if another player truly wanted to be malicious they could easy get you IP address.
---
Either way, regarding displaying your GT. Isn‚Äôt that for the most part universal across all multiplayer games on all platforms?
---
I'm really considering moving my pirate ship there
---
I love the "ding ding" of the buoy lol
---
How could they ban someone for crafting or trading ? Ingame features 
---
Thanks man! Ideally, i want combat armour too ;)
---
If you are on Xbox, my arch got bopped last night by some cunts. I‚Äôll give you some ammo or something if you repair it.
---
You will not be banned unless you cheat. The fact that you think you will banned for crafting just goes to show how effective the misinformation campaign by crybaby loser cheaters actually has been.
---
Let me clarify. Based strictly on demand, the prices can be anything a player offers but if you factor supply in the equation, that change things up a bit. 
---
Players are not making educated offers and only trying to beat out the previous person, everything in this game is run like an auction so your statement is valid in that sense. Sellers are not setting their own prices for goods and allowing only demand/offers to dictate pricing. This doesn't mean the market right now isn't inflated. Since the in-game currency is capped at 25k and is static, inflation exists if we are all having to spend more than the cap limit on gear and items. If the in game currency cap adjusted to the inflation, we wont have to grind so much more time for caps. So all in all we are indeed being ripped off. 
---
No team required, just simple programming. The type of simple programming you learn in your first coding class. A majority of other games utilize a username censoring algorithm.
---
so would ideal be combat unyeilding / bolstering sentinal gear?
---
I'd really like to be able to level up legendaries as well, I have a level 40 Grognack with the +40% swing speed, and that thing would be amazing if I could level it up, and I have so many examples like that.
---
Praise Saint Felicia, patron Saint of goodbyes
---
I will clarify.  It will truly create the economy by letting the buyers dictate prices, and showing a more true "Supply and Demand.
---
Players saying an item arbitrarily is worth 25k does not create the economy.
---
Having an auction house with no floor on pricing means the buyers completely dictate the cost of said item via player worth.
---
I like the variety of the cards, but I dislike the swapping. Loadout manager makes it bearable.
---
Me too for this one feel free to add me or anyone else in this thread to do it assuming OP has done it already. I‚Äôm on UK time evenings or this weekend 
---
InfraRedPS on PSN
---
That is it man, yes! Preferably heavy too haha, a lot to ask i know! 
---
For p2t
---
If you're on PC useing a game controller. Unplug/disconnect controller and go into controls. Find Push-to-talk and set to what you want ignoring preset keyboard key binds. Then plug/reconnect controller and you're set. I've done this using the space bar and it works for me. 
---
Hope this helps. 
---
I'm with you on the fallout lore aspect, but no one said it'd be a warhead type explosion...the meltdown would cause a nuke zone in a much smaller area...think of like...Poseidon / Poseidon workshop / Charleston Station being inside the ring...
---
Chernobyl wasn't contained to the plant itself...ask the residents of Pripyat
---
Do you scrap them for mods?
---
Semi-automatic.
---
I had over 100k shotgun shells, have 3 characters. But they were bought over time since game launch. No problems what so ever for me
---
Cool thanks
---
i don't want anyone to know my character's name is blurnt starmpsin.
---
The mystery one. I can‚Äôt remember the exact name. There needs to be more quest for sure but those two stand out to me, I guarantee the wasterlanders DLC this Fall will add human NPC. It hints at it with the title and the description saying there‚Äôs choice and consequence. 
---
Game tag: piallator 
---
Any time you're on, I will be happy to walk the wasteland with you. 
---
Level up and get carnivore mutation and cannibal perk. Have a few water purifiers at your camp. Easy peasy. Get 3 levels of lead belly if you don't want to deal with purified water-- drink anything.
---
You have to claim the chassis first. There's no recall if it's dropped or you didn't claim it by entering it first. Ultracite is crap anyway (imo). By the time you're 45-50 you'll probably be looking to craft x01.
---
Order of mysteries 
---
No lol, why would I?
---
The only one I can confirm is a random event spawn is the single nuke silo I have marked (will mark the others soon) 
---
I saw a safe, ran up to it, and was killed by about 6 mines going off at one. Have seen scorched guano there too.
---
Sounds about right. Level 5 Somerset does 50 damage with 50% armor penetration, while an unmodded level 15 handmade does 30 damage. Assuming you're shooting something with a bit of DR, the Somerset works out at 2.6x the damage per shot.
---
The Somerset will eventually be superseded by higher-level modded weapons, but it's pretty strong up to level 30 or so. If you want something similarly punchy that uses more widely available ammo then mod up a hunting rifle with hardened receiver and perforating magazine, but it won't shoot as fast.
---
You can't scrap Legendaries. 
---
recently i have been crafting hundreds of rounds of ammo for the handmade rifle and other weapons to sell and to replenish my stock as i go through t it so quickly.
---
The beta barely fixed anything is all lol
---
If you‚Äôve played any other mmo on PS4 you would know this is not true.
---
OOOOOO yes please. 
---
Well I did own the chassis beforehand. It literally gave me the notification that it was about to be recalled and that‚Äôs when it crashed.
---
Is that true though? Is X01 better than Ultracite? Looking around at the stats it looks like its DT is way better, but I‚Äôm not in endgame yet so I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs more important.
---
I sometimes try to find lower-level players to pass them off to as well.
---
wall of text..but i will try to read it
---
do you have a link to the confirmation?
---
Some home providers throttle you after a set limit. I've never hit it tho. 
---
Use the search bar. It was here multiple times a while back.
---
Serums
---
It does not have to always display your account name. I‚Äôve played a handful of mmo games on PS4 that did not always display your account name and displayed your actual character‚Äôs name.
---
Nice! Good info.
---
Oh I wasn't aware of that. Good to know.
---
Yes! No one in-game knows that my name is actually "BofaDeez", and it hurts my soul.
---
Yup my favorite is how they both buffed and nerfed heavy guns at the same time. Like who the fuck plans this stuff?
---
Not really, Bethesda never set any prices up. Supply, demand, rarity, etc are dictating the prices. Nothing else.
---
Of course everyone wants to sell items as expensive as possible to then buy sonething else really expensive with those caps. 2 shot explosive use to be 15 to 18 k, now you can get one for 2 to 3 k easy.
---
What you seem to be looking for is a new fallout where all items have set price and it would be illegal to sell at any other price then the price set by Bethesda?
---
I am ok with that. ER should be what mitigates energy weapons, not DR. They should be different damage/resist tables.
---
Like mentioned below if you have level 3 hacking and lock picking you can bypass certain areas. You can also pick up extra mainframe cores for the next run through. The quicker you move through areas the less likely you are to spawn multiple waves of robots as well.
---
10% damage increase. ?% decreased rate of fire...
---
 people can run a melee build with 10 trillion damage but my two shot handmade gets nerfed because Bethesda cant balance which effects should be able to stack. On its own two shot had enough of a weakness to validate its strength in its absolutely horrid accuracy. 
---
Theyre nerfing shit based on their broken PvP system and the complaint of players and it effects the people who dont pvp. Its okay theyre new to this, theyll learn that you cant just nerf everything people whine about eventually after they ruin half the game. Which sadly is all they have left because the other half is purely bugs and exploits.
---
Buff the other legendary effects and just outright get rid of the useless ones. Like melee weapons with +100% vats hit chance.
---
No aliens yet but they‚Äôre in the files. Maybe we‚Äôll see them down the road.
---
If their lives were being ruined then they should have just blocked him, by your logic.
---
Does the ammo reset after a while or do you only ever get the amount you find the first time?
---
Not at all, I meant as I'll personally look into what the status is on it and ask the Dev's about it. They have all the knowledge on these things- I as a single brain do not.
---
Wait.  Back up. 
---
Your luck is 25?  Wtf. 
---
And second. Do you really think that letting regen get to full has an effect?  That‚Äôs really interesting if so. 
---
"PS. I don't get why people buy games.  I have a crap ton of money, but I'm not ruining my fun by not programming it myself. "
---
How does that sound? Like real life, if you have more money than time, buy it. If you have more time than money, DIY. Don't judge someone because they do it different than you.
---
Agreed.  
---
The vast and overwhelming majority of legendary items that drop are trash.  Making them more abundant would at least motivate people to play more.
---
There are. There is just no way to penetrate ER but you can with DR
---
There‚Äôs no huge security flaw, related to any of this, but good waste of comment space.
---
Epic as in Legendary?
---
This game doesn't eat a lot of data. To put in perceptive what 10kb/sec is. It's 36Mb of data an hour. He could play fallout for 1000 hours on that plan. 
---
Yeah I never had an issue with the economy. I farmed all of my shit. I never had issues with being one shot even when battling SBQ beside known dupers. I enjoyed the game and was bored with it at level 67. I farmed and built all of my shit. So I don't share the same distain towards dupers even with server instability. And personally I can't wait until private servers so I can play with mods to see what can come from this game. The non vocal majority seem to not care about the vocal minorities opinion on dupers or modders. Most of us either change servers or worked around the challenge and had fun doing. The game play was/is fine some weapons and ammo types need a balance up not down. My biggest complaint was how easy and short the game was. At level 35 I was launching my first nuke and fighting the SBQ. end game content in construction power armor

It is pretty much Fallout 4 with buddies 
---
I like my mental image of a small hallway closet with a single rack and a rats nest of wires where the janitor has the only key to open the door and someone named Bob needs to put a 256MB USB stick in to update a game that millions love to play.
---
I know this is not how it works but it makes me go haha thinking of it.... not hehe, just simply haha
---
Also,  you can get multiple mutations per session no need to sever hop.
---
He used to respawn instantly for me...2x the XP, not 2x the loot though
---
Yes having a player set an item at 25k set the economy, if it sells, if it doesn‚Äôt then he will try lower until it sells. That‚Äôs how economy works, we are not in communist Russia.
---
What you want is a buyer market, basically everything dirt cheap so everyone has everything and can buy everything.
---
Unfortunately, I am on Xbox One, can't seem to find any Rp'ers here either. 
---
I WANT ALL THE MUTATIONS!!!
---
There's no specific order that you need to collect the logs in.  The Ash Heap is a fair bit tougher than the Forest, yes.
---
For the future, you can press space or the equivalent console button to manually recall the armor.
---
I would go west and do more forest stuff first. 
---
So unless I stumble on log 6 then for example, I‚Äôll basically have to wait a while before continuing the story?
---
And tell me why the buyer should dictate the prices instead of the seller? Tell me one exemple of how that has ever worked in the story of gaming?
---
Its an assault rifle? Are you on xbox? Ill give you 2000 caps for it
---
Nuclear meltdowns cause way more sage than nuclear bombs though
---
I sell them in Flatwoods and Sutton Station. I got a couple nice things there early on with my first character so once I was able to run WSGC and needed to bounce around to multiple vendors afterwards I started saving the low level legendries for them. 
---
The note says "these are the ghosts of the people who died instantly." That would seem to imply a nuclear bomb and not some sort of slow death like disease
---
anytime!! i have hundreds of hours clocked in to this game since it was released..lemme kno if u have any questions or need additional suggestions
---
It is an assault rifle but I am on ps4. Thanks for the price estimate tho.
---
I think that will help people understand how to help you. And it might be hard to consider, but I would start running checks and cleanings on your computer. I play on PS4 and the only consistent crash I get that isn't server wide is in Charleston. I'm not sure what's a common issue on PC is but this doesn't look like something I remember seeing on this board a lot.  
---
The fasnacht event is not slated to realease till the 15th I believe. It will most likely not be affected by the 1 day delay. 
---
Who else has been playing since BETA and still haven't ever gotten a legendary weapon worth keeping?
---
Did I wake up in November again? We get it, bugs everywhere. Now in breaking news it turns out that water is indeed wet.
---
I‚Äôve visited most places in the first already, I‚Äôve gone north to the acid looking lands with the fair grounds, now with some exceptions it looks like the ash heap and the savage divide are the next zones. But it does feel like to continue the story you have to wait a while and level up quite significantly before hand.
---
Lethal rad levels - only so much they can do for a nuke zone...maybe so many rads even hazmat suits still get a few Rads/sec
---
It's a bug and they're already aware of it. It was never an intended change. It happened when they made other items safe from the "scrap all junk" function.
---
bruh..please dont play any game for that long..that is not healthy
---
Actually never mind.
---
Yeah it was another game that my brother was playing couldn't even tell you which. I just know it ain't happening again while I'm on the same phone plan. Lol 
---
My camp is near here so I stop by to say hello about once a day. I have been having a glitch where his body instantly reappears in the water and I‚Äôm not able to loot his body. PS4
---
Is this game still a thing? After a few simple steps i had aprox 70gb of extra free space on my ssd. Never felt better.
---
Tbh I don't do it much these days, uni and work keep me to busy to play for that duration
---
Yep, same happened to me.  I explored and did stuff including events, etc in forest and up north before heading over to ash heap.  Did Charleston area and responders quest lines too, iirc 
---
Does he have the game already downloaded? Because that downloads for updates will eat most of it.  
---
Also only a 25Mbit plan? Isn't that extremely small even for a smart phone plan?
---
I thought so at first, but it never dropped any legendary.
---
It's crowned, and says "epic behemoth".
---
I meant yr left hand and yr right hand since to me, unarmed meant yr bare hands. I‚Äôve since looked it up and see that things like the deathclaw gauntlet count as ‚Äúunarmed‚Äù weapons 
---
Until I realized that the imagine was you looking back and forth between your left arm and right arm, saying ‚Äúyup the gangs all here‚Äù and then rushing into battle 
---
I did. Still do. If you already bought it no reason not to play it I say. Give it a try. It may surprise you.
---
Theyre not Bungie, its not going to be some dumb stand on the three vault boys left toes symbols while sucking off a horde of snallygasters while one guy hacks a computer style shit. God help them if they attempt it. 
---
But you dont lock part of your playerbase out when you already promised them they could play the entire game solo. I can summon a nuke solo easily enough, i can kill scorchbeasts solo. Eventually if it hasnt already happened two hundred times people will solo SBQ
---
I dont mean make it easy enough to solo. But if I want to walk in and try it solo dont tell me i need 3 other players to begin. 
---
The rad resist is what you want. Ah maybe a bug then. I lost a whole chassis of X01 recently after a disconnect. Someone else had a issue when the fusion core ran out. He said kept crashing the server. I think that's what happened to me too. I set out the x01 and excavator. Recalled the x01 (spacebar) and got in excavator which had a drained core. When moved it gave 2 server not responding and a disconnect. When logged back in it reverted a few minutes back and my chassis was gone.
---
Oh btw we laugh when see a guy in ultracite. We have a nickname for it but probably get banned here xD
---
Potentially.
---
Wow, like the Bar/Cafe area. I've been trying to work on something like that. Thanks so much for sharing. Now I need to find those Bar Stools you have for sure.
---
i love long gaming sessions..but i make sure im not just doing that only..my couch is the most comfortable thing in the world..but i even play standing up sometimes lolol so im not sitting the entire time
---
I used the same until I got my extra jets shishkabob. I have never looked cooler. 
---
ive only seen a rad storm once..which is wierd because they were pretty much common in fo4
---
Fusion generator is power for your camp. I use it as it basically powers the majority of my camp. 
---
Use the back gate to the lab and funnel them, it's better than getting shut in, although I can handle them regardless of level, it's just fish in a barrel this way.
---
Not saying your wrong been like 2 weeks since I grinded mutations. Did they change that used to it was 1 per

Gauley mine and deposits in the ash heap.

Dude this game is so awesome!yes it has its troubles but...awesome i tell ya
---
Im on xbox to
---
&gt; *2 shot explosive use to be 15 to 18 k, now you can get one for 2 to 3 k easy.* 
---
You made my point exactly right here. People realized that the price was too ridiculous and found other means to get the weapon thus driving the value of that weapon down.
---
Until there is an actual Index created for this poor economy then buyers and sellers alike can get an idea of what an item is actually worth. 
---
Fusion generator is the best camp generator in the game. Makes 100 energy for your camp. Can also get this for free by doing "powering up" events. Terminal is a camp computer that allows access to certain features for certain items like lights and powered doors etc. Connectors are how you connect power throughout your camp. Lights need to be near a connector to be powered and turn on. Fusion generator is better than large generator. Power armor stations lets you mod your power armor in your camp. 
---
Not when the armor on the suit is above your level.  Waiting the two minutes for the auto-recall is definitely the only way to get an over-level suit in your inventory.
---
who?
---
Fusion generators give you 100 power without setting up a ton of generators. I think it used to only be available from the "Powering Up" quests.
---
You do realize 2 outta 3 bugs you stated, are likely due to you amd your local situation, rather than the game?
---
Ill give the first one, but server disconnects have gone down greatly in the past month, and its more a question *if* it will dc you in your play session, whereas before it was *when* am I gonna get dc'd and how many times.
---
Alt tabbing is dangerous with any game, 2/3 times I get a black screen no matter the game if im running in full screen mode. The issue doesnt lie fully on fo76, any game can cause a black screen. Trying running the game in windowed mode, maximized.
---
And mobs rehealing themselves is the server/ your client being laggy and not updating properly. There is a short window where the client says, this player did x damage, than the server says okay they did X damage and updates the client, and the damage is applied to the mob. The grey bar is the damage your client thinks you did, if this exchange doesnt happen or happens too slowly, the server rejects that you did X damage and the grey bar turns back to white.
---
While i'm still halfway through the map and level 45 I found the grind isn't too bad. There were times i need adhesive, screws or springs but as long as I explore and do what i do i'll find what i need. I only really grinded for lead and black titanium, the former of which i'm sitting on about 1000 pieces of until i can get super duper. I'm pretty sure the Flux and other things become more of problem later on, but as with all Grindy games i've played this has been the most generous. 
---
If you want to talk about a grind, there is GTA online, where just to experience more stories and missions you have to grind out a ton of missions. It got to the point where i was no longer having fun just grinding out the same mission over and over and over. At least with follout so far i've been able to find what i need in standard play or short farming intervals. 
---
Have you tried it out? If you like using it I'd suggest keep it, it's a decent enough weapon. 
---
Me and my fiance are getting ready to! We're both mid 60 so I'm really glad to see that your levels are close to ours and you did it. Also thank you for the tips everyone who comments! I'll be storing those away for when we get our shot.

I know for a fact a lot of people left this sub because most of the posts are one like your telling a company that does not care that they are leaving, and generally bashing on Bethesda and the game. This sub is a literal circle jerk of people bitching about the same thing. It is toxic as fuck. I am all about constructive criticism, but I draw the line at bashing Bethesda and the people that still enjoy the game. 
---
My camps is on one of the nearby lakes so I usually kill him at least once per play-session.  The loot is meh but it feels good to kill the big bastard.    They really wasted a perfectly good opportunity to generate some sort of pop-=up event at that location.  
---
So your complaint is that you are to lazy to wipe out mobs to get legendarily to spawn. So you want Bethesda to do your work for you?  
---
Also what do you define as a bullet sponge?
---
Girl as in play girl characters or girls add in the real player?
---
The former, I play a girl char...

---
Fusion generator is just the most efficient power generator, you do not get cores from here. 
---
Terminals are computers you can hook up to lights and power switches. Not many players bother with them as their use is limited. 
---
Connector gives you additional power pylon-type options, this is useful for camp construction
---
Haven't tried it yet. I am honestly a low level and wanted to see if it was worth getting some caps.I hold on to it once I get to level 40.
---
The caddy one?
---
I'm not sure what the issue is. From what I understand, it sounds like you're saying that it's *costly* to gain xp, scrap, and legendary spawns, as opposed to them just magically spawning in front of you, and dying with a mere sneeze. I farm in some capacity almost every day, and literally always end up with the issue of surplus, not deficit in regards to resources. 
---
I saw someone suggest getting a Mutant Slayer's weapon if West Tek is your go-to. This is what I would suggest as well. Otherwise, I'd advise expanding your farming method and targets to otherwise easier locations. 
---
I've been upset about this since the beginning of the game.  It doesn't reflect the character I've been playing at all and breaks the immersion.  I had to change my user name as well.  I signed up with a generic user name, but when I'm playing a female character, it doesn't fit.  Hopefully Bethesda will change this soon.
---
5k atm
---
You'd maybe get 2k caps for it tops, but that doesn't mean it's a terrible weapon. It'll be good for you when you hit 40 for sure. 
---
Just wait until tomorrow, the update rolls out with bigger C.A.M.P. budget and the areas we can't build will become available, plus we should see that the C.A.M.P. will not take damage in Pacifist mode too. Sounds like a Win/Win to me, just wait a day.
---
Most people do what you're doing to get a few of the desired mutations then just buy the serums to fill in the gaps. Some of them really suck for certain builds so it's risky to keep RNGing them through radiation.
---
I wanted Bird Bones, Eagle Eye, Marsupial, Adrenal Reaction, Healing Factor and speed demon.
---
I needed 6. Then I "radiation farmed" until I had 3 of those, which left 3 more to get. 
---
I already had the recipe for AR from SBQ, so crafted and popped my AR serum, then went to Whitesprings Bunker and purchased the last 2 from the Modus vendor (don't forget Grape Mentats and Hard Bargain). 
---
Who X2
---
Look at it this way - you're building the future from what they left behind for you to find.
---
The current state of the market is a buyers market. The market subreddits are filled with "make me an offer posts". I have rarely seen any seller actually setting a price for their goods. They are letting the buyer determine the value of their goods. 
---
So it's literally the people who are complaining fault... are you joking???
---
I'm bashing a bad game after i supported it with a collectors edition purchase.  So i guess i can just shut my hole and go away.  Seems smart.
---
I though supreme court ruled it was allowed due to religious rights. Or at least that's what I read. Maybe it wasn't supreme court or just a local. 
---
Do you get Legendary spawns more frequently inside, or outside? I occasionally go there and clear the perimeter, and virtually never see a Legendary 
---
Ok, I make sure to give it a try.
---
Ultra-shiiiiny?
---
I did it a week ago,  collected a ton of toxic water,  chugging down,  repeat. 
---
It might be more effective jumping, but it is not necessary., I'm trying to get them all!!
---
On fallout 4 I used to just select the item such as a door or wall to then be able to walk through it then cancel, sadly doesnt work like that anymore haha
---
That doesn't work when you have multiple characters with different builds for team play.  My male character name doesn't fit my female characters name and so on.
---
As in a real girl lol! But I‚Äôd be happy to team up sometime if you‚Äôd like :) 
---
Crown merely indicates an area "Boss." An enemy must have "Legendary" in the name in order to drop legendary items.
---
What statline are you rockin ? I would love to try it now, just for sake, but I'm rockin a heavy 12/7/3/3/12/8/11 mutant build and I don't really know if it's usable or not.
---
Do it say caddy?
---
They could do it like Dark Souls 3 where you can go to the settings and have it as an option to show either the gamertag or the character name instead of forcing it one way or the other. 
---
Im so confused on the market at the moment cause no one will offer more than 1k on any outfit cause everyone is selling them all at the same time 
---
I‚Äôm thinking the asshole is the person that thinks others should ignore their free will and conform to your bullshit rules. I‚Äôm thinking the asshole is the guy who can‚Äôt walk a little distance somewhere else to use a bench and stash and whatever else. I‚Äôm thinking if I find you on PS4 you‚Äôre in for a world of griefing.
---
Hi I'm Bob!
---
That would be cool. I go around taking photos of camps I come across when roaming around. Makes for fun loading screens.
---
For me it depends on the game I'm playing, back when diablo had in game currency conversion I played about 8-9 hours every day
---
When archeage came out (both beta and full release), I probably played for about 11-14 hours every other day to max out as soon as possible
---
Have you used some or something? Ive got 6 of them at level 19
---
LOL Hes so preoccupied with trashing anthem right now but I am expecting another fo76 hit piece pretty soon.
---
Isn't that /u/gallowboob? 
---
The majority of your camp???  You living in a hadron collider?
---
How's your build compare Luckwise with your buddy? Just curious if that's a factor.
---
Also,  I've of the perks reduce the negative effect by 75%.
---
Still a good one. 
---
Engage in combat before entering or exiting.
---
Like 3k at most
---
I'll always pick them up to dump in well known locations like bins at stations and the ice box at whietsprings. Unless it's wood. Forget that.
---
To answer your question I'm 60 with a full compliment of the 1* that I like so I'm gradually replacing with higher * now.
---
You've obviously got no idea how development works
---
Ha! I just gifted mine away (at lvl 34) with a tear in my eye. It was my go to weapon for a long time, but I hadn't used it for a while.
---
I have it and I try to use it. But I totally understand the frustration...
---
I think the OPs point was more that the community is a weeeeeee bit schizophrenic 
---
I honestly want the team in charge of this type of stuff to write a novel or maybe screenwriter a movie. Their attention to detail and writing skills are so much better than half of the shows on Netflix today.
---
Named character Robert. If i make more I'll just use Rob, Robby, Bob, Bobby, and maybe even throw in a Roberta.......lol
---
Also increase the cap limits/day. If they want to keep giving me garbage 1\* legendaries, I need a place to sell them!
---
xD something like that
---
That just sounds like a big ass excuse though. The last one is her getting infected aint it. And if it isn't bugged, aren't there people who HAVE completed it? I don't even know. If nobody has completed it at all then yeah, maybe.

I want my character name to be visible since I'm playing a RPG. 
---
I also don't want everyone I meet to know the name of my account since this is bad security. At the very least give us a display name for the friends list.
---
THe Vampire machete is serrated.  I think it's medium speed.  
---
I dont recall the level..might be 15 - I've had it a long time. 
---
I have either 2 or 3 incisor cards and 2x marital arts cards for at least 60% armor penetration and 40% swing speed increase.  
---
And I got on a roll, so heres what else I've learned about some of my 1-2 handed weapons:
---
  Just for grins, I've tried out both the Instigating Guitar sword (2x damage if enemy is @ full health, otherwise dmg 90), slow speed, and the war drum (slow, 90 dmg).  
---
Other than the strangly satisfying sound effect when they hit, they are too slow to take out a swarm of mid-levels or even single high level (or my armor isn't strong enough) before said critters kill me.
---
The mole miner gauntlet does good damage (around 90), but needs repair much sooner than the others.
---
The furious fire axe I've had since I was a single digit - it is quite effective against 3 or fewer mutants to around lvl 30.  More than 3 of higher than 30, I'm probably sniping or using the death tambo.
---
THe L25 death tambo was dropped by a low level scorched at Path of the Winds, the 35, I found on te ground at an unmarked mole miner camp on the side of a cliff.  (Thought it was a bear trap at first.)
---
The VM was a gift from a high level, the war drum and iGS were dropped by enemies along the savage divide.
---
It has been deemed as a legally recognised religious head gear in some countries, unfortunately not here in the uk.
---
You are not wrong but nir am I.
---
What I meant was it isn't your crate to take. 
---
Sure, you have individuals like myself that have over a dozen vouchers, but 1) the drop could belong to a new player, and 2) why bother stealing a few measly items for yourself when they could go to someone who legitimately needs them? An individual with enough lockpick skill to steal from the drop in the first place (I'm unsure the level as I haven't had the opportunity to play since this addition) would likely already have enough supplies (or player skill) to continue without stealing.
---
Just order your own crate since it's so easy, man.
---
I've been making my bread as an ammo dealer. Buying and selling 5-10k at a time so I'm easily over the 100k threshold. Guess we'll find out tomorrow.
---
There's a mission where you go through a portal into a world with like the white frost where you need to run from house to house because being outside kills you. Was the most frustrated I ever got in the game tbh. 
---
I was thinking the same thing, like the savage divide would be crazy hot and the first would endure some winter. Cranberry bog would rain, that‚Äôs why I loved Zelda BOTW so much because you had to adapt to the area to survive as well 
---
Think i mighta found a piece, not sure yet tho. Combat unyeilding sent
---
It seems to drastically increase the drop rate of two and three star items.  Unless they regenerate they never seem to get the loot table for the better gear.  
---
Patch notes say "this is what we changed". You can't say that if you haven't changed anything yet. Talk about unrealistic expectations.
---
LOL.  Guy's such a click bait lying douche.
---
Yeah didn‚Äôt you know you could build those.. üòÇ

Genuinely liked some of his videos to begin with. Back when I had a thriving dislike for the direction that Destiny was taking, his dissections of the studio politics behind it and collation of information surrounding the game were enjoyable to watch. But then I realised he was just confirming my negative bias against the game and fuelling my resentment.
---
I‚Äôve then seen him copy and paste this trick to every other game that suffers a bit of turbulence and he just pisses fuel on a little forest fire, looking to benefit from people looking for an outlet to mitch and boan. The discourse surrounding this industry is pretty bloody toxic for the people who work within it and voices like YongYea just add to the dehumanising of them.
---
Full disclosure: Shortly after first discovering YongYea‚Äôs videos, I started working in the media production side of the game industry - so not affiliated with any one game studio or publisher but I do work with them. I think I might be softening in my old age and/or proximity to the industry but I find this barrage of negativity exhausting.
---
sent you a friend request
---
I concur.
---
Yeah, it was the "epic" prefix on it's name that made me think it could be legendary. Only mob in the game that I've seen with the title.
---
Also add in that if nobody fixes said power plant within the time frame it melts down
---
Ah!
---
Always happy to team up. 
---
Yeah the caddy one
---
A lot of people will tell you they play exactly the same. This is false. Going back to 4 from 76 was strange for me, everything just feels slightly off. Objectives are vastly different as well. I say go for it, at the end of the day it‚Äôs your opinion that matters
---
This is awesome!!!
---
Log out and back in you will probably have your armor back
---
If you‚Äôre not paying full price, have friends to play with, and like the fallout gameplay, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs worth it. 
---
Yes. If you are playing solo, and it sounds like you are, wait to go into the ash heap for a while. Do the responder quests and when you can tackle the Fireeaters quest, located in the ash heap, you'll be ready for the rest of the region. Please note, you need to have either Power armor, an environmental suit or at least a mask or you suffer various maladies in that region. I found the device to be a decent place to go after the forest, more so than the Heap

&gt;I'll take a Synth any day over Garvey.

My gamertag is xTRYHARDPLAYERx and I should be on around 4:30 central time if that works. I‚Äôm always willing to help out.
---
Keep me updated! Posted this on other subs. You are first still though for handmade, as you enquired first.
---
I called mine "Dutch VDL" as I was still in the middle of RDR2 when I created him.
---
That sucks man. The game is fantastic other than these bugs that completely break hours‚Äô worth of effort and energy. It‚Äôs a video game. I feel like it should not bring me this much stress haha. Which sadly makes me sometimes wonder if it‚Äôs even worth it if I might just up and lose something so huge to a bug.
---
Okay well that sounds like some good advice! Maybe it‚Äôs best I lost my Ultracite to not end up being one of ‚Äúthose guys‚Äù hahaha
---
I'd settle for any kind of paint - sprayed, brushed, rolled on lead paint, anything.  Doesn't have to be pretty, the shade of yellow is so loud.
---
That's why they would need to offer the choice to rename your character.
---
Or... just nerf the two that are causing problems... instead of having to change values on all guns. In my opinion, only things that need to be tweaked right now are melee and adrenaline reaction. It just sounds like you are a bit salty beth nerfed your god gun ;p I run a two shot firerate handmade I am exuberant about it‚Äôs performance both in vats and out of vats, pve and pvp.

---
I like these ideas and think they should be added but not for the Carnivore reason. I use Ionized Meat for food, I only have to eat one every 20 mins or so
---
I never thought about using the overly generous perk to make it a viable PvP weapon (so thanks for that!), but even without that trick that I'd say the handy blade is anything but useless.
---
With several points in Slugger, rank 3 Incisor, rank 3 Martial Artist, and the damage bonus from being over-repaired, my Furious electrified handy blade does something like 80 ballistic damage and 24 energy damage per tick, and since it ticks several times per second the actual DPS is probably approaching 1k. 
---
Glowing ghouls melt. level 68 super mutants scream in pain and die in 2 seconds. I can shred a lvl 80 scorchbeast in less than 10 seconds once I get the damn thing to land.
---
Buy only the serums you want from another player.
---
Honestly he's so annoying and pretentious
---
Correct. And having to wait that 60 seconds has cost me big time.
---
It's really random. IF you get a server that has a lot of legendaries there - wait 30 minutes and clear it again when it respawns for you. What myself and others have found is that legendary spawns are server dependent, and if you see a bunch in an area, you'll see them again when they respawn. If you have a friend you can just reload on eachother to respawn them. For some reason, after 3-4 respawns, they go from 2-3 stars down to 1. seems like there's some kind of measure in place to prevent repeated 3 star farming in a single location.
---
Yes you should.
---
the only game i played more the fo76 is ff12..but im sure i will pass that eventually..when 12 came out..i could not stop playing
---
It‚Äôs odd. Works sometimes for me
---
Depending on the quality of said star I still grab them for a bit to see if they might be useful. I'm lvl 142
---
My thought as well, if they turn this into a ‚Äòshoot all of your load at once‚Äô kind of weapon that‚Äôd be cool actually. I‚Äôll save up 1000000 cells and one-blow the queen. 
---
All the time! I am so glad to know I'm not alone in this. I play with my fiance and it's never happened to him.

DLC = Downloadable Content.  This qualifies.

patch &lt; DLC &lt; expansion.  I will agree that this is *nowhere near* expansion levels, I'm sure that's what you meant.
---
DLC is used too broadly these days to mean some major game-altering update.  Anything from micro-transactions to *actual* expansions are DLC, not just major overhauls.
---
Just being pedantic, but this might explain the downvote(s) you're getting.
---
Tried that 3 times.
---
Great idea. I would do a fridge too.
---
Hell, I've already seen a number of YouTubers posting updates like "DLC delay by one day!" Really, guys? Is this huge news? Patches/updates get pushed back all the time. Why the YouTube crowd is rushing to jump on this news is beyond me.
---
The best way to handle that is that the actual user name *with* the character name would show in the social menu, but the character name would show above thier head.
---
Oh OK. Thanks!
---
It looks like he used bookshelves, same way I do my counter for my CAMP store 
---
You're fine
---
I craft 1-2k 5mm almost daily
---
There is a lot of resentment about The price reducing so drastically in such a short time frame. And your comment could be seen as gloating about the fact you get all the stuff at a lower price. That is just my theory. I the tricentennial version for both Xbox and PS4. It does chap my ass a little bit that within a month the game was available for like $30. But it‚Äôs whatever. 
---
Read my reply to the Mutant Slayers suggestion.
---
Again this isn't me crying about not being able to clear out areas. I likely have far better weapons and armor than you. This is about my observation that other players are doing the same thing I do and avoiding clearing out high level areas with mutants and gutsy.
---
Have you not noticed all of the players farming Whitespring and Watoga?
---
Nobody is farming West Tek for XP.
---
Lmao that‚Äôs funny because your lack of knowledge about several PvP factors and my abundance of knowledge shows a clear area of skill. Skill in this situation coming as knowledge. Get some skill kid, stop crying.
---
Also, been playing FPS shooters since I was 9 playing quake on my windows 2000 pc. Judging by how you exude whiny salty bitch, I can confidently say I would wreck you in any FPS.
---
That was an example but you did just make my point though. If there are 20+ god rolled weapons/armor, then they really aren't god rolls and prices should be adjusted accordingly. I have personally seen people have the same exact weapon roll as the other and they paid out of the ass. Without an Index of the games economy, there is no telling what an item is worth. Although, the cap limit should be raised to adjust to those prices. 
---
I used it till like lvl 40 was a nice gun for a long time
---
Find areas with scorched. Tons of them carry shotguns. I gave away 2000 rounds of shotgun ammo yesterday. Find someone that is willing to trade ammo for shells.
---
LOL!
---
This is the problem with YouTubers. They constantly have to put out content to stay relevant and keep up the views or they fall by the wayside in the algorithm. This is why so many shoddy YouTubers post videos about literally anything and everything, and their quality drops over time.
---
Somebody was banned with an unconfirmed story? They all rush out to make 10 minute long videos about what *may* have happened.
---
A bug in the game that people are experiencing? MORE VIDEOS.
---
Minor patch delay? Gotta make a video!
---
It's getting annoying as can be.
---
With friends, totally worth it.,
---
There are a few bugs here and there, like every game in the world, but nothing major. There are a few things that are apparently problematic, but they involve issues with very specific end-game builds. Crashes are pretty rare on PC, at least, can't say about consoles. Progress is unlikely to get deleted as the game autosaves every 10 minutes as well as at certain checkpoints throughout each quest, as well as at level ups, so a crash can delete, at most, very little of your progress. Jerk players are of course another thing, no one guarantee you that they won't exist. But in general, the 76 community is very kind and griefers are not too many. Also, they game has anti-griefing methods bult in, and will soon add more, so griefing is something I wouldn't worry about. Personally, I have never faced a griefer, even though I am a low level.
---
Because that‚Äôs an event silly billy 
---
It's available at either sutton or pleasant valley shop. All the sack hood variants are.
---
Don't know why you're throwing dupers in with modders. You can mod the game as you please if you're playing private. If you want to import at 100,000 damage explosive machine gun via a mod, that's fine - it's your game experience. It does bother me when I work hard to acquire gear, only to have it become worthless because better itmes were duped and sold 10s of thousands of times on ebay. 
---
The wall will defeat you
---
I don't get it, just don't get it. Don't understand spawning at Vault 76 an walking down to Overseer Camp, doing a hunting run pretty much and someone just starts attacking me over an over. Followed pretty much all the way down. Slap damage is a joke, he kept at it and my health kept going down. I had to heal 3 or 4 times to keep from dying. So I just don't get it, need that much attention? I finally got in my Power Armor, knelt down and Fast Traveled away just to get away from the annoying player. I just want to see that all go away. Let them waste bullets or get tired of swinging, make me invisible to this type of situation. If we want to fight over a workshop, that's one thing. Or I can go to survival when that launches if I like. Until then, just go an Fallout!
---
That‚Äôs why you use 2 strong contrasting colors, for when one color matches the surroundings too much.
---
So that‚Äôs why white text with a black border works well since:
---
If the surroundings are white (very light), you can still see the white letters because of the black border.
---
If the surroundings are black (very dark) you can still see the white letters even though the black outline blends with the surroundings.
---
So you want COD Zombies in Fallout where you cant ever complete the mission? 
---
Also personally I dont think the servers could handle 200 enemies on screen with 24 people.
---
Not a bad idea just may need a few adjustments I feel. It would be nice to see enemy wave events. 
---
Actually most plans have a data cap, they‚Äôre just so high you never notice. My current internet plan caps me at 500gb/month but I never even do half of that 
---
Where is Evan?
---
The only way it makes sense, game-wise, is if it was faction based.  Server wide bonuses for a faction that "owns" the power plant.  The only way to reset the power plant would be overloading it, so you have to fight through a wave of security bots to get to the control room, start the overload process, which starts a timer to overload.  When plant overloads, it releases a burst of fallout.  Lasts 30 minutes, plant resets and ready to be re-fixed/retaken.  
---
186 caps on the fusion generator seems good.
---
Both times I found Graham, he has the fusion generator plan...240 caps I think.
---
I only have 1 hard bargain card equipped, charsma is low, and didn't bother with the mentat that lowers prices.
---
Have read you get the PA station plan when you complete miner miracles (for excavator armor)
---
Basically if you like 4, you‚Äôll like 76
---
I've crafted and used all the PA's and the x01 is all around better in my opinion. Especially after you add the legs mod to increase carry weight. I use the card to decrease how often it needs repaired and even when you do need to repair a piece, it's not very expensive. Use the "fix it good" card to repair to 200%
---
You only get the black screen while alt+tabbing if you're in true full screen mode. If it's borderless you won't get it. :)
---
Also i'm fairly confident it's not my internet connection. Speed test; over wi-fi, no clue where the heck their servers are located so picked ireland https://www.speedtest.net/result/8107355617.png
---
Besides that i **never** had any issues with my internet in any other online games. 
---
So it's because of me that the game freaks out on alt tabs and it's because of me that the server derps out... yeahhhh.... 
---
Looks in mirror, Trebor
---
Blackwater Mine is a decent source. The whole area is littered with acetone canisters, orange canisters, rusty canisters, brass miners lamps, fuses, a couple high powered magnets, a couple cooking pots, etc. All told, you can probably get 40-50 units of copper scrap.
---
Oh, and there's also 3 or 4 ore veins on the hillside between the mine and the WS train station.
---
It's clean, installed the game on a ssd, no issues with anything else. 
---
Tried to throw mirv to 1 shot SB in glass cavern once. It fell through the ground, bounced back and exploded in my face. Stop using them since. That was more idiotic than mirv fatman exploding in my face.
---
&gt; running in full screen mode
---
Yeah that will kill a lot of things.  I have a fairly beefy system, but I almost always run in borderless windowed mode these days to prevent Windows from pitching a fit.
---
I can‚Äôt answer how much it uses but it should be low. Understand that the only information being shared with the server is what players are doing, the game itself is loaded client side. Should probably be good, my downspeed is similar to his and I have no issues 
---
404
---
YES
---
The videos will help people help you
---
Yes, this suggestion is posted on a daily basis. Example #181638291 why this sub needs to crack down on duplicate threads 
---
there are a ton of trolly controversial names in game on ps4 anyway lol.
---
Nobody is going to hammer griefers for 5 caps. No it‚Äôs not bugged. The underlying design of the game is to promote griefing, no matter how they try to paint a different picture. Griefers can conduct their fun business all day long even when they have 10000 bounty on them and zero caps in account. Bethesda to lower level players: Die and get robbed or GTFO. Your only option is to leave the server. 
---
Yeah these little details could've made the game better.  They really shitted this game 
---
I‚Äôm playing hello kitty island adventure 
---
I stopped after level 120...
---
I go by a price per pound concept currently.
---
I just get the glowing blood, glowing/hardened mass and chems for selling.  Much lighter to carry around if perked that way.
---
I put that 1* trash in the icebox at the whitesprings clubhouse for those that want to hump that crap around.  Let the folks with more time on their hands sell it off.
---
I‚Äôd buy like all of these.  My own pet baby scorchies in a cage?? Yay!  
---
How is the budget? Sometimes if it's a previously owned workshop, you will have to scrap other people stuff
---
i honestly farm..but not really expecting much..i have 400 hours..no TSE drop..but when i first started playing..i really didnt mess with that many higher-level areas..i entered my first nuke zone at level 37...if i eventually get a TSE..that is cool..but i dont know when or where..if it happens..it happens..but im not going to be upset each playing session where i dont get a 3*.. yesterday i met someone that was trying to spawn the responder vendor bot..it was the first im ive seen the vendor..but the time involved in that server-hopping process is way too time consuming for me
---
I did this. Helpful üòÉüëç
---
It has nothing to do with players. The inflated economy has everything to do with the developers, it's like no one on their team has ever played an online game with an economy before. Let me explain all games with working economies have credit sinks or cap sinks in this case. You have to have more caps flowing back to the game each day then you have flowing out to players, or they lose value. A good ingame economy takes several cap sinks that players have to or want to use. This one has one and it's an option, fast travel. Some easy ways are instances or bosses you have to pay the game a large amount of caps to enter. A tax on items sold through player vendors, tax to the buyer and seller. Some player bound items that can only be bought from ingame vendors like a food or a drink that is better than player made, but player bound so it can't be duped. The list goes on.......until they have more credits leaving the the game than are flowing in each day the problem will only get worse, it really is that simple.
---
Thanks that's great info. I've been using a spear for a while. I think the first was lvl 10. Recently found a level 20. I'm lvl 34. No legendary effects though. It's medium speed. With my perks, I get about 65 or so dmg. I have been keeping my eye out for an upgraded weapon, but so far keep returning to my trusty spear. I don't come across them much in the wild.
---
Your info is good to help me sort perks, though melee is my close combat back up and not my main.
---
i heard the bloodied meat hook is one of the best weapons in the game
---
sure, lets just give everyone everything worth playing for in a month or two so everyone has everything worth owning and just stops playing because everyones characters are maxed out with the best gear... that sounds like a great idea!..... not.
---
grinding is grinding. rng is rng. yes better loot drops are motivating, but also sometimes stop you in your tracks as the item you've been wanting you already own. now what. rare drops are supposed to be...... rare. i know that sounds crazy.
---
I play on PC. I think that most of the issues you describe are seen more in console versions of the game. 
---
Server stability issues - Rarely see it. Maybe get disconnected once for every 20-30 hours I play. Can instantly reconnect. 
---
Crashes - Can have some issues at loading of server. Takes a few seconds to fully load items / camp etc and if you try to do things at that time the game can freeze up. These have become less of an issue lately.
---
Bugs - Yeah, there are some but none that really effect me much. I do have a cool pick with some purple rocks.
---
Progress disappearing - Never seen.
---
 Jerk players - Pretty rare. Heard this is more prevalent in consoles because of a younger player base compared to PC.
---
I enjoy the game and have had a lot of fun with it.
---
If you want some PC observations on game performance: 
---
I can only remember my game crashing twice. 
---
Since dupers and their duped items were removed, I have only experienced one server crash as opposed to the multiple I would get daily. It makes you realize that the big server instability complaints a lot of reviews had was not Bethesdas fault, but players actively destroying the system. 
---
I have maybe 400 hours playtime and none of my characters have been deleted or corrupted... Yet...
---
You learn many ways to avoid "griefers" as you go on. I live in the ash heap far south. They are ignorant to the wonders of mining, so they see no reason to head down there. There are also fewer workshops down there. It is worth knowing that workshops are PVP zones. If you take one, expect some bigger and badder people to come along and take it from you. Once I had a guy come along when I was low level start punching me in the face randomly. Normally you could just fast travel away and ignore him, but he was causing bleeding damage on me which prevented fast travel. I commend his ingenuity, but I just jumped off a bridge into water and bought enough time to fast travel away. I got tons of anti-player tips and tricks.
---
Also try taking all materials out of stash.
---
I had em all at one point. Except herbivore cause I had carnivore. It‚Äôs fun if you have the right things to make it work. 
---
are you on PC? If so, I'll pay 6k for it
---
&gt;v I can‚Äôt tell you how many legendary 3* deathclaws I have killed at WS and have gotten jack shit
---
really? even the regular deathclaws always drop something good for me..i only get frustrated when a weapon or armor is not included in their drop
---
I have a vampire machete and I use it regularly.
---
What are the damage numbers?
---
If you are remotely close to 40 and can afford the stash weight, and haven't been brave enough to do a post nuke whitesprings run yet, I'd say hang on to it just to see how well it works.
---
BTW, in case you dont know, the "vampire" part means it restores a bit of your health when the enemy is hit.
---
The Handmade unlocks at 15 and a stronger one unlocks every 10 levels after that.
---
Agree. I engaged (as level 50ish) with a lvl 60 bat and a mirelurk queen in the 70 (with minions) that was a tree star legendary to get a 1 star piece of crap.
---
Soo much for "legendary"....
---
Clear
---
Confirmed on your second part. Was the first time I experienced the infamous regen "bug" but it was 10000% due to lag. 
---
Finally someone that isn't attacking others but actually contributing to the discussion. Kudos to you. I completely agree with what you say. 
---
Nothing in stash
---
If that made any sense at all I'd agree with you.  Sadly, it doesn't.
---
But what does wearing the whitespring jumpsuit do that makes it worth 5k caps?
---
I never used my two shot weapon lol. Because of its shit tier accuracy. I used a non legendary hunting rifle and recently swapped to an instigating pump shotgun sneak build.
---
If they wanna get rid of god tier shit they should focus on exploits such as infinite criticals. 
---
Brother :D 
---
To keep track when you have multiple characters like a saved game file
---
Happened to me so many times today on Xbox, that and getting fully kicked out of the game. 
---
Even now trying to start a fight. Goddam man, pull your heqd out of your ass. The air's much nicer.
---
BLAHAHAHA
---
I‚Äôve encountered a bloated glowing ghoul named ‚Äòscorched wendigo‚Äô and he was carrying two legendary items (one armor one melee weapon). You never know what you will run into in the wonderland. 
---
Awesome! I mean tbh it doesn‚Äôt really matter, I just thought it would be cool to have a bunch of girls roaming Appalachia for a change! But if your character is female then I guess that works! I don‚Äôt want to discriminate haha!
---
I‚Äôll add you :) 
---
No, but I wish I had a checkbox to automatically reject party invites
---
I like Kefka's theme song and laugh
---
Every official fallout 76 sub is a literal salt mine of toxicity. Lol. As well as a few Facebook groups. 
---
I am really hoping that we will be able to scrap with the Legendary Vendor but currently nope. We can build better \*-ed weapons with the Legendary Vendor. I am hoping for big things with that guy.
---
You'd think there would have been a gift emote during christmas
---
You can go back every day or so to pick up more, but that's not really enough to use it frequently.  You pretty much have to convert it to use fusion cells if you want to use it often, and that nerfs the damage quite a bit.  :(
---
&gt;Right now if want an exact 3* roll on a ranged weapon you have a 1/2 chance of rolling a weapon over armor, approx. 1/80 chance of rolling the right weapon, 1/23 chance of getting the correct prefix, a 1/7 chance of getting the right major, and a 1/9 chance of getting the correct minor roll, but the odds of that are approx. 1/232k.
---
So? Use what you get, what you have. Yes I agree the chances to get any good 3 star is pretty low. But there's good reasons for that. Many of those are really really good, superior. You can't have so good stuff dropping a lot.
---
"Sometimes you just got to play by the rules of the game"
---
‚ÄúDoing end game content in construction power armor‚Äù and a few sentences before that you stated you were fighting the queen next to known dupers. And you actually think you were contributing to the fight and accomplished anything? No it was all thanks to the duper‚Äôs with all the best items and likely stacking bobbleheads.
---
And by getting to lvl 67 I doubt you even scratched the surface or even obtained one top end game item. Lvl 67 can currently be achieved in a few days of casual grinding. So you won‚Äôt be too surprised when your opinion has little value to people with real play time and experience with the game.
---
Usually happens when someone was in a team and the other members left. Making the game think you're still in a team. But you're the only member.
---
Interesting, what is the error it gives you or is it just greyed our?
---
The highlighted materials are being provided by the work shop.
---
Some of those plans are easily acquired without paying. You will get Fusion Generator and Large Generator if you do a "Powering Up..." event a few times. PA station you get by completing the Miner Miracles quest (making Excavator armor, basically).
---
Stimpak I picked up early on my alt, but I'm not sure how. May have been a random event reward.
---
So much better just to buy the right serums on the trade subs. Study the effects and get exactly what you want.
---
Maxed rifle perks and bloody mess shows as 69/68 (ballistic/energy) I think. And it's furious so it ramps it fast since it's hitting something like 10 times a second.
---
Roger that. I suppose if I have such crappy armor and weapons, and still manage to get multiple 3* items per day with no complaints, then it would be no issue for a demigod such as yourself. Also, I wasn't aware that you didn't receive xp as a result of killing mobs at West Tek. I guess garbage, inferior armor goes in tandem with inferior knowledge of the game. My apologies.
---
Pretty much...
---
Take the caps from me and send them to the abyss...If I want to jump off the monorail elevator to my death, so be it...
---
hello FF6 fan..that was one of the first RPGs i ever played
---
A mic does help. We had a lvl 200+ approach us in WS resort one day and she asked us to kill her and she assured us it wasn't a trap. I had pacifist on and didn‚Äôt feel like fiddling with turning it off, so had my bf kill her. And it wasn't a trap. 
---
Maxed rifle perks and bloody mess shows as 69/68 (ballistic/energy) I think. And it's furious so it ramps it fast since it's hitting something like 10 times a second. Also tank killer for sweet armor penetration.
---
If you have an accidental bounty I feel for you but it's not that bad.
---
If your bounty is there because you pk'ed another player,  go suck a bag of d's and suffer. 
---
I would actually pay atoms for some kind of "Meat grinder" camp defense item that would grind up anything that walked into it and produce an edible meat, I think that would be hilarious and awesome
---
It doesn't make sense to dupe that much ammo and not dupe a bunch of other gear. Yet all bethesda claimed was wrong was he had too much ammo. So, the fact that he didn't have a bunch of duped serums, or guns shows chances are he didn't have that much ammo. Not even mentioning the fact you can even see that bethesda miscounts by picking up wood with a new character and then putting that wood in a suitcase, then checking your achievements. The wood collected number will increase, then when you pull the wood out of the suitcase it will increase again, meaning they count the wood each time it ENTERS your inventory regardless of if it is something you dropped.

Ad Victorian Brother

If i get it, which i most likely will, its unyeilding sentinal ap refresh combat cheatpiece. Not sure aout heavy meduim light though
---
I think I saw one spawn in front if Whitespring a couple times with the same prefix. One would hope they would make such an uncommon mob legendary. 
---
Leg him with enforcer perk and a plain ole' shotgun. 
---
I get what you‚Äôre saying but I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre going to change that aspect of the game. During prelaunch they talked about the bounty system as being ‚Äúinteresting content‚Äù. They‚Äôre looking at it as a core component of the game. 
---
The best solution I‚Äôve found is, as you mentioned, getting on the mic and asking. 
---
That or get your bounty so high that it‚Äôs impossible for people to ignore. To each their own. 
---
Because that would make adding people even more difficult than it already is, that's why. Plus, you can't change your character's name yet, so you would essentially be forcing people to play with the random names they chose at the start of their gameplay (My currently female character being called "Alexander" for example).
---
Why can't Grahm be visible on the world map with a blip like players just a different color?
---
What annoys me the most is the fact you can still get a bounty on your head even with Pacifist tag on if you loot owned (workshop) container. I think Pacifist should prevent you from accessing it in the first place.
---
I still have yet to even come across one of the aliens! Where is his camp at? 
---
&gt; From a story perspective, why? Why would anyone be nihilistic enough to destroy our precious remaining infrastructure in order to create a nightmarish landscape?
---
Let's call it negligence. :D
---
Congrats!!!! Im still waiting for any *explosive* weapon to drop for me..i have soooo many hours at whitespring..i am due
---
I dont know if he does or not. Im on a 15Mbit plan and the game works most of the time. Id say about 98%.
---
There is also a graphics bug where they don‚Äôt look like anything has grown, but you can still harvest. 
---
Only excavator power armor is worth keeping because of its calibrated shocks carry weight. All other power armor is uselessly overencombered ap draining hell to wear.
---
Is it supposed to create another folder called [Fallout76Prefs.int](https://Fallout76Prefs.int) after you change the original to Fallout76Custom.int?
---
No.
---
Roger that. So to clarify, your experience has been that there is equal chance of them spawning inside as there is outside?
---
If they were being bothered then why did they not just block him out of their lives, mentally.
---
It makes as much sense as what you said, which is kinda my point, that it doesn‚Äôt make much sense at all.
---
Agreed, I hope they copy Diablo 3.  
---
Arguably there is.  
---
Anyone can see your login.  All they need is your password.  A lot of people use the same usernames and passwords everywhere (not a good idea).  So if an account was compromised somewhere else.. Then there are dictionary attacks, etc etc.
---
Making login names publicly available is a really poor practice.
---
It would be a lot of work, sure, especially if you needed "special ingredients" to make something. (Involving updated to loot generation, etc.)
---
I do think the item grinder theory is the path they are one, but tailoeing weapons for individuals would add a ton of richness and variety to gameplay.
---
However, they would need to solve the duping problem, and that is a far bigger fish to fry.
---

That's what I'd run if I was going for a pure bloody build with no explosive damage. I have a bloodied explosive harpoon gun as well though, so I run this:

*citation needed* I believe there was a case against Microsoft having to do with being able to track people who make threats against other players or file false reports "swatting" with the police. As a result it became law that account names must be displayed. That's not to say they couldn't add a second line with the characters name but to the best of my knowledge that is the reason.
---
:)
---
The health regen never changes the outcome for me. 
---
I leave bounties alone because all the ones I have seen are obvious traps or 5/10 cap mistakes. It's not worth risking my 245 caps against such small amounts.
---
The latest example I saw was a guy in a Mr Fuzzy outfit running around the queen fight with a 25 cap bounty begging for someone to clear it. I was curious as to who his partner in crime was so I lit him up with shotgun fire while in pacifist mode doing no damage. Someone else started immediately poking me with their deathclaw gauntlet.
---
I announced it to the area that I thought soandso was working with Mr Bounty as a warning. Several said they had already blocked them both.
---
Not possible, those two occupy the same effect slot.

Ps4 sorry
---
I remember seeing a comment from one of the Bethesda community guys saying its getting fixed in the update that should have been today but now coming tomorrow. Its not on the inside the vault article but keep an eye out for the patch notes. 
---
Of course, I get that.  I totally agree pvp is still broken and there are people griefing due to exploiting workshops.  But I've also seen others calling for no PVP in adventure, which I think is a mistake.  
---
3200 atoms
---
never cared once about the bad reviews..not at all..only thing that bothered me was the TSE nerf
---
Having the vendor wander is a terrible idea, I too hope they don't do that.  
---
If they're smart, they'll at least stick him somewhere and stake it out as the player hub, because wherever he ends up is where the hub will be.  
---
I don't recall the details, but there will be a quest line involving VTU to unlock the plans for the crafting bench, and after that there will be an assortment of daily quests you can complete to unlock new recipes. 
---
They're taking it beyond just the beer and liquor that's currently in the game,  and from the sounds of it the new drinks are going to act almost like short duration mutations in the sense that they have both positive and negative effects. One does something like add fire damage to your melee weapons at the cost of taking fire damage yourself, one has increased scoped stability and damage at the expense of VATS accuracy, etc.Also, some of them can be "aged" in a fermenter for a certain period of time to gain enhanced effects.
---
That's just the first wave of stuff, with more new quests, legendary vendor, legendary scrapping, etc, dropping every couple weeks through out the spring.

Here's the full roadmap:  https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-our-roadmaps
---
I read somewhere that it happens when you try to open your pipboy right after you load in not shur how true it is I haven't tested it 
---
Yeah.  I'm not an idiot.
---
Put 3 ranks in tank killer and mod the handmade with Armor penetration magazine. Problem solved
---
god no.  
---
Grinding for items is bad enough, now I am going to have a .0000000000000000000001% chance to get a decent legendary perk?
---
Could not agree more, though I am buying and selling there. The crazy part is the obvious duper sales. That takes some guts.
---
I'd keep that, amigo. Quality drop you got there.
---
you cursed person
---
no better than the trogs of the pitt
---
Dark Souls implemented this idea and do so very well. Allow the player to name the character however they so choose, while at the same time censoring it from others. There is a set list of letters or words, whatever, that will be censored, and therefor no policing is needed
---
I‚Äôm holding out hope that they give it a real buff someday or that they have something special planned for it.
---
The gun is iconic, I don‚Äôt want to believe they would intentionally make it so horrible as a gag
---
lab studies have shown that random rewards are about 118972369817623984720 times more stimulating than deterministic ones, 
---
Well, ofc, you can label everything into DLC. Technically this is no longer 1st DLC. Everytime they added new content to Atom store can be considered as DLC. Take a ESO, Thieves Guild DLC. It adds new dungeons, new story, new styles, new characters, new gear- this is what DLC is online gaming. F76 adds what in DLC? a brewing. Referring to this update as DLC is same wrong as referring to Tetris Battle in Facebook as MMO.
---
You‚Äôre still on this subreddit? A simple click could solve that problem very quickly for you. And for the many of us who still enjoy the game
---
Mines been doing it today without loading the pip boy up, I just put it down to it being buggy since the update is coming out tomorrow. 
---
What is coal even used for?
---
My question is: if you murder someone, you should get wanted status, right? What about the rest of your team? 
---
That‚Äôs where you are wrong. The reason why the prices went down is not because people realized the price was too high, it‚Äôs because those items were dupped so many times that people were selling them right and left for lower prices each time. 
---
Economy should never be dictate by the game developpers unless there‚Äôs no trades or sells between players.
---
anyone else notice that a lot of non-legendary glowing ones drop legendaries?
---
&gt;Your luck is 25? Wtf.
---
Unyielding gives at max 3 more specials per piece. So you can have 3*5 boost to all specials except the endurance, about 20% healt or whatever the limit is.
---
I think quite a few people think luck doesn't influence drops.
---
Finally got a decent legendary hunting rifle earlier. Two shot.
---
Level 20...
---
Are you a pistol specialist or something?  Have you not farmed Whitesprings Golf Club at all?
---
I've got a list if duper. They do it daily. 
---
A lvl 8 player isn't going to have PVP gear and you know it. He also isn't worth killing for caps. If you are repeatedly killing him over a workshop, you are just being malicious. Would YOU bother killing a lvl 8 repeatedly considering it probably costs at least 4 times what he's worth just to contest the workshop? If you would you must be broke a lot and really bored. And the reason this dude initially had a bounty was that he used the type of melee build that can do it to kill the low level guy through his slap shield. He had a bounty when I killed him the first time, the second kill was really just out of curiosity and because he was being an ass who needed a bigger fish to give him a taste of his own medicine. No bounty, I don't come looking for him, and he doesn't lose all his shit. His loss was a direct result of his bad behavior.
---
Okay, so I tried it.  I hear a faint click when it activates that isn't there when the mutation activates.  But it's down below the level of the ambient sounds - it's really quiet, much quieter than footsteps.
---
Now is the difference I'm seeing because my PER and AGI are so high?  Is it because I'm running on PC and maybe you're not?  I don't know, but my noise is not noticeable or even audible from any distance.
---
r/gaming
---
Thank you so much for the thoughtful reply!  I know I'm kinda asking a fisherman why he likes tuna here (that's not a real phrase. I'm making shit up), but this is the sense I've been getting from lurking around this sub as well. 
---
Thanks bro! 
---
Looking at the list I know for a fact there are a few missed ones.  
---
Example near the "Chinese Temple" or whatever it is called up on a cliff is a rocking chair overlooking.  
---
You feel like you'll fall off the cliff if you try to sit in the chair.
---
I‚Äôve been asking for this since day 1. It doesn‚Äôt seem as much of an issue now for some reason but still sometimes you can‚Äôt give shit away because they don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre trying to do :(
---
I'm not even mad about it anymore.  I would hate to see others weapons get nerfed as hard.
---
... if so many people ask for items, prices will go up if there is not enough supply.
---
I don‚Äôt think you get how a game economy works...
---
i think that instead of a base modification why not the ability to make baits. The baits could even be for specific creatures and require varied materials. they could even be crafted from the campfire or chemistry bench.
---
Just a red crossed out circle on it and cant place it
---
White springs golf club, i levelled up from 25 pretty quickly there. Maybe avoid it if you jump into a nuke zone. 
---
That would be so good! I can‚Äôt be bothered to get them for myself anymore but I‚Äôd do it for a new player 
---
Exactly. Haha
---
Oh yeah... I almost never get workshops so I forget lol
---
I think the RNG drop is a neat idea actually. All other fps games I‚Äôve played are the same structured unlocking system that unlock weapons and accessories as you level up. It‚Äôs nice because the rewards are predictable. But then it lacks the surprise element that fo76 has. What I don‚Äôt like about fo76 is that the game would let you fight a 3* creature (harder to beat) but only reward you a one star item most of the time. And often times it‚Äôs something you‚Äôve already had, such as recipes and plans. This is just completely lame and unacceptable, and a waste of everyone‚Äôs time. At least make sure a 3* drops a 3* item and it‚Äôs not a recipe that‚Äôs already learned. 
---
I have made so many caps defending my accidental bounties. I accidentally get them while purposefully murdering workshop owners for their loot. 
---
I once turned a 50 cap bounty into a 2000 cap gain over two days. I am not even exaggerating.
---
Last night I got a 10 cap bounty for blowing up a car at someone else's workshop. It was behind the player I was shooting; oops! Anyways, I saw an obvious 5 cap bounty baiter in flatwoods, so I decided to pay him a visit. 
---
I figured I did not have much to lose. He was just standing on a roof, menacingly. I unloaded a maximum range automatic vats critical headshot volley and he lost only 70% of his HP. Wow, that never happens. I followed up with my shots to the face for zero damage deal. Ah, he is using sentinel/assassin gear. I swapped to the gamma gun and forced him to run or fight. He rushed me down and managed to get him with my vats volley at a better range. He came back to claim my bounty and failed to one shot me. I killed him without a bounty for 200 caps. I told him I eventually wanted him to kill me, but only after I got as many caps as possible from him. He told me off and refused to clear my bounty. 
---
I invested into 90 more caps worth of bounty by destroying a few of those cheap cardboard vault boy cutouts someone had at their camp to entice more people to hunt me down. A level 150 and his low level friend showed up to take me on. The low level guy drew my attention from lvl 150 dude, but my damage still too high. Eventually, 5 people surrounded me on the roof. They just watched me while I waited for lvl 150 guy to try again. The lower level guy switched to his high level bloodied sneak character and finally one shot. His character was bugged out and completely invisible, no shimmer from a stealth boy, but even then I would not have been able to retaliate fast enough. Maybe I could have slapped him to death, but that would just be more bounty.
---
My point is: I see these accidental bounties as huge opportunities to gain caps against anyone who cannot outright one shot you.
---
Graham is not really rare, and people even share commonly it's location in trading places. But that other, roaming responder bot, that is fairly rare, and it can so easily get killed too.
---
Not a good analogy.
---
Beauties in the eye of the beholder m8
---
Prestige worldwide
---
I think if we had a small area not the full map it could handle it. They could name it Fallout Ghouls and your only mission is staying alive.
---
make me an offer doesn‚Äôt mean he will sell it at that price, it‚Äôs to test the water, have you ever bought something not in store in real life? The peices are set by the buyer, if he doesn‚Äôt dell he adjust. Not the other way around lolol
---
I need it for crafting mutations that i sell to people for caps
---
Yea, IMO not worth it if you can't be on alot. I lost my workshop at a small farm literally an hour after I left it alone with a ton of defense.
---
At level 20 you can go farm super mutants up in the Toxic Valley, they give decent XP. Or walk around Morgan town and kill the Ghouls. It's slow going without people power leveling you, but it's honest. 
---
I mean I'm watching, compiling a list by the way, not receiving duped items. They have numerous legendary weapons, of every kind... Junk, and it's cheap. There's 6 I know of at the moment. 
---
Right it's always fun when you accidently hit a Whitesprings bot.
---
I usually just use my mic to tell them I have gifts.  Why not do that?
---
I use it for crafting mutations
---
No actually, I have a hazmat suit. The problem is j don't know if I can kill the level 42-91s. (That's the lowest and highest I seen there)
---
I then sell them to other players for caps
---
I detect lethal levels of sarcasm
---
I have to agree with you on one thing, pvp is very wonky at the moment. And the discrepancy between player‚Äôs abilities are quite high (don‚Äôt think it is such a bad thing but should be looked at) the problem I have with pvp is it is not intuitive or informative. A lot of the time I don‚Äôt know why I am not doing damage or why my enemy is regening health, or why they are doing so much damage to me and I not to them ect. I feel like more stats and stuff would be nice
---
&gt; Theyre not Bungie 
---
Reason F76 sucks. They should take more from Bungie playbook. This is online game and should be about people interacting (in negative or in positive way) with each other and not be playing game like it was single player game. Want to play alone solo, there is genre for it. It is called single player games. 
---
You're being disingenuous.
---
r/fallout hates this game and anyone that doesn't spend at least six hours a day telling everyone why they hate it ad nauseum.
---
How many luck bobble heads did you eat in order to get 25 luck? ü§Æ
---
i was at flatwoods the other day..seen a level 3..ended up on my team..gave:
---
* crafted 10mm gun
---
* 100 10mm
---
* 350 .38 ammo
---
* marine wet suit
---
* vault tec jumpsuit
---
* other apparel
---
* a modded level 5 rifle (hardened receiver/glow sight circle/suppressor
---
* so many aid items
---
* opened up their map by bringing them to whitespring/harpers/summersville
---
they jumped several levels in about an hour and a half span
---
The fo76 bounties page is brutal sometimes. There‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm attempting to properly tag it as I‚Äôm on mobile and I‚Äôll do something wrong and never live it down.
---
Damn that‚Äôs beastly. I think mine is furious too actually. Will have to get the rest of the rifleman perks or transfer it to a new character one of the days to see its full potential 
---
If I wanted the workshop and he kept attacking it? Yes. Some people actually want workshops. Especially if I'm already invested in a server, and I want to take 4-5 workshops and I've already taken a few, I would definitely be willing to pvp over a workshop. It's literally what they are for. 
---
Bounty doesn't mean a lot. Accidentally shoot someone's camp when you're aiming for a ghoul at whitesprings? Bounty. If he stepped outside of the workshop boundary for a second while pvping and hit the guys resource extractors on accident? Bounty. I'm not saying you're in the wrong for killing someone with a bounty - go for it. Just don't assume that bounty = evil griefer.
---
Yes. I run a full Unyeilding set +3 to all stats except endurance at low health. With my natural luck at 9. I block my health below 30% with rads so my strength is always around mid to high 30's.
---
&gt; It makes no sense to me why there are even stars on enemies. Why not just have legendary enemies and then they can drop whatever? 
---
The stars indicate how though the enemy is. Most max level one star legendaries can be one shot. Do you want to have no indication of how strong the enemy is? Or do you want all legendaries to become as weak as one stars are right now? Or all be buffed significantly?
---
Queen is kinda irrelevant since it's special on it's own.
---
Um that's what r/fo76 is. Filthy casuals was created to get away from what you seek. 
---
Oh... those ones probably are...
---
Nice get!! Super Jealous!
---
The power armor station plans are a reward for completing Miner Miracles. That's at Garrahan Mining and you build excavator power armor.
---
They can‚Äôt go back on it now. The entire database is already built and filled with data. They can‚Äôt just add another field to it now and somehow magically fill every entry with a unique identifier.
---
Duping will likely exist for a very long time due to the instability of this game‚Äôs netcode. And trust me it definitely has to still exist. Just yesterday I asked a guy how much for a rifle and he asks me ‚ÄúThis one? -Insert weapon name- (6)‚Äù with the (6) part I‚Äôm assuming meaning they have 6 exact copies of that same 3* weapon.
---
Leave it a few minutes before you run in, when I was a lower level they use to spawn in at level 9, especially around the houses. I mentioned the nuke zone as the bloated glowing ones take a lot of effort to kill and tend to spawn in at higher levels. 
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox, I live in England and would be happy to help :) 
---
For west tek? honestly it's a bit rare in general. I've definitely seen plenty of both, and if you're on server, might as well clear it all.
---
Watoga is a fairly good area thanks to forever spawning robots
---
Does the perception perk card awareness work on players?
---
Don‚Äôt be afraid to die, you‚Äôll get way more xp for killing enemies above your lvl. What kind of build are you running?
---
I mean who wouldn't buy a baby scorchbeast. 
---
I hope they fix it soon, one of most anoying things...
---
But you don't have to be stupid and go PVP with all your farmed junk in your inventory. There is no reason to do THAT. And I would be careful mentioning mule accounts. Bethesda doesn't like those, because all the extra stuff being on them in the game world is hard on the servers. Pretty sure that's the next thing on their ban-or-remove list.
---
Only if you are specializing on a VATS crit build.
---
I‚Äôd imagine it is delayed so they can address the duplication Glitch.
---
It seems like no one else was going to tell them.
---
I am not so sure about that. I think the stars may be random on spawn. I have killed many 3 stars only to be greeted with a 1 star upon respawn. I suspect it can work both ways, making it worthwhile to clear the 1 star for a potential 2-3 star spawn.
---
Thanks! I'll try it out.
---
It would be nice to be able to pay our own bounty, but the next question would be what to do with those caps???  Here's a thought, use those caps to create a "Bounty Kitty" and enhance the Watuga PVP Event loot to include payouts from there?  The "Bounty Kitty" totals would show up when you joined the game so then players can see if its worth hopping into the PVP servers.  If you want to PVP go there and beat each other up to drive the Kitty even higher.  Then when the kitty reaches a predetermined threshold the Watuga HS Event would trigger.  Whoever wins gets the kitty.
---
And those of us who don't give a crap about PVP can just be left alone while you guys beat on each other. 
---
For a level 20 who's "bad at combat" that's basically a suicide mission.
---
&gt;Do you want to have no indication of how strong the enemy is? 
---
Yes actually, that would make a whole lot more sense. That way, everyone wouldn't scream at the top of their lungs that there is a three-star over here. It wouldn't make people have to compete. Because no one would be able to tell which one is strong and which one isn't
---
TBF this sub fluctuates on about a monthly basis
---
Have a TSE revolver of some sort (western or the other one). Lives in stash waiting for legendary vendor update.
---
Then theyll need to have some form of matchmaking to put randos together in a group. Dont forget early Destiny 1 was an absolute pile of ass
---
I always just put the doors on last
---
I'm not sure your tiny brain is capable of understanding this, but Fallout 76 is a _video game_.  The person who was the "victim" of this "vicious homophobic attack" could have ended it by blocking the players who were teasing him.  He admits he switched servers and they didn't follow him.  He's just an attention whoring SJW who bought a game with PVP and then wants to whine that people role-played assholes and tried to kill his character.
---
Hello hello a UK lady here please be my friend haha.
---
GT - Lrnbnn üòä
---
&gt; That‚Äôs where you are wrong.  
---
I sure hope you realize that isn't an argument or dick measuring contest to see who's right. This is just a discussion and with that kind of elitist attitude it makes this discussion difficult. 
---
&gt; The reason why the prices went down is not because people realized the price was too high, it‚Äôs because those items were dupped so many times that people were selling them right and left for lower prices each time. 
---
Its like you're agreeing with me just in your own way. Whether or not the duping was caused because of high prices, it caused the value to go down and thus lower prices.
---
Get cranberry cobbler or relish, use the bed rest boost, and hit the mutants. 
---
Then YEE HAW
---
The pistol doesn't kill, people kill using the pistol.  
---
Many drills and syringers from 3* Legendaries, it‚Äôs the norm nowadays although Bethesda claims they removed the drill from loot list in a previous patch. 
---
I would be happy to see some "foil rare" perk cards, even if same stats.  Animation instead of static etc.
---
I have a IE 10mm pistole max lvl 2* if Intrested 
---
Even if this were true it could still take you up to 40 tries to figure out their PIN code, and that‚Äôs if you were getting each number correct based on the sound as you presumed in possible.
---
That‚Äôs a lot of time and effort to get in someone‚Äôs camp. There‚Äôs much easier ways to get in, like ask the person, or blow the door up.
---
yes, this sub is the one which you seek..
---
filthy Casuals is for Filthy Casuals.
---
This sub is for everyone else, like you.  So please, do rant and complain about everything you feel is wrong with this game and the people who play it and the people who made it.
---
Luckily you have let us know what your intentions are so i can block you so i wont have to read your impending sodium depositories.
---
have a beautiful day!
---
bye bye!
---
Unyielding/bloodied build bebeh. And I'm level 178.
---
Sounds good
---
Hahaha yes! I‚Äôll add you :) 
---
Absolutely.  I'd also say, if I'm in Pacifist, I never want to have VATS lock onto a nearby player over a Scorchbeast.
---
Not to mention the security concerns of sharing your account name publicly like that.
---
Yes, as far as I am aware. Only problem is you don‚Äôt see if they have serendipity, emergency protocols, sent/cav, and the many other damage mitigating addons that could be playing into effect that don‚Äôt factor in base defense 
---
Good idea. I have some toxic water muled away. Haven't got around to figuring out a good use for it.
---
Nah u/gallowboob is the human form of anal fissures 
---
Well I‚Äôm in power armor all the time, maybe that‚Äôs why my luck can‚Äôt go higher than 15 
---
You're hilarious 
---
I bet you played wrong and are in wrong zone. There is no reason to high level players to be in Toxic Valley.
---
Already been discussed and is on the table. But, I'm definitely sure that "assmate" is lore-friendly and so welcoming to other fellow vault dwellers. Maybe the scorch beasts appreciate it.
---
Yeah, he's got the same rep over on /r/AnthemTheGame 
---
Agree. Finally can reliably use them!
---
That was the entire purpose of my post. In order to get the 3* to spawn the area needs to be wiped clean. As a level 200 I have zero interest in clearing out an area like West Tek or Harpers Ferry if the only thing I see is 1 or 2 legendary. 
---
I often find myself at the Whitespring only to find that all of the ghouls have spawned as level 22. I clear the whole resort even though as a level 200 I have zero incentive to do so ......I do it because it is effortless. 
---
Ultracite ammo?
---
Thanks for the offer! I'll look for your name to come online.
---
That's a good trick - shooting someone in Pacifist to see if it draws anyone out of the woodwork.
---
They should have become Wanted, but with the Workshop mechanics, who really knows what's happening, much less what's supposed to be happening.
---
The lack of any sort of instructions from the developer, and even the $30 book I purchased that's useless due to all the changes introduced since launch, it's just one big guessing game for the most part.
---
Most Griefers have learned to use the game mechanics to their advantage, and if they were clearly understood by all, it would hurt their feeble feelings much, so Bethesda prefers to keep us in the Dark.
---
Also If they explain how it's supposed to work, then they would have something else to fix.

---
I'm far from done üòÄ
---
I'll be adding a lot more later today.
---
Personally I'd say if you like fo4 it's worth maybe $30.  
---
The game is very similar to fo4 and there is a story including (robot) npc's.    
---
For me personally I fond the lack of endgame activities to be the deal killer but I got my moneys worth.  They are planning to add a ton of new content and features down the road so hopefully the game will improve as time goes on.
---
 My Western Revolver hits at 98 and with the Reflex sight I get head shots all the time. It kills stuff pretty good for what it is. No AP is its biggest problem.

Gotcha, thanks.

---
I doubt normal ammo is considered ‚Äúrare‚Äù it‚Äôs the ultracite ammo that seems to be flagging people‚Äôs accounts.
---
I'm guessing it's the way it is so most people give up on getting specific weapons, and play with the best of what they find. More varied playstyles.
---
On console you use your email to login, at least on PSN. 
---
Making login names publicly available is not poor practice, making a login system vulnerable to a brute force dictionary attack is poor practice. 
---
Because the brute force attack is the problem, not displaying usernames, I know it‚Äôs common Bethesda practice, but you don‚Äôt fix a problem by simply avoiding it.
---
Lmao so true
---
&gt;So guns and armor are unstackable.
---
They are now. They weren't before. When the change came, about during first month into release, existing stacks didn't get automatically collapsed. I had lots of stacked marine tactical helmets, but when I moved them around, the stacks broke off. But the patch didn't collapse them, it only made them not stack anymore.
---
&gt;The dupe would create more than one of the item but it occupied the same inventory slot thus stacking it on itself.
---
Uh say what?
---
&gt;under the wrongful impression that duped items have been removed and I'm just trying to reduce misinformation here.
---
Sadly they are. Only large single amounts of dupes were deleted. All other dupes have been spread all around and continue to exists. But it doesn't seem you are full on point either. Stacks was no requirement of duping. Duping might have influenced that change, but it continued to happen well after.
---
Aaah ok , thanks for info
---
Claims it‚Äôs a known fact can‚Äôt provide proof... gotcha!
---
I'll ad all of you guys, I appreciate it immensely
---
I must go explore now, the baby is asleep
---
Was announced yesterday that it is postponed 'til tomorrow the 13th.
---
That could be fun as well, but I'm really looking for more useful CAMP building options.
---
It was pushed back one day.
---
Do all the events you can find in the forest and toxic valley. Most give 25-400xp for a few minutes of work, and many of them have a chance of giving you decent loot and/or a legendary creature who might drop a level appropriate legendary item.
---
Also, capture workshops. You get a couple hundred XP simply for claiming it, and you get a couple hundred more for completing the defense event that pops up a couple minutes later. You also get a decent reward of chems, junk, and CAMP plans.  If you're worried about getting griefed, build a stash box and crafting bench as soon as you claim them so that you can scrap everything and stash it. If someone comes to contest your workshop don't bother fighting, just server hop and claim it again.
---
Indeed.  At least if or until they change how Pacifist works at CAMPs, a keypad is no more secure than anything else, because someone can easily bash down a wall.
---
&gt; make me an offer doesn‚Äôt mean he will sell it at that price, it‚Äôs to test the water 
---
So who's setting the value of the said items when testing the waters? 
---
&gt; And tell me why the buyer should dictate the prices instead of the seller? 
---
You are just all over the place are ya? 
---
&gt;  The peices are set by the buyer, if he doesn‚Äôt dell he adjust.  Not the other way around lolol 
---
Why are you contradicting yourself?
---
He needs to take care of his own radioactive barrels. Geez.
---
Just want to say that there are far better games out there for your money. But if you insist, the game can be enjoyed. The early-game and mid-game can be fun as you plan out your character and build and get the best gear. Once you get to the end-game though (by end-game I mean end-end-game), you will start to see the shortcomings of the game and will start to experience the game-breaking bugs that few care about in this subreddit. For example, mutations and their interactions with perks are riddled with bugs (I, a lvl 193, can't play the game without power armor with emergency protocols due to those bugs, else ill be one shot), some explosive legendary weapons still don't do consistent damage to scorhcbeasts, heavy weapons still don't shoot properly when close to an enemy, assaultron head still depletes all your fusion cells instantly, and many more. Add to that the imbalance between builds and lack of content.  Also, the game's narrative is dog-shit (the way the story is communicated) and most locations are beautiful but empty shells. The roadmap is already not on track (as they delayed the FIRST silly content drop). We haven't even reached the elaborate complex updates and they need more time. Fallout 76 is a mediocre game with moments of fun spread throughout. Make a choice.
---
You know you can do a quest to get rid of it right? At the Wardens, at the Penitentiary? 
---
Ahhhhh. PA is not worth the stat loss for me. 
---
Then why not traps to capture creatures for their meat?
---
Ive had this happen alot on PS4 unfortunately
---
Not everyone has area chat on
---
The level is not random. If you don't want to see low level or mid level 3 stars, don't kill such enemies.
---
If you craft/trade over 100k ultracite ammo in 30 days it‚Äôs very likely your account will be suspended until they fix the duping exploit. I‚Äôve seen it happen to a few honest traders now, and it sucks because there was no warning from BGS that you couldn‚Äôt trade in these amounts before the ban hammer. 
---
Just stick to normal ammo and you‚Äôll be fine, if you want to craft/trade ultracite ammo make sure you don‚Äôt do more than 100k in a 30 day period. Any casual players will not even have to worry about this at all. 
---
Look for it yourself. Not my job to babysit you.
---
if you did next to no damage to him he could have been running sentinels assassins armor, best way to kill them IMO is to run a high firing rate gun and use a staggering perk (like one gun army for heavy guns) 
---
i was able to almost constantly stagger one guy running that gear, since staggering does not count as standing still
---
Explosives became much worse when Bethesda nerfed Demolition Expert with the TSE patch a while ago. I'd suggest waiting untill Bethesda fixes them.
---
Here's a reddit post talking about it:

---
That's a weird bug, but you might get lucky and not need it. Check the junction box next to the food processing terminal. If someone has powered up the nuclear plant it should be putting out enough juice to power everything on the farm, so you'll just need to string wires. 
---
Bloodied melee is rediculous, my super sledge can do 3000+ damage with the right buffs and perks equipped. Plus I run fireproof and Dense so I'm basically immune to explosives. 
---
I don't have a *lot* of armor though, and very low health so if you manage to get in a few good hits (especially if marsupial jumping around like a maniac) you'd probably win sometimes. 
---
BTW, the sniper rifles I mention were found laying around at some location in the forest.
---
I, too, hit Welch looking for the log at level 15. I wouldn't recommend picking up the Welch log unless you've got some stealth boys (and a change of underwear) handy. &gt;!The log is in the kitchen of a house with a static spawn of three high-level supermutants battling a deathclaw!&lt;
---
Sounds like the shop is bugged.
---
a @#$@#% molerat was attacking my Brahmin at my base, and @#$#@$$ VATS would only target my cow, not the enemy!!!
---
finally just went over and punched the molerat to death

Oh ok thanks lol

I dont enjoy floating bases, but when they are themed to be floating, I love them. Nice job!!
---
‚ÄòWS Waiter‚Äô should be given to those spend most of their time at the golf club.

No. Just 5.56 and shotgun shells mainly. Never any ultracite or difficult to get ammo.
---
I only keep it to trade to the vendors in a few weeks.
---
Nice. I'm rocking a ts .50, for now, i'll take something better. I like this weapon.

There were animal traps in Fo4, it would be nice to see them return. I actually did like this aspect of building.

But if the people who were harassing him, at any point in that scenario felt like their lives were being pulled apart, they could simply just block and avoid anyone they fear of doing such actions, or even better, and I know this one is gonna fly right over your tiny ant brain, but they could‚Äôve just not been homophobic assholes, then they wouldn‚Äôt suffer repercussions from it, right? Right.

And I mean really who is this day and age is gonna argue the case of homophobes. You‚Äôre probably just some pre-pubescent naive immature little kid just like the homophobes, or likely, one of the homophobes yourself.

Well mate I kill what I meet. If I do a horde event, I expect the mobs to have my level, not to be level 5

So looks as if we were both right. Does not seem to work with any wall, but the brick version. That one however snaps with no problem. It would be nice to see the devs fix the issue for the other types of wall.

Easy way? Craft items and do easy missions. Mr. Messenger is easy and provides decent caps and xp. Powering Up Poseidon, Grafton Day, are relatively easy.

I‚Äôm not one for doing specific builds, I get what looks useful at the time. I‚Äôve found some level 26 mutants amongst other mutants that I‚Äôve been able to kill, I‚Äôve died a couple of times, so I‚Äôm not too fussed. It‚Äôs fine if your not bothered about your junk cus doing a stealth mission to recover it all amongst death claws and high level mutants sounds like a nightmare.
---
Than upvote it!!!!! Gezzzzzzzz
---
 Pistols do not kill. but the bullets kill.
---
Watoga protectrons go down in maybe a second. I need to do more testing with my other plasmas (AA and TW) but I honestly think this is the best due to quick damage ramp up. And getting AA from rifle perks helps too.
---
I'm not disagreeing with with your assessment, just that your *definitions* are a bit different than what most people understand.
---
Expansions are DLCs, but not all DLCs are expansions.  You're equating *all* DLCs with expansions, but DLCs can be minor and not as important.  So saying that the next content here doesn't amount to a DLC makes no sense to people who use the standard definitions.
---
Plus, expansions are often (not not always) associated with a purchase, which was common a few years back, but now there are a lot of free expansions to big games, making the distinction a little blurrier.

Beth wouldn't admit it even if there were false bans(Which I'm pretty sure there were), It would be PR suicide. Better to just throw everyone under the bus until they fix the issue. "Acceptable Losses" if you will.
---
What would the game look like without duping? I would suspect that well over 90% of the god roll weapons in the game are duped. If you buy an AAE handmade, it is almost assured to be a duped item. Don't sweat it. Buy it because attempting to find one on your own is an insanity test.
---
Nah you‚Äôre the one claiming things, I‚Äôve followed this from the beginning and nothing has been proven as fact. Just annoying to hear you acting like you know everything and then refusing to cite your sources. 
---
Eh, if a well known YTer posts a quick 3 minute news item letting people know, I don't have a huge problem with that.  If they're trying to sensationalize it as some earth shattering disappointment with the game...yeah no thanks.
---
It's a bug, should be fixed with tomorrow's patch. 
---
At level 20, you can probably safely take on the largish groups of Mid level (5-22) Super Mutants that spawn constantly at 3 locations - (The first two are also Power Armor spawn locations)
---
1) WV Lumber (top left corner of map)
---
2) Eastern Regional Penitentiary (Due North of Morgantown Airport) -stay out in the yard, come in from north east end or due north hole in the wall
---
3) Grafton Steel (Due north of Morgantown High School), approach from East side so you don't get rushed into bad water area. I'd recommend sniping to isolate a few at a time, stay at the edges, don't rush in and get surrounded. You don't need to cap the workshop at Grafton Steel, always lots of Mutants in the big buildings. 
---
Hotkey your best weapons, water and stimpaks, use the benches at the locations to scrap their weapons for bonus steel... 
---
Nope to both questions. I'm an avid Whitesprings farmer, I always do events that have guaranteed Legendary drops, its just I keep getting the shittiest legendary weapon drops. I was farming Whitesprings for a couple hours on saturday and the best weapon I got was a fucking 3\* baton.

r/fallout will ban you if you don't bash the game like a full time job, you probably want to go there.
---
I‚Äôm a sniper type of player btw
---
Yeah you‚Äôll be fine, it‚Äôs the ultracite ammo that‚Äôs being flagged as ‚Äúrare‚Äù. I‚Äôve traded well over 100k shotty shells in 30 days and no ban. My buddy traded over 100k ultracite and he was banned. Just stay away from the ultracite.
---
Depends where you are. Here in the UK they are practically unheard of for home internet. Throttling is a thing, but generally not a huge issue either.
---
&gt;Or a robot you can pay to get rid of the bounty?
---
I like this. Like, put a parole office in the guard shack outside the prison.
---
I have a Save game on FO4 with 7 DeathClaws wandering around Sanctuary, every now &amp; then one goes Rouge and kills a few settlers (Wasteland Population Control System).
---
Happens to me EVERY TIME I exit or re-enter my power armor.
---
i would love the ability to lower/remove bounties. example. break someone's wall. gain a bounty. repair said wall. it removes it
---
Is it inappropriate to say "I love you"? Lol
---
Oh also, flavor homerun by building it next to a hanger.
---
I've just seen too many YouTubers reporting rumors as fact, like the guy who had over 900 hours in the game. They  waste no time reporting anything negative about the game whether it's confirmed or not. Fallout 76 has a lot of problems, but ban speculations and hearsay don't help anything at all except to get views.
---
If the rumors were about expansions, sure, but they'll report videos of like "This is what micro-transactions COULD look like based on pure speculation..."
---
Bethesda is aware. They report that they "need to introduce new functionality" to fix the issue while still allowing bulk to be used for crafting. Here's a link to that thread. 
---

Some things you don't touch because they're sacred. Some you don't touch because they're cursed.

Alright i got a trade sorted for the chest so when that guy gets on i can trade it to you :)
---
A bad joke. Windows Server 2003 is no longer supported. FO76 still has morrowind code in it, so it was a joke about how vendors like Amazon (AWS) and Microsoft (Azure) would not allow an old virtual machine running a no longer supported OS in ther environment.
---
&gt; But you don't have to be stupid and go PVP with all your farmed junk in your inventory. There is no reason to do THAT. 
---
It's dumb, but it can happen. I've certainly forgot about having 20 stable flux on me in the heat of the moment and lost it during pvp. Not a proud moment, but no one's perfect. If he's farming all that crap, he's a pvper, probably thought "eh, this guy is level 8, I won't die". I'm not chastising you for killing him, but don't think you did the world some great favor by killing the "griefer".   
---
On your second point - no, regular players carrying around lots of stuff doesn't really hurt the game world. The people who were hurting the game world were carrying around millions of duped weapons and armor. And Bethesda has never stated anything about removing players who use two accounts to mule, or use a friend to mule.
---
oh well, guess i'm either glitched or this is a mystery nobody has solved just yet. 
---
This would not surprise me.
---
Hey man, sorry, a guy has offered me a trade i can't refuse! Trading 2 pieces!
---
Yes, yes you are. That is why you are the only one who has ever made a post like this.
---
You can buy serums off other players for 200-250 caps. Much quicker and easier than "farming" them and dealing with unwanted ones.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs kind of a bummer but you‚Äôll have a hard time if you don‚Äôt get the damage perks at first. I‚Äôd recommend maxing out your rifleman perks as son as possible and investing in a perk like evasive that gives you more DR. 
---
Rifle builds kind of suck at first but they‚Äôre super powerful towards the end game so you definitely have something to look forward to. What system are you on btw? XB1?
---
I have one of those as well, but yeah, 1 star bloodied does 2x the damage against queen, bloated ghouls, etc. It's good for splash damage though.
---
Ach, could i get the shotgun for the chest instead then? I dont have a real use for the chest and im giving some pretty good stuff for it
---
Are you serious here or just acting stupid?
---
It's about time people see all my Mule word play for my mules characters.
---
And with these two pieces of advice, I'll never claim a workshop again. I really love this community sometimes. Ty very much. If your on pc, at a queen fight and notice she is frozen and barely moving, you helped make the ammo to do it. üòòüòò
---
True but that is also limiting for few reasons. 
---
1) Caps is the only thing in the game with no weight. 
---
2) Having characters with nothing but tons and tons of junk would cause the same server instability as dupers did. Anything but caps would run into the weight max across all account characters.
---
&gt; They are now. They weren't before. When the change came, about during first month into release, existing stacks didn't get automatically collapsed. I had lots of stacked marine tactical helmets, but when I moved them around, the stacks broke off. But the patch didn't collapse them, it only made them not stack anymore.
---
Then that was a bug. They did not stack without some coercion.
---
Yes, auto-scrapping bulk is annoying. Bethesda is aware. They report that they "need to introduce new functionality" to fix the issue while still allowing bulk to be used for crafting.
---
Here's a link to that thread:
---
Yup. One of (so many) reasons why I wouldn't buy this or any other bethesda title on console. 
---
I can black screen a windowed mode game too, if im watching netflix while playing a windowed or borderless game and alt tab out. Its less an issue of the game causing it, and more that you keed a pile of ram to suspend state the game, and some games dont like being dropped in priority.
---
Speed tests are kind of meh, your ping is a ton more important.
---
That said, I'm an almost daily player, with a 100mb/s connection across 10 ish devices with a ping generally between 80-140ms, I partake in a nuke zone every couple days if not more, and have yet to experience HP bars coming back up since they patched the damage calculation issue ages ago. Id be looking at things like packet loss and routing in your internal network.
---
So your move duder.
---
I looked at a few things and it was pretty much generic, but the workshops tab is pretty useful. 
---
Its not set up to be a pvp game lol
---
For as much as this sub hates "YouTubers" they sure do get talked about a lot.
---
I wish the bounty system was increased by 10. Lets say you destroy another players fusion generator you get a 100 cap bounty and so on. I also wish there was a debt system were if they can't pay for their bounty they would have to give all the caps they get later on and if after awile they don't pay that either (gain no caps) some of their resources can be given to pay off the bounty. This would decrease griefing (as most people see it) and increase the amount of people on the (yet to come) survival servers.
---
Yeah love that lore of finding a neat area and climbing to the top of it, just to find a note of a guy that did the same thing and pissed off the edge.
---
They did? That super mutant must have been an old file? /s
---
Anti armor weapon with high damage like black powder rifle or dragon works wonders. Especially with crit shots 
---
Yeah that was bugging me so much. I had all my guards outfitted with combat armor and assault rifles and still those stupid settlers get kidnapped by Raiders with pipe pistols. 
---
its so that u can recognize ur different characters when choosing characters. but i think this is a good idea
---
Nah pc. I go for rifle perks whenever they appear but I‚Äôve only had 3 perk packs so far, and they didn‚Äôt do much for me damage wise 
---
Here's a link btw:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/am8yat/a_note_on_banning/
---
Let me try to explain again. My observation is the same enemy will always be a legendary. You do not need to kill the non legendaries to open up the spawn. It is not a lottery spawn. It is like a timed spawn. If the legendaries at westtek are only outside, they will always spawn outside, never inside. In Watoga, if you see a legendary protection walk out of a specific spawn point, it will always be that spawn point for that server. My observation is you do not need to clear everything, legendary or not, to get those legendaries to respawn.
---
Or are you saying you do not want to kill the 1 star legendaries in hopes they spawn higher level ones?
---
Yup, I'm well aware, I saw a few like that.  Quick downvote (if that), and close the window as soon as I realize.  Don't even bother commenting, usually the rabid followers out-shout you to oblivion.  Does YT have a block feature?  I need to look into that...
---
It's a bit like the anti-vax FB groups, you can't reach them.  Best to not engage.
---
I 1 shot every enemy at west tek, even with a gun on my melee character. What is this bullet sponge you speak of? 
---
Also, this is a waste of time complaint, waste of time for you, waste of time fo Bethesda to read, waste of time for anyone to read.
---
Oh no me cants farm the legendaries eazier cus no can kill fas, halppp bethy halllppp!!!
---
Could i give the chestpiece and a tse handmade or something? Im kinda stuck here
---
I guess my next question then is what do you consider _worth keeping_?  Instigating and Furious aren't as good as Bloodied but they're still pretty decent if you're specced to that weapon type.  I agree good drops are super rare but halfway decent ones aren't extremely uncommon.
---
Prepares to offer left arm...
---
I have a lever TSE with movement speed when aiming, max level?
---
I already have that too, dont rly need it
---
I've got 25 stable cobalt flux you want to save yourself some time. Otherwise find an area with more than one farm that has corn. Still won't net anywhere near 250 unless you have a few people helping.
---
Idk, honestly I haven't shopped around for the game in a while.  Although last I looked (who knows how many weeks ago) it was full price through Bethesda and Amazon, too?  Plus any HB subscribers have 10% off, and some people just like their charity stuff.  Or, they've just been waiting since it was on sale, like me, and haven't seen it yet.  I'm just spreading the word.
---
He thought it was safe to stick around after I killed him once and didn't bother to take his stuff? That should have been his cue to get his shit and leave. But he decided trying to be cheeky instead. He made a string of easily avoidable bad decisions. Decisions someone over lvl 100 should not be making. And I posted this because of the funny "oh shit!" jackpot of scrap, not for virtue points. Killing a jerk was just a bonus.
---
Beth. has publicly confirmed they have removed as little as 10k of some items. You don't need millions. Just be prudent and careful about it. If it becomes a problem, they WILL eventually ban it. 
---
I have nerve damage in my hands and thought it was rough too. 
---
A few tips. 
---
* get an automatic weapon. 
---
* run around and shoot the targets. You don't have to stay. Behind the counter. 
---
* have friends help shoot the targets. 
---
* stash as much stuff as possible and drink a nuka cherry or eat sugar bombs before trying the obstacle course. 
---
* whiskey could help too.  Or buffout. 
---
* the one to catch the "traitor" is pretty easy. 
---
Easy to get overwhelmed in Grafton Steel. Don't be a hero....
---
Or just a function to hunt bounties on log in so you can find a server with a bounty on it. I server hop all day farming ect. The first thing I do is scan the map for bounties. I'll some times get a bounty so the pvp comes to me even then, it takes several server hops to find some one interested in the bounty system. I am hoping the new pvp servers will fix this, we will see. Maybe it's just me but I intentionally look for pvp traps the challenge is fun and it's not like you die in Rl.
---
16gb ram is more than enough for me, also you can see the ping in the speed test sooo it's better than yours :)
---
Anyway, it seems that it's really hard for you to understand that other games like GTA, ESO, BDO have no issues, EVEN IN FALLOUT 76 i'm able to craft and do shit with 0 lag; just damaging mobs was problematic. You want to say that my connection choses to only be shitty when i shoot mobs? 30 seconds later when i open a door and trade everything is fine, then drops again? 
---
I don't think you truly understand how this shit works... 
---
But every single good gear is duped so I don‚Äôt think it works
---
Unfortunately
---
Not sure?! I could give maybe capa for it then?
---
They need a scape goat
---
I played solo almost the whole time until I got to around level 75. Just follow the quests. 
---
Don't fast travel. 
---
Explore. 
---
I agree with your statement but it‚Äôs not applicable I don‚Äôt think :/
---
I guess ill try get outof the trade with the other guy, might  be a bit of a pain though
---
I believe it's on an *extreme* case by case basis. It's basically a matter of out-stubborn(ing) whoever is assigned to your case. If you put up enough of a stink about it they'll let you, because when it comes down to it after all the hours and dollars spent fighting it, it's still about religious freedom, whether they agree with it or not.
---
I don't have this problem but I don't rely on the game to aim for me.
---
Nowadays a good one star instigating, bloodied or AA is kinda better than bad max level TSE. Good TSE still wins though.
---
Good thing about TSE's is if you want one, you can just buy one, because they have been duped so much.
---
I've done that once or twice &gt;.&gt;
---
What bothers me is when there's an obvious unfriendly right in front of me, but I can't get it in VATS at all, half the time it will only target friendlies.  No reason for that at all.
---
When I hit VATS and fire before I look, and end up in bullet-hell, that's on me and I'll accept my fate (or log out fast :P ).  But preference should *always* be unfriendlies &gt; friendlies.
---
Hey thanks for the kind response friend. I am smiling as I type this.
---
*hurk*
---
Thanks dude
---
The fact that you still think a guy doing pvp in a spot designed for pvp is "a jerk" just goes to show that you're missing the point.
---
I'm on PC and I crash way more often then others are reporting on a regularly-updated mid-performance gaming desktop. At least once a week. Often the crashes are in clusters. It's not unplayable, but it is less-stable-than-most-games, even now. Luckily I'm usually playing with friends, which helps since I can rejoin the same server that I left. 
---
Despite stability issues, I've had lots of fun playing with friends and exploring the world. The attention to detail in the world design is great. Designing and decorating the camp is great fun too. I have no regrets. 
---
Look. I already know about that. I‚Äôve been doing it and I‚Äôve been scrapping the outfits and hats on the side. 
---
It did make naming a melee "Finn Mertens" pointless.
---
I have nerve damage in my hands and rely heavily on vats. It's a definite issue. 
---
Same with turrets at the prison. 
---
Same with other players when i'm set passive and we're battling a mob. 
---
The accuracy is... Shit.
---
I was wondering why the hell I wasnt rocking so muxh damage. Well half of the shots were going everywhere. 
---
I have the twisted muscle mutation that is certainly not helping on top of that. 
---
Time to engineer the build a bit ! 
---
Good point, I should probably read before commenting next time. My bad.
---
Thanks, the hangar was one of the reasons I chose the spot (that and the plastic drop in the cat lady house next door!) I could actually build inside there if I had any budget left! There are enemies that spawn inside there so I‚Äôm looking forward to the update in the hope I can build a turret inside. 
---
The biggest thing I would saw would be to have a semi-auto gun like the combat or assault rifle as a backup. The hunting rifle is good for long range but once they‚Äôre in your face you‚Äôll want something with a higher fire rate. 
---
Definitely don‚Äôt be afraid to pop chems and also the pharma farma perk is really good for finding stimpacks early on so you can stay alive longer. Wish I could help in game but I‚Äôm on XB1, I wish you luck tho!
---
It takes time.  
---
Thoroughly explore the forest and toxic valley.  Redo events.  Practice melee combat at places like morgantown airport.  When that event starts, you get lots of low level scorched.  
---
Take all the weapons and scrap them for materials.   Learn what weapons ae effective against what critters.
---
If you follow the overseers quest, you'll learn the lore, meet level appropriate critters, and build XP at a reasonable rate.
---
Find a hunting rifle with a scope, and sit on the hill opposite grafton steel or WV Lumber and snipe the mutants.   
---
After sniping the outside mutants at grafton steel, go a bit NNW and try out path of the wind. (When I did that one, it was mostly level 6 scorched, and I picked up a very effective L25 death tambo.
---
From there, go west into the toxic valley and do the area by the alligator.   
---
Most of the critters there are scorched or ghouls, but make sure you have a hunting or sniper rifle.  You'll likely need to use it from the top of the waterslide against a couple critters.  
---
You'll also get a quest while you are there.  For me. the reward for that quest was a 1\* 10mm sub machine gun that also has burn damage. (Perfect Storm\*)
---
You'll be in the 30s in no time, your combat skills will be much improved, and so will your weaponry :)
---
Gamer tag is diesel gunner I like running around helping lower levels and pretending to be a hired gun shoot me an invite if you see me on. 
---
But they CAN ask you to start over if you want to opt into it... Bethesda isn‚Äôt forcing us to play survival mode. It‚Äôs our choice. Those who don‚Äôt want to invest time into a new survival character simply... shouldn‚Äôt, and continue with the character they already have in adventure mode. 
---
Also, I don‚Äôt think one needs to play 6-7 hours a day to be competent in survival mode. Maybe if you approach it from the perspective of min maxing as soon as possible, but like you said this group is the exception rather than the norm so you are asking them to cater the game mode to the few exceptions rather than the majority?
---
No this community sucks balls. Groups of lvl 200 shitheads running around doing nothing but stealing peoples workshops and killing others even when they got pacifist mode turned on since their damage is way off the charts. And then they tell you "its just a game" after griefing you to take your massiv 8 caps and 20 wood from you because they just suck and have no life.
---
Fuck other players in this game.
---
You have to actually destroy something or kill a non-hostile player to get a bounty after the last update, not just hit a house or a workshop item with a stray bullet. And he had a bounty of 120. You don't get that accidentally. If he wanted the workshop and PVP'd the guy, he would have had no bounty. You don't want a bounty when you are packing a ton of resources anyway, so someone can't come whack you outside of a PVP zone and take it. I watched him kill the lvl 8 twice outside PVP just because he could. He was being malicious, stupid, and it cost him. 
---
Yabba Dabba DONE!!!
---
I'm glad you took it the right way. Some people who don't know how to recognize sarcasm without the " /s" are downvoting me. But they have sad lives so i still feel like I came out ahead. 
---
 If that was hard ... well I dunno what you find easy. ;)
---
Their lives weren't ruined because they were banned for a game.
---
Anything that happened to them was because they were unrepentant fuckwaffles about it, because it was a 3 day ban until they were shitheads, and then it became permanent.
---
/r/fo76bazaar may be able to help you. Lots of trades there.

I guess you don‚Äôt believe players trade in high quantities? There used to be a lot of people that would have 150k ultracite ammo in their inventory at a time, because it wasn‚Äôt stated to be a bannable offense. 
---
Dickheads that take other peoples workshops in teams, killing lvl 30 players with 3 lvl 200 assheads who easily kill you even through pacifist mode. That sums up this community. Cowards and assholes.
---
Congrats on 100 üòÅ
---
I eventually just remove and store the door until i'm done building
---
I guess pacifist mode is out of the question?
---
Oh thanks 
---
LOL yeah... you have like 200% less accuracy with that. That's really... ouch =). But even so, stat wise, even if you hit every single hit, the bloodied will outperform TSE. That's for two reasons - 1, the total damage from a TSE is just less than a bloodied, all other things equal, assuming 30% or less HP (and the lower you go, the wider the gap gets). The second reason is that with bloodied, it's all one hit, meaning it penetrates high armor better. With TSE it's ... I want to say 4 hits? two shots and 2 explosions? So it goes through far more DR, meaning it gets reduced more due to how DR works. Even at only two it's significant.
---
Hey, after the game's launch, I think we're all amenable to the idea of giving these releases a bit of extra time to get good and ready.  Thank you, and still looking forward to it!
---
It wasn't a hard mission. Just annoying and repetitive when you have to go and get all the paperwork and waiting at the DMV for your number!! 
---
I'm guessing he's taking about the DMV part. I think you're referring to Back to Basic.
---
oh well i have close to 100K ultra cite ammo. 
---
there was a couple guys hanging out at the greenbrier golf resort selling legendary weapons and ammo (they were dupers) and in an effort to gain proof of them dupping i agreed to trade with them so i could see their inventory.
---
i ended up getting a legendary 2 shot explosive 50mg and a 2shot explosive lever action ultracite gun with 100K ultracite ammo in exchange for 5000 caps.
---
I still pick up everything and just put all the one stars in the ws vender inside the hotel. 
---
Players are able to clear out these areas though. You are choosing not to and then foisting your malcontent on the developers. You're not even answering a simple question directly related to the source of your malcontent.
---
At some point, we, as players, need to understand developers have a scope of what they want the game to be. We can complain, give feedback, wishlist, beg, etc. for features we'd like implemented, but if it isn't in line with what Bethesda's vision of what the game is then they're not going to do it. Perhaps they're trying to cull this style of play completely.
---
I understand it isn't as fun as it could be for you with how the system is currently, but developers have to account for players with playstyles similar to yours and every other playstyle. How exciting would it be for players to come to a new area only for it to be empty, and then they server hop and it's still empty, because now everything is so easy to farm?
---
3* wooden legs from the SBQ, you say? Sounds about right...
---
Nah. That bit was pretty straight forward. I more mean that DMV section. Which was just tedious 
---
Just keep patting yourself on the back, it seems that's all your good at.
---
This!! I finally ventured into a nuke zone at white springs. I was level 51 at the time. The first time I went in... it was love lol I had so much fun killing all these higher level things, and whenever I would get too deep in I had a guardian.... angel? Death dealer? Something? He was a level 154 and would let me always get a shot in on the legendaries. We weren‚Äôt on a team, and I was hoping around everywhere, so I‚Äôm not sure why he stuck with me but I was so happy he did.... fast forward a few hours... getting ready to log off and someone drops another nuke. Since it was so much fun I thought.. what the hell? Why not?... I encountered three players working in team, I couldn‚Äôt decide if they were trying to help me or kill me.... well, with one shot melee strike, I went down. I quickly went back to try to grab my bag but of course it was gone. üôÑ so ya know, whatever. I‚Äôm laid back about playing so I didn‚Äôt get too aggravated about it. Until they literally started stalking me... after about 5-10 minutes of this I just left the world and turned the game off. 
---
Anywho! If we had a karma system that would help us to realize when we‚Äôre encountering awesome players that want to help and have fun or the assholes who take joy in watching the world burn. 
---
I also get tired of &lt;level 10‚Äôs running whenever I try to give them stuff. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I agree. I have observed the same.
---
Let's look at that lonely ghoul on the front porch of that one house at Whitespring. If he spawns as a legendary and I kill him......the next time he spawns he will spawn as a legendary again. Whether or not he spawns as a 3* legendary is an RNG meaning that there is an (X)% probability that he will spawn as a 2* legendary and an (X)% probability that he will spawn as a 3* legendary.
---
The Whitespring isn't a problem because it isn't challenging to run through and thrash everything. As far as West Tek or even Harpers Ferry you would be correct that if I look down from the roof and see a 1* legendary.....no.....I do not care to waste my time or resources to bag a 1* legendary so I leave. I witness other high level players doing this also.
---
The current endgame is farming 3* legendaries. Clearing an area with 20+ Super Mutants is highly inefficient when I can just server hop and move on. If certain enemies were not so bullet spongey and  you would see these areas being cleared more frequently and less people hanging out at the Whitespring and Watoga.
---
Did you report them with screenshots?
---
You can solo with the right weapon but even for me (lvl 140) it can be hard. It helps to snipe from the cliff above before you go in. 
---
All the fun people are PC or PS, Xbox just has people who role play raiders and we all know how that goes haha.
---
yeah I'm waiting until after the patch before I waste another serum on it
---
Yeah could be I guess, but one time I did forget to server hop and spent like 45 mins taking rad damage/showering without getting a second mutation. Once I realized I server hopped and got one on my first try. Just anecdotal evidence I guess though... 
---
I love all the explosive weapons even though they are nerfed. A little dangerous in close quarters but effective. I have a lvl 45 explosive stalkers The Dragon. Max out your demolitions expert perk card for a little more punch. 
---
I said the same thing in the thread and was quickly downvoted. I guess people like to get their accounts hacked?
---
I want a community board where we can post either looking to sell or buy things or ask for teammates for certain situations.
---
 The number on the Auto Grenade Launcher is 100 firing rate. It does empty its 12 grenades into the world real quick. I'll look into One Gun Army. Is that a Strength thing? I'll level soon I am pulling a couple of Shotgun perks.
---
i reported them to bethesda support but i couldn't figure out how to include the pictures and recordings of them into the report (im on xbox one)
---
i haven't heard anything since then so i assumed they were banned.
---
Yeah, the next hate train is Anthem. I wonder what will be April's hate train.
---
Anyhow YouTubers lost me except angry joe. I never agree with Joe but his angry rants make me laugh and then I do the opposite of what he thinks. Works great for me.
---
If he's colorblind (looking through the replies to the root), he can't see red as it blends in with the area. The black border in those specific biomes won't highlight anything.
---
Okay But Why Are You Talking Like This?
---
There is a cool little photography setup in the hills West of #5. Has a chair with decorations and a camera pointing at it. 
---
It seems to me like you should be spamming SBQ then. The quest gives a 2-3 star item drop and the queen itself can drop the same.
---
Yeah since you reported them you probably won‚Äôt get suspended for having that ammo. Once your account flags they‚Äôll see your report. 
---
what should i do with the items in the meantime, just drop them?
---
Yeah absolutely.
---
It's not even a tse, just a 1 star ts i got for cheap. Nice gun, butbmore like an automatic shotgun than a long range heavy gun lol
---
Bloodied are expensive tho
---
No you‚Äôll be fine, I wouldn‚Äôt bother dropping them. The weapons definitely don‚Äôt matter and as long as you don‚Äôt have over 150k ultracite ammo your account shouldn‚Äôt even be flagged at all.
---
For fucks sake it wasn't a fucking complaint. You people just want it to borrow a complaint.
---
It was a fucking suggestion.
---
I can one shot everything with my bloodied rifle also. Or I can one shot them with my bloodied explosive Western revolver. It's still not worth getting hit with a 'hot potato' from the fucking Tom Brady of super mutants and eating 500 rounds from a mini gun to clear an area that doesn't have any legendaries.
---
Now imagine the guy who doesn't have a TSE/AAE/BE.....WTF are you even in this thread for if you are one shot killing everything yourself?.......you have a problem with making it easier for others to one shot kill like you do?
---
Yea but that makes grieving easy as not very one would figure that out.
---
I hotspotted this game for a little bit during an internet outage, I think? The usage was EXTREMELY low. He'll have no problems.
---
Check the status of your NAT. 
---
Also not everyone was guilty.
---
Tribal power armor from fo3 pitt dlc... so sick
---
Ok. Here's the thing. Trading items does not trigger the item counter. You can test this by trading junk items and checking the counter on the challenge screen. So any amount of trading will not trigger the anti-cheat measures. Bethesda themselves state that *any legitimate method*, that includes trading. A lot of people have done the trading and crafting hing later and did not get banned. There has literally been zero proof about the trade/craft thing triggering a ban.
---
... I think you may be misunderstanding.
---
They suggested the display be: Hans Blaster (Xx_Darth_Helmet_xX) for your male character and Leia Hairrolls (Xx_Darth_Helmet_xX) for your female character instead of Xx_Darth_Helmet_xX for *all* your characters.
---
I'm not sure what you mean by your male character name not fitting your female characters name and so on.
---
What's this even mean?
---
And I'm sure your going to tell me about how some indie game you failed to develop makes you an expert on the subject...
---
I would watch this if not at work. Does shooting invisible players allow vats like when you shoot crouched players?
---
Also, do you know how many seconds of vats time you get after shooting crouched players? It feels like 10 seconds until I need to shoot them again. Maybe based on stealth?
---
Really? That would be great
---
Well all mine are named Sheep or Sheepette!  Like my heavy weapons specialist is Sheepette Tank. And Dr. Sheep for my medical build!  
---
Yup, hate that glitch.  It happened to me down in the ash heap when I was killed by another player. All I could do was wish the guy good luck and let him have my junk.  
---
Thanks! I had a lot of fun making it! I've got one in mind for the Free States and the Brotherhood at Camp Venture, hopefully today or tomorrow.
---
Oh, and you can easily destroy several walls with one shot using a powerful weapon. I've received a 100 cap bounty when trying to kill a guy with a 300 cap bounty who ran into his friends house. That was from one shot. Bloodied explosive weapons do a lot of damage to structures.
---
Damn. Hope this weeks patch will finally fix it
---
Bc y'all are talking about adding complicated mechanics to game who's core mechanics still need work. It's a cool concept, but the game struggles with a lot of things as is. Quests and missions still have bugs. Perk cards and mutations still aren't properly applying all the time. People are still duplicating items. The list goes on and on and on.
---
Yeah I definitely remember seeing it, don't have a link unfortunately. Here's hoping! 
---
Boiled water is supposed to be like hot radiated water whereas purified water would be clean with a neutral temperature so it would make sence to cook with hot water
---
That system has been well established for a multitude of games similar to 76 and all of them have been denied on console so far... i'd be seriously impressed if beth was made a exceptation... they DID manage to establish mods though so you never know ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Farm it for exp and legendary every day. Its a great exp spot.......shrug. 
---
Doesn't take much time to clear it all out, even the inside.
---
1 star bloodied go for 1-2k caps all the time. Hell I can't even sell mine.
---
What platform are you on?
---
one gun army is actually in luck. for shotguns there is enforcer
---
I hear ya man just grind caps  and save the gun is worth it.
---
I'm glad you got a good experience, count yourself lucky! And dont always expect that. This community is very hit or miss. 
---
Habit
---
Love it and thank you!  
---
Cruised a few placed I hadn't been in SD last night, and intend on hitting the rest.  I play with the map open on a second monitor, the red can be hard to read, (the suggestion of white/black outline) might work.
---
It's been surprising how many of these places I've been right by and missed.  But look the other way and walk 10 feet to the left it's quite possible!  Bethesda did an amazing job tucking so many unique things into the game.
---
Again thanks.  More reason to get out and explore and take screenshots!
---
I don't know why everyone thinks this is a complaint thread. I guess because it's the internet.
---
I was merely making a suggestion on something that I observed. A suggestion to make it a little bit easier for players without God tiered weapons to clear some areas.
---
It doesn't hurt my feelings. I'll just continue to server hop but as long as higher level players like myself are efficiently farming....... everyone else will continue to walk into areas where someone snuck in with a deathclaw and killed the 3* and then left and everyone can make complaint threads about how no 3* legendaries ever spawn.
---
Or intentional sabotage??? A new faction? The Chinese!!! 
---
An outrage farmer. Brings in the money.
---
Are radscorpions bugs? I do not like those dudes....
---
I'm level 200 and I don't farm anything for XP anymore.
---
I roll in. Sneak through and kill the 3* legendary and leave the rest of them for you. Good thing you like xp.....shrug.
---
Anyone can 1 shot those super mutants and it doesn‚Äôt require the best weapons, just a good build.
---
And I see your post as a complaint because it has data or any quantifiable or qualitative information to backup your claim, basically just like, your opinion, dude. 
---
Someone else made a post about the real problem with legendaries, with lots of numbers and data to back it up, that makes it all make sense, I mean a 1/242k chance of getting the exact legendary you want sounds a lot more like the problem than a super mutant that a bad build can‚Äôt kill. 
---
And because there are actual posts pointing to the real issue, your post is doing nothing but wasting the time of the people who need to devote their time to finding the real issue. Don‚Äôt waste their time man.
---
Nice weapon!
---
Yeah, I have run into them about 4x throughout my whole game experience. I‚Äôm level 86.
---
I can't get almost any daily quest's to work except the toxic waste and ash heap ones. Occasionally pumpkin jack pops up, but things like belly of the beast or queen of the hunt just do not trigger no matter what I try. I honestly did not know queen of the hunt was a daily quest until playing a second character through every quest. And now I can't trigger it again. 
---
I was laughing my butt off when I played that one.  All I kept thinking was the guy that wrote it sitting in a real DMV thinking "how can I get this crap into a game" 
---
GTA V is, hands down, the worst online community in the history of online communities. That is an example of how shitty people can be, when given the opportunity.
---
Such a huge, open, do anything you want world... and THAT is what they do to it.
---
People are just tossing ideas around. Of course it would be super hard to implement some of these things. But it‚Äôs interesting to talk about and hear ideas. 
---
If I had to choose between my game not crashing and more bugs, I‚Äôd choose the game not crashing. But I don‚Äôt want to be in this sub seeing nothing but ‚Äúmy game just crashed!‚Äù posts.
---
What?  I've never heard of this. I know there's the one quest where you have a warrant out for your arrest, triggered by a couple Gutsys trying to kill you, and you have to go there to clear your name.  But I haven't heard of going to the Warden to clear a bounty.  have you actually done this?
---
i suppose, but world of warcraft manages to accomplish reviewing character names despite millions of players. it can be a little annoying, though. one time i got a name change ticket because my character‚Äôs name was ‚Äúholyshiitake.‚Äù got around it by just changing one of the i‚Äôs to an accented one. 
---
regardless, it shouldn‚Äôt be that difficult.
---
ha i make sure not to have any of my TSEs equipped
---
Super Hitler desperately wants this!
---
You've obviously never beaten something  to death with one.
---
I thought it was really funny, annoying realistic, but funny.
---
never happened yet.
---
This would be nice.... As my user is pretty old and since Bethesda don't allow people to change their names
---
Welcome to gaming.
---
So you are saying that if it is quiet enough, you can the pin drop?
---
You should. It's gratifying.
---
Not true at all.
---
I have a mutant slayers handmade and it takes 3 shots to the right arm to kill them without sneak crits.
---
If players like myself are sneaking into areas and killing the 3* and leaving...........you my friend are the one missing what the real problems are. Bethesda very clearly understands the probability of pulling a good drop..... it's basic probability math. What they don't realize is that respawns aren't being triggered because areas aren't being cleared.
---
fuck that, i helped players in this game, gave out plans and stimpaks, radaway and radx for free to newbies and anyone below lvl 20 just to get griefed by lvl 200 cocksuckers who move in groups. In fucking pacifist mode.
---
Fuck this shit. Workshops are a fucking deathtrap.
---
It does get up to 9, though. You only have level 1 Cola Nut, which doubles all colas' benefits. Level 2 TRIPLES the benefits, so...
---
I like the idea behind cryo grenades but the blast radius is pitiful even with grenadier. Do cryo mines have a similar effect? Also what happens to your AP if you hit yourself with a cryo grenade. 
---
I believe you. This is exactly what I‚Äôm working toward now!
---
But there is pvp in it?
---
If u claim a workshop it removes pacifist mode. You are open to pvp from all other players. It's how they're intended to work. 
---
I hate it but learned the hard way. 
---
You‚Äôre putting words in their mouth, they only specify crafting not trading so idk where you‚Äôre getting that information. You seem to think the word ‚Äúlegitimate‚Äù implies trading but from my experience this is not the case. 
---
Your example of trading junk items doesn‚Äôt apply because they state they won‚Äôt reveal all the ways they flag these accounts, so it‚Äôs very possible they have a different item counter system than what‚Äôs used in game. Again you point to other people doing things but no sourcing..
---
Nah. Look at ESO. Sure, there's three colours to everything, but some of that crap is crazy detailed. And really... how many colours do you want going on at once?
---
My max level TS Wester Revolver is a Canon...El Canon!!
---
Getting your xbox or playstation to talk to a PC based server is, most likely, a more complicated feat than getting a PC game to talk to a PC server. 
---
No, I'm just an employed developer with a degree in it...
---
My suggestion earlier was to add more durability to science, etc for energy weapons or something. 
---
Every 20 hours
---
A nuke on what and at what time?
---
They give you a daily quest...  you do it. 
---
That's pretty much it.
---
"Level up five times wearing the beer hat"... pretty self explanatory.
---
"take pictures in 5 different mines or caves"... again. 
---
Just check the challenges in the menu... it outlines them all.
---
 Cool I am doing nothing with my 2 Luck. ;)
---
Yes true.. Nethertheless, since BETA 90 % of players were friendly or neutral to me in fo76 and this is what i love about this game
---
Not really griefing, but similar situation: I had this happen with a level 30 who kept trying to take a workshop from me. 10 times he tried and failed, and he kept waiting until I was out doing other stuff. He did eventually kill me because he figured out that when I fast travelled to the workshop, I'd always spawn in the same spot, so he sat there and held a machine gun to my head for the 10 seconds that my character was there but I was unable to do anything during load screen (controls locked up / black screen fading into world). Ironically we came out about even from the exchange, since I'm high level - he got most of his money back.
---
It's specifically only when you use an aid item from your pip boy. I never use stuff from there anymore - always from keybinds. Stupid bug though.
---
The ASAM missile turret is the worst for this, I swear it will steal VATS focus even if its not on the screen, I played "line in the sand" last night and every time I hit VATS i'd spin around and point at that damn ASAM turret.
---
I'd prefer it never to target a friendly, but if it has to, can there be a priority list, with bad guys first and friendlies last?
---
I don't mess with anyone with a bounty that's higher than a level or two more than me. Not doin' it.  No way.
---
Hell, had a character beg me to kill him a few days ago... I was leery. He took off his armour, put away his weapons. So I shot him in the head...
---
...and instantly got destroyed by turrets.
---
Nah. Screw that shit. PvP ain't my game.
---
Fissure cite prime and any time after 4 on Monday Tuesday Friday and Saturday
---
Youll have to connect the floating pieces to a foundation, then do whatever you did to make them floating again
---
Or while you're fixing when you could have the option to cause it to melt down.
---
That's been my thought reading this.  In theory 3* should be harder to kill and drop better loot.  But from my perspective they aren't any tougher and so makes sense loot seems to be about the same.  Star system creates expectation of better loot though, so should either be tougher to kill (like can't solo) and guarantee 3*, or lose the Stars on them and keep as is.  
---
I know a lot of people want to only play solo and that is what I do myself with exception of SBQ, but it is kinda crazy that you can solo everything in the map, except this one thing that takes 10 people.  Would be cool to have 4-5 other true 3* legendaries that took 2 to 3 people to take down?
---
They did nothing to escalate the ban to permanent.  Bethesda changed it to a permaban when SJW sites like Eurogamer got ahold of the story and drew out the pitchforks.  My point about their lives being potentially ruined was that a bunch of immature kids played a distasteful joke on another player in a video game and then they got effectively doxxed by the snowflake they were teasing.
---
I alternate between cable and 3G so I keep track of usage. On Xbox about 60MB/hour sometimes 100. As far as latency on 3G I get 100ms pings vs like 14 on cable. There is pretty much no difference in playability.
---
Aid items to use while farming white springs for the hundredth time, a new crafting table for crafting said aid items that will take up more of your camp budget, and a daily radiant quest to learn the recipes to the new aid items a little at a time to pad this out as long as possible...
---
I love the FO community so far. Been such a pleasant surprise.
---
*How* is deliberately typing like that a habit?
---
Considering my characters are named [Dwayne Schrute](https://imgur.com/OdfZ8oN) and [Rod Swanson](https://imgur.com/e9dugLc), I'd appreciate this very much.
---
You can get a TSE weapon that is 2 stars.  I have a 2 star TSE Hunting Rifle that dropped the same day that TS and E got nerfed.
---
You on ps4?
---
Leave the area and come back the next day. A new event may not spawn. You may need to hop to a different server if it has recently run on the server you're on. 
---
Wait, did they try to push back the initial release date? I don't recall that happening. I do remember being very surprised that they went from the beta straight into the release after what... a week? Not much of a beta if they don't have time to fix anything...
---
Oops. Yeah. 
---
Nah, destiny 2 showed us that easily getting legendary is a bad thing 
---
I dont think bethesda knows what "daily" means, or they are bugged. I was trying to do the camden park "daily" quests for about a week, and they only popped up 2 or 3 times(one a day, 2 or 3 times total over the course of a week). I have given up on daily quests. I thought they would be quests that you could do once every 24 hours, but I do one daily quest, and come back the next day(or week) and they just don't pop up or trigger or whatever.
---
For example, I'll log on, do the dross toss daily at camden park, play for a bit, then log off. The next day(at least 24 hours later), I'll log back on, travel to camden park, walk around and talk to robots for 10 minutes, and the quests don't show up. Not sure what the deal is. 
---
And yet it isnt set up for it
---
You need a different sub. Lol. This place is a toxic wasteland most days. Lmao!! I go to the filthy casual sub for the good stuff. It's like night and day. 
---
As I said, cool concept, maybe just poor wording in title? "Weather concepts need tweaking" IMO implies it's not working properly and should be fixed. So curiosity sparked, I read post to find it's just adding complicated mechanics to a struggling game. Maybe I'm blabbing. Maybe I slipped up and let he toxic get on me. Lol ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I'm on XBone. If you're interested, PM your GT. 
---
You know people are going to be mad about this, and this is basically the minimum amount of time that they're ever going to "accept" as a delay.
---
I have tried the beta and was a mess of bug and bad optimization
---
Did you guys get the plans? I'm on PC as well and looking for em.
---
And there was much rejoicing
---
Providing one example of something not being true does not prove it to be not true at all. And obviously, thanks for the DUH moment when you mention how an automatic rifle can‚Äôt one shot, o rlyyy!!???
---
Anyway, back to the actual subject. Sneaking into west tek and ONLY killing the legendary enemies would be a harder feat to accomplish than simply going into west tek and killing every enemy. I mean my character can‚Äôt manage it with 30 agi and escape artist/sneak cards.
---
So before you come here with this evidence-less claim, maybe consider that people aren‚Äôt going to just believe that this is an actual thing
---
What proof do you have that this is happening?
---
What proof do you have that if a legendary enemy is killed, but the rest of the enemies in his area are not killed, that he will not simply just respawn in that spot after the allotted amount of time/trigger event has occurred?
---
What proof do you have that it‚Äôs possible to sneak into west tek and just cherry pick the legendary mobs without purposely ignoring the rest of the enemies and taking more damage and wasting more time for trying to do it this way?
---
You don‚Äôt, you left that all to speculation, that‚Äôs why your point is a waste of time, it‚Äôs a weak argument.
---
&gt;It wouldn't make people have to compete.
---
Compete for what? That happens only because some assholes try to kill even 3 stars as fast as possible. The game perfectly allows whatever max amount of players can be on same server(32?) , to all kill the same 3 star legendary.
---
What you want makes it only worse. They will still be assholes and do the same thing, but now other players will have to rush to kill all "legendaries".
---
Rural plans often do. Not everybody has super fast unlimited internet.
---
Yep, if Stabilized (heavy weapons accuracy + armor piercing buff) actually worked for gatling laser / plasma, they would be pretty good. Even more so if the anti armor legendary worked for them. There's absolutely no reason for them to not, other than an oversight on Bethesda's part.
---
&gt;who is this day and age is gonna argue the case of homophobes
---
I'm not arguing in favor of homophobes.  The _high school students_ involved were not homophobes, they were just playing as assholes in a video game.  And more importantly, they were assholes to a protected class of people who like to stir up a lot of shit to get attention because deep down that's what it's all about for them.  He wasn't afraid of these people.  He wasn't in fear that they would _physically_ hurt them.  He got teased and ran to the press when he couldn't get the instant gratification he wanted from Bethesda's shit-tier reporting system.  
---
Stop, what?
---
personally, I never say that fallout 76 is trash, bugged AF yes 
---
At least it's rare, and I had the good fortune of dying in a spot that was off the beaten path, but fairly easy to find. 
---
I guess if it's another player, you're probably not getting the junk back anyway. 
---
Yep we need a laugh emote, an apologize emote, a kill *me* emote, and an, I'm going to kill *you* emote.
---
This is what bugs you? Is it annoying? Sure... I guess a little.
---
But what about switching your weapon to just fists EVERY 5 minutes!!
---
sorry about this... just a little... annoyed üòÇ
---
Actually... I'm not so sure about that. I don't see projectiles at all anymore for plasma weapons, the bolts just kind of "appear" at the target. Looks weird but they seem to have adjusted that? IDK test it out for yourself.
---
Yeah dude maybe read the post first
---
That's just what I hear from people who use them. I'll have to see for myself lol 
---
Sure it seems simple but that's if you just do basic string matching. Look up the scunthorpe problem and you'll understand why it isn't always so simple.
---
Yes that‚Äôs right, that‚Äôs why I went ahead and emphasized on using white with black.
---
This. The ban wave occurred after a maintenance where they supposedly swept for duped items and if they found any, also swept your account for "rares" in large stacks. That maintenance was probably just a scan because even people I know who I -know- have duped stuff in huge quantities still had it. That being said it was an awful scan because those people didn't get tagged and I suspect people who may have just accidentally picked up bags/etc did.
---
fuck that system. Thats just retarded. Even more so if its gangs of cocksuckers that abuse the system baiting people and killing them. Why cant we set up our own server instances and kick people as punishment ? Have the cocksuckers play on their own server with other cocksucker and not normal people.
---
if you are using a slower weapon (like the auto nade) id recommend 3. if using like say a .50 cal, gatling laser or mini-gun you can make due with 2
---
there should be a luck perk card that says "plants May randomly become nuked flora when you harvest them during a rad storm."
---
Oh it was definitely a thing previously. Like, I could unload a full gatling plasma core into an enemy from 5 feet and miss every shot -the bolts appeared behind them and went straight through. Now it seems fixed though. But yes, definitely get a regular plasma gun and test for yourself.
---
They were talking about pushing launch back and everybody freaked. Idk if they ever straight up came out and said it was because of the community backlash, but Bethesda tends to be very perceptive/reactive (depending on your view point) to their fans. Alot of times it works in their favor, like in the micro when a fan has a good individual idea. However, they let the community kinda bully them on some of the macro stuff. That's just my opinion, though, my post was more factually accurate irony. 
---
Why do you people keep trying to draw attention to youtubers you clearly dislike... Wouldn't you much prefer the opposite
---
So cite your video proof of trading causing people to get banned. Bethesda themselves saying legitimate methods are safe holds a lot more value than your words about "this is not the case".
---
If you get a bounty doing it, you are doing something considered "wrong". That wasn't PVP, it was abusing how high you can get melee damage to kill a non-hostile player through their slap-shield, and taking advantage of a new player. If you think killing non-hostile single-digit noobs with your lvl 100+ account is sporting, then I would argue that YOU might be missing a point or two. Certainly a waste of your time, asking for a bounty, and people are going to kill you for your bounty once you become enough of a nuisance. 
---
Why should they have all the fun?
---
I watched what he was doing. I know how he got the bounty. You have a pathological need to defend bad behavior or something. 
---
The dailies change every day but you can do them uh...daily.
---
As for weeklies, well, you can do them once a week...and they change every week.
---
I love different/creative camps. This is badass. 
---
I have to agree that some of the very situation legendary effects are extremely lackluster. A ghoul slaying item should provide a ton of benefit when I'm specifically killing ghouls for instance.
---
First and foremost I'm talking about the outside of West Tek. Going inside is another debate about whether or not that is efficient farming.
---
I've literally watched players leave areas and when I go in I find one meat pile lying in the same exact spot where and enemy always spawns but is not there. If you haven't realized yet everything spawns in the exact same spot every time.
---
I myself hunt legendaries efficiently and I find it extremely hard to believe that I'm the only one doing it when it is literally the end game.
---
I don't see you complaining about Watoga or the Whitespring needing a buff......so why are your panties in a bunch over me suggesting that other areas need a slight nerf?
---
Does that make a difference?
---
You said nobody is farming West Tek for XP. It is clearly not the case.
---
It'll be 5 weeks from now because YongYea is currently stuck on the Anthem sugartit and he's not gonna stop until he's sucked it completely dry
---
The only one I ever tried was the gatling but it could be fixed by now for all I know they are to heavy for me to pick up lol
---
Slap damage is capped at 5, has been ever since the exploiters were stacking explosive bobbleheads to one shot through slap.
---
Ok.
---
Nobody above level 150 is farming West Tek for XP.
---
Do you feel better now that I made that more clear?
---
After that it'll be the Outer Worlds. Mark my words.
---
Struggling to get fusion cores? I got rid of 52 fusion cores by running and using a gattling laser because they took up too much weight when I was lv60
---
well i'll try to change servers then. Maybe it'll help.
---
But honestly this system need to be reworked then. It's per-person daily quest - for what reason it should depend on server? Either i did it early today or not. 
---
I was visiting bunch of location i'm interested in every day and not even once for a week (or maybe 6 days) i've got daily event there. Ridiculous.
---
Yeah happens to me as well. At least once a night it will either freeze up or boot me. 
---
But all that is just like, your opinion, man.
---
The fact is they broke the rules, and got banned for it, conversation ends there.
---
Also you sound like someone who has never experienced discrimination due to your race, sexual orientation, and or religious beliefs. I say this because you automatically assume, without knowing these people, that they have negative intentions and are just seeking attention. News flash man, nothing happens unless it‚Äôs brought to people‚Äôs attention.
---
Keep in mind you‚Äôre hearing this from a straight, white, middle-class, atheist man. I have no bias here, just knowledge and facts, and most importantly I‚Äôm mature enough and have experienced enough to know that you‚Äôre just an ignorant person that lacks the knowledge to know any better.
---
Don‚Äôt worry one day you‚Äôll get rid of that systematic instinctual hate mommy and daddy raised you to have.
---
Not at home now so I can't check, but don't most games have a "reset to default" option? You'll lose the rest of your changes, but at least get push to talk back.
---
He's not a "fanboy" and nobody is crying 
---
It is holding something up.  Remove the other object first or connect stairs to whatever it is (support it) and then you should be able to get rid of it.  
---
OMG!! I never thought this suggestion would be so popular! But it just make sense
---
I‚Äôm online now if you want any help
---
I absolutely agree the character name should be displayed along with the account name.
---
u/ladydevann Do you think this would be possible?
---
No I think they can sense the sarcasm.
---
I like it, maybe even an option to booby Trap it for when someone contests the Workshop.
---
You assume I'm not 150. Again you are wrong.
---
&gt;Then that was a bug. They did not stack without some coercion.
---
No. Items stacked if they were the same.
---
&gt; know for a fact they didn't as I used to farm hunting rifles at launch and they never stacked at any point during any patch even during the beta.
---
That's because they were all different. Different mods, different durability, different health. 
---
&gt; I'm sure you're right and there were some duping methods that didn't create stacks of items, but the one that created the most dupes doubled an item, so from 1 to 2, then 2 to 4 etc etc and each time it stacked those in your inventory even if the items weren't supposed to stack. 
---
Duping directly didn't create a stack. You dropped stuff into container, and have a friend pick it up, then you made the game disconnect you, creating a rollback on your inventory where you still have the stuff, as well as your friend has a copy of them. Only by combining these, they would stack. Sure you could do it alone where joining back into server and picking it up might have created a stack, but that might have already been changed by them when duping involved getting the server to disconnect you. Prior you duped by artillery box which required a friend and you disconnected yourself.
---
You said Bethesda deleted stacks of unstackable items. No, they deleted large single amounts of duped items, whether they were stacked or not. You've never even crafted any armor or weapons during the time they stacked, because you think duping had to be involved to create stacks.
---
Don‚Äôt forget that you have to worship the ground obsidian walks on and praise fallout 2 and NV as the only real canon games
---
Well, likely because it isn't a unique name. They'd have to have done that from the start, locked people out from being able to use the same name, or else people would be hating on potentially wrong people.
---
It's an awesome idea that would have had to been there from the start of the game, I'd think.
---
The level 8 player nearby might think so too. 
---
Give us our daily thread
---
Counterpoint, grinding is a staple for MMOs :p
---
What do you need XP for?....you haven't finished your build yet?
---
I haven't slept in a bed or drank cranberry juice since level 100.
---
 I think then Stagger is the same for all three, and I believe that's what I need.
---
I'm just gonna say, I've slightly moved my CAMP 10x (that's 400 caps btw) while trying to perfect my base. Sometimes you place a piece and then it's just permanent, and you have to move your CAMP and start over.
---
I got 95% done once and then accidentally placed a half wall and couldn't remove it.
---
Another thing is, if your daily event comes up and you leave the server without doing it, it‚Äôs just gone from your quests. Idk if you can make it reappear or wait till the next day but I always found that so annoying and kinda devastating. 
---
I only started about two weeks ago. I‚Äôm level 45 currently it‚Äôs my only character. 
---
What
---
It‚Äôs weird I didn‚Äôt eat any mentats or collect anything and I got the glow it‚Äôs... really weird
---
How I typed for 5 years so just do it 
---
I know what you're talking about, this happened to me before also. One whole wall had a tree clipping into it and then when I went to remove this whole floor to redesign it, it wouldn't let me pick up the wall or store it.
---
Unfortunately the only solution is to replace your CAMP and start all over. Best of luck mate. 
---
Ironic. They could save other junk from getting scrapped, but not bulk itself.
---
FO76 plays like a slice of life. Besides that it is hard to find meaning in it.
---
"Two shot should provide double damage"
---
Like it used to? Absolutely.
---
"...maybe even at the cost of double ammo."
---
Dude no. That's just a regular rifle at that point.
---
Does anyone know if bulk items work properly now and actually weigh less? 
---
I've tried this a few times with things I didn't care about if I lost and it ne er worked for me.  So very risky indeed on anything of value.
---
I don‚Äôt farm white spring or watoga, I don‚Äôt farm legendaries at all. I go through west tek because it‚Äôs fun. I have a plethora of top end 3* gear but I find it‚Äôs more reliable to buy them with caps than farm legendaries. 
---
Also I barely ever see a legendary outside of west tek and every time I have it‚Äôs just a one star. I usually see at least a couple multi starred enemies inside west tek though.
---
All I‚Äôm saying is that your argument is weak man. Something does need to be changed regarding legendary drops though you‚Äôre right in regards to that.
---
It doesn't matter who you are.  The world will stick it to you eventually.  These groups don't need you going around virtue signaling for them.  But here you are, defending someone you don't even know because the "discrimination" you're so sure exists affected them.  If being teased by teenagers is your idea of discrimination then you're a snowflake like them too.  Man up.
---
Problem is the people I know that got banned for trading didn‚Äôt record themselves and so have no video evidence. Why would you need to record every transaction you make in a game that encourages community engagement? We know now that one should do this so they don‚Äôt get unfairly banned.
---
I was simply responding to your false statements that people were ‚Äúabsolutely lying about being banned for crafting/trading‚Äù. From my personal experience this is false but I see now that you‚Äôre a blind follower. 
---
Btw I heard there‚Äôs a pastor at Kanawa Ministry that has some Killer punch you should try! Don‚Äôt even bother to question what‚Äôs in it, once again follow blindly. 
---
Bro. You just bought it. Why are you asking us, instead of just playing it?
---
Nuke the fissure prime site. Join the quest to kill the scorchbeast queen. Upon successful completion you will be rewarded with a 2-3 star legendary item in addition to the 2-3 star legendary the queen drops on her corpse.
---
That seems like what you should be doing if you cannot be bothered to kill 1 star legendaries.
---
Is that clear enough? Do I need visual aids?
---
I've helped 15-20 below level 15 characters over the least 2 weeks. 
---
Only one of the new players was an alt, and 2 others didn't respond to a PSN message. 
---
The rest we're definitely new. Asked alot of questions and such.
---
I'm about to get back on. I don't know if I need any help because I don't know what I'm doing honestly. 
---
This problem refers to context though, when it comes to naming your character the context is clear, and basic string matching would still be valid.
---
It‚Äôs funny they never mentioned trading in that post once even though that‚Äôs what most people were worried about, deceptive wording much?
---
And you know damn good and well that Yong is gonna do some shitty jabs and title his vids something like, "The Outer Worlds shows Bethesda how a proper Single Player RPG is done" when Fallout 76 is a spin off that wasn't trying at all to be that. That's the equivalent of saying "The Outer Worlds shows Tetris how a proper Single Player RPG is done" 
---
I'm a member of both, but it lacks content. I'm expecting it to devolve into being nothing but cat pictures and inside "jokes".
---
A true claim should be reproducible. When I said I and many other people have tried the trading and crafting method and didn't get banned, you didn't believe me, but I am to believe that "people you know" are totally legit players?
---
Or just if you want someone to travel Appalachia with
---
Anytime I was ready to clean out my stash of decent gear to replace with better gear, I'd look all around on the map and message any low level player to see if they wanted my stuff.  All the times I did this I only TWICE got someone to come over and take it.  The second time, the guy knew nothing about the game, never played any fallout before.  He wants to do sniper so I made him a well decked out sniper rifle for his level.  He was like level 6 at the time.  Now I save all my known recipes and any legendary armor that drops that's close to his level.  I've been picking level 15 raider power armor pieces for him, and basically anything that looks like he could need.  Last night he logged on and was level 11.  I had several pieces of stuff as well as plans and recipes for him.  Some of this stuff, like marine armor and t60 plans I didn't get till after level 100!  We team up and we go take down some scorchbeasts, a deathclaw, then over to westek for a run though.  I logged off with him after 1-2 hours and he was 16.  All this because someone FINALLY accepted my offer of free stuff and help!
---
At level 20 you could farm events like collision course. 
---
You get exp, stuff, caps and plans for completing it, but also kill a bunch of scorched. 
---
The Momma Dolces food factory quest also works for this. 
---
Because initially the question was raised only anout crafting, by tge famous "900 hour guy". The rumors about trading causing the ban came about later.
---
I‚Äôve lived my entire life defending people I don‚Äôt know from people who are wrongfully harassing them. I enjoy bullying the bully. 
---
And no what makes a snowflake is someone that thinks their lives are ruined because they got banned from a game, gotcha, snowflake.
---
I just spoke about this on another post - And yes you will have to move the camp to resolve this 
---
I can. I wanted to post a lmgtfy
---
 I had an Anti Armor Auto Grenade Launcher for a while. As I was using that kind of thing and its real heavy it got sold. Foolish of me. ;)
---
Yes, or people would never repair them. Why bother when you can wait and get a free nuke zone?
---
Maybe on Reddit but there were lots of traders filing tickets and yet their concerns weren‚Äôt addressed in that statement?
---
Thanks for sharing! 
---
ive had it happen but it was because i hadnt discovered any marked spots near the death radius
---
"critical (hell even toxic) people"
---
You could not have more perfectly described the very subreddit you are on right now. 
---
Be the change you wish to see in the world  ï ‚Ä¢·¥•‚Ä¢ î
---
They could add more types of paint to the game and make the existing paints such as blue and yellow paint, usable for painting clothes
---
No, I just expect you not to make statements like ‚Äúabsolute lying‚Äù when you don‚Äôt have the evidence to back those claims up. I‚Äôm responding to you to try to ascertain the proof you have to back those claims up. Now that I know you‚Äôre just saying things with no evidence my job here is done, you‚Äôre not all knowing my friend not until the Mothman blesses you with such grace. 
---
This would work for a single player game, but not something like 76 imo.  Static drops like that are fine in limited quantities, however it is pretty terrible when it is for all loot in the game.  Granted, I would much prefer if they would narrow loot tables down more.  More towards actual MMO play where specific areas/specific mobs are what you want to farm for specific pieces of gear.  So like you want right arm pieces, you need to farm watoga for legendary bots.  Shotguns - west tek super mutants,  chest pieces - white springs, etc... as examples.  Could broaden it to be more or less inclusive, just something that lessens RNG a bit so grinding isn't such a crapshoot and you can focus farm for things you want rather than just pray to RNGesus. 
---
Granted, this is also coming from a guy who would spend a week+ farming the same zone/mob for hours on end a day for something as simple as a cosmetic item or a minor clicky (click item for buff/effect) on top of the hours of grinding for actual gear/progression

you get them for free eventually and you'll be super mad at yourself for wasting caps on them
---
Would be better. i changed to bloodied build today and now i'm so angry because of this bug
---
That's probably the ideal combo of legendary effects for a blackpowder weapon. Awesome!
---
And it does this even if your reticle is over what you're trying to target, too.
---
Is this true? Even outside the boundaries of your workshop? Let me guess- you can kill players within your workshop with no penalty even if it's not contested right? That explains a lot. Watch out when sightseeing other player settlements!
---
Depends on location white springs or watago I think alt anyone under 40 west of the savage divide is new
---
Thank god! I almost feel like it‚Äôs pointless to capture things when you way materials gained va materials lost
---
yeah I think the announcement of free dlc has gotten people to pay attention and people are trickling in yay
---
If you just want xp and have a shit load of ammo you can just keep destroying vertibirds at a workshop. Its like 300-500xp each kill and only costs aluminum and steel to repair the landing pad.
---
This is from memory as I don't have a map handy (at work). There's the BBQ place, near site... alpha, I think? One of the sites, there's only one BBQ place. In the savage divide, lower. It's about midway between those on the X axis and about level with the BBQ place. There's an area with a rope and wooden planks bridge, that's where the alien was. Just beyond it is a small lake that leads down to a slightly bigger lake (that the bridge is over). 
---
Yeah I get that lol
---
I recently re started a new character, lvl 50 now but i have seen alot of lower players myself. Wondering the same since they could be trying to farm rare outfits but im being optimistic. Games more stable, new content on way and sales are good for bringing people back or in.
---
Once again, use the fucking search bar for yourself and you'll see the scores of people who made extensive posts disproving these claims. Many of them have good video proofs as well. Don't go spreading around false info about trades causing bans. This the "trade steal" rumor shit all over again. It's not ny job to dig up weeks old posts and spoon feed them to you.
---
Same here
---
I love you. 
---
That happened later. This was shortly after 900 hour guys huge post that blew up.
---
That is the usual option people go with. melee is a lot more reliable but you do take more damage and put yourself at risk more often which is why people usually go with a hybrid build so they have some ranged option to start a fight with. What you focus is obviously your choice, me saying rifles was just an example but you can do melee just as easily. As long as you don't split your choices and try to do them both at the same time you will be fine. Rifles aren't bad though, even with TSE being nerfed you still have Instigating and Anti-armor for options. Instigating is probably your best bet if you aren't going Bloodied. It goes well with a melee build since you get the double damage and then can finish it off with melee.
---
Unless they broke something again mine changes the stats on my explosive shotgun 
---
How would you deal with a high level, auto radium rifle? Or if you are stationary, a nuke grenade?  How does born survivor work when available health is diminishing due to rad damage? Would you eventually be forced to use radaway?
---
It does for notifications. If you are unsubbed from a content creator that you don't like, but YT still forces them on you. Click on the notifications three dots -&gt; block 'channel name'.
---
Ummm sorry to sound dumb. But how/where do you do this? 
---
could you look for the link? would be nice
---
This lol I still forget and try to do that every time I redo my camp lol
---
You‚Äôre obviously not Rick C-137. I‚Äôve scoured the archives and nothing proves what you‚Äôre claiming but ok, have fun with spreading your falsities and claiming them as absolute fact. 
---
What you're proposing makes legendary drops boring. Basically you want a smaller loot pool to increase your odds of finding what you want.
---
What I'm proposing is essentially an increase in the probability of getting a chance at a spin of the wheel.
---
You want getting good loot to be easier I want to increase the probability of good loot through an increased chance. Basically you want to make the daily pick 4 a pick 3 where as I want to reduce the price of the ticket so I can get more chances at winning the pick 4. Obviously which idea is better is debatable..... what's not debatable is how unnecessary it is to attack someone for not sharing your view.
---
I don‚Äôt have the mutation, but would also love a chicken coop
---
Not true for me. It HAS done it on the wheel as well for me. Several times. 
---
the stagger is the same yes, but the chance of triggering it goes from 4, 8 and 12% chance. 
---
Lol, the last legendary 3\* I took out had a coffee cup. It didn't even come with coffee. 
---
It should be showing you a measurable difference on the status screen. Maybe it's just bugged on the Harpoon gun, it seems to work with everything else.
---
I‚Äôve not come across a decent semi auto yet, but sure I‚Äôll grab one as and when. Right now I‚Äôm a pistol and rifle kind a guy. I do have a fire garden fork though which is useful for close up stuff, but it‚Äôs only level 5.
---
It would basically be a rifle with double the fire rate. Still would be better than what we have now.
---
Oh
---
Scratch that, figured it out. What is the benefit of scrapping junk?
---
No No No Linda listen! People filed claims before that directly to Bethesda but didn‚Äôt make posts about it. I wouldn‚Äôt expect a grandstander like you to understand that tho
---
Would love this..being that when I make a boy toon. It doesn't have my ID name which is a girl name. Being that I'm a girl. :P
---
But you miss the entire point.
---
The point is to make farming more efficient. You know as well as I do that the SBQ fight isn't efficient. Farming Watoga and Whitespring is what peop are doing.
---
25k
---
25000 caps per character, 125000 caps for account
---
I don't think there is any, I mean nobody mentioned it from Bethesda or online
---
Sorry dude, it was last week sometime, it would be like looking for a needle in a haystack!
---
 Of course. Well I can do 2 easily enough and if I spit out 12 it should proc. ;)
---
Replayed this the other day as i restarted a new build and a ghoul comes walking in and he was labeled J47 or something and they just called his number a little before that. Didnt notice that my first time. Thought it was a nice touch. I probably shouldnt have killed him so fast...
---
Grafton steel. Run through kill all the super mutants. Log out and back in repeat till mid 30s to 40s depending on spec and skill. Then go do westek till the end of days.
---
There's a coal deposit just West of Charleston Landfill you can set camp on. It has a nice "troll under the bridge" aesthetic to it. It's where the road and railroad meet. 
---
Don't feed the trolls.
---
How can you be so sure they were absolutely legit? Because you "knew" them?
---
you are absolutely brilliant for this. wow
---
Still haven't encountered the acid rain that I think I heard about.
---
-44 now...lul
---
That didn't stay up long
---
"Scoured the archives" lol just like you were claiming Bethesda never made any official statement. 
---
damn...im praying. do you know if the bug is just that you can't see the effect? i'm still doing a shitton of damage even if its not displayed
---
No wonder we are seeing so many god roll weapons being sold in multiple groups. 
---
I forgot about how they screwed up this trivial yet important detail that literally every other major game out there gets right.
---
I run maxed ghoulish and Radicool, so I normally have 80% rads anyhow. I don't use Born Survivor since I'd be wasting stimpaks constantly. Honestly, If I got hit a couple of times it'd be over, I have to get the first hit. I one-shot almost everyone, but I'm a total glass cannon. 
---
Scrapping junk will break it down to components that weigh less than the junk would
---
Thanks for telling
---
Sounds like they (and people sticking up for them) are the real snowflakes, if they can't handle the consequences of their actions.
---
&gt; No. Items stacked if they were the same.
---
No, they didn't.
---
&gt; That's because they were all different. Different mods, different durability, different health.
---
No, they weren't. Full condition base hunting rifles didn't stack.
---
&gt; Duping directly didn't create a stack.
---
Yes, it did.
---
&gt; You said Bethesda deleted stacks of unstackable items. No, they deleted large single amounts of duped items, whether they were stacked or not.
---
Yes, they did.
---
Glad I learned this now early into game lol thanks 
---
I am going on now if you still need that. GT is porkpr0ducts
---
Just tested it, it works. Your not going to see a huge change it's based of your weapons base dmg before bloodied kicks in. So if your weps base is less than 100 dmg those 5 points should only add 10 or 20 dmg,at least that's my understanding of it. I traded out my demo for max weapon smith after the ( fix ).
---
The reduction in price is actually encouraging a lot of people to buy the game. I have talked to many such new playetmrs and they said "why not buy the game if it's such low price now"?
---
nah you wont. Too many toxic assholes.
---
Pardon my stupid, (not thread related) but how did you get cult of the mothman by your name? Been on reddit a bit and can‚Äòt figure it out for the life of me.
---
A solution is to buy or build a nice gaming pc. Plug pc into hdtv, plug ps4 remote into pc with full support, then enjoy smooth 60fps gaming like i do üôÇ
---
Per Baronik upthread: 25000 per character, 125000 per account
---
That's exactly how I would picture it. It would allow teams of Wanted players if they choose it, while preventing people from being an "accomplice" without penalties. 
---
Aha and now we get to the root of it! Let the character speculation begin! 
---
Yes I knew them quite well, some irl. Some were part of RP communities I participated in and some were simply wasteland traders trying to make a living in the harsh environment that is Appalachia. 
---
But you don‚Äôt want there to be any innocents caught up in this ban, so in your mind they must all be illegitimate in some way right? 
---
Google fo 76 outfits or apparel ( sorry spelling) should find pretty good guide
---
Oh wow, didn't know it !
---
I believe the way it works is each one reduces weight by 20% of the weight after each item is taken into effect so example is cannonball weighs 1 then is reduced to .8 then is reduced by 20% of that Weight I could be wrong but I know if you have a full set it won't weigh completely zero even if it says it weighs zero it will eventually take up weight if you have alot of that ammo.
---
true.. but with an explosive .50 cal spitting out 250 rounds, someones gonna be stuck for a little while
---
for my big guns setup i also run Stabilized so my pellets will hit my targets a bit farther away
---
Thanks!  I know now what I‚Äôll be doing tonight!
---
Reduce weight by 90%
---
Haha both of my ranged characters are bloodied. I‚Äôm leveling a melee non-Bloodied alt to try out melee and get some weapon variety (seriously, as a Bloodied build... there‚Äôs basically only one Legendary prefix you want for weapons, and 95% for armor!
---
Hold your horses there buddy, I was responding to your claims of ‚Äúabsolute lying‚Äù not BGS‚Äôs sorry excuse of a statement, way to make stuff up again tho!
---
How does it stack with perks that reduce ammo weight? 
---
I'll take, "Things we've been asking for since release" for 500, Alex.
---
Kinda what I thought, thanks! 
---
I've mentioned this to the Dev's before but I'll bring that back up again.
---
I have certain ammo types that weigh nothing, I have the perk and some ammo pieces, 5mm for example has no weight.
---
&gt;the scunthorpe problem
---
also the ID you created doesnt even get saved anywhere, if you log in from another console or pc its just a blank when you highlight the character in character select. so the name literally only exists because the character needs a label to set it apart from other character you have on your account

---
It's flair, click on the subreddit page. Dunno exactly where as I'm on mobile but it will be called Flair
---
I have a laptop that would undoubtedly do a better job than the PS4 (nothing too recent, but an i7 with a 970m) but this is besides the point. Some people do not have this option and there should be minimum level of stability across all platforms.
---
Comments like this are unhelpful and could be said of any poorly performing console versions of a multiplatform release.
---
Every banned player has submitted tickets claiming to be innocent. So you want to say every ban was a mistake and that no actual duping has ever happened?
---
Also I fail to understand your logic. You refuse to believe when I say that I and other people have tested the methods, yet you want me ti believe these people just because you knew them? Why shoukd I? It has nothing to do with what I want or not. People have provided pretty solid proof that trading and crafting does not cause bans. Did yo stare at these friends' screens all the while they played to be so sure? Surely, all anyone has to do is provide a proof that trading caused their account to be banned, and the matter will be open for debate. At present there is no proof for your claims.
---
I want to be able to build a "Lure" in my CAMP, and when activated it calls in the local MOB's to try and attack the lure, your job is to make a CAMP to protect it and to help.
---
Each wave of mobs would get stronger until they start to include legendaries,   the mission would end when the lure is destroyed, or you turn it off.
---
Agreed. My account name is the one I use for many things. The problem is no one provinces it right.
---
It's pronounced "dickgobbler" the r,e,m,i,j,i,d,o are silent.
---
sure but a lot of people prefer to earn their gear, as they find it more rewarding.  
---
You do you, there is no right way to acquire gear so long as you are enjoying the game.
---
90% max
---
I mean 1.26x damage would be better than what we have now. (1.25x, iirc)
---
I'd really prefer more damage per shot than more shots. Higher rate of fire just means you run out of ammo quicker, and that shit is already a grind.
---
Do you have your Xbox set to instant on mode? I've noticed if you leave it in that state it makes a lot of games not function properly. Try doing a "cold boot" of the Xbox by going to the setting and hitting restart console and see if that helps with the crashing a bit. 
---
I only crash/disconnect once or twice per 10-16 hour game sessions. 
---
Sorry man that sucks a lot :/. Not sure how much they will do or if it violates any rules but you could try
---
sadly locks don't save with the stored door and have to be reapplied when building that door again
---
Ad victorium. Or whatever cliche fallout responce I can give. Thank you
---
If u but a key for cheaper then market price u take the risk of losing the money.
---
 LOL. I mostly plan to fire it into the floor between us.
---
if the price is too good to be true, it commonly is. to be frank though you should have changed the E-mail on the account and the password
---
I‚Äôve never had this bug so it‚Äôs not there to annoy me, I do understand that that would be frustrating though. 
---
Have you tried adding say 10000 rounds of 5mm to your stash to see if it has no weight or just says no weight?
---
You can make any level lower or equal to you
---
How does it stack with perks for ammo weight? 
---
I hold it on my person for that very reason, if I put it in my stash, it weighs the original amount as far as I can tell 
---
i just hit 35 and i went to craft the lvl 35 parts but they dont show up
---
90% max AFAIK. 
---
Can you look into whether the bugged / non-appearing Dailies are being addressed this patch or is currently being worked on?  Queen of the Hunt / Heart of the Enemy chief among them but there are a number of other ones that never show any more.
---
I know the patch is tomorrow, but the 'I'll see if it's fixed this patch in the notes' hasn't worked out so well the last few months.  :)
---
Hard to block someone's account if they're a tool if you never see their account.
---
Doesn't help that crouching removes you from the map, so it's already hard to block assholes.
---
Do you have any idea how those event work?
---
I join, monster pop in front of me, I kill it with a single grenade. How/where is a level 8 implicated?
---
I've had this happen a few times, but I never got a warning just an empty list. It is apparently an issue with your Bethesda account syncing properly. It ended up fixing itself after about an hour of playing. I tried all the steps you did to fix it, but also completely logged out of and restarted the bethesda launcher. Ended up just having to wait. 
---
You might need to lodge a ticket if that didn't work. 
---
Have a little fun
---
I am working on a character that will not begin quests until level 45 or 50, depending on the reward. With the relevant perks some of these weapons can go far in the game, especially PvE.
---
I've read others say events toward them but I've never seen confirmation on it. 
---
I couldn't - it was regestered for seller's gmail, I didn't have access to.
---
Never said anything about every player that submits a ticket being innocent, obviously that‚Äôs not the case. 
---
I‚Äôm simply responding to your claims of ‚Äúabsolutely lying‚Äù that you have failed to backup. You‚Äôre the one who made this claim initially and I wouldn‚Äôt have responded to your comment if you hadn‚Äôt made such broad generalizations.  You don‚Äôt need to believe me, I just don‚Äôt like when people act like they know it all when they don‚Äôt.
---
Notice now it‚Äôs ‚Äúpretty good proof‚Äù not irrefutable as was implied in your ‚Äúabsolutely lying‚Äù statement. You would assume that people who traded would be re-instated but this is not the case, believe me or don‚Äôt idc, just don‚Äôt go spewing nonsense unless you can back it up.
---
Another you could try is deleting the locally stored save data (it only resets your settings, not your in game progress). Though I've notice this only helps slightly. 
---
I know in stash it does. I mean so you can see your character weight change 
---
I don't care about the money, but about the progress I've lost...
---
Congrats on hitting 100.  I did the same about 9 hours ago. :)
---
Loving the game.  The random encounters and messages left behind fit the desolate NPC-less world.
---
\-G
---
There are tonnes of us on PC, definitely not dead. 
---
But how to report anything to bethesda? I'm logged on official forum, but don't see any way to report it.
---
Installing the game as at least 50 gigabytes just as a start.
---
that depends on the enemies resistances. which is why AA is so good for pvp as people will tend to have tanky armor.
---
Yep we'll the thing is if u buy it for 6 dollars probably was someone that stole a credit card and u help them launder the money
---
Most of the rare outfits are event or quest rewards. The rest spawn on the traveling responder vendor bor that spawns at Chatleston station.
---
only if they let us change them. I knew they wouldn't be displayed so I named all my characters 'boob'
---
I love fallout 76 been playing a couple times a week but they did reuse a lot if not close to all assets from 4 so why not just give us the other map to
---
Well, he still selling those accounts on Allegro (biggest auction portal in Poland, like ebay) and auction site doesn't do anything about it...
---
I don't want ... To set the world on fiiirreee...
---
probably have to create a new character and then trade it
---
but your in-game networth (lol) could be unlimited..buy something really expensive..count that towards your 'assets'
---
great job on being another dweller from 13.
---
the holy trinity did make me, Wolfenstein, doom, diablo, but the pc gamer mag junktown Preview demo, exiting vault 13, the search for water chip, the search for the power armor components in the crater, defeating the master, this was the game experience that made me into a pc gamer in my first formative moments as a computer user at age 15. 
---
I enjoy 76 for its 4 elements of classic inspired adventure, RP character and base building, open vast wandering zen, and the dark glow of radiated post war contemplation, that immortal feeling of mankind's auto destruction impulse.
---
hopefully they will finish the game with its 5th identity piece, by adding a system that will allow for intricate interaction between players, the world, the enemies, and each other in both cooperation and in competitive rivalry. I envision this as a two piece system equally involving the addition of the community for creating content inside the game such as modes and locations, cities/towns, etc, and also UI/mod type additions to its usability, and the other part a deeper set of systems like karma and permanent server / higher player count population within server so that player choices will have impact and the effect will be multiplicative, creating lasting gameplay experiences to outdo the original greats like SWG or Wow.
---
Yep why would they. They make money off of it and probably no legal reasons to stop.
---
basic ones..like if you get a tato..u can immediately craft tato soup..using that as an example..but anything that involves multiple ingredients u will need to find the recipes
---
Yup, well said. ESAD, dupers.
---
Sounds more like you leased the game. 
---
You're a heck of a lot more trusting than I would be.
---
Oh man you got me. I'm still a bit salty I paid full price for this trash tbh
---
You are taking my comment to literal, which after rereading my post is understandable. I worded it poorly. I was speaking of perks in general not just the damage ones, the example i mentioned was just an example of splitting perk upgrading up and not finishing the build so using only damage perk cards in the example was my mistake. So what i mean is not waste level up perk card options on the rifle (since he want's to main melee), so he should get his melee cards first. Be it damage, or utility, the primary damage source for his build should be finished before getting cards for the secondary damage source.
---
PvE early is easy, but after lvl 25 if you don't focus on one thing it becomes a LOT harder. I made this mistake when I was leveling and had to wait until level 70+ to finish the quest line because I couldn't kill stuff quick enough in the silo's. I constantly ran out of ammo because it would take multiple clips to kill something, etc. etc. In the end it only slows you down. If i was maining melee it probably wouldn't have been as bad, but I wasn't...It didn't bother me since I like to take my time with the story anyways but at the end it was harsh. Once I hit the Glassed Cavern part of the story it became a LOT harder to kill things and didn't get any easier because I split between my rifle and my melee. I couldn't kill still fast enough and would end up getting mobbed to death in dense areas.
---
Or they could just use this as the perfect reason to add raiders.. even if they only comes after bounties.
---
If your on ps4 I'll give you mine I finished that quest a while ago 
---
You can set them down somewhere, switch accounts, and hope you join the same server.
---
Is it a way to rollback the account?
---
If you have any friends online you can join their server, put items in a world containers, quit to menu and join that friend's server and pick up loot in that world container. No guarantees that some random person won't find your loot, or that random friend won't server hop/log off, server crash or any other number of things.
---
What I did was run the glass cavern daily and at the end is the bos soldier who has some bos armor that can be scrapped. Eventually you have the chance of learning the bos mod from scrapping the armor
---
Yes the game is sad when your wearing POWER ARMOR and get one shot by a tambourine!
---
( I suggest you google what a tambourine is for some context)
---
I want to give that thought an award, I don't want to spend 4 dollars and give my credit card info the Reddit. That's an outstanding vision sir, and not entirely improbable either. I hope that it comes to manifestation.
---
You seem to care more about trivialization than efficiency. You won't do SBQ because it takes too long, you won't kill one star legendaries- are you the laziest human on the planet?
---
End game content I had X01 power armor had 3 farmed TSE weapons had one of those fighting the SBQ at low level it was a level 25 weapon so yeah at 800 points of damage a shit yeah I say I was doing something. I'm explored the entire map that's how I got from 40-65. I work 65 hours a week on average and get to play maybe 2 hours at most 3 to 4 nights a week. Congrats on your opinion and I'm sorry the dupers hurt you. But I honestly never saw where they ruined the game. 
---
Safest way is to do it through a friend. If your friend gets annoyed by holding your stuff while you join back then find a new friend. People shouldn‚Äôt get annoyed that easily. But really. Don‚Äôt just sit it down and join back. Anything could happen. 
---
The ole powerfist, quick in and out with some ultraviolence eh?
---
Right? Literally every mmo does this. No need to reinvent the wheel bethesda.
---
Well, in the wasteland that would probably be a inconvenience but would happen. Not everything leads to a grand discovery. If it did it‚Äôd be lame.
---
What platform are you and what were you doing at the time of your disconnect....
---
Agreed. The mutants spawn in from weird angles, try not to get stuck inside the buildings. Sniping is best, but sometimes you have to peak in and kite them out a bit to isolate. Level 20 is tough. You are dealing with higher level enemies, and you aren't really optimized for anything yet. Fire Axes, Hardened Hunting Rifles  &amp; Hardened Pump Action Shotguns are your friend. 
---
I can agree with that but I never played the game for a financial gain either in the game or in real life gain. Once I out leveled gear I found someone close to the gear and gave it to them. My camps were built to help those in need and I tend to help when I see someone getting their ass kicked. The game is what you make it in the end. If you focus on the bad that's all you will see. 
---
I would do pc but none of my friends would switch
---
I don‚Äôt quite understand what you mean buddy with that last bit sorry?
---
This right here. Finding the mainframe cores takes entirely too long. Repair them if you can, and it'll make the process soooo much faster.
---
Because he‚Äôd be mobbed all the time? Defeats the purpose of a randomly wanderering merchant?
---
What we need is to keep him on a predictable route, last path map I saw took him pretty much *EVERYWHERE*. Also maybe add in something like those radio towers from 4, where when you‚Äôre somewhat close you can pick up a signal and home in on him
---
I named mine Ana L. Beeds hoping it would be visable. I was disappointed.....
---
Awesome
---
It's the
---
Yes please
---
Until they reach level 5, they can create quite a nuisance. I plan to always have a newbie to harass high levels and their castle camps. No clothes or armor required, Little general Butt naked.
---
Well I didn‚Äôt know you could make them at the nuclear plants until today. I‚Äôve been farming and have a lot now. No need to flex my guy
---
I've gotten multiple BOS armor plans from Grafton Monsters, and the train car East of Watoga Train Station.
---
Not dead and no where near as many issues and crashes.
---
lol this was a major problem at release cause people didnt understand they needed to scrap junk to save stash space
---
The tall bridge you can see from Flatwoods there is one ghoul you can kill then it will get back up and just walk off the bridge and walk in the air.
---
The only issue with this story is, NOBODY EXPECTS THE SPANISH INQUISITION!
---
True, but this is a Fallout title.  I‚Äôm expecting something with effort to have some sort of worthwhile reward.
---
Has someone made a support ticket for this? I‚Äôm not sure how myself. It‚Äôs quite annoying as I want to craft the confederate hats and sell to bots but cannot ü§î
---
Some people dont have world skills and need to survive off clickbait controversy. Sad
---
Sometimes you have to server hop to get them
---
There is no way. Without the registered email, you never owned it, and have no way to prove that you ever did.
---
Unlucky. I've snagged them maybe 2/10 trying.
---
I had one spawn on the road between The Whitespring and The Whitespring Station. I was talking with a friend that regularly kept their camp on the road down near the Enclave bunker, he was ahead of me, nearing his camp, I stopped for a moment, turned around was startled when I almost got smacked with a fire hydrant. I jumped, and used my jet pack to escape to the side and took the Behemoth down before he could reach the camp.
---
Common place for lead, so ya unlucky.
---
I laughed a lot, cuz reminded me of actually dealing with the DMV.
---
You're character has a carry weight. Some things, like Bobby pins have a very small weight but still says 0. So for your 5mm have you tried storing it to see how much the weight of your character changes? Not your stash weight but the characters c as rly weight
---
That's not what he's talking about at all. Snarky douchebag.
---
Where is this man's Gold?
---
Yes, it is possible to be an asshole.
---
Hey! Thanks for the reply. That‚Äôs great to hear! Digging the game, but losing resources bums me out. Looking forward to that update.
---
Gun Fu makes the problem worse unfortunately.
---
Never made fusion cores, they're just fairly easy to find imo
---
Caveat emptor.
---
ok, thx
---
Get in that excavator PA and go to lucky hole mine. You'll a ton of lead
---
Agreed, gotta keep an eye on the atom shop! I was never a fan on that hat, I wanna show off my hair, haha
---
In short, yes. My wife is a die hard Fallout fan and was super excited for 76 to come out so we could play together. Based on bad reviews I delayed playing for awhile and even when I started playing was a dick about it. I regret that now. Once I started crafting and building, the game changed for me. I now have things to work for, to grind for. I'm not necessarily motivated to complete missions for the sake of completion. However, if a mission will get me closer to being able to build or craft something new I'll spend hours on it. I'm having a ton of fun with it. 
---
or /r/market76
---
I‚Äôll jump on now 
---
Dammit, Preston. I already helped them. 
---
Hey how about love for the rpg builds that got nerfed with the TSE nerf?
---
Hmm i have a gauss one that is rotting in my chest. Tile to get money ! 
---
As a level 32 I just dropped like 16 at the overseer camp.. I never use power armor (yet) and they take 3.00 weight each! I had almost 30! Not sure how I had that much..
---
Nick Valentine approves. 
---
"Everyone agrees, including Bethesda."
---
Yeah it was worded strangely.
---
That happened to us once this past weekend.  We didn't kill the sbq before the time expired so the quest failed. The sbq didn't fly off and disappear, she stayed on the ground and we killed her and got her loot.
---
I mean, they kinda have that already with teams. You‚Äôd think that would have been a feature implemented earlier on considering the various base building aspects being specific to the world your in and the amount of gameplay revolving around it.
---
k bud
---
Keep drinkin that kool aid
---
Actually, I think that's a stance gamers take that has nothing to do with Fallout. 
---
There's the mindset that everything, literally everything in a game, has to give something that is of value. Hence, people thinking that Scorch beasts should drop something amazing. But why?
---
I tried to wait to finish that quest until I was Level 25 so Perfect Storm would be the same level when I got it. Works pretty good!
---
Was he running serendipity for dodge chance? Because automatic weapons are the way to go to counter that.
---
I see that happens to accept its dead and float there
---
Most of the notes in Charleston are signed by R, but there's no indication of who it is. Your post got me curious, and I decided to look it up online. I don't think they wanted to be known as most of their messages are slightly cryptic and a bit of a mystery. None of the NPCs in that are have a name starting with R except for Roselynn, but she's definitely not responsible for R's notes.
---
R is just a ghost from a past, it seems. Somebody who was influential, but didn't want to be known by name.
---
You can find list of the notes here:
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Charleston](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Charleston)
---
I have used this technique many, many times. It can be disasterous, however ive only been unlucky once out of maybe a dozen times doing it.
---
thanks Ill just have to use a friend. Sounds like Bethesda should add account lockers that can share equipment between accounts. 
---
He really comes off as a low effort Youtuber. The 900 hr guy ban video for me was a real stand out. If he bothered to dig just a little below the surface by reading more than a couple of gaming media articles and the top couple of reddit posts, he would have known the whole situation was fishy from the beginning.
---
I'm sure you'r not. But after spending two hours gathering stuff to sell and scrap, I was pisssed and couldn't do anything about it.
---
Plasma Pistols and Rifles do 2 types of damage which unfortunately makes them really ineffective because of the way armor works in the game. 
---
Ohhhh I‚Äôve been storing all 5mm I have so can only talk for the 4700 I have right now 
---
&gt;"We gave an initial ban of three days while our CS team looked into the matter further to verify the individuals involved and what took place," a Bethesda spokesperson told Eurogamer. "After additional review, we have now permanently banned the players we've identified."
---

Don't let facts get in the way of your feelings.
---
Where do I sign?
---
I just got the game. 
---
Camp Venture has a pretty good haul but I have to say most of my lead I pick up through Junk scraps.  The lead pipe weapon is pretty good and I can always snag three out of the enclave bunker.  If you're picking up junk then you shouldn't have to worry about making special runs just for lead. 
---
Look for toys like wooden blocks, any dumbell (the heavier the more lead), pencils, paint, rat poison, and batteries which all contain lead.
---
Lmfao this is the best thing I‚Äôve ever seen!? How do I do it!!??
---
Sorry, I'm very new to this type of gaming. I am using Xbox. 
---
You have to click on the part you want to craft. Then it should give you the choice of 25 or 35. Just like when crafting other armor.
---
Yong makes money off the outrage  and  reading reddit posts but it's not like his videos aren't accurate. FO76 has been shitty and continuing to be shitty so can you blame a guy for easy pickings? This game needs to be put down already.
---
I‚Äôm not sure how to do that :/
---
His next video is going to be how this subreddit hates him lol
---
Hell if Reddit was not around half the Youtubers would have no insights or content.
---
No. Unless you are bulking to sell, the only items that make sense to bulk for weight reduction purposes are aluminum and lead.
---
I love how people who hate on these YouTubers seem to be so obsessed with them.
---
yeah they are still op on melee builds. which is why i said seemingly to those who first pick it up and think "well this is lame" 
---
You're disturbed alright. 
---
I think it's more disturbed that people continue to play this garbage. Have some self-respect man.
---
It's funny.. i actually changed my account name through the official customer support just so i could roleplay.. which is kind of ridiculous now that i think about it.. But i wanted to be the Mysterious Stranger so.. Unfortunately it was taken, but since the game is so buggy i just pretended to be a malfunctioning code and used: ID_Mysterious_Stranger
---
I found a whopping 6 videos of him about Fallout 76. How is this relevant to this sub?
---
Well, apparently everyone hates 76 but have you ever been to the comments section of any post by the Fallout social media accounts?
---
&gt; But the level of coding we're talking about is...pretty extreme.
---
(Assuming the climate system is in any way similar to previous Creation Engine games)
---
Yeah, it's like, you have to attach a Spell to the weather record and that spell has to be a continuous effect spell. That's mind-blowingly hard to do.
---
The "worn veil" will get you in. Go to AMR medical and find the dead woman in the alley behind the building and grab another one.
---
Yeah, don't let facts get in the way of your feelings indeed. What was that thing I sad up above? 
---
&gt;Anything that happened to them was because they were unrepentant fuckwaffles about it, because it was a 3 day ban until they were shitheads, and then it became permanent.
---
Hmmm, where would I get the idea that they were unrepentant fuckwaffles?  
---
Let's check the article you linked and didn't read beyond cherrypicking!  
---
&gt;I do not regret the incident. I will not apologise given the opportunity.
---
I guess it's true. Facts really DON'T care about your feelings. 
---
&lt;3
---
I know this is kinda off topic, but there's also a bug where you hop in a power armor suit with a punching item equipped, where whenever you try to swap to any weapon and switch back using the "last weapon" button, it'll tell you that you can't equip the selected item, no matter what. Found that out the hard way when I was sniping mole miners and a foreman found me and started to rush me. Went to switch, and was told that my level 25 medic's double barrel shotty couldn't be equipped, even though I'm halfway to level 30
---
And you believe this game is garbage because others say so, having never played it yourself. Exactly the kind of sheep Yongyea thrives on.
---
http://upli.st/l/list-of-all-ascii-emoticons
---
Cause some people are still waiting for the game to get fixed, and like to hear updates and not sit in a forum. Not like Kotaku's covering video games anymore.
---
Was announced yesterday afternoon that it will be tomorrow‚Äôs date. 
---
It would be cool if the game looked at your favorite weapons (by time equipped or something) and made it more likely to drop a weapon you'll use.  Granted if I get a really nice dragon or something I'll still probably play around with it but I REALLY want a 3 star .50 cal machine gun.
---
How many videos has he made about Fallout 76? I found 6 by simple search. How is he any relevance?
---
Fallout 3 reference
---
Picked up a bloodied handmade and a bloodied ripper recently. 
---
So the 14th? Ok I missed the second announcement, thanks!
---
Yeah, it can totally just be used for display purposes rather than anything functional and wouldn't be that confusing.
---
then fuck them. the game is fun to level up and just play.
---
It's a joke about how 2 weeks after the Unstoppables event ended, Yongyea made a video about it as if it was hot news.
---
No, not really. If you have class freak you could try and get ALL the mutations and then just remove 1 you really hate. Better to trade for serums.
---
no, the 13.
---
I picked up, and sold, a Explosive Black Powder Rifle just the other day. 
---
The 13th, today is the 12th. No worries! Keep on keepin on.
---
PC?
---
I've seen him a few times.  The best was when he was randomly on top of Charleston capital fighting other super mutants.
---
Today‚Äôs the 13th.
---
Thank you sir...thank you
---
Did you grind an event or Whitesprings or was it a random drop from a Legendary?
---
&gt;for a safe filled with garbage items
---
If you've played any BSG game ever, this should come as no surprise to you. I can't tell you how many "master" locked safes I opened in Oblivion &amp; Skyrim that had nothing but some cabbage and a couple septims, or locked doors/terminals in F03 &amp; FO4 that had nothing of value behind them.
---
Dumb question are you out of fusion cores? That's the only thing I can think of that causes something like that.
---
the majority of wastelanders are cool..there are a few clowns roaming around tho
---
Right cause bitching someone out is okay. GTFOH.
---
When I log in my max weight is 540, if however I exit my armor it will drop to 440. Without the shocks it will update be 340, hopefully this has helped.
---
Lmao
---
Which power armor? are you using calibrated shock mods?
---
I assume OP is talking about the new "brewing and distilling" recipes that are coming in tomorrow/s update.
---
Today is the 13th.
---
Ah. So, time zones ... 
---
Seems the question I should be asking is, what time in what time zone is the release planned for?
---
Thank you for your reply. I am very new to this type of gaming. I have recently been able to hang out with a few very nice people in the game who are talking me through some of my difficulties with playing FO76.  Most of the issues are that I don't know how to use the controller or adjust settings. But, slowly, I am starting to get the hang of it. At my age,to start a multi player game for the first time, is a bit daunting (72). So , thanks again.
---
yeah same. I had an uninvited guest in my camp once and he seemed innocent so i showed him around and he emoted and jumped around and tried to sell me a TSE rifle for 1000caps and then left. 10 minutes later some low level german guy shows up ay my camp and he has a mic and in very broken english he tells me "yea yu seen this guy that was here" and i tell him yeah he took a look around and then left, and he goes "vel, he chazed me for ten minutz and kill me and take all stuff" and I was like damn, i guess he just put on a friendly facade to sell duped items and because i was high level too. It's too easy to just walk 10 feet and pretend you're nice, it's like everyone is wearing the cowl of nocturnal haha.
---
Isn‚Äôt buying an account a giant TOS?
---
My main character Old Man Jenkins punched an entire mole rat horde to death, and all he got out of it was a furious combat knife
---
Apparently you have this backwards bro.
---
You're the one arguing in favor of making the process of playing the game take longer.... LOL.
---
I work 40 hours a week and spend 9 hours a week power lifting in the gym.......what do you do?
---
probably didnt understand the camp mechanic yet and thought it was just environmental. Or he was just a low level dick, either or.
---
I think I just figured out that Bethesda is releasing it according to some US time zone even though it‚Äôs already 13th morning in much of the world.
---
uh, cause that's how a game works? 
---
so today.
---
Xbox One, and I had just put the pieces of armor onto the chassis and was sitting still waiting for it to be recalled to my inventory when it crashed.
---
Hol' up a minute, who said I haven't played it? 
---
I don't like Yong but just because I don't like him doesn't mean he doesn't have a point. Fuck man, your own subreddit has to post continuously about the shit Bethesda is pulling with this game. 
---
Who's the sheep now? You're one of the whales that keep pouring money into a shit game while Bethesda rakes in the money and continues to break the game further. 
---
Same, never had it, on PC
---
I don't server hope for whitesprings unless its to refresh spawns for a friend. I was just pointing out that you get TONS of legendaries from Whitesprings. So much so that theres literally no where else thats even compare-able. 
---
Your right, spawning into whitesprings usually only benefits the people already there. 
---
We need more grind spots with legendaries. Basically what it comes down to. 
---
master locked is one thing (and IMO could be improved), but finding a specific key required to open a thing should have the best offerings.
---
Yes, so it seems the question I should be asking is, in what time zone? 
---
Also go count again. He has made *36* videos about Fallout 76. He even has a playlist if them. He has 33 videos about Anthem. A game that came out even later. Each video is 10 minites long, with no content whatsoever, but just long enough to get monitisation. The exact same tactic that Juicehead uses.
---
It's not even that bad of a game. Like of you like the core loop of Fallout 4 this is basically a version of that. 
---
$6 for 500 hours of gaming is still pretty good.  If you liked it that much, maybe buy it for real so Bethesda gets comped for what it produced.
---
when I first got my account years ago, I played Halo with Dan Gleeballs and Anul Beedz. wonder what ever happened to those guys...
---
Yup, that's what happened for my group too.  We got her loot for killing her but did't get the quest loot.  We assumed it was that way because the quest failed. 
---
There have been tons of cool player made things posted on here but what we've all been asking for is a towns system, to level up and build and gain perks as a collective rather than an individual -
---
or a hunger games like survival mode where really strong weapons are rare and create an almost king of the hill kind of feel where getting something good is about the conflicts with other players looking for it at possible spawn points or taking down a known user of the particular weapon
---
Or a system where instead of dev creates dungeon, players farm Dungeon, players grow bored and ask dev to release more dungeon, creative players and
---
Playful Creators cycle in a feedback loop like the deathclaw maze or any limitless number of situations possible if the developers can build the right combo of layers in the system for karma (both toward a player's choices to help or grief and toward a creation's positive traffic / infamy). I've seen all these cool camps and ideas but have yet to have an in game experience with any of them. A real system for this 5th identity piece will create that multiplicative multiplayer feeling that exists when creating happens in an online setting of play. 
---
Afternoon-ish eastern time. My fault for assuming everyone is from my time zone haha.
---
Yep, that helpful :)
---
I was talking about daily quests not challenges for atoms.
---
In this instance, there literally wasn't even a map. Just a request for me to select a location. 
---
... And I'd been to multiple locations nearby. 
---
Lol Bethesda made it too real.
---
There are ways around it. Which I will not be posting in order to not spread around how.
---
Glad I wasn't the only one that this happened to. You have no idea how panicked I was when I finished slaughtering mole miners and went to grab my medic's double barrel only to see I was "using" a short double barrel I grabbed to scrap for mods.
---
Not lately. But when I did it was filled with angry customers who felt they got ripped off by Bethesda.
---
You've never made a Fallout 76 related post before. Also, you have no idea what's currently going on in the game or how the Atom store works, as shown clearly in your last sentence. You may find it entertaining to troll the forums, but keep your shit opinions to yourself about whether others should enjoy a game or not.
---
ye i got a bloodied combat knife
---
Or you kill a 3 star legendary and the body falls through the map and you lose the loot. :-(
---
West Virginia time zone.
---
I think I remember that the servers were offline from 9am ish to until they are ready (afternoon)
---
Do rad roaches count? 
---
Found bloodied 3 star Chinese officers sword today, anyone know what I can get for it? 
---
I'm not sure, but seems like server-hopping either not working at all or working in a weird ways that i can't comprehend. I mean in terms of getting daily quest. Changed several servers (that's for sure) and spent some time at one location. Still no quest :(
---
A combination of T-51 and T-45. Just the frame alone should give me an extra 10 pounds, right? I'm getting 0.
---
&gt; West Virginia time zone 
---
Lol that‚Äôs hilarious but yes I believe EST is what they used for the other downtimes.
---
It was always filled by people who had never played the game making nylon bag jokes and telling Bethesda to close down the servers. You do not see so many now because they have moved on to Anthem now.
---
Nah, my fault for assuming Bethesda would use any time zone other than their main office.
---
The original issue was that mods had a flag to prevent them from "scrap all". This same flag was used to mark an item that can be automatically scrapped while crafting. So players were upset that they would hunt down a rare mod and then accidentally scrap it while crafting a gun.
---
Bethesda changed that flag in patch 4 or so. It no longer allowed auto scrap during crafting. But this same flag was used on bulk items, so players were mad they would have to manually scrap bulked items in-order to craft something.
---
In a hot-patch, Bethesda changed it again by removing this flag from the bulk items so people could once again automatically scrap them when crafting. Unfortunately this means they are no longer excluded from the "scrap all" command.
---
We are now waiting for Bethesda to introduce a new item tag that will protect from "scrap all", while still allowing the items to auto scrap for crafting.
---
Found a vampires explosive combat shotgun
---
&gt; I mean what's the point of giving your character a name if in the end what is showing to other players is your account name?   
---
Do you think any any thought was put into this game?
---
Too late, I already stopped playing... Thanks though.
---
It used to be there but they moved it, it's now part of a pretty convoluted unmarked quest line. I know because I used a youtube guide to find it and it wasnt there, so i had to find a more recent guide. 
---
Ahhh, silly autocorrect on mobile. Yes, I meant the Devide not device. üëçüòÇ

Is it the YT'ers fault or the algorithm? Is it societies desire for this content? Are they just reacting to what people want to consume?
---
You're still wrong.  They were permabanned before the refusal to apologize.  And I'm glad they refused to apologize.  There aren't many people left who stand their ground when the SJW mob comes for them.  
---
Since you're cherry picking the article in a failed attempt to try and still be right that the ban was escalated, here is what comes directly before his refusal to apologize:
---
&gt;My version of the incident is more or less the same as the public has taken it, the only differences being the fact that I don't hate gay people. It was just a late night of having fun and after the first encounter (seen on my channel) we felt it would be fun to offend them somehow. You can call that evil but I think it's just playful immaturity.
---
NOICE!!
---
Don't know about buying, but selling may be a TOS violation.
---
36. He has a playlist of them on his channel.
---
Is the Baron around?
---
Go to camden park and Wavy Willards lots of low level scorched to help you level.
---
I really don't like that people can see my account name freely. Maybe I'm old fashioned but I want my character names to be what the general public sees and only that.
---
what for? I won't be playing it again as I said above, starting from the scratch would be massive waste of time.
---
What does he even have that is worth chasing him down?  I haven't seen him since they made plans permanently available at the vendors.  I can't imagine it's anything that's special enough that people would mob him, at least no more than they do the other  vendors.
---
Thanks! Ill have to check it out tonight!

All I know is I have been collecting honey for a few weeks now and hope we can brew mead.

One dropped from a ghoul in white springs and one dropped from a watoga robot. Non nuked zone both places.

I met a 12 year old kid a few weeks ago and took it upon myself to coach him and protect him from shitty players. He asks me like every day if i can play and always goes "i'm just wondering..." like i'm gonna be mad, it's so cute. And last time we played his little sister came to the microphone and asked me if i had a beard, lol.

Don't use locks so it won't  bother me

Maybe he didnt realize it's not open PvP and thought he'd get the jump on you before you do on him. Or he doesn't realize it's pvp and thought you were an enemy or npc, probably a kid.
---
So 14.5 hours from now is when it usually is.

Oh gosh please I wanna keypad lock my camp
---
Thanks!! I really need to give Watoga more attention.

Like I can‚Äôt even friend up on the main screen. I‚Äôm not sending TEAM invites and he‚Äôs not getting them, we can‚Äôt even add each other to our friends list in order to send invites in the main screen. And even if we could be on a friends list, odds are it would not show us as online even when we are, so we still wouldn‚Äôt be able to team up. 
---
As for NAT issues, again no other games and services has this type of issue where we can‚Äôt even create a friends list. 
---
This game almost certainly will go free to play. It‚Äôs like 3 months old and already 75% off
---
It seems like what you are saying is pvp is an after thought for the game. The fact a purely pvp based survival mode is coming out proves the game was build for it and it is not an afterthought

Oh man, until this thread I thought your IGN was displayed.

Why would the displayed character name have to be unique? It could still be tied to your account name in the background. I‚Äôm pretty sure that I‚Äôm not the only Matt in the world.
---
You did it all wrong. Wait around the supply drop, wait until somebody starts to pick the lock, get up right beside them, like uncomfortably close, and as soon as you see them finish picking the lock, absolutely SMASH that pickup button. Bonus points for killing the guy who picked the lock.
---
The filthy community is also very popular.
---
The point would be that when someone contests the workshop, they have to pay full price, but the owner could then got the self destruct. Also, I would imagine there are plenty of users that have 25,000 caps such that the cost different matter.
---
You clearly don't understand how free to play works. Retails can't make a game F2P. Retails have only been discounting console versions to clear out physical space. If it worked like that, every game would go F2P after a couple of years.
---
Yes, we did

Yong Yea somehow became an arbiter on how to manage game developers and produce quality products while literally having built up nothing himself. His videos are editorials and badly researched ones as well, his content become rather opinionated as a way to adopt more views and become yet another  panhandling Youtuber looking to jump on a subscriber bandwagon. If it was up to me, I'd say let him mess up a few stories here and there , after three strikes it time to say YOOOONG OUUUT ! 
---
Psh everyone is covering anthem now this game is dead and buried in the eyes of everyone not playing it.  
---
i heard about how bad the game was at launch so i waited and finally bought the game 2 weeks ago but only played for half hour so didnt get anything done really.  i want to really start playing right after this new patch comes out.  Any other mostly new players want to add me to play after patch 7 add me.
---
Ah ok, it‚Äôs been a while since I last played that

Buying an selling accounts should be against TOS

Was it pretty quick with a low level? I need the plans so considering spinning up an alt.

Explosive is fun. I just got it on a Medic's combat rifle.

You can just scrap your plants and you will get a whole one back for each one you scrap.

the chassis bumps your character's STR up to 11 before applying any negatives if your STR is too high you gain no bonuses from it but motion assist servos can add +2 STR as a static bonus.

Got a bounty once "not good for a bounty Hunter to have BTW" stripped down to my undies stashed my junk and went to The Whitespring, jumped up on the bus right in front and spammed the help emote. Worked like a charm.

I don't see any reason for any of the above ideas to not happen. What I like about the first two in tandem is that perhaps a centralized theme of exploring the wasteland could serve as the hunger games scenario, and townships for our societal needs perhaps. I think the difficult matter for the programers is to create content where both PVP and PVE can coexist in peace. Obviously when some people will opt out of PVP, such as myself, there will be a challenge for creating content that runs along king of the hill themes. No matter, have you bothered to suggest these ideas publicly and see if they gain traction, or to talk with devs directly?  I'm new to Reddit so I don't know how to search and discover that answer for myself.

Because when I get killed by a server hopping asshole I want to be able to follow them.

I wear a full chef outfit (there's no chef suit so i wear a ski outfit) and put my camp just in front of the overseer's camp, with houses full of workbenches, crops, water and a nice patio for guests. If a noob comes by I cook him up 10 cranberry cobblers and a bunch of radstag meat and send him on his way!
---
rly oh i did not know that thx
---
Doh! I'm deeply sorry that I missed the prereq of posting on a FO76 post in order to be qualified as a player! How could I have missed that?! Rats!
---
How about we put all of this behind us...
---
 *Slides you 500 Atoms*, that'll compensate right bud?
---
Well, where are the fact that support this idea that games MUST do this?
---
Oh crap. I just did some digging on Bing. In FO76, is the Excavator armor the only type of armor that provides a carry bonus? 
---
Really? I've been looking at new posts daily,  you misremembering or something? 
---
Platform?
---
Whoops... PC
---
Ive got a bloodied grog axe for cheap if you want
---
as a passive free bonus. yes. but the Motion assist servos can add +10 carry weight and the Calibrated shocks add +50 each
---
Same reason you can change your name in Borderlands: It‚Äôs just the name of your save. It‚Äôs to differentiate between different characters.

That's a great rifle.  Mod it up and have a blast with it.
---
Look buddy, you could go and pull this shit in r/Fallout and maybe they'll suck your dick for a bit if you throw in your soul into the New Vegas Circle Jerk Pit. But please don't try to question other people's self respect or anything here, you bloody bastard. If you think the game is shit, say is as much as you want wherever you want, but no one gave you a fucking right to tell others what to do ir not, you utter moron.
---
Hell DLC for some games is just a bunch of weapon skins or a new playable character.
---
How cheap?! Lol
---
He developed a very toxic fan base.
---
They act like those people who have a bad day at work and comes home and kicks their dog for doing something that slightly annoyed them
---
Happens on PS4 when you ender or exit power armor. Annoying but not a a deal breaker.
---
700 type cheap if youre on ps4
---
Its more of an issue in that he finds some way to throw Fallout 76 into every.single.video he makes now.  I admit I watched the Anthem one today and he still found a way to bring up FO76.  
---
If the video doesn't hit 10 minutes, he brings up FO76 even if it has nothing to do with what he's talking about.
---
sure if i had enough stupid adhesive i would xd
---
That's interesting just like ESO but I don't think it would work out really.
---
Oh, so an explosive gauss rifle still drops! Thank you so much for your confirmation. Anti-armor, two-shot and bloodied and in some cases, quad are the prefix we are looking for, right? Let's us hope for finding a perfect one. Good hunting, bro!
---
Where's your facts supporting this idea that games SHOULDN'T do that?
---
This definitely. I keep trying to bring up the Pip-Boy as soon as the game loads to eat or drink them immediately regret it. The map still works to look out.
---
Because some people only get there gaming news from YouTubers and actively seek out that content. I actually had an instance in the Fallout 76 BETA where I never talked about a certain date change or time change or something. A couple people very angrily commented on a later video about it saying that I never notified them of that and they missed it as a result. That is obviously a pretty extreme example, but it gives you an idea 
---
I often forget that a decent chunk of people just don't follow the game closely and I guess videos like that is the main way they hear about that stuff. 
---
It's depressingly meh. Full rifle build and it does less damage (at least in my limited testing) than my AA lever. And way less DPS than my furious plasma flamer, or probably a non-legendary one.
---
Who TF you calling toxic! /s
---
I‚Äôm always invited, so.
---
I‚Äôd suggest you stop writing off the concern for all women everywhere over the selfish, myopic interest of a single individual. You‚Äôre indicating just how narcissistic your interests are.
---
Insert cutesy shrug emote here.
---
I wouldn't report it. I'm assuming what you did is against ToS. I've never played a game that allowed account buying/selling on 3rd party websites.
---
if u dont have a code or forgot to get one or are just to lazy go on nukacrypt thing website
---
You can still get a bounty in pacifist mode
---
You slept in a bed at level 100?
---
Soft.
---
I agree, weather is something that was sorely under utilized in this game. You could have crazy story systems that would circulate the map or areas of the map. Instead, we kind of get this 'oh no... it's a storm.' sensation from rad storms. 
---
On a side note to this ricochet should not work against friendly robots like the Whitesprings ones, I go in and try to kill an enemy that spawned ricochet goes off and counts as me damaging the robot so they get hostile towards me.
---
I had a similar experience the other day.. A newbie (Lvl 20) had a wanted tag and I was just farming not paying attention to him, going on my way. He basically 2 shot hit me melee style sledge and I was dead lol wtf?  I have all my under armor above 50 , sort of a bad ass setup too. So I clicked the "Get Revenge" option and one sliced him with my death claw. I remembered reading PA doesn't do anything in PVP so I didn't bother wearing it.  After he died - re spawned he ran like hell from me lol :) It's odd in the PVP experience the VATS acted strange too, the whole experience was bizarre..
---
I have no idea why anyone would want this.
---
Yeah, pistols are strong, it's just a rumour! 
---
God, please.
---
That's right.
---
I‚Äôm sorry, all I see in your reply is REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
See you in the wasteland, internet tough guy.
---
You have my condolences sir. I'm actually doing the same. I know the Ultracite PA isn't the best but it's pretty and can't wait till I can display it and my nukacola PA. " Fingers crossed"
---
Give me mud slides D:&lt;
---
Fair enough.
---
Man. Had an epic long battle with a great group today. It took almost an hour of constant battle to take her down. Lost the event and everything else despawned......lol, But we got the queen and ultracite plans.......ü§™ü§™ü§™
---
If you‚Äôre ps4 and still having trouble, I could prob craft this for you. 
---
Imao I just realize how stupid I am
---
Players with 25,000 caps are not claiming workshops for the resources. If they claim, they are doing it to pvp. You can't stop someone who just wants to pvp.
---
Players who are claiming for resources will think twice about spending a bunch of caps. The more it costs the more they have to justify staying on to get their value. They could just hop servers to a workshop that is unclaimed and keep all the caps.
---
Thanks I was unsure if it would show both or just craft the lvl 25 and I didn‚Äôt want to waste resources 
---
Why shouldn't I report it? I've got nothing more to lost - If they ban the account at least someone else won't be dissapointed some day.
---
As for account there weren't any problem since the day I bought it - why should I worry?
---
I leave Starched Genes on all the time, once I've gotten the mutations I want. Otherwise, I'd risk forgetting to swap it back...and then take a Radaway... happens.
---
And no matter how good or bad Death Standing is he's going to treat it as the holy Grail and ark of the covenant rolled into one of gaming regardless of how good or bad it is. 
---
Not hating on kojima games as he clearly has a fan base but they're not for me and at this point it seems more like a cult of personality than a gaming studio. 
---
Thx man its 16 days old now im lvl 80 but i can add you üòâ
---
You find one?
---
And more difficult to role play.
---
Now there's two of them!
---
Didn‚Äôt find one but someone gave me one. 
---
You can't prove a negative. 
---
You make the statement that this is how games have to work, then you need to provide that proof that statement is a fact. 
---
Similar to this, I'd rather they bring over what they had in Elder Scrolls Online -- generic repair kits. So long as you had a repair kit in your inventory you could repair weapons and armor on-the-fly. This would be a universal item that worked for just about anything, and would be consumed when doing the repair.
---
Weapon durability is one of the more frustrating aspects of the game. Bethesda wants this to be more of a survival game but some weapons break insanely fast, and it kills the game's flow. A good example: any Two Shot weapon. The weapons degrade twice as fast as a normal weapon (despite no longer doing twice the damage). Repair kits would make it so we could actually use these weapons more reliably without having to worry about them falling apart like they're made of cheap plastic.
---
My Two Shot Minigun is an absolute joke of a weapon. It falls apart so fast it's not even worth carrying around.
---
Well you said you are done playing so you are right in that sense, might as well report it.
---
8gb of Ram might be the issue. What monitor or hdtv are you using. Go into settings and try fullscreen mode with v-sync on and that should smooth it out. But totally try to mess with those settings in the options menu
---
its craftable...
---
I used to enjoy his videos but stopped watching a few months ago where every single video was pretty much bashing whatever game was current at the time. The other day he made a video about the anthem ps4 crashes that somehow managed to be 12 fricking minutes long. Okay its a shit bug but just turn your ps4 off and on again (albeit by holding the power button to boot to safe mode and then rebooting again) and its sorted, but everything just seems to be clickbaity nonsense in order to get more views
---
The perks work well for weapons and armor with high durability, as the effect activates rarely but gives a lot of durability. I believe it never over repairs, and doesn‚Äôt increase durability when above 100%.
---
I believe it‚Äôs supposed to be from any toxic valley event or the grafton monster, I‚Äôve been killing that dude multiple times a day for the last week and I did get a plan drop finally, but nothing good yet.  
---
On the PS4 you open the PIP Boy and then, if I remember right, hit the Triangle button.  
---
Yeah, but still no idea how to do this (report it)?
---
Lol posted exactly the same a week before

If you ever want any used gift cards, hmu. :p. Sucks though- sorry to hear.  But a game (more like a digital code) for $6?  And you can‚Äôt access the email used to set it up?  That doesn‚Äôt sound like a sale- sounds like he‚Äôs renting out his game or something. Buyer beware

You can't manually count persons videos if he has so many of them. I didn't notice the playlist, yes, now I see them.

I have a Vamps Golf club I use at whitespring it just feels right to use it there. I never have to use a stim with it. Vampire is one of the better Legendary prefixes in the game. I'd use it as a secondary weapon for when your health gets low.
---
I think here, but can't check it because I'm at work.

Whitesprings clubhouse during a nuke, trying to VATS ghouls but instead targeting one of the 8 guys in power armor who is smashing the ghouls with a melee weapon.
---
I like this idea, but players are going to start to not repair during Powering Up events so that they could farm flux 
---
That's exactly what I needed to know. Thank you. 
---
Been playing for the past 4 hours (standard PS4) not a single disconnect, and hardly any framerate drops surprisingly. Might be a local issue
---
i love luck of the draw, its very weapon dependant on how efficient it is though. for example (unless its patched) a semi auto weapon will get more procs than an auto, since at last check it procs based off per trigger pull instead of per shot.  so tapfire weapons = more procs.
---
its not "omg greatest skill ever" but imo its worth the 3 points for saving mats
---
I've had two people join me, but it no longer appears to be up... I'm so sorry guys :(
---
They do proc and can make the difference between finishing a long fight, like the SBQ.  
---
You run 1,000 rounds through a TS Gatling and pray it‚Äôs still ticking.
---
No problem here.
---
Come to the light side!
---
It is crafted as a heavy weapon? Not a normal laser weapon, indeed. Heavy and laser weapon buffs coming today, I'd laugh if Tesla doesn't get any buff from it. Bethesda should clarify which weapons they are talking about when they say 'energy weapons'.
---
It's alright.  At least I know where to look for him now.  I didn't know where the one by Overseer's Camp was.  I found mine around Summersville Lake.
---
I have 16gb in my rig too, doesnt change the fact I can still force a black screen alt-tabbing.
---
And yes you may have a lower ping than me, when connecting to a website who's whole goal is to provide a speed test, it doesnt always follow suit on the real world. I can also pick servers within my country and pull mid 30ms pings. That also doesnt mean your connecting to fo76 using the same routing as the speed test, for all you know its bumping you a US server, or a section your routing through is getting throttled. Other games may be routed differently, or  you may have servers closer to you. There are a lot of variables.
---
Think to how many extra thinga are being updated in a nuke zone, the server is busy and if your device is taking longer than normal to reply, the server has already moved on to the next task and your stuck doing no damage.
---
Opening a door ingame is pretty simple, the door is open or its not, on the other hand doing a damage calculation and making sure both client and server agree is a ton more reasource intensive and takes more time, so its alot easier for the client and server to fall out of sync.
---
And another reason I think its something local, is that very few people are complaining about having lag issues, so its either you something close to you that is causing lag and throttling.
---
Deep dive your router and see if your dropping packets. And your welcome to fix your own problem if your so smart, just dont blame the game for you being and ID 10 T.
---
Uh yeah, how are you getting a ts furious... that isn't a possibility, those are both prefix only. Also... furious dragon? I hope all 15 bullets it shoots before breaking and 15 minutes of reloading do it for you.
---
Irl many people have the first and last name John Smith. I agree, it would help with role playing to be able to have a name.... My gamer tag is okay.. but I have 4 characters, my problem is that everyone sees all of my characters as the same person? Role play breaking for me lol
---
Well I think I do. The event is not for you. By the time you join, it's already there. It does not pop out in front of you, it's you popping out in front of it.
---
Sure it's not purely by player levels, Forest area has lowest level caps. But other players in area influence enemy levels too. You want level 50 or above enemies, you get to location where they can spawn.
---
No, they have mentioned some drinks and their effects, but they haven't released any actual recipes yet. I'm guessing it'll be a combination of existing ingredients and new things that will be added to the game. 
---
THX!
---
I feel the easiest way to make it easier to farm for specific types of weapons, and increase threat diversity is make a few more areas like Whitesprings, with different types of enemies, AND have enemies only drop legendary versions of the weapons and armor that are already in their loot table. 
---
Don‚Äôt want a bounty?  Turn on Pacifist and never switch it off.  Quit with the PvP nonsense and senseless griefing.
---
I've found you need enough people and the correct weapons. I gave up on that basic gattling gun. for SBQ events.
---
The attack has to be consistent or you're wasting your time. I use Ultracite laser gattling gun and a TSE prime shotgun with ultracite ammo.
---
Fingers crossed is right! Just don‚Äôt let a disconnect happen while you‚Äôre moving things around!
---
Not that this is that big of a deal. I mean, after 5 minutes of frustration I remembered ‚ÄúOh it‚Äôs just a video game‚Äù so I‚Äôve moved on. But it‚Äôs just no fun being punished because the servers suck.
---
Too many prefixes in the game that are useless and too many choices. Remove several bad prefixes or make them worth while, hint nobody like being good 1/2 the time nocturnal i'm looking at you. Fix the bad perks for good, make three star legendaries drop three star items always, 2 star same, etc, and maybe make locations of enemies drop specific types of weapons/armor only and rotate them so the good locations change weekly or something. 
---
I find the girls all over but only worn dress, no veil. 
---
On a related note, most storage lockers in real life (that get sold when the owner bounces) are just filled with old clothes and ugly furniture. Generally not legendary baseball card collections or something. 
---
Lockpicking is useful in 76 basically until you start getting legendary weapons. After that, it really only serves to open Nuclear keycard containers. :/
---
Yesterday I claimed 7 workshops at once and only one person tried claiming but stopped when I came back to get them
---
I thought about doing that, but seems like cheating. 
---
Yes this is annoying. 
---
I haven't been kicked from the game in quite a while though! 
---
did not notice xd nah im good xd im lvl 52
---
vegasbartender63, if you find me I'll take it off your hands. 
---
I'm on now if you are
---
Still the same complaints from day 1 : (
---
I got it on a second try in about 10 minutes
---
Can I grab Adrenal, Grounded, Healing Factor, Marsupial, Scaly Skin, and Twisted Muscles?
---
You grill want that ammo?
---
1000 caps?
---
sure if ur on ps4 add me my psn is Krisiboy21 im lvl 52
---
There are also the brick windows that you can jump through. 
---
Wrong, GallowBoob is a prion disease.
---
I made my account years ago for the creation kit. If I had known my Beth acct name would be the one showing I would have made a new acct for 76. I hate that my irl name shows in game, and I can't change it.
---
Demo perk not worth it anymore since nerf
---
With the content in this game why would anyone get offended by a user name. I can see it now.
---
Random triggered player-Ummm excuse me you players name offends me.
---
Me- What exactly is wrong with Vag Stash
---
Triggered Player- well couldn't you use another name 
---
Me- what? like box or pussy or c*nt
---
Psn admin type person- that'll be a 2 week ban
---
Me- dammit
---
Yeah I'm like 50/50 on this also there's going to be a lot of players named "mule" on the map.
---
Even from his perspective why would he stop? View counts up, subscriber count up, videos are often times very liked by audience. If he is just getting positive reinforcement for drama videos (esp. 76 drama videos) why would he stop or change that? 
---
That isn't justification to make irresponsible content, but it is an important factor imo 
---
Legend
---
I'll pass at the moment... may not be on for a few days.  Heading out of town.  Sorry for the late reply, I've been getting some last minute stuff done.  Thank you for the reply!
---
I doubt people really want to run around with Material Mule or Legendary Mule
---
It does this a lot when server hopping now too. Quite often I disconnect and reconnect only to rejoin the same server. The most I've reconnect to the same server is a row is 6 times, lol.
---
Strange. I guess you could always create a new character, make a mad dash for the nearest dead MoM girl and then transfer it to your existing character.
---
&gt; I can also pick servers within my country and pull mid 30ms pings.  
---
I picked Ireland, not my own country. it's 1550 miles away from me. If i pick my own country i get 15ms or lower. 
---
I'm not dropping any packets, and for fucks sake, you said it yourself that there was some bug regarding damage calculation. In your mind it's so impossible for that bug to still be present in some form? It's more plausible that the issue is on my side? You're really that delusional? 
---
Anyway, you're a waste of time. You only read/understand the bits that you want to understand, not being able to check a stupid speed test i linked and see the distance is proof enough. 
---
As much as I agree with you in regard to some legendary effects the whole point of the ‚Äútwo shot‚Äù legendary effect is suppose to be you deal double damage with the expense of one bullet. 
---
Nice..I love when u get a good item and don't realize it til later..happened with most of my 3* drops
---
Today has been super buggy but in general the game runs really smoothly. There‚Äôs a few bugs here and there but nothing that I‚Äôve found that massively impacts the game. People have been complaining a lot about it putting your weapons back in your inventory but I haven‚Äôt seen it. 
---
I thought two shot meant at the cost of one bullet, you shoot two? Either way, I see the points against it costing double ammo, I‚Äôm just willing to go far for a patch.
---
Powering up events are dumb imo
---
Once you get the fusion Gen plan, 
---
Not patch, fix*
---
Runs pretty good for me on the X. I dont think it's a super high performance game on any console, so I don't think it's a ton better on the X than on the ps4 pro or current gen consoles, but it's good. Nothing to take advantage of the hardware specifically - re rdr2. But the graphics are great and the response has the crispness that you get used to on the X. 
---
Just start a character, trust me, 30 minutes from now you will be 100 percent reinvested
---
Happens on PS4 when *everything*. Seriously, like every second time I want to switch to my melee weapon to hit a bug or molerate, I end up punching it.
---
I love the Fallout universe. I loved Fallout 4
---
Tbh if it wasn't a Fallout game it would probably be pretty average, but I have recently reignited the spark by joining a "guild" and playing with other like-minded team mates. 
---
F76 is best played with friends. 
---
Definitely agree
---
Looks awesome
---
YongYea has given me nightmares. He‚Äôs chasing me while yelling ‚Äùcanvas bag!‚Äù until I wake up. **** him.
---
His videos are to expose shady greedy companies
---
He is actually a big help in the video game industry and he gets his facts stright and shares the truth that companies try to hide.
---
We need his videos to spread mass panic over something that is not a big deal at all 
---
When he makes videos on game reviews, he helps make the pre orders go down and get the game review bombed and then companies get hurt and people lose jobs.
---
I like him
---
Thanks! Definetely will try it, the console arrives tomorrow, so hopefully tomorrow night I can try it.
---
You're right, every game has some bad reviews, but it's more important for the consumer to enjoy the game, personally, I like Destiny 2 a lot, it's a fun game, but in some way, is similar to Fallout 76, nowadays it's more trendy to hate on a game and call it "dead", ignoring that there are people playing it and having fun.
---
I try to add you but your tag is bad
---
Don't get me started on medical insurance lol.
---
I think it will be something like socketed items in Diablo. Chance to re roll a specific slot(s) only at the cost of other stars. Like you would need to scrap "x" amount of stars in order to buy Vanguard for something. 
---
I have acquired a TSE Gauss Rifle through trading recently. Its damage is 425. And I also got Instigating Hunting Rifle which is 160, simply doubling the number, it hits 320 when enemy is at full health. I can always one shot a Super Mutant Warlord at full health with the Hunting Rifle with a body shot in VATS but not TSE Gauss Rifle. The Gauss Rifle sometimes takes 2 shots to kill. Might be due to bad accuracy of Two-shot but it feels Gauss Rifle is not strong as its shown damage.
---
Interesting ü§î Glad I operate an open house policy üòÖ
---
I knew this was gonna be a thing so, I named my character the same name as my account which happens to be, my RL name
---
Yeah, started a new character the other day, got a 10 cap bounty because I didn't take notice.
---
After about 2-3 hours a kind player put me out of my misery, didn't steal my junk bag.
---
They did stay hidden waiting to see if I would seek revenge but I wasn't interested as they did me a favour.
---
Big thumbs up in-game and on reddit to that player.
---
Love all these ideas!
---
I have to admit I love seeing rain clouds in the distance, and then if I fast travel there it is actually raining
---
This would be good but I also just want more cool looking clothes and armour. 
---
Its the damn nuclear apocalypse - I don't want to run around in a 1950s style swimsuit. 
---
While it's not weather, I'd love to see darker nights in the game. As it is now, it never feels like it's night time.
---
sure bud, keep believing that. 
---
Looks line an apartment
---
Maybe, I don't know, because you can have the same name as others? (Sarcasm) ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. The name system does not prevent you from naming your character something that another player named theirs. 
---
Exactly, I‚Äôd say play it and see, a lot of higher players will help you out as well probably. Or that‚Äôs what I see quite frequently. 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt judge the game by tomorrow night as it‚Äôll probably be really laggy due to the new update coming out tomorrow morning. Over the next month they‚Äôre releasing a load of new content, so you got the game at a perfect time. 
---
Reminds me of one of the cool FO4 mods that did this same thing, but gave these locations a map marker. Great work!
---
Keep getting booted withe ol error code.
---
No, I've deleted the game and submitted the ticket to ban the account.
---
Yes, that's it, thx a lot, just submitted the ticket, hope to get the account banned.
---
It proves literally nothing other than theyre making a pvp based survival mode for the game. 
---
After release. 
---
Its an afterthought. 
---
And IF its not? Theyve got no idea how to balance a game around PvP. Good luck to them.
---
I f@$ked a mermaidddd!!
---
My house only has 3 walls, even the ragstags get in 
---
Sorry I should have clarified better, it shoots two rounds but costs you one round...I guess that makes a little better sense 
---
Yeah on PC, I'll see ya around good luck happy hunting and stay safe in the wastes fellow traveler
---
yep
---
Update is coming tomorrow. Maybe that has something to do with it?
---
Cool gimme a sec
---
I also want my Excavator Armor to have Mothman Paint
---
At the very least let us choose 
---
how we find each other? my username is vegasbartender63
---
it becomes a quest item and you can not drop or trade it. Dam
---
But just the frame alone should give me an extra 10, right? Which is not happening anymore.
---
Yep, if you have the plan it's under the Heavy Guns category for crafting.
---
I just got disconnected when we were about to kill the sbq. F 5k ammo
---
What I‚Äôm trying to say it supports the idea that it isn‚Äôt an afterthought rather than pvp being an afterthough. Which supports the idea that pvp was a main mechanic in the idea of the game, so for you to just blow it off like it is alright to be buggy just because the game wasn‚Äôt supposed to be a pvp game is false :P.
---
Huh. Well, I have a bloody harpoon gun, I can get up to 1600 damage on it.. but demo expert just shows no difference
---
That's pretty much what I got from it. It would be cool if we got more info, but it's not like its crucial for us to know.
---
I took a long time to come into this game - having been put off it by all the bad press it got. But my step son kept asking to play it, so when it was on sale recently I grabbed it - and have been having a blast ever since.
---
He and I have roamed through the wilderness together, uncovering its secrets and listening to the sad demise of its residents. I love the darkness of the story and some of the locations you come across.
---
Yesterday I noticed I had a bunch of plans I already knew, scanned the map and found a lvl 9, and thought I would try to give them away. I am only lvl 70, and the last time I did this the new player ran away. So this time I sent a team invite and it was accepted. I fast traveled to their location, and said over area chat they could have any plan in my inventory they didnt know for free. This player was only just starting his FO76 experience, and was grateful. I even crafted them a nice shiny bed for their home and some leather armour for them.
---
I enjoy the game - sure it has its bugs and moments - but it is the players that I have met that really make it awesome, and the exploration and uncovering all the hidden gems within the game.
---
Add me, I‚Äôd be happy to team up and kill bloatflies with you!
---
Just reached level 88, GT is eddie the fink
---
im still waiting on those damn VT weapon skins
---
Yeah I have had the same experience. Something like this would be awesome, but I would hate to see griefers abuse it by trying to get people to lower their guard.
---
It should also display a text msg explaining that someone wants to gift them something
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b0e23h/scorchbeast_queen_taking_no_damage/
---
There you dingus, i'm not the only one with this kind of issues. What are you going to say now?
---
That's been my experience with 2 separate legendary gauss rifles. Disappointing to say the least.
---
Thanks god you got this recorded. Had this no damage bug with regular mobs, whined here on reddit a couple of hours ago and nobody believed me...
---
In each life some rain must fall
---
All I heard is that there is a 50/50 chance that luck affects drops...I bet with enough luck I can raise that to a 70/30 chance though. ;)
---
Idk I like having one brick wall in my bedroom.. its what I‚Äôve always wanted irl üòÇ
---
The blue and white tile,  the mosaic tile, red rocket sign. Was hoping these would pop in before being retired for good 
---
I found a lv50 explosive pipe pistol a few days ago - stuff definitely drops, it might not be what most people are looking for but there's still stuff out there lol
---
That's a good point.
---
Ngl I used to always want like a brick wall inside my house when I was growing up xD but it just seems weird and conflicts with general designs of my camp
---
Not only do I agree with you, I think that was the intention of the change, and I think it was supposed to be for the pvp mode servers but that bad merge brought it into the general system. 
---
I remember shortly after reaching level 50 I saw a lvl 40 Instigating The Dragon for sale at a vendor and liquidated a bunch of shit so I could buy it. I felt all lucky and proud until like a day later when I naturally pulled a lvl 50 one off a Whitesprings ghoul :/
---
I still have only shot the damn thing like twice.
---
I have one concern.
---
For the Charleston Power Plant it‚Äôs in a lowish level area so that may hurt lower level players experience if the area becomes a nuked area.
---
I have faith after 2 weeks of sales and today being a filler since the update was delayed that we will get food stuff this week
---
My fiance just scored an instigating explosive handmade the other day, literally the best legendary either of us has ever gotten. And we have between the 2 of us at least 1000 hours logged.
---
Just got a Bloodied Gauss rifle today. No luck yet on explosive, though. Got 3 Bloodied weapons in the past week. Shame I don't use them....
---
Maybe they will do it like Xur in destiny. He is in a different location each week, but at least he stays there until the weekly reset.
---
Have to agree with the other comments - generally it runs well. But occasionally on load it will lag or just freeze before righting itself.
---
Only rarely do I have the game crash
---
Bluetooth keyboard works just fine if you an open usb slot.
---
So... World of Warcraft is releasing the WoW 8.1.5 DLC soon?
---
patch &lt; content patch &lt; DLC &lt; expansion
---
The brewery stuff is a content update. DLC generally includes *significant* content updates. So, if they saved the entirety of the spring updates and released them at once, that would be DLC, by common usage. And that's not getting into the idea that people generally (and incorrectly) equate DLC with *paid* DLC, which is probably a huge part of the downvotes.
---
rare drop my friend
---
I came to this thread because I was excited when the game was announced and then got shit on so I passed. I feel like it might be time to give it a try, but I do love the NPCs in FO4. I also love exploring old places and seeing the environment. I just dont want to buy 76 and feel like theres nothing for me to do. 
---
There's a few variations of these, sometimes the note reads something like "Look, I get it, people died, but we're alive and trying to survive. I'm taking anything I find in these because we need it more than some dead people."
---
i wanna say chairs?
---
Think its at the bottom of chairs menu
---
If you are wearing pocketed armor or pieces with +1 Strength your carry weight will go down.
---
Holy fuck, thank you. Been wating to find these things and/or camp at one. Almost camped at the birdwatching station in the north west.
---
I checked all the known vendors except Grahm. So far nobody sells pole hook plans
---
I let that guy put me off buying this game for months. Glad I took the chance on it. I‚Äôve been playing non stop for weeks now
---
Yup, chairs
---
That's a score! Congrats! I've had a few handmades drop, but none like that one. ...
---
Man, what an original post. "Wow a youtuber hating on FO76!!! what surprise guys amirite lol"
---
This gets posted about once every hour. Those youtubers should be doing videos on this sub rather than the game at this point.
---
I experienced the same, but for me it was several second floor pieces and after removing everything thoses were floating above air.
---
So, there's a chance the problem might be related to the emplacement we choose, as if something part of the environnement is causing it? Anything seems possible with bugs...
---
I get bloodied weapons dropping all the time. I've never gotten a legendary with explosive.
---
I do that on purpose so people can still use my base but mobs cant get into my generators
---
It seems to me the only people crying are the ones constantly complaining about the game
---
Yep. I tore down my entire two-storey house, just so I could raise the foundations up over the dirt and start over...
---
If you place 2 doorframes then use r then t to change them to walls you can have the inside texture on both sides
---
So because you don‚Äôt like the game and don‚Äôt find it enjoyable, everyone else doesn‚Äôt like the game and find it enjoyable? Thank you for assuming my point of view on the game. I will now stop playing a game I have fun playing with my friends because you sir think it is a shitty game. 
---
For pure damage a bloodied power fist, or meat hook will do significantly more than you can do in power armour, but youll die a lot.
---
Jesus Christ, kid, punctuation is not the enemy. Edited for clarity:
---
I was at my base near Top of the World, located at the nearby junk resource node (gotta get those screws xd). Suddenly, a gang of about a dozen level 68 super mutants attacked my base. I kept killing the intruders until I came face-to-face with two level 68 enemies and one level 35 three star legendary. I made him my priority target, but he killed me twice when I ran out of stimpacks. I finally bashed his head in with my trusty super sledge, then cleaned up the rest of them. As I was looting their remains for gear to scrap, the word "Vampiric" caught my eye. Upon inspection, it turns out the legendary enemy dropped a combat rifle with Vampiric, Suppressor, and Explosive (*which is bullshit because legendary weapons can only have 1 [tier 1 legendary effect](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Fallout_76_legendary_weapon_effects), but let's just roll with it*). This gun is broken. I don't even use stimpacks anymore. 
---
Now I just need adhesive to upgrade the gun because those super mutants destroyed my adhesive farm.
---
Go back to Boston!
---
Great point!  I do like using melee weapons.  I would think that will be a lot more difficult without power armor.
---
Depends in the build? I'm a stealth build so I only carry around a suit for a suprise nuke or so I can fast travel when over unencumbered.
---
Yeah it is, though there are a decent few perks like serendipity that only work out of power armour. Wih the right build you can go over 3000 damage without food or chems on a good unarmed weapon
---
A minor annoyance, but this is the sort of oversight that just reminds me how little play-testing they must have done on this game.
---
A commenter yesterday who‚Äôd know valued it at max caps.  
---
And now I've got you right where I want... wait, where ARE we?
