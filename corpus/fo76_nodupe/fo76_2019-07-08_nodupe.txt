Am I alone in totally hating this grind?  I think I've already blown getting all of the rewards because I did not do the first 20 levels in week one. This combined with the fact that I just started grinding for secret service armor and I'm losing motivation fast.
---
---
---
He's IN foundation.
---
I know but it's a broken score system  there is no reason to respect. If score was more balanced then they deserved a ban. Although still bethsda fault for not fixing this exploit, they need to fix thier broken game not the players.
---
I would guess more fun than you.
---
Zax would suggest dropping a nuke on the first person you see as a show of dominance.
---
Because if we ask for both we're only going to get one. And you know what option the devs will take

I'd argue most guns could use a lot more custokizability/fine tuning of stat-distribution through mods.
---

---
But yeah, SMGs and heavies are some of the most restricted as far as "fun" goes.
---
Get a shit ton of lead and steel
---
Craft it
---
It doesn't always spawn 3 legendaries though, I solo it on a private server and sometimes I only get 1 or 2 legendaries!
---
I got all the masks when the event was happening! why does this activate my fight or flight instinct?
---
Take me home to Balmora....   
---
I guess I just need to scrap my two story home and go small just so I can decorate and have a couple of turrets at least.   
---
This is disappointing for sure.
---
You could craft it if you have both the skill set and the materials or equip the ammo finder perk
---
Farm lead, steel acid, and cloth.  Then craft your own ammo. 
---
There are many guides on how to do this. In a day or two you can get enough resources to craft a lot of ammo.
---
Here’s a thread on getting lead ore from Lucky Hole Mine

Here’s another thread on getting lead by scrapping junk.

---
Get acid from the crickets at Tanagra town and Toxic Larry’s, then hop servers and repeat. 
---
Cloth is everywhere
---
Scrap weapons to get a lot of steel.
---
No you can not add any wallpaper or flooring. You can of course put decorations and tables, etc.. but that's about it.
---
I laughed so hard I cried. Jfc thank you for that.
---
Honestly after last week's underwhelming update, the Vault Tec Bomber jacket and today's update is a great way to start the week. The sales are top tier, and the Slocum Joe's isn't bad for $15.

---
Also staying in the final 10 gives more XP
---
I remember starting out and it was a grind for ammo. Things changed drastically when I was high enough level to take the ammosmith and super duper perks. Never had an ammo issue again after that.
---
This is one I think Bethesda needs to address. I think that if you are doing an event you should get credit for the legendary creatures there. I realize that it could get abused but even at level 100 sometimes you get someone who just obliterates the legendary miner before you even get a shot, especially since the spawn is semi-random. There have also been times when I tagged the scorch beast queen a ton and I mean A TON and got absolutely nothing. I did 3 crits used a couple of hundred rounds of ammo and nothing...
---
So where I had my Camp placed I could build inside and around the pylon and also access the junk pile.  But I can't build a second floor. Before the wastelanders update there was a rock on the ground near the pylon that you could set it on and then you'd be able to build a second floor and access the junk pile.  But now it just Clips through that rock.
---
I'm sure it's neat, but since they've severely reduced the amount of Atoms we can earn, I'm even more frugal with the Atoms I do have.
---
I’ve never known about this tbh
---
Ive tried it 5 times today alone and gotten 3 every single time
---
I have heard that if people attack the supervisors as they come out of the ground  they dont register as legendaries but without testing im not sure how valid that reddit poster is
---
And from all the guides I've seen today alone they always encounter 3 supervisor legendaries
---
Probably just bad luck on my part, it seems to happen 2/3 of the times that I do it,public or private servers.
---
This individual did  nice breakdown. Check out the comments as well:

---
The problem with placing on the structure is that I'm not close enough to the junk pile.
---
Ive even encountered a bug where ill kill a 3 star enemy, the game registers the item on my screen as a 3 star
---
I go to check the pipboy and its a 1/2 star, usually fixes itself after a full restart of the game
---
I bought the game about March - best game I've played all year.   It definitely has its share of bugs, but overall it was a great gameplay experience even played primarily like a single-player game.
---
thanks friend!!!
---
So if you successfully rob a bank, all the blame is on the bank for not being able to stop you?
---
Contact customer support, they'll ignore you but we need a papertrail of players at least trying to ask for help.
---
Sad thing that people defends Bugthesda, glitches and bugs since beta they never bother fixing , people loosing stuff they grind for. Challenges auto completing , list could be made long af
---
But i guess fanboys will be fanboys
---
Thank you! Appreciate it.
---
They also fixed them to cover more space and top to bottom floors.i only use 2 in my camp with the wall conduit.
---
Go for it. Headcanon:

Since the Unit under the Pentagon couldn’t be powered sufficiently, Military created a prototype Power Armor suit capable of instilling fear into its enemies but boosting moral to the US troops.

---
(BTW if anyone is curious it's "One More Pils" by Andy Vale)
---
I wonder if its player number based, as most guides seem to have groups doing it
---
Ill take a look in the morning and see what results i get, providing they don't get one shot yet again by people ruining the event
---
I appreciate that, but unless I’m missing something, this doesn’t answer my question. I got the whatever Halloween paint job at 7k exp yesterday. I’ve played quite a few matches since then and just got the holiday beanie... also 7k. It implies I’ll get the skeleton suit first, which is preferred, but I don’t understand why I’m receiving them staggered if the xp is the same.
---
Did they lock your ticket? They keep locking mine when I ask for help about this issue!
---
I don't have a jetpack yet haha. There's a place inside the very bottom of the structure that you can get to. Its on the top of an arch and if I place it there as close as I can to the junk pile it still doesn't fit in my building area.
---
People still only do habitat A and nothing else for me.
---
Was annoying yesterday, I had enough radkelp to upgrade to level 2 but didn't turn any in. On the way to do so, a freaking Yaoi Gaoi spawned out of nowhere and mauled me! I reached the destination again literally ONE second too late, I was beyond pissed! And then I realized 'Oh yeah, I stashed my healing stick!" since nobody was even doing this until recently and I didn't want to accidentally sell it or scrap it, now it's back in my inventory so I can assist with keeping weaker animals alive
---
[removed]
---
Tag but don't walk away cuz you lose the body lol, I've been seeing people with explosive weapons blowing up bodies before
---
No I wish. Got bugged as I pressed launch nuke. In the background we could hear the computers resetting launch codes. I had to exit out, gf now in Bravo patiently waiting for some codes lol.
---
You can mess with the transparency so they aren't super awful. I hate the preselected locations though. Why tf do I want a horseshoe tattoo on my forehead? No, no, no, no.
---
Because Socialism, if you haven't lived in a social country dive into 76 to get a good taste of equality :)
---
They are vague about camp building.they emphasize using different thing to be more efficient in your camp while having all the cool kid stuff.lol
---
I dont care , never had much time to do them, just sounds strange imo you rather pay for stuff .
---
Why not?
---
It depends does the bank have a hole in the wall? If bethsda is the bank, all you need to do is walk in crawl in, tap a brick on the wall watch it crumple then loot. To many bugs arent patched, but they bring out more things to pay for, this was a 60$ game on launch that wasnt completed. They dont deserve more money for a still incomplete game with game breaking bugs.
---
Many thanks! I know with double XP, doing the ghille suit stuff was pretty easy. But would you say the holiday stuff is easier/harder or about the same?
---
For me it happens whenever I crash on joining a game. 
---
I've never been online anytime close to the reset.
---
yo they just updated!
---
Of you find the right person, yeah. The drawback to this outfit is that most people find it ugly, so you have to find someone who really wants it for the sake of completion *and* has the outfit you want.
---
They are still xp locked
---
So you have to reach 14k overseer rank to unlock the final items (the Christmas hoodie and skeleton outfit)
---
The long coat is further past.
---
I just unlocked the 7k point which is the Halloween armor.
---
They are staggered.
---
Its very easy to hide the wires .use the power connector plans.you can get it in whitesprings.changes the way you set it up.
---
It's just a vending machine like the others, you assign stuff and people buy it sometimes.
---
Testify!
---
If you have that many, chances are new players could use at least some of them. Drop them in a bag in front of V76 or at the Wayward. Good will!
---
Thanks! Happy nuking!
---
This. So much this.
---
They definitely need to rehaul how the 'special' rewards are given. It's bullshit that you need all three animals alive to even get anything good, perhaps if one was it then people would actually do the damn event! Cause apparently doing anything other than Habitat A is too difficult for some people....
---
I maxed out the Halloween one, but the final reward for the Christmas rewards seems to require a lot more xp than people say it does!
---
Yeah it's not a pretty outfit. I just got one yesterday and realized it was super rare. Figured I'd try my luck at getting something cool for it haha.
---
Who is Wendy and why does she eat burgers?
---
It’s got an interior that’s larger than the circus wagon. Also comes with sliding doors
---
Somehow missed this comment - lol, yeah there aren't many, I figured the big babies could go in there too.
---
I'd say it's uncommon now with two vendors carrying it. The wandering trader introduced in wastelanders and the responder bot. Just a matter of server hopping.
---
Kinda easy? I just hit the 7k point to get the beanie and Halloween armor
---
Thank you, that helped a lot!
---
Might be fun actually just to try out now that I’m
---
Looking at it lol. 
---
But yeah I hear you. Totally agree. Would really wish the junk walls from fo4 was implemented
---
Here they are. 
---
https://i.imgur.com/Gpv9CwG.jpg
---
Rationalize it all you want, but a tos breach is a tos breach and if they get suspended they asked for it.
---
They need to make the combat rifle skins just work on it first
---
Ok, I'll be the one. How do you play music in game through the mic?
---
This. I haven't seen player icons on owned workshops since the update. I went to two to claim only to find out they were already claimed. Then, I had to pay to fast travel to workshops I owned.
---
Brings up a sticky situation. What about a pumpkin action shotgun?
---
I just submitted my 4th ticket today.
---
There was a glitch, haven't seen any noticeable lag around player camps who did that!
---
I know where the vendor in my game is,  if ur on ps4. Does the clothing appear for other players?
---
Week 3 of waiting for the red rocket prefab (although this week’s atom shop is a good alternative)
---
I usually make sure to summon the others to tag the legendary, unless they don’t return the favor. Then I just run around and steal all the kills.
---
Deathclaw Wellington, Glowing Meat Steak, Mutant Hound Chops, Mutant Hound Stew, Yao Guai Ribs, and Yao Guai Roast. All that gives you +3 strength and +60% melee damage.  
---
If you rely on power attacks use sunshine oil for +400 AP
---
This! No need to downvote me to hell just saying. Thank you for clarifying for me to some bitter and salty ppl.
---
Only in America ....😉
---
I really just want the skeleton man haha
---
It made me find a piece of headgear I didn't own yet for 12 caps, best daily ever
---
I believe it is placeable inside.
---
The tiles work much better though personally.
---
Also the pack has to be bought to use it, so your friend can’t build you one unfortunately
---
Then bethsda loses more players, the player pool is already small compared to other games. They can't afford to suspend for thier own lack of effort.
---
These were reported as not working.  They are included, with an explanation as to why they are possibly working as intended.
---
You really think an atomic shop skin has any impact on actual quest development?
---
Honestly I just want the skeleton armor. That’s probably the last thing I’ll get right 😭
---
Im wondering how easy the event is to run solo, if i ever get the chance that is
---
As im guessing it would be easier to take the scrap needed to repair the mining equipment with me.
---
Also side note, i have a full set of excavator power armor atm, is it even needed for this event?
---
😳
---
This is the Photo Opportunity daily and both lens plans can drop form this (105mm and 200mm) if you pass either the Charisma or Intelligence check.
---
I think you can have 5 in your camp if you don't have anything else in it!
---
No.it is your choice.
---
Intresting, i was wondering why i was randomly melted few times by my JE lmg  in situation when normally fireproof and dense armor would save me.
---
Drop lone wanderer and group up!
---
It will substantially slow over time, but after 850 hours I'm still earning the occasional atom from challenges that I finish off. If you go challenge hunting with the intention of getting as many atoms as possible, with the removal of atoms as a reward for daily and weekly challenges, you will find that they dry up very fast though.
---
And before you spend badges on the NV lens, check what others have to say. Apparently it’s a waste of badges.
---
Slows the decay at such a tiny amount it'll still all spoil in less than a day!
---
Just fucking happened to me. Game has been closed all day. I just logged in for the first time and I am down 4500 points. 3000 from weeklies and 1500 from dailies. What the actual fuck.
---
It currently does let you do that....
---
Yes, they can be used inside your base. https://i.imgur.com/7xw1F54.jpg
---
Probably, but it has been reported in this thread that this card does not work while sneaking.  I'm leaving it in the list until it is confirmed to work.
---
Thanks
---
I think its that dude's sister
---
The skeleton and ghillie suit unlock much sooner. I am pretty sure I was rank 1 when I started grinding the unlocked rewards and was between 25 and 26 when the last reward unlocked.
---
And how many players do you think they’ve lost do to a lack of enforcing their own rules?
---
Your dancing around trying to justify behavior that violates terms and conditions.
---
Maybe for the rad protection. That’s about the only thing you would need it for this event for.
---
I’ve got a 2x max budget camp, can confirm there’s no extra apparent lag. It takes a little bit longer to load in than normal camps, but once it’s there it’s fine.
---
Inventories are different for each player.
---
The civil war dress seems to be the closest to a poofy ball gown! It's very dirty though.
---
Since the seasons thing has started the only source of free atoms are lifetime challenges and season rewards. It used to be that you got them for daily and weekly challenges but that has just changed.
---
Well RIP, sorry
---
That’s my Shotty with Halloween Paint. David S Pump Action.
---
The skeleton will come before the winter hat or around same tine, iirc from my grind this past weekend. The winter coat is the real rough one.
---
Damb I'd love that for my game
---
Wow, I get a little ticked off when people take my loot after I get downed, but I wouldn't go that far. I don't even use a mic in this game, and really wish it had text chat. I mean geez chill out. It's only a game. We are supposed to be having fun, not getting angry at each other. A couple of the mechanics in this game can be a tiny bit toxic though.
---
I've noticed no difference on loading either, heck one of my camps built in a cave takes twice as long, and that has half of its budget left to build in!
---
The start is VERY generous. You earn atoms for everything you do and it piles up quickly, you'll be earning hundreds for a few hours of play time. This will slow down over time, but you will most likely always have some obscure challenges that go outside your play style that can give you a decent amount. I'm at a thousand hours and still have some challenges for repairing PA parts, repairing shotguns, etc. Also, the season added a bunch of new challenges, so I'm hoping this is a precedent that each season will add more atom challenges to compensate for earning less atoms from the actual season
---
I dont think the idiots at Bugthesda even know themselves when they break something EVERY major patch ...
---
I guess that rock lifted your module off the ground far enough to build up that high?
---
I put my module inside of the pylon when I built there and I could build up on that top, but not very far. I couldn't put walls up there, but I could put a street lamp and some turrets, along with a bit of furniture. Only wall I could put up there were half-walls.
---
I'm currently camped right next to it in the clearing right through the trees, it's turned out to be a good spot. I can place my camp there even when someone has built in that pylon and then i have a neighbor. Not much of any resources, but I can jump down from there and find all kinds of resources.
---
No way to increase it. A level 2 and a level 200 will have the same budget. Turrets(missles take the most), crops, Brahman, big neon billboard lights, any pre-built building all take a lot of budget per item. Display cases and the displayed items take budget. So if you have a lot of displayed bobble heads or magazines, they could be taking up a good amount of budget too.
---
I've noticed they've removed more styles than add.
---
[deleted]
---
Really? I got the beanie first but not the skeleton outfit yet!
---
(Edit: got the armor but not the outfit)
---
Possibly some. But it's about to hit gamepass which would more than make up for whatever they lose.
---
Cool! Planning on stopping after the skeleton. Thanks for your help. I’m gonna grind into the late night. Hopefully I can do it before 4am EST haha
---

---
Here’s my build.
---
It will be really soon then unless you did some grinding when one of the events was active. Stick with it, the coat is 7k after beanie.
---
Totally. I came across one creature in 4 matches, 5th match...7. \*sigh\*
---
OMW to nuke your base for price gouging pumpkins.
---
This thread is gold.
---
You fucking rule.
---
Well there’s an easy solution... mute them. I never said what he did was right or justified. I was just pointing out that there’s a chance that they saw another bloodied player which is possibly a sore point for them trying to complete that event. Personally I’ve never had an issue but a friend of mine can’t stand them on the bases they can’t actually help with that event. 
---
On top of that you need to get a hit on an enemy to get XP and to access the loot and when someone’s one Shotting them it’s a little frustrating. That issues is partly Bethesda fault I feel like if I’m close enough by I should get XP and drops (even if the XP is diminished based on the fact if it was hit/killed by a random player or a teammate). I was maining a melee build and trying to hit something before it died had gotten so frustrating that I’m changing my entire build.
---
Its been happening to alot of people going by the amount of threads on here in the last week. You can put a support ticket in for lost levels, apparantly they are giving 150 atoms to cover a level lost, I assume you'll have to do some maths to work out exactly what you have lost but with atoms as a replacement for lost SCORE, from next week you will be able to buy levels.
---
"accidently" 😉

Play music into your mic via your phone or something, I dunno, What else would it be?

I am convinced Mole Rats are just disease delivery vehicles at this point.

Hi Todd

Happy Fashnacht forever!
---
These are pretty common in parts of the US
---
I guess you could say he was roleplaying as a raider and taking it too seriously.
---
Honestly though, I wouldn't have expected better behavior from someone just taking potshots at everyone he sees.
---
That's legit the best PA skin they've ever released.
---
Alot of people hope that, but the gamepass has other games, bethsda is a play only this or suffer kinda game. So while it might see a slight increase it will be for a short time.
---
I’ve been playing everyday for the last few weeks, I haven’t been up to Morgantown to much lately
---
Itd be cool if it dispensed a free donut with every purchase
---
Ouch... Never thought of that. They usually flag storyline corpses so they don't decay, though. Like none of the Responder corpses turn into meat piles.
---
There's tricks you can do to plant anywhere without those.

I can't stand people that also just hunt you constantly. You die, reload, and try to just go about doing what you were doing and they continue to just hunt you. Like fuck, leave me alone dude. 
---
I had one person stalk me. My friend and I were already in the middle of shit so I didn't want to reload servers and everything. Person eventually gave up after every time they'd kill me or my friend, we would kill them. But it was fucking bizarre. Like, at first they just saw me as a weak target to bully and just kept doing it. 
---
How is that any fucking fun?
---
Ah man that sucks lol..
---
Yeah, the negatives discussed about a build budget increase don’t seem so believable after having a massive camp for a couple months and seeing it under lots of different circumstances. I’ve had two other increased budget camps spawn near mine once, on the same server, in very close proximity. And all that extra strain on the loading area didn’t slow things down at all. We were able to run from one to the other without slowdown or crashing. 
---
I’ve also had up to 7 or 8 people at my camp at once and none of them crashed or reported any massive slowdown. The budget should be increased for sure. If not in public worlds, then definitely in private worlds
---
How hard is it on the CAMP budget?
---
I suppose I’ll continue to grind
---
Here's a crazy idea, maybe don't delete the hairstyles! do you know how frustrating it is trying to role-play a raider when there's no way to get a mohawk anymore? Like you think they have at least re-released it for wastelanders.
---
Slocum's + train car = railroad?
---
In FO4 there was a Slocum's over the Railroad's hideout, entered by a trap door behind the counter. Longshot but it might be a reference. Slim, I know.
---
Could just OD on rad x like a trooper, looks weirder for other players running in with my marine gear and fascnacht sun mask on
---
It's also got really steady recoil so you can easily keep it pointed at her head easily while you wait for your AP to recharge for VATS crit spam.
---
Just make sure your sneak is high due to how close you've got to stand next to her.
---
Makes sense that he used to, since he obviously has got a sharing problem.
---
Pretty funny if true.
---
Does it work with contemporary walls cause that's all I use lol.
---
You're never too old to enjoy a flying saucer.
---
You can’t. It’s a major flaw in NW. Even just to be able to see where you’re at in Overseer rank progress you need to wait until the end of a match.
---
agreed, even with the refreshed weekly's and daily's they still reward score at 3/5 done
---
It's a little chunk. I'd say it takes up the same as the circus cage.
---
I don’t think it works with it if you plan to do it from the start. HOWEVER like I said, you can use the barn walls. Place them both down. Then simply highlight them, and edit them into a different wall. Like the contemporary style
---
I'm not saying they shouldnt reinforce thier rules, I'm saying fix the game, then ban people. You cant blame the player for a poor engine, you cant be mad people will break a grind meant to make you pay. Bethsda works in bad faith, why should the player work in good faith?
---
Cool thanks
---
The circus cage took up a lot though unless they adjusted it at some point
---
Yes you encounter them very early on in the game. Just set up camp or go to your camp and make a weapon work bench.
---
It brought sea of thieves back from the dead, and it's going strong. Downplay it if you like, but gamepass is quite a boon for devs and players alike.
---
No prob.
---
Do you not have any repair kits from fighting the queen?
---
Sneak - If you over 30 agility, you don’t benefit from the sneak card?
---
Is the wandering trader and responder bot a random spawn or do they stick to certain areas? I’m level 175 and I’ve never seen either
---
Just make sure to keep it all to yourself. Do not split it with anyone. The rep loss is way easier to grind back than 500 extra gold.
---
How much do they have the log cabin bundle out for please?
---
Yeah. Mobile auto corrects certain contractions based on my usage of them.
---
because i'm an idiot not well versed in this stuff, where would i go exactly to submit a ticket for ps4?  
---
currently i'm short 2500 score &gt;&lt;  hopefully all the dailies work right tonight.
---
I’m not your butty, asshole.
---
No it doesn’t
---
Any update if this is still working?
---
Ok thanks.
---
Sea of thieves doesnt need to be played daily to complete the end game, fo76 does.  Also sea if thieves wasnt a broken mess, it lacked content they later added, somthing bethsda still fails to do.
---
It happened to me as well. Logged in saw only 4 of each so re logged and 3500 worth autocompleted. I did a ticket
---
People playing today say yes, it is
---
I mean in the vault
---
Yea exteriors are very lacking. Amazed by some folks indoor setups and here I am doing a mostly outdoor water front bar and stage type setup and barely anything. Alot can be accomplished with what's there and a good imagination but it's not our job to create content for ourselves it's Bethesda.
---
My phone auto corrects certain  contractions based on my usage with the French/English keyboard. We're and You're particularly.
---
I’ve seen a lot of new players saying how they’re struggling with ammo so I decided to make this post for them and people who don’t know about it, even though this post can be considered as common knowledge
---
Nope I’ve never fought the queen
---
in my travels of not really looking for it, i have seen it for sale exactly once.  something of a clothing collector lol, and i learned of it the one time i saw it and am really glad i bought it.
---
Yeah I'll test it out tomorrow morning when I next play. I was already thinking of swapping it for Gun Fu, actually. I've been using it right now to make up for Adrenaline a bit, but I'm thinking Gun Fu and Adrenaline together might be an effective combination.
---
Then you’re in trouble.
---
No problem, glad it helps
---
&gt; (I installed OBS just in case to start quick recording in case. I had similar experience sadly.)
---
I imagine your graphics card software probably has a feature to save gameplay that's just happened, so you don't have to keep OBS running constantly to get clips of stuff like this.
---
I think budget does increase slightly the more you level up, up to a certain point. That might have been debunked, though. I can’t remember.
---
Nigga just shoot them again

Okay. Well mine does. Ive accidentally sold a gun worth 15 scrip when I only had 12. The gun was gone but I got the 12. Its happened more than once.  Maybe my game is broken then.  
---
No need for down votes.
---
Ok its just a vendor instead of the usual one got it.
---
Great
---
Just doing it for SCORE as I don‘t like pvp.
---
1. Joining solo without a team.
---
2. Moving from bush to bush until it is done.
---
3. Watching YT or doing something else until someone kills me
---
4. Dislike it most of the time.
---
Had a few funny moments when another bush guy took the same bush and did not recognize/kill me.
---
I mostly get under the top ten for the extra bonus.
---
Others get a free kill ... Win-Win
---
I also unlocked some nice skins for adventure mode.
---
I hate bethesda for forcing adventure mode players to do pvp to get all rewards. Now even in the weekly challenge.
---
IMO everyone should have the option to finish the challenges in Adventure Mode OR Nuclear Winter.
---
Can‘t be that difficult to provide two options for each challenge.
---
First, I need the fixer plan.
---
It keeps the faeries out of your head.
---
Put a door wall there, then another in the same place, it’ll let you do that.
---
Yeah. It's part of the bundle. People keep saying it's inclusion is just greedy be wise the train car has nothing to do with diners.
---
Not from a purveyor...
---
Right. To echo the above comments
---
1) do the daily with Rocksy and Wren
---
2) take photos of Foundation and give to The raider in the tower
---
3) sell mirelurk meat to Ohio River Raiders (Queen is best)
---
4) look for random encounters and help the Raiders out. Personally had best luck at The hunting lodge and NAR repair lodge
---
Just landed the skeleton outfit! Good luck on the grind friend! It also awards a bit of adventure xp if you last long enough, the grind is annoying but the cosmetics worth it
---
I'm all for it as long as it's an option to choose between. I'd much rather have 15 chances for super duper to activate. 
---
"But food is so easy to get... yadda yadda yadda"
---
Don't care.
---
It would probably not interact well with super duper. 
---
.
---
It would also somehow allow people to duplicate legendary weapons.
---
Just picked up all the junk and it worked, thank you again. You’re a legend, I was so frustrated!
---
just like FO4 had the secret understory that you're really a synth, I think FO76 has a secret understory: we're in a VR simulation, the BETA for opening the vault. We're all in couches a la Dr Braun, and the reason nothing is permanent (including death) is a hint.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
That's why nothing is canon or fits with the rest of the FOU.
---
Just got this as well. First time logging in today and I am unable to claim 4500 SCORE between dailies (-1500) and weeklies (-3000)
---
Go  [here](https://help.bethesda.net/) and login to the same bethesda account that you have linked to your PS4, then select fallout 76 and follow the prompts.
---
No, but there is a workbench at the overseers camp by the Wayward
---
They should replace the level up one with this. This actually encourages people to check the vendors, even if just to buy one bullet for one cap. I actually managed to find a nice armor piece that I wouldn't have bothered looking for. Leveling up is just something that happens while you do other things.
---
I'd even take that at this point.
---
He's talking about Vault 79, not 76, he's clearly in the middle of doing the vault raid and needs to repair.
---
They'll sure have a blast when they see my 1 cap plan vendors right next to Wayward. I'd give them away but I don't want some high level snatching them all up.
---
Everything other than the Lunchbox drinks, Blooded/Junkies legendaries(Only weapons I sell and they go quick, don't want to waste people's time or STASH space!), and some rarer end plans like grenades/meds go for 1 cap!
---
I'm still new myself and saving to buy the rest of the serum recipes but I just feel generous lol 
---
Plenty of .38 ammo too, and some water purifiers unlocked behind the house along with some free soup and goodies provided by Commutron!
---
Or just don't. Don't be manipulated by Bethesda. They're using such simple tricks and everyone falls for it.
---
I didn't hop on until 8 hours later and it still fucked me. Missing 3k of weeklies and 1.5k of dailies.
---
FO1st actually has a better deal on Atoms, plus stuff
---
It already uses the mods from scrapping, so it might as well.
---
Ok must've been close by. It was like a year and a half ago. I don't remember specifically.
---
When im on my main and theres legendary spawns in an event I typically shoot it once then do the follow me emote to people to try draw their attention to it, I was doing that when at first it was me and two others at Uraniam Fever at the start and then exactly same thing happened, bunch of 150+ come in and ruin it
---
I don’t need those I’m doing the buried treasure quest
---
Ok. I’m in no hurry, but just spent some atoms and worried that I’d  possibly have to spend real money to get some other stuff.
---
Thanks btw
---
Thanks, I made a edit about scrapping weapons with the scrapper perk and for plastic farming, go to Morgantown and Watoga highschools as well as scrapping laser weapons with the scrapper perk. What’s allegheny, I haven’t heard of that place before
---
Four total
---
They don't need to pull money from the casual crowd because the vets almost likely the whales.
---
Bought some from atom shop
---
When you click ESC instinctively to get rid of it and it opens a huge tab mid fight. Smh
---
Thanks for responding
---
Thank you
---
There should be an option, I think R3 or such, that will toggle unlockable options.
---
Just remember the 180. That will cause previously looted areas to reset during a gaming period. 
---
This is great if you are farming lead and the various known locations - you can reset them by collecting junk and then go and do those lead sources again.
---
Video game announcements are like two weeks away they normally have sales then
---
I see. 
---
If you have 50 atoms you could but a repair kit from the atom shop. because i don't know if there are any workbenches
---
bogus.  i need more vending or a proper auction house &gt;&lt;
---
At rank 3 i think it ignores 38% armor and adds 9% chance tk stagger, so isnt all bad, im pairing it with the 3 maxed out rifleman perks so it adds a fair amount
---
Also if you have maxed covert operative a stealth shot is about 3-4x the usual damage multiplier for stealth
---
Yeah, i remember when I first went there I was confused but the map did help and watching videos, specially how to get to the chemistry workbench helped. Guess I’ll make a edit about this, thanks for mentioning it
---
thanks.  for some reason i was thinking it was some kind of a native interface on each console.
---
ammosmith + super duper
---
So it’s not like the nuka cola vending machine?
---
I have to have three vending machines and then that guy?
---
Whack.
---
I reallllllly wish you had the option of making one that didn't cover your hair 😭 so devastated.  
---
But yeah, I'm still very pleased with it.
---
I tested it, and it works as a gas mask - but it does not prevent waterborne hazards.
---
The same thing happened to me :(
---
It's been said many times but since there are lot of new players, here it is...use a shotgun when going for the 25 critical hits. Each pellet equals a hit, so you should get 8 crits in 1 shot. Makes it much faster.
---
Actually they are. I got the last season of COD with free points, and wasn’t sure how tough it would be so I hit it hard. Finished halfway through the season. I skipped two weeks in the current one and am still half done. 
---
But this is Bethesda and FO76, so who knows. It seems events are now awarding score points, if that’s the case most people should be able to finish but I suspect they want it to last pretty much the whole season as the player base is pretty bitchy if things don’t take forever. And then they also bitch if things take too long.
---
Yes - in the area outside the main vault door.
---
It's all there, you just gotta look for it cos the benches are pretty spread out.
---
I don't think level should matter. If you're level 2 and you have a butt load of resources, you should be able to build. Probably more so if you spend money on the game/subscription. A home is a home and the amount is the same at 2 or 200.   
---
My budget was through the roof before I put the bobbleheads and magazine rack down unfortunately. I'm just going to scrap a lot and start over. \*sniff\*
---
Good thinking! It would be awesome it you had the choice for just the mask, but I'm more obsessed with the outfit part.
---
Its why we need instanced dungeons, hell a free game like archeage managed it just fine and didnt charge stupid amounts for it from the community
---
They made it work like this
---
When you go to a dungeon entrance you get a portal, door or what have you, when you go to enter it asks what type of dungeon instance you want to create
---
You can then choose from a private instance for your group, an open dungeon where all players show up or a completely solo experience and even added a queue system to allow you to matchmake with similar leveled players if needed (now mind you this was very early builds of the game and havent played in a few years so it could have changed)
---
They could easily do this for fallout
---
Can you sell things to it?
---
I *can* blame a player for violating an agreement they entered into. 
---
Two wrongs don’t make a right.
---
I "love" that it won't let you do that but it WILL let you keep selling after hitting your 1000 scrip limit.
---
You'll get to point in either questline where it will say if you proceed you'll be unable to side with either faction, stop there and go do the other one
---
Theres no real point anyways. Nothing's going to be too threatening to your camp unless it's a scorch beast, but that's rare and even then the turrets wouldn't help.
---
Same level. Me and a buddy nuke Morgantown sometimes and while the ghouls aren't as abundant, the flux you can get is more varied. 
---
The whitesprings is definitely a better place to nuke for legendary stuff.
---
Ok thank you
---
A must-have for a bloodied build
---
It’s rude not to share butt pics
---
The game let's you do that if you are close to your scrip cap, but not if the scrip machine can't afford it!
---
When you’re in NW it will show them.
---
Today is placing your camp 3x
---
Open your map button, select challenges and there you are.
---
The quick access is based on console. PS4: OPTIONS&gt;RIGHT PAD)
---
As for others couldn’t tell ya
---
The product should be fully functional, it is not, this is a broken product. Any agreements are void, since the only way to tell if the product is broken is to buy it and play it. If you need proof the product is broken ask Australia, where they were forced to give refunds for this game. The more people defend this game the worse bethsda will get.
---
Yeah I kind of feel you. Few were around thought I'd try out the new teams, hoping for some help because I'm a lowly 50. Started the event a bunch joined in and not a one went for the conduit. So I tried and died repeatedly, eventually others started but was to late at that point. Little bummed.
---
Have you adjusted the World Radios slider?
---
(Edit: also they can sound low if you are away from them. Did you use the classical radio or Appalachia?)

Yep, dunno why it’s so quiet tbh
---
Everyone I've talked to about this, myself included, customer support just auto lock the ticket after giving an automated message saying they cannot offer any help at all...
---
What tiles do you mean? Like the garden plots in FO4?
---
Yeah the pack is on sale for 11 bucks (I think) which seems a little steep since I'd basically just be getting it for the planter.
---
Yeah probably, it’s meant for people who like taking pictures or have bought everything else most likely
---
It's the 33% VATS. Limb damage is another. Can oneshot in VATS.
---
Holy crap with the downvotes guys. Calm down.
---
I wondered the same thing. Super random part of that bundle.
---
Oh so it just means complete the daily NW challenges for 3 days this week. I was thinking there was a separate nuclear winter daily challenge board or something, I kind of feel like a dodo now lol. Thank you so much for clarifying
---
I don’t condone any party willfully violating their portion of an agreement. 
---
Whether or not Bethesda has done so does not open the door for the players to violate their agreement. 
---
And that’s not how these kinds of agreements work. Read the T&amp;C. It doesn’t have any clause about the product having to have a certain level of performance.  
---
Someone else having a lack of integrity isn’t a valid reason to have a lack of integrity yourself.
---
If your bank makes an accounting or payment error, you still have the obligation to follow your side of the agreement. That can mean paying your credit card bill on time or face late fees and interest.
---
By your logic, if the statement got lost in the mail, you don’t have to pay your bill. And that’s utterly ridiculous.
---
Thats a good idea
---
LOL, yes. Most of the player base isn’t interested, and those that are would be very disappointed in the result. Fallout can’t handle encrypted, let alone 6v6+ in close quarters with fast action. 
---
The companies that make PvP games put more development into performance optimization than has been put into all of 76.
---
*fasnacht tune plays*
---
Me: Let's fucking goooooooooooooo!
---
Finding out that this was our's, rather than a standard Atom Shop outfit, was great.  
---
Much as I like the Riot Gear, this is far more up my alley.   
---
I wonder if they're gonna add variations like they did with the Gear though, as I'd be intrigued to see what they add to it or what palettes they apply.

Found this. I guess it makes sense.
---
When oh when are scrap kits and repair kits going on sale again? Fuck everything else, I burn through scrap kits
---
Is a camp placed the same way as adventure mode?
---
 I never had headaches like this before.
---
I consider myself I good builder. Have received numerous compliments on many different builds. If you want my opinion on what makes a good camp, small space, packed full of stuff. Walls, floors, and ceilings take a lot of budget too. My best builds have been smaller buildings, or no buildings with a lot of decor and good lighting. Different lighting work better in different situations. The light up advertisements in wall decor are great. They cost less budget then a normal light, and they don't count towards your 50 light cap.
---
Perhaps Bethesda could actually provide score to players who do the dailies and weeklies? No? OK we won't get anything then...
---
It reminds me of Lord Humungus from Mad Max 2
---
I don’t see anything I really want on the board anyway. I haven’t spent any atoms since I started playing in 2018 so I don’t have any interest in outfits or weapon skins.
---
How about they make it so that when I log in the challenges aren't already finished, and I can actually earn SCORE. That'd be a good start.
---
Jesus, what an utter thundercunt
---
That one was fun. It went to every camp on my server and bought something even if it was just a few shells or a chem. I found a few not too bad legendaries for the alt I just started too so that was nice.
---
I don't think you can sell stuff that's in the freezer, which makes it useless for this purpose.
---
THAT IS AWESOME!!! thank you in the name of science
---
What is the sound heard when queen hits the ground? Is that catbug?!
---
Much as body tattoos would be nice, most outfits/armors cover them up.
---
I also know. 
---
Because I like to eat.
---
I was wondering the same hopefully its a little different and not just a color swap :P
---
They are not offering anything, no evidence has been provided of this, they just lock your ticket!
---
Because they’re being realistic. Bethesda has a bottom line. No matter how shitty and annoying it is, they’re for profit.
---
When somone doesnt have integrity I agree, but this is a corporation. Your a fanboy so you'll defend anything they do, that being said have fun this is a useless arguement.
---
14, the daily reset bug has been rough...
---
10/31 twenty-four seven.
---
That was me.
---
Or fixing Smiley so I can buy some damn gold.
---
It's legit wild to me that people aren't making a bigger deal about his. I'm missing 4500 atoms, 3000 from weeklies. This is completely fucked
---
this david blaine looking...
---
The garden plot tiles are bought with bullion.
---
The bundle has lots of good cosmetics, I bought the double pack just because
---
If you're on PC I can add those attachments for you free of charge. I grinded out all the attachments when I got a furious FFR 10mm SMG.
---
I’d rather grind for a legendary if a type I *know* I want, rather than just RNG/trade for it.
---
Ohhhh no, you get better ones for free from killing the Queen. It's actually not that hard even if you're low level. Might not be able to do the silo but joining in on Queen's is easy, I suggest finding some friends who are into doing triple Queen nuke runs
---
Hahahaha I just saw a former raider running through crater 5 feet from rocksy
---
Ngl I just did this and got a Tesla rifle the team joining and fast traveling is op
---
Loading in puts me under my floors, but I just high tail it a couple of meters turn around and watch my creation come to life, fast travelling always puts me out the back. 
---
Next camp going to try putting the unit right where the front door will be and build back from that... just realised that's going to limit the size as it is always in the centre :I
---
Any pictures or videos of the inside of the railcar?
---
Please elaborate. I for one find Melee challenging. Seeing as I am in the face of the Enemy and very vulnerable if I get cornered. Not to mention glass cannon builds that literally have like 50 health. Or running a nuke zone with an unarmed build, having to figure out how not to get swarmed with virtually no armor. Yeah melee is op in this game but I feel it is far from, as you say, lazy. While you sit back from enemies and pick them off from a safe distance.
---
I hit cap limit really fast! Had to leave Uranium Fever, shut the garage door turning off the vending machines, and then Traveling back to Fever. It was one of the better challenges
---
Yes they are :)
---
So I logged on tonight and this just started. I waited a few minutes till more people showed up. I travel there to find nobody started the event with 5 seconds left and it failed. What a waste
---
Your onto something there!!!! if only I had the Grognak outfit.
---
Just out of curiosity, how many of your weekly or daily challenges have auto completed?
---
They are making a big deal about it its just bethesda is gonna do jack shit about it.
---
you know what...I kind of agree with this, I'm a solo player but I like the additional sense of stress and danger that comes with non NPC folks in the mix.
---
Keep getting trash, or stuff for shop never seem to find anything I'm interested in
---
Yeah agreed, sorry this wasn’t meant to take away from the numerous current problems in game, was just a suggestion for the future
---
The responder robot has a bunch of different places he has a chance to spawn
---
But you can buy high cap items from a player vender after they hit max caps.
---
I learned this the hard way too, and since then I make sure to swap Bloody Mess out, because it's distinct and knowing I'll be losing damage makes me pay the extra attention.
---
I dunno who this guy is or if it's the same person each time, but these posts are such great value. I appreciate the act of doing this for the rest of the community. I'm stuck in a maternity ward and have been for three days and seeing the new Slocums had got me all jacked up for going home!
---
Man I love those tinny horns
---
Appalachia radio and also when I’m close to it it’s quiet
---
You only get cut off once you commit to joining one side or another in the final quest.  You need to collect 3 companions for each side so you have a good amount of content for each.
---
Run both factions up to "Side with....".  From there you HAVE to pick one.  I don't think it matters which you choose other than having a chance at upping rep by sharing the gold with that specific one.
---
The only change I noticed is that I chose to side with the settlers and share my gold as agreed.  The settlers sometimes comment on it.  I haven't heard any chatter from the raiders.
---
You continue to get your dailies and access to rewards on both sides with no problem.
---
You can do this challenge in 5 seconds just place the box move two feet place the box then do it again, I suck at nuclear winter so I like this challenge lol.
---
You can't say anything without all the bitches coming out of the woodwork to complain.
---
Can we see?
---
0, I only played for two days this week
---
Great. According to this I'm 6 levels behind where I should be. Prob from the 3 damn days it took for my game to update and my scores to start registering.
---
Weird, might be a bug. Never noticed that
---
Yep, it's glitched. Has been for over 2 years. I doubt Bethesda will fix it at this point, given they have other priorities and the bug seems related some core combat mechanics. If you test around a bit, even using the shotgun with 0 shotgun perks will 1 shot everything except scorchbeasts/SBQ/sheepsquatch.
---
And there’s the assumption insult: **fanboy**. The clarion call of someone that can no longer defend their argument. 
---
I literally said Bethesda has responsibilities on their side.  A ‘fanboy’ wouldn’t do that. 
---
I’m a realist.  And trying to claim that because a ‘corporation’ didn’t fulfill its alleged responsibilities somehow indemnifies the other party from following their portion of the agreement is ridiculous and naive. 
---
That’s not how contracts or terms &amp; conditions work. 
---
Look in the T&amp;C. You’ll find provisions for ***arbitration**. Which means that before the consumer can take action that would violation the T&amp;C, they have to go through certain steps. They can’t just skip ahead and do whatever they want. 
---
But you clearly don’t care about the agreements. You only care that someone gets to ‘stick it to the man’. And you’re an apologist for those that choose to violate their agreements. 
---
The only difference is you choose to grant leeway to one side over the other. 
---
I don’t. **Both** parties are responsible for following their agreements. 
---
And since you can’t defend or argue against that logically, you call me a ‘fanboy’. Which is hilarious, because I never defended Bethesda.  
---
Please, show me where I defended them. 
---
Holding both sides accountable is literally an unbiased position. 
---
But nice try. Let me know when you have an actual valid argument instead of ‘lol, fanboy’.
---
I guess a ‘rabid illogical hater’ sees anyone that disagrees with them as a ‘fanboy’.
---
Yeah probably a bug. Can I report it on this sub reddit?
---
If you're on windows 10, you can change the audio output device of individual programs  
---
I use vlc media player to play music and stuff, so I spliced together an mp3 of the song, and that "please rise" part lol  
---
then I set vlc's output device to be the same one as my microphone, then I pressed the actual physical mute button on my mic, went to fallout, turned audio from push to talk to open mic, and then waited til the right moment and alt tabbed out and played my audio file, and then tabbed back into the game  
---
I use a virtual audio cable tho, so that may be why it was so easy for me, not sure if it will work without one, but it might!
---
I always use the come here emote when I see a legendary and I appreciate the others that do as well. Perhaps those “high level players” were just terrified of getting destroyed by the legendary mole miner and that is why they had to kill him so quick?
---

Yes! I saw a lady wearing it and messaged her just to ask what it was. I want a fabulous dress! Cutest thing by the way — she must have been playing with her husband because her username was Mrs[username of the player she was running with]. Marriage goals.

Awesome! Welcome aboard fellow Dweller!

Stepbro, I’m stuck.

THIS 100%

That is its own issue. At least one player still reaps a benefit (the buyer). But I would like to see that adjusted in some way too.
---
I’d say submit a ticket through Bethesda and see what they respond with. Or wait till someone else comments.
---
score points are not xp
---
depending on your model of modem, some modems are butched firmware and they disable pf as well.

Just got mine too 😎

IIRC it’s a special NW version, but I wouldn’t know much about it.
---
Lol
---
You dont believe bethsda is to blame for the bugs in thier game but the player is. This is my defention of a fanboy, if you don't like it that is your problem. Why is there no bug or exploit to cheat in any other season pass? Oh that's right it's not a broken "game". If it doesnt require you to use a 3rd party software, it's not a cheat it is an issue with the game. Also clam down it was a simple comment you took way to hard, I didnt slap your mother, we're talking online my option of you means nothing.
---
He fried his brain taking all those chems in the hot sun while he was a raider.
---
Psycho's a helluvah drug.
---
Shotguns combined with certain armor legendaries (bashing damage, reduce damage while blocking, etc) give a huge boost to shotguns, i believe it has been a thing for a while, no idea why they haven't fixed this yet.
---
How do I submit a ticket? I’m new to this sub and fallout 76 so I don’t know how to do it. Do you do it via Bethesda’s website?
---
The pics from that website are noticing compared to what they really were
---
Score give legendaryrun rank.  Xp gives level rank. That's why its two different events.
---
Yep.. All but one of my dailies and weeklies were auto-completed on login.. Lost something close to 7k SCORE. Submitted 4 separate (useless) tickets today just to try and force their eyes open.
---
I think is the case here, is so dumbed down that I can't even allow only trusted macs connection

Evidently you don't. Double xp is double XP, so leveling and the repeatable score challenge will fill twice as fast. Double score is double score. Anything that will yield score will yield twice as much. Don't down vote someone because you have reading comprehension issues.

I told them that after I sent a ticket after I clicked on an atomic shop item to inspect it and instead it went straight to purchasing it even though I didn’t click purchase, but of course they don’t care
---
I’m pretty sure it actually comes with it; I didn’t have one before I got the bundle but I have one now..
---
So, I don’t think you really get a say in the matter. There are people who have already lost between 4-6 lvls or SCORE this week because their weeklies auto completed. If you’re not having issues, fantastic, but other players are. You don’t get to say that their complaints aren’t justified simply because you aren’t having the issue. They deserve the same chance to finish the Season as everyone else without having to email Bethesda’s atrocious customer support everyday to have them fix the issue.
---
Also, OP clearly stated that they needed to rework the system so that everyone can complete the season, not just hand out the rewards. No where did he say Bethesda should just give everyone everything, but you would know that if you took time to actually read and comprehend what he was trying to say instead of looking to make fun of other members of the community while using clown emojis on reddit.
---
I’m a bloodied build I despise people that bash it it’s like bro I grinded and I’m specced to do a huge amount of damage don’t get angry cuz ur doing double digit damage at level 100
---
Agree, though I have mixed feelings about this.  For the sake of consistency and immersion low level players should be smashed in the Mire and Bog and high level players should be able to breeze through the Forest if assisting low levels.  
---
Granted, I've been playing since the beginning and it might be nice to make the left hand side of the map worth going to in terms of challenge and rewards.
---
I feel your pain.. 6250 for me. Been submitting reports to Bethesda all day to try and force some response/fix
---
I keep thinking about those but tired of always having to eat and drink. I can’t fathom not having those perks and having to eat and drink even more.
---
And toxic players will never be satisfied. No one is without blame and your rhetoric is the same I hear from people just looking to complain. Then they insult someone else by labelling them as “fanboys”. I like Fallout 76 and make good money and I’ll continue to support it know why? It’s my choice and I don’t expect everything to be perfect.
---
*finally, someone with the guts to help me to my bunk.*
---
That guy actually killed me, so thank you for the revenge!
---
Exactly. And why should u nerf it? You literally need to be like basically dead to get good damage. Imo its balanced
---
I don’t have any friends who play fallout
---
The point is to kill it before it kills u I’m walking around one hit all the time
---
Double digit lol. Maybe if they used both hands they can have Quad digit damage levels like us...!!!
---
People complain about level 400 plus players but honestly, if you plan your build, you can be ready to roll at or right around level 50. I really wish they would add an area with actual hard mobs.
---
This. Minus the game crash this is exactly my story earlier this morning. 6250 score down, submitted multiple error reports today in the hopes this doesnt happen again
---
I’m rocking a bloodied faster fire rate gauss shotgun doing 4000 a shot it’s not my fault you can’t do that lol
---
Really? He didn’t answer my question. Maybe you should open your eyes and read the screen better.
---
All that Donating our reward to the foundation adds up
---
I have a BE but I think I'd rather have the Faster fire rate for the submachine gun.
---
Easier to plant crops on top of a campfire tbh.
---
I just want some cute tattoos!!
---
Hah if only, if the private servers were priced more resonably, i would consider it just for me and my friends
---
In my currency which is GBP its about £11.99 a month or £100 a year, which is rediculous when you consider a lot of games give servers away for free or as part of their founders packs
---
If it was £3.99 or £4.99 a month and £40-45 a year i would happily consider it, but the benefits are extremely lackluster for the pricetag
---
Im more afraid of gold bullion farming then any legendary enemy, besides teleporting glitched out level 80 wendigos, those scare the hell out of me
---
Tactical Hipster Discount Jason!
---
The Scrip machine lets you go over your personal limit of 1,000 and eat the loss, but it doesn't let you go over its limit of 150.
---
LOL spot on!
---
I always do that when it pops up on the xbox LFG page.  The problem is even when people show up they all group up in the same habitat most of the time... it really should be an event that is able to be triggered like encryptid or scorched earth!
---
I learned early how to use throwing knives specifically for this reason
---
Only one i think ill have an issue with is the crit hits....I don’t know how to do that
---
Yeah. I was logged in at the time of reset and when I checked the new challenges they were 5/8 and 4/7 complete already. Someone else had similar problems as they were logged in at the time of reset too.
---
Wait... Action boy got hit???
---
Other than that I agree it's an awesome step forward and will only improve!
---
If you like I sell these for 350 caps on XB1
---
Thanks, I just reported it and they hopefully should get back to me. I’ll give you an update when they message me again!
---
Sorry you ran into such a horrible person.  Almost exact opposite of the experience I had when I killed a wanted player last night for the challenge.  They were standing inside their home and I killed him, didn't touch his stuff.  When he came back I dropped some plans I had on me I already knew.  He heart emoted me, I thumbs up him and we each went about our gaming.    
---
Sucks folks have to sometimes behave like in your story.  I play games to escape the stress and nonsense of real life.  Absoilutely no reason for someone to act like over over just a game.
---
Just get all the mutations from a river. Seriously theirs no downside to having all of them. They work with all builds and with the new team system we have no downsides to all mutations.
---
If a lowbie on  pc needs the serum I will hook you up. Under 60 and no alts please.
---
So did I but then I lost it so I bought another copy
---
To increase your camp budget, money is required. Pay only 10 dollars per month to get 50% more camp space, pay 20 dollars to get 100%.please Note: these are additional costs, you still need to pay the money for your fallout 1st membership.
---
try some of the mountain areas. I’m not saying where mine is because I don’t want to risk losing it.but go explore the mountains and find a nice area with a view. some of the mountains have a really nice view. Mine i can see a lot of cool things as well as watch nukes drop since the whitesprings is in the distance.
---
Oof. Did you lose all your progress or was it saved?
---
Even if there meta is like two rolls of the same dice like if Somone gets somthing your looking for you can just trade them it literally multiplies the effectiveness of doing these events if you just share. Anyone who argues luck is bsing because iirc, The luck just applies condition and mods to it not the actual roll.
---
Someone bought the toilet paper i had listed for 500 caps. I was over the moon lmao
---
They should just add a flag for pvp yes/no so people who want to pvp can, and those who do not wont be dragged into it. Make workshops override it
---
If they don't fix my auto completing score rewards I might just have to look into this myself. I am all for doing this legit but I just lost 4000 score today and it doesn't seem like I am going to be compensated. AT THE VERY LEAST, give me the atoms to buy the ranks that I am missing because of this glitch. I know damn well they can give me atoms since they can't give score apparently.
---
Unfortunately this perk that almost every character I’ve ever used ... USES, is getting nothing out of the perks. AP boosts via armor seem to be working though.
---
Pipe wrench
---
It's worth it tbh. Even if you dont have a lot of time to play an hour or so a day will net you so much scrap by the end of the month. When your month runs out you'll have more space in your stash and only have to get speings/ballistic fibers
---
I think Ward still is a raider deep down, honestly.
---
It's a random encounter... So if you check every ten to fifteen minutes while the blast zone is active you have chance to spawn it.
---
I think its easier to name the useful ones instead
---
It doesn't require much coordination... people just need to spread out into all 3 habits! 50%+ of the time I am in B or C alone and theres at least 5 people in A (and they still somehow let their friendly animal get killed 😅 that happened twice yesterday...)
---
Floater grenades
---
That would be sweet! Not to mention would have fit perfectly to this seasons space theme.
---
No but they’ll get a few caps.
---
I think so too. He is a wolf in sheeps cloth.
---
Thankfully my progress is connected to my Xbox account
---
Yea and the Jason like outfit is awsome too
---
That’s a shame ward likes me at the moment
---
Simplest solution that should make the most players happy. I've brought this up several times before but it always gets downvoted. The PvE community absolutely hates any idea that makes the game more enjoyable for PvPers, even if its an idea that makes the game better for them too.
---
That would work well, have a quick setting like that when you make a team and the old initiation filled would apply
---
Ghoul slayers gamma gun
---
I just left the savage divide. Down south there’s a house you can take over that has Halloween decorations up. It’s a sweet spot if you are into pumpkins.
---
You mean like a reflex sight with a flip-to-side magnifier?
---
No.
---
I always assumed the mods to the legendary used a similar system to the RNG of destiny
---
You kill an an enemy
---
System runs the dice roll to see what loot pool is used
---
Then it runs what type of gear item you get from the loot pool
---
After that it generates the affix and prefixes for the item
---
Then its level is generated based on your level versus the enemy/event level
---
Then the modification parts are rolled
---
Finally you get the item
---
If its not like this then I'm not sure what voodoo crap magic Bethesda pulled here
---
This was an issue before the game was even released in **beta!?** 😱
---
Yeah, exactly that. Damn.
---
Your good i gues, its alota xp tho
---
This is not the issue for 90% of the people having this issue today. I myself wasn't even on when the reset happened, I came home from work and found out I lost 4k score because it auto completed. I didnt leave the game running, I wasnt in at reset, and they didnt complete at 3/5.
---
I’d be down for some Settler Rep after I maxed out the Raiders and got the ammo machine I quit grinding and even turning in treasury notes.
---
No kidding dude I think Bethesda should go on Facebook more in some PVP groups instead of just hanging out in reddit some of the comments regarding PVP are cringeworthy as hell.
---
Who cares dude lol move on
---
It could just replace pacifist mode. Make the default mechanics the same as pacifist (since that's how the majority of players want to play anyway) then add an option players have to go into the menu so they can have looser PvP restrictions. This should give everyone what they want.
---
Bethesda PR team puttin in work
---
You can end the event early/ very quickly if more than 2 people are collecting ore. It ends when you hit lvl 4. Much less time for the scavengers to die.. but then some people complain because they only join the event to farm ghouls...
---
Yeah, I was pleasantly surprised. The outfit is actually pretty cool. I love it.
---
Ugh I had some Atom saved up for free late season levels and they dropped that caboose today. 10 levels for a caboose!
---
And a big bushy beard!
---
3* nocturnal shovel
---
I got 2/3 today even though it's the first day
---
Are you sure its Action Boy and not Lone Wanderer that you claim is broken. My Action Boy still works and I've haven't used Lone Wanderer since the patch drop as its a solo play perk card.
---
Insert Reddit *First time?* Meme
---
And Samuel absolutely was not in a vault. Looting a Vault Tec gift shop doesn't mean you lived in one. Jen also hid she had spies for parents. Those Foundation people are way shadier than the Raiders.
---
I like the idea of a pre existing building... I’ll try that
---
Or honestly just keep the PVP initiation like it was and just make pascifist where you can't be initiated outside of a workshop at all even if someone sparks off a teammate
---
I wish they would let us wallpaper both sides of a wall. There are some nice brick walls I'd love to use as an exterior, plus it would make interior rooms much better.
---
I got the skeleton suit a few days ago but have not gotten the beanie or the outfit, they must be more than it says.
---
I hate fast traveling there because it adds that stupid clown costume miscellaneous quest to my quest log.
---
looks crap though
---
I was not aware of that, but I'm happy that's the case. My new goal is to fill up a display with vocal sacks.
---
I've gotten the beanie two days ago, still no luck on the jacket.
---
Absolutely. I love pvp (even though I'm no good). I hate battle royales. Tdm/ ctf would be WAY more fun than NW
---
I use them as much as I use my shotgun to be honest.
---
No, it not being favoritable for Nuclear Winter is entirely intentional as making it unusable in the mode requires a keyword to be *added*.
---
This is how I feel having to do his quest everyday
---
Nocturnal Rolling Pin. Or just the Rolling Pin in general.
---
Ngl I didn't even notice that they had a fix patch, everything is the same for me
---
I wondered the same after reading this (many have reported the issue with Action Boy/Girl here over the past week) but it seems to be true. Initially I saw my AP fast generating as usual but that guy has a couple of AP boosting armor parts. When I tested him without the armor and only the perks I could not see any difference with or without the card. There are better accounts if you want to dig into the topic on this sub.
---
I saw Angry Turtle do some comparisons on AP refresh rates and Action B/G is basically useless when compared to AP refresh rates on armor. 3 pieces and your AP goes back up in 6 seconds.
---
Ok just got on. Should I buy the bundle or just the vendor. I’m not really one of those players who makes their camp look like a bar or restaurant. Train car is the only other interesting part from the bundle but can’t just get that like the vendor.
---
looks great!
---
22 but after today I don't even know if I want to do the grind, lost out on 4k score because bethesda can't fix auto completing challenges.
---
That sounds right to me!
---
Rusty knuckles for raider power armor
---
The metal walls work fairly well for a diner. You can  create diner style (table level) windows by placing a solid metal half wall and stacking  a windowed metal half wall on top of it.
---
You can also use the metal roof angles at ground level to make retro looking fins that look like a diner. Not perfect but works pretty well til they release a diner wall set..
---
I maxed out settler rep last week now wards giving me infinite vital equipment
---
Nah it's like borderlands iorc, roll what gun it is, roll barrel roll barrel quality repeat for all slots then set the name based on the parts, there's also "weapon quality" sweetspots based on enemy type  eg doublebarrel&gt;pump&gt;combat shotgun
---
That's nice and all, but I stopped caring when you started putting words in my mouth. Maybe you should stop frothing at the mouth about lost score, take your own advice, and do a bit of reading before saying something. 
---
And for future reference, if you plan on writing out some virtue signaling garbage from whatever strawman you created in your mind, you probably shouldn't mislead it with "just out of curiosity"
---
Defending them counts as an event too
---
Yes, you can set up inside, but you can't use the rear door or put a door on the open end, if that matters to you
---
I'm on xbox and I have it all of the time.  Nothing like chewing up a clip and spitting it into thin air at 95% VATS.
---
Ahh so part by part instead of the destiny method, would be interesting to know what it actually uses, as the amount if 3* rolling pins and instigating pitchforks i have earned so far is getting rediculous
---
Level 21
---
Allegheny asylum, the kitche upstairs has a LOAD of plastic in a small area, its also a good source for ballistic fiber, and can find a handful of acid and lead as well
---
Edit: its in the south east close by the savage divide. You go through it along the main questline
---
It's sad really. I hear so much more toxicity from PvE players that put themselves in situations that open themselves to PvP. I've had literally one experience with a group of truely toxic PvP players in my 1500 or so hours, but I can't tell you how many PvE players I've encountered that have screamed and messaged me threats and insults for doing nothing more than playing the game. You look at the posts on here and read the things these players say and it makes you wonder how on earth this is the "nicest online community". I've seen so many people wish death and harm on another just because they were killed in a Workshop and had their 300lbs of junk taken. It's like the community is filled with immature 12 olds that throw a tantrum when they lose and can't handle any sort of competition.
---
Where did I say Bethesda isn’t  responsible for the bugs?  Please, **link that comment**.  Support your argument, if you can. 
---
Or did you jump to an illogical assumption?  If so, show some integrity and admit that you made a false claim.
---
Wait how can this glitch happen? How did you lose 4000 score? Hopefully I don’t have this bug without me noticing.
---
I just hotkey dog food and water
---
I am not sure but I just got the ghillie suit. I'm only doing maybe four dailies and a couple weekly ones. I don't really have much more time than that. I don't really want any of the stuff I saw but I didn't check out everything. The game crashes if I linger on the legendary run board for too long.
---
Saying people shouldnt abuse the bugs, people exploit weakness in whatever they do. Same as a kid who cheats on a test.
---
lvl 6 now, and that's by accident. can only manage a couple of hours every other day or so, so no real pressure..
---
Do every event that pops up with an exclamation mark in the middle
---
Exact same fucking boat. Was playing daily, almost level 21, and this just completely killed it for me. Happened to me an hour ago, missing 4500.
---
Hasn't charged me caps to fast travel to one. Just did it today (owned the airport one by Charleston), used it to get to the Ash Heap for cheap. No caps used.
---
Maybe a random bug?
---
omfg that's great, would you mind if I used this in a video or two? I have some other ideas planned haha
---
Yes! I accidentally one shot a legendary instead of gun bashing during an event and felt so shitty. I wish for a sorry emote daily.
---
No one really know it seems like. Today I did absolutely nothing. Got home from work and hopped on, boom, 2 weekly's and 5 dailies were completed while awarding no score because I remember from the day before being on the metal armor level. Some people say using the atom shop before login causes it, some say playing NW before logging in does, some say being on at reset does it. Well, i didnt do any of these and it happened.
---
Ok so glad I don’t have to talk to this dolt ever again. Fuck Ward.
---
I know I know but besides just doing that is there anything else?
---
Good soil, plenty of water and sunlight. Stay ahead of the weeds, don’t be an afternoon farmer
---
Don't care. Just want to be a train car hobo.
---
anything in my hands when my AP is depleted.
---
Pretty much how I thought it should have been. I only say to switch it and make PvP the toggleable option because of how many more players are PvE only. I think a lot of the issues people have with PvP are a complete lack of understanding of the mechanics. When a player gets wrecked and they have no idea why it seems to sour them from PvP and make them think it's all toxic. Making pacifist the default means less players will get sucked into PvP without understanding how or why.
---
Where did I say that people should exploit bugs?  You’re making no sense at all.
---
Did you mean I said people *should nor* exploit the bugs?  You think that’s equivalent to saying Bethesda isn’t responsible for the bugs?
---
LOL
---
No.  That’s absurd. 
---
Bethesda has a responsibility to fix the bugs in this game. That’s the same as a homeowner having a responsibility to fix a gap in a broken fence. 
---
That doesn’t mean the player has the right to exploit the bugs, just like a random passerby doesn’t have the right to trespass on the homeowner’s property, just because there is a gap in the fence.
---
In other words: two wrongs don’t make a right. 
---
That statement (that I made a while ago) specifically means that **BOTH SIDES** did wrong.  
---
Now explain how saying that both sides did wrong is in anyway defending the actions of either side.
---
Nope. That's the only way to get them
---
What do you mean infinite vital equipment
---
I've always said the pve community is more toxic than the PVP community too, I believe it to be true. Because of their voices and the reddit platform it feels as if they're  dictating how our playstyle should be nerfed but they want twice the camp budget to display their Mr fuzzy museums (causes lag) it's a wasteland and needs to be people that are a real threat. The other thing is how they scream nerf this nerf that like sentinel assassin for example even though they have no idea how to be set up for PVP to tank damage and deal damage so they just want everything to be nerfed so they don't have to aquire the gear or test things to be effective.
---
Speaking of keys, does anyone know where the **** you find the key for that room over the House of Scares/Fears??
---
There is no farming. You can claim 200 bullion a day from one of the machines in either foundation or crater by turning in 20 treasury notes.
---
Once per week you can also buy 300 bullion for 6k caps from the gentleman wearing an American flag shirt on the second floor of the wayward. He resets on Sundays I believe.
---
There is only the grind, unfortunately.
---
New one to me, weird
---
I agree with your, "Eek!" 
---
Start game over or just the quest? (And I thank you for your help. FO76  consistently proves to have one of the best player communities.)
---
Same, logged in with 4/4 on daily and weekly.  Thought it was a bug, logged out then back in and it went to 4/7 and 4/8.  Lost 4.5k score this week already...
---
Every time I switch servers it pops up, I have no idea why it says it’s removed the item but I don’t have that item, I’m not complaining though it’s nice free xp
---
You understand where I'm coming from, nailed it, they don't want to understand that there's a learning curve they only want to win which is why most of them only fight super mutants ect. If you wanna get better at PVP sometimes you gotta get beat up
---
Sorry that was a typo I meant shouldnt*
---
Not a perk issue (I think) but;
---
For some reason, Super Mutants seem to do *a lot* more damage since the last patch. It's not just one mutant dealing a lot more than normal like what used to happen. It's every single one.
---
V.A.T.S is really broken. Bethesda will not believe anyone unless they have video proof and we all submit a support ticket with the broken support ticket system. And then maybe they will investigate it.
---
I have to exercise a ton of self-restraint to not buy atoms 😂
---
Check the market subs
---
like 7 or 8 I can't remember exactly. Monster hunter is getting an update soon, So I'm sure I won't progress much for a while.
---
There are three good houses down there to choose from. One is open the other two boarded up. Despite being a little off the grid I still got decent amounts of shoppers if retailing is your thing.
---
I haven't had this issue but have seen a couple posts about it
---
Level 25
---
I don't think legacies need a nerf either if you're set up for PVP you can handle them
---
22
---
Well you need a doorframe wall. But then you can change that into a regular wall. Or a wall with a window. You just need it to be a doorframe first in order for it to work. Then just edit both walls into whatever looks, style, or material it is.
---
The quest.
---
20-22 should be the average for players who have been participating since day 1 assuming they didnt run into the daily reset glitch. Anything above and they've most likely been hard grinding the game for exp. 
---
Don't worry about the people who are already around 25 or close to 30 that takes a lot of time and effort.
---
Id still report him for abusive language.
---
Would love this. I actually enjoy cooking and brewing in-game but can only sell crafted alcohol since it doesn’t spoil.
---
IDK, when do you bury your bodies? haha
---
Thanks for the update, will move some points into maxing Gun Fu. Unless that is broken as well.
---
You should make some friends in-game, it's easy to meet people now with public teams
---
So you are claiming I said people shouldn’t exploit the bugs, and that somehow is the same as absolving Bethesda from responsibility for the bugs. 
---
No.  That’s an absurd and illogical conclusion. 
---
Bethesda has a responsibility to fix the bugs in this game. That’s the same as a homeowner having a responsibility to fix a gap in a broken fence.
---
In other words: two wrongs don’t make a right.
---
That statement (that I made a while ago) specifically means that BOTH SIDES did wrong.
---
25, but I’m furloughed as a movie theatre employee. Plenty of time to do the repeatable weekly.
---
Commie whacker
---
Damn lucky do you keep the treasury notes?
---
Lol. I think this might be the worst one. (As in, best answer, worst weapon)
---
Protest sign
---
Do you have the park that allows you to hack robots equipped? I think that may be your problem, if that dont help then idk man.
---
I got two... on the same day
---
11 scrip 60 caps 3 treasury notes every time it’s awesome
---
Follow up... What about two shot. Is that automatically factored into the stats when examining the weapon?
---
Making me jealous its the easiest dailly for either faction aswell
---
You have to enter VATS and shoot / hit enemies in VATS to build up the Crit meter. When the meter is full you have to press the jump button while in VATS, whichever one that is for your platform, then shoot the enemy. This will deal a critical against them.
---
As a added tip, complete this challenge using a shotgun for your critical hit. When you fire, each "shot" or pellet counts as a crit hit so you'll finish the challenge quick instead of having to fill your crit meter before every crit hit.
---
There’s an abandoned swim club near Crater that seems like it would be fun. Never seen a camp there.
---
As of an hour ago I’m still traveling free between owned workshops (Xbox).
---
You can use the herbivore mutation with cranberry relish and get 20% bonus XP instead of 10%
---
It’s actually a fun mode if you play it...
---
Same. I love it. Promotes shopping.
---
I use the event to mine ores mostly. Don't care about getting tickets and mole miners.
---
Oof. That sucks. At least you get scrip for it, but still lame.
---
You could always mute them in the social tab. That's what I did to the guy who was playing some loud crap one night during Fasnacht.
---
Please ***DONT*** add more 'Styles' to Atom Shop, just add them to the fucking game and stop with the "micro"transaction bullshit.
---
It was before scrip
---
Seems to work as normal as of today.
---
Sending them a support request results in nothing, so honestly, not a big deal.
---
Also a nuclear explosion remote
---
hitting spacebar will make your next shot a crit after the meter is full
---
Spam the “critical” button when in vats lol
---
Sea of thieves has always been on gamepass. It didn’t revitalize that game. Content brought that game back from the dead.  FO 76 could learn something from them
---
I need this for the time i accidentally stole a guy's loot after he died (like 6 lead) and i felt bad so i gave it back along with a spare bobblehead.
---
Anyway then he killed me and took everything i had, like 400lbs overencumbered with a bunch of rare loot i was holding for my display cases, since i was at the end of a long scavenging trip.
---
😒
---
Anyway to do that with half walls?
---
Welcome to Appalachia, the community is why I keep coming back. A high level helped me early on and now I go out of my way to do the same. Seems like a lot of people keep paying it forward and it really cool to see and hear! Keep on grinding, before you know you may see a post about you helpin out the new player!
---
Any questions?
---
Well, I use a Xbox controller, what key would that be?
---
Oh no. Hopefully whatever caused that Bethesda fixes and give your your rightfully earned score back. Maybe if this gets enough then attention Bethesda might extend the upcoming double XP and score boosts...
---
I miss the “shops” we had in fallout 4 that you could assign settlers to. Would be nice to have stuff like that again- especially for camps where people make it like a little town
---
it is, however the caboose is sort of not the most common aesthetic for a train car diner. usually they would have had that streamlined look and usually would have been a passenger car, lots of red, yellow and chrome. not too dissimilar to the diners that have been in each bethesda FO. the rest of the bundle follows that aesthetic but not the caboose. 
---
i had seen it datamined weeks ago, and my first thought wasnt that it would be part of the slocums joes bundle. if it had been a red passenger car i probably would have. so i think that its pretty understandable why some people would scratch their heads a little.
---
There was a water/drinking fountain available in the atomic shop back when you could get the dirty sink. It will probably come back around at some point.
---
It’s triangle on PS4 so probably the Y button for Xbox
---
Not good enough. I want my score, or the atoms for my missed levels. Extending the double exp does nothing if the people unaffected also get the benefit, thats the cheap mans fix. They need to bite the bullet and make it right with the people who actually filed tickets and provided proof.
---
I’m really sick of all these people bitching about SCORE. Like you said, it’s week 2 of 10.
---
1000% agree. Without coffee the world would cease  to exist.
---
No, this weekend (7/9-7/13) is The Purveyor Sale (25% off)
---
7/23-7/27 is the High SCORE Weekend/Double Dailies.
---
Like Pete Hines' bicycle.
---
Everyone gets a ride.
---
...for a price.
---
Ahhhhh ok that makes sense then because i am a heavy gun pa build...I don’t use vats at all...guess I need to build a shot gun and or rifle to do that. I only have 3 days to get them all done as I am on a 10 day camping trip starting Friday morning..lol
---
I remember when I used to give a Shit what people thought about the things I liked... ah, to be young again!
---
Edit - Ghost rules.
---
Thank you! I appreciate it.
---
I know. That’s why I said I hope they return what was lost from your earned score. I only said the extension as a possibility and it seems like something Bethesda would do :/
---
***Killing in the Name*** *starts playing*
---
Im not hating on your idea, I honestly think they might do this. I just think they will do that and not offer anything extra to the people affected. Didn't mean to come off harshly if I did.
---
Most likely the game and servers
---
I'd never seen Wren leave the comms centre until after the patch...
---
Not tested for time but i think its about 3 seconds max to fill up for me , not sure though, using max lvl LW , AB + 3pcs ap armor

---
Exactly, i saw in in bungos discord with all of the other stuff pulled from the PTS. it doesn't really jive with that highly stylized late 40's/50's look that the rest of the slocums joes and red rocket bundle. its just sort of plain and feels like it is more aimed at being a home rather than a diner. There is also a scaled down firewatch tower too, i wonder what theme it will be used for.
---
I guess we'll have to see if people can make some good builds out of it. personally i would only want to train car and i dont need any scrotums joes stuff in my camp lol.
---
Did the clock hit midnight?
---
Look at Mr. Camp Budget over here with all his extra camp budget to flaunt in our poor faces.
---
With the new teams I've found most people are insanely stupid.
---
I've failed campfire tales 5 times so far, even though 8 high levels are at it.
---
Nobody will help keep fire lit just sit on the roof sniping
---
Do you play in a team? This problem predates Wastelanders, I got told to equip Gun Fu when playing on a team which stops you dropping out of VATS before the target is dead.
---
Yeah its the Y button on xbox
---
Just unlocked the star wallpaper,  whatever rank that is
---
Don't worry, bethesda will auto complete it for you.
---
*Triggered.*
---
Is there anything wrong with medic rocket launcher?
---
Best bet:  shotguns. Get close and when your critical is ready, hit ‘Y’ and fire. All eight pellets can count as a critical hit. So four crits can get you the 25 you need.
---
Me in Nuclear Winter.
---
Its the one the gangsters girlfriend wore in FO4, though I have only seen it a couple times.
---
Which makes me think it isn't really a bug that Halloween and Christmas rewards are back right now.  I usually only do NW during double XP but I am doing it  now for Halloween rewards.
---
Happens to me about 3/4 of the time on public servers too.  The workshop icons just get replaced by "normal" blue fast travel icons.  If I go take the workshop I can fast travel to it though.  Just a visual bug.
---
Wait?! What?! Poodleskirt?!!!
---
I don't do that. I wait until my camp has loaded in fully before looking at the challenges.
---
Don't know why, it probably doesn't affect anything lol
---
For me. Yes.
---
lvl 20 here, effort almost zero, just playing the game as usually.
---
So the three daily missions for Ward, Wren/Rocksy &amp; Davenport. That’s 9 each day. 
---
The other 11 you can get from Public Events. 
---
That’s 200 per day. 
---
You can also go see Smiley at Waywards and buy up to 300 gold for 6k caps, once a week.
---
That’s 1700 per week.
---
Plain and simple the sickle any perks still useless even god roll
---
While Adrenaline is broken, you could replace it with gun-fu for more dmg per enemy killed in vats.
---
Alright, good to know and thanks!
---
oh I see..
---
and my reading comprehension is low today apparently
---
-Edited
---
I don't wanna be a dickhead but me and another rando took him down the other day. It is very do - able. You just need the right tools for the job like a bloodied 50 cal.
---
Why not wait for them to ask if you can hear them and emote "yes"? I usually ask if someone can hear me when I start talking.
---
canned coffee is excited
---
Not quite. The three dailies for Davenport/Crater/Foundation get you 3 Treasury notes each. And you can buy 300 gold a week from Smiley.
---
what kind of robot is he hammering
---
an acog spawns in the empty pool on the watoga high school roof
---
I'm having the same issue (Steam version).
---
I am but I'm good thanks, I'm a schematic junky so I like to try and unlock everything myself if I can
---
reporting someone
---
I made a cute coffee and donut themed vendor area. I wish they'd have included a stack of donuts or something as a prop
---
Other downsides are chunky ass walls, occasional flickering artefacts, and ugly seams if those walls don’t go all the way across. But it does work, after a fashion.
---
Yes!
---
Mines ps4
---
Too bad VATS in its current state is bugged.
---
I know wish this had happened before
---
Where I'm from they call it the tooth fairy, but she normally leaves you like a fiver and takes the tooth?
---
You’ll only find it from vendors. Came from the Treasure Hunter special event.
---
I bought fo76 used on Amazon for $7.59. I discourage anyone from directly giving Bethesda their money.
---
when you make/build something it uses junk. Something used them.
---
This was bad in the early days as it used to scrap your mods.
---
There are wendigo dentists that need them to make dentures.
---
It glitches out whenever I start it, none of the troughs accept the food I or my team put into it! It's a shame as I really want the bear arms mod plans, and a project-P recipe for my heavy gunner!
---
Huh?
---
Nevermind, someone will get it.
---
Check the market sub. They sell ‘em.
---
It's either the Wasteland Tooth Fairy...she is persistent. Or they didn't flag them properly and they are auto scrapping when you craft or repair something. Or it's a bug. Or all three...it is Bethesda.
---
Naw, you can only accidentally script weapons for more script than what you can carry and get shorted. It’s the way.
---
I think Bethesda stated that the next patch will focus on the bugs and QOL issues.
---
Thanks, your tip worked like a charm.
---
I get it since I had a childhood
---
That already exists
---
I feel your pain. I've never gone looking for that thing but I've come across it 3 times while farming flux. It seems everytime I encounter it I'm always low on ammo and I have to beg for help. The last time I used every single round of random ammo I had with junk weapons I just happened to have on hand. Ended up finishing the fight with a machete. worst part is that after all the trouble I've only gotten garbage legendaries.
---
Is it a thing in america too?
---
No Fallout 1st, no stash space!
---
Yeah. I offer free fashnacht donuts but only give out one a day cause I don’t feel like server hopping to find a ton of frogs and Brahmin willing to let me milk them. I’m much more generous with the free beer I offer.
---
Yeah lol
---
haha thats my question
---
What are the market subs? I don't see any in the sidebar/info on this sub.
---
What really?
---
Thanks! I'm happy you liked it :)
---
I rolled a Stalkers +33% V.A.T.S one yesterday. It mops up trash mobs with headshots from miles away and I have great fun doing it as well.
---
Yeah, the lets nuke emote
---
You arn't, your character will just be greyed out and won't do anything to stop pvp!
---
ya but you wont get the points
---
Wow level 140 what a noob. My 5th alt is higher than that
---
Thanks! I don't mind!  
---
just drop me a message so i can watch your videos!
---
Fairly certain the are adding an 'I'm so sorry' emote this summer
---
It's one of the team-up emotes
---
The preset settings are horrendous, it seems like they were made by somebody who has never played a game before. Sadly you're stuck with the extremely limited graphics settings on consoles, but on pc changing the .ini files is an absolute must. The god rays/bloom are just obnoxious, especially in the forest and mire. Depth of field gave me a headache so I couldn't play the game for more than an hour or two at a time before I turned it off. Idk what the max FOV is on console, I set mine to 100 and it's bearable for the most part
---
You do, the flux just gets deleted now, instead of dropping, all the other junk still drops!
---
Not a bad idea.
---
Scrip. Scrip. Scrip. 
---
You can blame autocorrect, but we've all been playing long enough to know the correct word by now.
---
I agree. When my strange in numbers does proc I switch teams - I like my super high jump and super slow fall lol
---
I guffawed!
---
Yeah its annoying. People can just avoid you and gang up on someone without hitting you back. That or if you dont get the option to seek revenge and spawn white, you have to start initiation again. Its just unnecessary for those of us that like team pvp.
---
reminds me of when I found him trapped in his fucking bunk
---
I loved it. I traveled to every vendor on the map. I found some really cool looking camps. Some people put a lot of effort into their camp.
---
13. I don't care too much for it tbh
---
Sarcasm.
---
Unfortunately half walls, and corner walls you can’t. I tried to find a way. But it won’t do a double.
---
Honestly, the Fat Man is pretty underwhelming
---
That's so funny! Guess they needed it really bad
---
Honestly, all four new guns are worth the grind.
---
I got a bloodied on my first roll, can’t say I’m super impressed but I need to buy mods for it so maybe that’ll help
---
That’s why I use barn. It’s simple wooden walls. That don’t glitch or go through each other. And it has a smooth edge. Concrete is horrible to use as a double wall. And it glitches through the roof.
---
Is there a point to grinding that high, as wouldnt the real goal be the 50k level limit
---
The fix for what they wanted should have been to make pacifist mode absolute and leave regular teams alone. Make pacifist more effective by not allowing pacifist players to even pick player locks, contest or claim workshops, and not go red while on a team. Public teams i totally understand the change, but why'd they mess with private teams?
---
It’d be cool if they made a Display Plate where you could display cooked food items. Maybe have it so the items won’t spoil, max of 3 plates. Then you could have table settings with real food, like fasnacht donuts for your idea!
---
THAT IS SO COOL
---
it’s the meatball from aqua teen hunger force small easter egg
---
A sexy one?
---
I think the Dense Torso Mod is working (inconsistently) the same as Fireproof. I do AWOL every time I can and most of the time an exploding legendary does a tiny amount of damage, but every now and again I lose a big chunk of health.
---
I do end up doing that, but a general "can't talk/no mic" would be nice for the people who don't ask (and also if you don't feel like voice chatting).
---
Nah no increase for leveling up.
---
I'm pretty sure there is still that camp budget bug where they made foundations cost to much budget. So hopefully that will get fixed in the next patch, I thought it would have been fixed in patch 20.
---
When you in PA no other armor can be worn, including underarmor. When you equip regular armor and underarmor, and hope into a PA set, the PA set takes priority. However, if you exit said PA, then the armor you were wearing before you hopped in should be reequiped.
---
It does not exist. Rub Todd's crystal ball to find the answer to your second question.
---
It still counts as 8 crits if they all hit. Finished in one run of West Tech which was nice
---
they might ban or suspend a few people who glitch to 100 on day 1, but thats it. I wouldn't worry about what someone else does. you worry about you, what gltichers do isnt your problem, if they want to risk the ban, thats their problem, not anyone elses.
---
hard to give a fuck though, when people are losing 1000s of score due to the auto complete bug that they *said* was fixed, or the god mode glitch they *said* was fixed.
---
if you actual read the EULA, you will find that they can pretty much terminate your service for any reason they want, and i really do mean ANY reason they can come up with.
---
Sure blame the robots... classic Canadian
---
Why You No Muh Bone Saw ( ͠° ͟ʖ ͡°)
---
Some people don’t play bloodied builds.
---
No I'm xbox thanks for the offer though
---
No... They should make it the way I like it, not the way you like it.
---
All serum?
---
Harder. The christmas one especially takes a long time.
---
I’ve also heard the excuse that it’s due to Box Car style Diners, but realistically I think everyone is missing the simplest theory that they just wanted a bundle to throw it in so you’d have to buy the bundle and that was the closest match for them. Bethesda really aren’t the brightest bulbs in the case, but you can bet they have a very high cost efficiency
---
18
---
I saw that, I'm offering to a pc user that may happen on this
---
I know but even if you don't it's still gonna be a damn good option.
---
Oh ok sorry
---
The ones I have learned. I've got marsupial if you want it for 350 and I'll pull all my serums to let you buy any others you may want
---
No worries at all. If I coulda helped you I would 👍
---
I currently have 8. They are precious to me
---
I already bought marsupial sadly and I'm now on caps but I'll buy if I accidentally take off starched genes
---
I run Action boy/girl , Fireproof, Adrenaline, Serendipity, Sneak. Sneak is a buggy mess but mainly due to hits showing damage, but no damage actually applied  and blowing stealth in the process.  Most of my deaths are getting mobbed after stealth is broken and the game just becomes an unresponsive mess where you cannot do anything but just wait to die. Serendipity usually kicks in on respawn adding insult to a buggy death.
---
PM me on here or xbox if you need it. GT DaRapuano
---
1)  I am almost certain that Bethesda Support are not actually in the US.
---
2)  I am also working from home. While I will be the first to admit there are some limitations and it is far from ideal, it is more than manageable for most industries that don't require in-person engagement assuming there is appropriate ICT infrastructure to support/enable it. I don't see how that is in a meaningful barrier to responding to a support ticket, especially considering the nature of the type of company Bethesda is (i.e. IT-related).
---
3)  "My video game is not a priority" ? As I said in reply to a previous comment, I have been waiting since 3 May 2020 - that is over TWO MONTHS ago.  Don't patronise me by telling me to have some compassion and patience - that is not appropriate or fair.
---
I don't think it is unreasonable for me to consider this kind of timeframe too long, even taking into consideration the global pandemic.
---
Ok thanks
---
No worries
---
I’m definitely stopping after skele. Was more asking if getting to the skeleton was easier or harder!
---
paddle ball
---
Something you can try: use the medium preset and change the individual settings up as desired. There are several settings that get changed under the hood by doing this.
---
  
---
The only other things I would suggest involve modifying ini files. While doing so gives you a lot more options, many people are either uncomfortable with doing so or simply don't want to mess with ini files.
---
It’s part of public team I believe. If you play solo it should work normal.
---
Assuming you were part of a team, that is.
---
Ts laser with beamspiltter is also good
---
21; have done all weeklys, nearly every daily... skipped a couple of NW ones. 
---
Haven’t been on enough to really grind xP, but have used INT buffs and the stew buff as much as possible when playing.
---
Might have to quit and start the quest over. The game doesn’t save until you are completely through it.
---
You had me at dancing robots.
---
It should be in your armor inventory, not junk. You can’t scrap PA just by hitting the “scrap all junk” button. 
---
Though I find naming my PA an easy way to identify my good PA.
---
ahhh..... pull the trigger and point it an any something?
---
heavy gunner perks, stabilized,  bloody mess, nerd rage, adrenal reaction. prime it if you can afford it. 
---
i have a B25, and im pretty sure its the highest ranged DPS in the game.
---
You absolutely do not drop anything if you die with either of those quests active. I've died numerous times in both since the last update to the game and lost absolutely nothing. The moment the quest completes is when you can lose your junk.
---
Yeah I came here to say this
---
How do I start the quest over?
---
"technical limitations"
---
Which is what it looks like it is doing, but if you have cores, is running with no under armor normal? Like at higher levels do people even bother having more than the outfits on?
---
I believe you man. I’ve seen people drop the Queen in like 5 minutes. I know it’s supposed to be end game hard. Which is great. I have decent Gear. Just not a nukadragons sped’d build. Just wish you got REAL loot for the trouble.
---
And that is the moment he said he strikes!
---
What words did I put into your mouth, because I read you original comment very thoroughly? By saying that people just want to “write it off and give everyone the rewards” you are saying that the complaints that OP raises are invalid and you are diminishing the fact that players are having real issues. Had you gone into detail about why players should just log in to their challenges already complete You may have had an effective argument, but instead you just left it at a cheap insult.
---
And there’s no virtue signaling here, just me telling you that you have may not completely understand the issues being discussed. And I don’t think you actually understand the concept of a strawman argument. This entire discussion is about players losing SCORE because of bugged weekly and daily quests that auto complete and how Bethesda should handle the situation. Me asking you if you have personally been affected by this glitch after you insult OP for starting a conversation about how to fix it is directly in line with the conversation in this post.
---
Thanks!
---
FISTO
---
Exit to the main menu
---
This comment made me ugly laugh on my break. Thank you for confusing my coworkers. Ha ha
---
I should of mentioned I was mass scrapping armor, which was when I must of scrapped it.
---
although that would be cool and more aesthetically pleasing, it definitely would be OP when compared to the regular vendors unless this one would cost 4 times as much camp budget.
---
Even if that were the case I would still use it over 4 regular ones lol.
---
Not a problem.
---
Thought I could catch it and put the response in the right spot.
---
Fashionable Raider Outfit and Slug Buster
---
Broadsider
---
It’s only for dailies FYI
---
When I was a PA user, I only wore outfits under it. Because it’s no point to ever exit your pa as a pa user and you don’t want the weight of the armor in your inventory weighing you down.
---
Hahah i guess so. I saw a player selling nothing but overpriced TP and thought it was quite clever so i followed suit with 1 little roll
---
For a system that is both rigged and severely bugged, that's a pretty harsh punishment
---
Oooh its atom shop
---
This made me laugh. You’re totally right. IRL, I’m a bit of a grammarsnob, so this was a lesson for me. I didn’t even notice the typo, though I am aware of the correct spelling from the game.
---
Could have used it yesterday after a SBQ when I accidentally caught a player in the crossfire while I was trying to shoot a Fog Crawler that was attacking him. I holstered my gun as soon as I realised but apparently he still needed to kill me in my tent. Oh well
---
When games put out updates the mod creater has to also update the mod. If the mod hasn't been updated it won't work.
---
Single Action Revolver
---
Bloodied Broadsider:
---
Listed damage = 10000
---
Actual damage = 1
---
I know the loot is diabolical, if you weigh it up it's not even worth fighting SBQ or WC. But that small chance of landing something epic will always get me. Anyway good luck in your adventures man. Have fun.
---
Nope. Just accept you won’t get everything.
---
Seriously- I hate when the recipes have such obscure hard to find ingredients.
---
There is a pot hole in that area, put the FO1 tent over it so the left corner covers it barley. Still a little iffy but seems to work 9/10 for me
---
Lvl 24. Don't do the NW Dailies or Weeklies. Spend about 30 minutes a day to complete the Dailies and another 2 to 3 hours doing whatever I want that day.
---
That’s the problem. You gotta slow down when you are doing that
---
Yup, that’s a derp moment. Rename your good stuff and favorite it. Then you’ll at least have to go through the “are you sure you want to scrap your favorited item?” dialogue.
---
That would be awesome but they would never do it because they use FOMO to manipulate you.
---
I can definitely relate to that. I think I've spent about a thousand screws and springs crafting Radium Rifles trying to get all the mods for it. I still don't have the reflex sight, but every time I throw on Super Duper and enter the crafting menu I see how many materials it requires and I'm just like, "christ is it really worth it?" Those things are so fucking expensive. And then when I finally cave in and craft a few, Super Duper only activates once if at all, and none of them unlock anything. My inner completionist needs that damn reflex sight, though.
---
Yea we know this is a fake karma farm. Drop the GT or it didnt happen bub.
---
I'm wonder that too couse since the patch I'm taking more damage and using more ap, test it the action boy and to me I saw a huge difference without it, the lone wonder I did not test it
---
Or emote In the open
---
I have a Bloodied with a few mods and I wouldn't say it's top tier DPS-wise. It does hit like a truck but it fires slow and has wonky accuracy sometimes. It's best used imo with Concentrated Fire and V.A.T.S perks. Failing that, just use it for fun/trash mobs.
---
I like wearing just plain T-51 (Hardened Powered Armour) while using it and pretending I'm playing a remaster of Fallout 1
---
If only
---
I don’t care for it either but this ones not bad. Today’s daily can be done in about 30 seconds so there’s one. I also completed place a camp 10 times from the challenges and that counted, so if you never play just see what the easy challenges are and you’ll be done fast.
---
I don’t bother with class freak, but run marsupial and the one that gives you energy resistance for less energy damage (I don’t use energy guns).
---
I think there is a health regen one I wanted to look at, but not sure if it’s worth it in high damage situations.
---
I just ran across him with a team on ps4 also. Muh  .50 caliber ammo :(
---
I'm on PS4 and I have this problem sometimes. It's the servers because I know it's not my internet.
---
This is actually false the drill is the best weapon in the game
---
Yeah, it’s frustrating but I guess I know now.
---
It’s a good bug.
---
Name your power armor and equipment. Also putting skins on them can help.
---
I saw some wrecked trains with a non combat random encounter. I took it and I’m gonna make a scabber base
---
Not complaining :D
---
My main character cooks SO SLOWLY, but my alt/mules cook super fast. Maybe it’s related to how many recipes I have learned on my main character.
---
Yeah I haven't seen to much about it anywhere
---
The bundle even comes with a train car!
---
Oh well, I've lost 6750 score points because of the stupid auto complete bug
---
Yes, when they don't do seasons anymore.
---
Outstanding!
---
Maybe I’ll mark it on my map as my lvl 190-220 house or smthn
---
I bought that maybe last summer ? It’s been a good long while now since it’s been in the atom store.
---
Build two doorways back to back and then replace with solid walls
---
Shit man, from how you talk I want to grief you now.
---
I intentionally bought 69 rounds of 10mm from someone’s camp the other day (because, you know, I’m a fucking child), and the camp owner comes running around the corner to where I’m at and hits me with the thumbs up, and runs back to whatever they were doing. Point is, I have fun with it.
---
Besides an assaultron, this is the only acceptable answer. Well, maybe a B1 series, too...
---
The .... what?
---
So I tried this today, unloaded all possible notes and holotapes from self and stash, to an alt, seems like the same pause especially cooking. Any other ideas?
---
If by corner walls you mean the slanted walls for roofs, you can double them up but they are really iffy about it. You'll have to remove any roof pieces they're connected to, and you'll have to put them back in a very specific order. It's a lot of trial and error but it is possible. Half walls however, I'm pretty sure there isn't any way to do those. Though, now that I'm thinking about it, maybe the flame trap trick would work?
---
i don't think it works that way.  i solved it by using a barn wall so the "outer" side wasn't gnarly.
---
I’ve seen posts saying all the dailies and weekly challenges must be completed, others say not necessarily. I know they have a double score weekend coming up and a double XP, so that should help anyone catch up. I’ve missed a few dailies and I’m level 18 or 19. I’ve been lucky to play every day so far but that’s not going to last, I plan on grinding out those double point weekends though.
---
Not to sound like an ass while probably sounding like an ass 
---
But if you know about the bug and you know the reset time... why don’t you just log off for a bit and log back on? Wouldn’t that at least fix your problem till Bethesda fixes it in 2 years
---
No need for turrets. You can have a large, nicely decorated camp. It's all about budget management and learning how much each item takes up. Turrets and other large objects eat up a ton. Display cases and lights eat up a lot.
---
People have wrote up guides on each items cost but when you get at max budget just start experimenting. Do you need three chairs or will one couch do?
---
Here's one of my camps.
---
https://youtu.be/BWP0hklQyeA
---
I’ve played it. It’s derivative. I’m not interested in Burger King, Pepsi, or NW.
---
Saw this a lot during the Faschnacht event. I was fairly low-level, especially compared to everyone else there. I only tried it three times, since I got frustrated that in 2/3 tries I couldn't even hit an enemy because the level 100+ were oneshotting them.
---
I’d be supportive of just mods for private servers
---
Having yet to experience this problem i can only offer what i’ve been doing. Stay away from the reset by 3hours on either side of it
---
What are you on, pc?
---
It take 30-60 minutes a day to complete the dailies and you're burned out? Are you sure you just don't like the game?
---
Every bobblehead and magazine in those displays is eating up budget.
---
No, you burned yourself out of the game.
---
Hard to tell from that pic, but I think it is the new fallout 1st outfit.
---
For the record this really happened. Second keep the jokes coming, y’all. Keep em coming.
---
Who cares abt them. You dont need trivial bs like this when much worse things are happening in game rn
---
if the system was more weekly skewed than being evenly split between daily and weekly, and if the ranks were fewer with less garbage filler, i'd be more on board.  
---
also the challenges ought to work correctly lol.
---
I had this issue today on pc
---
It's supposed to be a high tech replacement for the Gattling Gun I believe. Not a queen fighter.
---
This is so often requested that I don't see it happening if it hasn't happened by now.  Besides, I heard the developers have been working from home now for a while now.  Both of them.
---
A flyboy salute is the proper way to go.
---
yes, it works with contemporary walls. I just used it for several interior walls.
---
Just made 20 today. I have logged in just long enough to do each daily and the weeklies last week and today's dailies.
---
I've been considering finally taking the plunge on 1st ever since this was datamined a month or two ago. I have two questions, though: can it be worn without the mask, and is it a limited time offer? I'm not in any rush to buy 1st and I'd rather wait until there's something in the Atom Shop I'd be interested in spending the 1600 atoms on, but if it can only be claimed for the next week or two I'll just go ahead and buy in.
---
Edit: I should've watched the video before replying, it basically answered both of my questions.
---
I busted out all of them before I got onto NW to prevent any snags happening. So far it worked
---
My favorite place down there has a wood resource and two NPCs hanging out and a spawn for Nuka Cranberry. It’s a good spot. Look for the windmill and greenhouse. Nuka is in the greenhouse.
---
I too know this, cause there's a diner near me that's made from an actual train car
---
Still, it's pretty funny without context. It's a bundle with a whole bunch of Fallout Dunkin Donuts-themed items...and then there's some random seemingly-out-of-a-place Train Car
---
“ d a m a g e d “ please
---
Praise be to RNG
---
Very nice! These CAMP how-to-build vids are content that I personally never tire of. Nice channel BTW. Good luck with it!
---
The old music was more relaxing.
---
since update 20 dropped, on ps4 i've been able to barely get more than 20 mins before a crash.  today, for some unfathomable reason, not only did i get signed in on my first try, and only after a minute or so, but the atom shop and season board loaded in a few mins rather than needing several log in attempts before loading.
---
but past that and even more shocking, the game didn't crash at all for as long as i played (1.5 hrs\~)  also, all the daily challenges worked correctly and gave me the score they were supposed to.
---
Yes it can be worn without the mask. And it will be available for the next 20-some days or so. After that you probably won’t be able to get it
---
Thanks bro it worked
---
41 not doing the NW quest but I’ve done that repeatable quest loooooots of times to make up for the lost score
---
If we get an "I'm Sorry" emote, I will be tempted to make a Todd Howard character that just goes around spamming this to random players when they encounter bugs.
---
I know what you mean but yeah the mask and outfit are 2 separate pieces and it's only available for the next 27 days. Or so it says on the atomic shop.
---
i feel like mutations ought to be mandatory due to you know.... irradiated wasteland lol.
---
been running the run of them since level 40ish just for the flavor.
---
You may have mistunderstood the question...
---
That is dumb as hell and I will definitely be using that. Thank you.
---
It’d bug out and crash the server
---
You meant the specific NW one? Yeah I noticed that.
---
Same way as adventure. Pipboy then camp button, luckily you can spam it for no cap cost
---
there's the Order of Mysteries face covering!
---
Same button combo as in adventure.
---
yea, I find pacifist mode a necessity just for that reason. I like to use tesla rifles and other aoe guns
---
Can you wear it without the mask?
---
Oh you want tattoos? We'll give you tattoos but the only available pavement is going to be on the forehead
---
This happened to me today and it’s unfortunately been a major issue since launch. Started up the event, me and this other random were doing fine. 3 lvl 100s or so come in and 1 shot the supervisor each time. I get it, we all have OP weapons but I intentionally use something under powered or use a Tesla to tag so others get a hit.
---
So you also did today's NW challenge and had your weekly NW challenge auto-complete too?
---
I’m sorry but no. I’d rather have bug fixes.
---
Where do you get the contemporary walls plan?
---
Don’t think I’ve ever seen it on a vendor NPC nor player . . .
---
Mine is getting bugged again because it hit max caps never found anything to buy and had so so so many plans.
---
Think you replied to the wrong post.
---
I feel your pain brother.
---
Capt are you on ps4? I'd like to link up some time and share some building tips. I have extensive knowledge of the game but zero knowledge making videos or tutorials.
---
Healing Factor? Yeah without Class Freak it's one to avoid. -55% Chem Effects, affects stuff like Stimpaks and Buffout. It does heal a ton out of combat and an okay amount in-combat but for me is not worth it.
---
I do run a ton of other mutations though, Marsupial is one I think everyone needs and with Public Teams, Herd Mentality is basically a free +3 to all special stats.
---
I got a bounty by accident, guy approached me, obviously for the bounty, I holstered, they shot me, I'd forgotten about it until just now.
---
I just checked and it isn’t the outfit
---
Here’s the link to the trailer you can get better view of the outfit it starts at 1:30 https://youtu.be/RZuudnyjCA8
---
It’s the cave diver outfit. Heard it could be atom shop or we do go colossus event drop.
---
Sweet! I'll take a Child of Atom hydrogen symbol, a third eye, an 'X', and a gem tattoo.
---
Yes. Strangely enough but I WAS awarded the SCORE
---
Escape Artist never seems to work for me at all, and I've had similar experiences as you with sneak, especially around ghouls.
---
Yeah, I’ve been fighting this since Patch 20 dropped. Today I finally said “F-this!” and rebuilt my camp from scratch.
---
I laughed way too loud at this.
---
FINALLY, someone with a bug that can help.
---
You could make a blueprint
---
I feel completely opposite. Now I get rewarded more for my time and energy.
---
Not a perk, but my Furious Handmade does not proc correctly at all - making it pretty much useless.  Tested the other day by standing a couple feet away from a Sheepsquatch and pouring 2 mags into it for sure not ever missing a shot.  
---
Also, Escape Artist never seems to work for me.
---
I hate NW, not happy about this at all. I bought this game to play a Fallout game not a shitty Fortnight battle royal mod. I really wish they'd quit locking Adventure mode rewards progression behind NW. I don't care how easy they are, I don't like spending a min in that game mode. I apologise to those legit players of NW for when I yet again forget to turn the auto grouping off (do it every time) when I jump on to selfishly complete my challenges and handicap your team.
---
I already have first! :)
---
Has there been an acknowledgement that the VATS accuracy/hit bug is being investigated?  Today I was point blank and shot through my target 5 times in VATS
---
True, but I mean more for situations where your camp can’t be placed. Instead of world hopping you could just load into Camp #2 or #3 which could be elsewhere on the map.
---
Yep that is definite not it. I have no idea. I like the helmet though.
---
I have attempted to resolve this with Bethesda, same bug. They said it’s a known issue and they will try to fix it.
---
I’ve found him in crater before, on like day 1 of wastelanders 😐
---
Just aim at them and it'll tell you if they're legendary or not.
---
I've done it too and it sucks. As others have suggested rename it and maybe even put a skin on it. I named mine 111 so it appears at the top of the list.
---
Oh I see, ya that would be nice
---
 No,  I do enjoy the game.  What I don't like is the grind, the score glitching out and auto completing or not even giving me the points, and feeling like I can only play one game.
---
*Ward can run but he cannot hide*
---
I primarily run this event on my private server, running solo. Run it many, many times and always had three legendary spawns.
---
Just make sure you drink clean water first, as you might contract parasites while pumping water.
---
Be quiet.....they are listening!.....well sometimes.
---
Using 111 to put it at the top of the list is a good idea, I think I’ll do that from now on.
---
Games were not always like this. If this is the future of gaming, it's not a good one.
---
Wait til the very end.  Each level is 25 pts more so towards the end you won’t even be getting a level a day.
---
Oh now that explains it! I thought I saw two people with the cosmos uniform on one today and one yesterday. I thought they spent a ton of atoms just to buy all 100 levels. Rich Bastards. Anywho either way cheated or not. I'm working hard to get there. I just want the fireplace. Actually if I could just buy the nuka cola secret door that would be preferable. I have some atoms saved up now for it.
---
There is nothing in SCORE that's even a dot on a line to enhance actual gameplay.  
---
If you choose to participate, that's your decision.  I'll continue to ignore it and have fun playing the way I always have.
---
Its a shame that the pack doesn't add the structure pieces from fallout 4 that make an actual dinner, i'd kill to make a camp themed like that which isn't just a metal box on the outside.
---
And knowing is half the battle. Go Joe!
---
Funny thing, happend to me unintentional. Put down the camps, opened a chest, opened a door and got shot from behind, all in 30 seconds.
---
It’s funny too because the mechanic was in Skyrim AND fo4 yet they didn’t implement it into the scrip system? Pfft
---
Did the dailies and weekly in three hours, sitting at rank 26 rn.
---
I've got my eye on you. No offense.
---
You can't meet her unfortunately
---
Opening chests is not advised. It kills your initial stealth boy action.
---
If there are pink dots near my drop point I run for the hills.
---
We don't know the full story but we got a increase in score in one of the dailys so we may not need to buy anything.
---
CAN I PLEASE HAVE THE TOMMYGUN WOOD FOREGRIP BETHESDA
---
I mainly want that power armor skin that was front and center when you first turn the game on. The white bubbly one lol. I plan on buying lvls. And really got the most useful thing on here, amoo convertor
---
Send a ticket. AFAIK, Bethesda plan is to send you the "equivalent" amount of atoms to the potential levels you lost. So if say, that 4000 would have gotten you up 3 levels, they add 450 atoms so you can buy them when purchasable levels release
---
Would you explain where on the map this is?
---
Shit, I muted all chat day one. I do not care what random game strangers have to say.
---
What do you mean? They're hot fixing score output for one?
---
Thanks for showing that. Mine was about the same size but with the contemporary siding. I'm basically starting all over.
---
Cosmetics should be at the bottom of their list of concerns.  Actual gameplay mechanics like this should be at the top.  I would rather have a quantity slider for crafting like every other decent game in history than a giant scoreboard of goofy outfits.  
---
I'm not saying they're mutually exclusive, but there are so many core game components that should be improved, and this is just one of them.
---
Follow the road East from the Hornwright estate and it’ll be on your right Up the hill.
---
That's an underrated idea imo, I love the thought of having 'backup' camps
---
Ammo. Serum recipes. Gold bullion.
---
How are you 30? I'm 26 rn and I grinded all dailies and both weeklies and I'm not 30 LOL.
---
At least your honest
---
Yes
---
I don’t even have fo1st but I had a hoard amount of holotapes and notes in my inventory that didn’t weigh anything. Today I dropped everything I could and now I can use the favorites wheel in sbq fights again without it freezing. While looking through vendors my FPS went up to 60 instead of 14. Can’t believe I was living that way for the longest time. 
---
Now I want to drop all those keys I don’t use but we can’t.
---
I think they could very easily do both.
---
Healing factor is great. Not incredibly fast but overall it's very handy. Especially with starched Gene's.
---
 Building in fo4 was always my favorite thing so I wish it was more expansive in F76 than it is.
---
My biggest gripe is that F76 stifles creativity in camp building. Having to destroy the entire camp to try new ideas really hurts.
---
Wow thanks. I’ll check it out. If it won’t work my next guess is the tree next to the swim club
---
I know that feeling, I got anti armor, limb damage knuckles my second time fighting it. I don't anymore.
---
This will introduce a new dupe glitch and get emotes shut down for 6 weeks, like player vending.
---
I've had three sloths, all glitched away and never came back.  I had a mirelurk king that lasted for a long time until I replaced him with a sloth.  Should have stayed with him.  
---
Ever since wastelanders I've found tamable creatures super rare to come by.  I don't know... Maybe just a coincidence.
---
I found a plan that I didn't know I was missing: the fat-man plans for 350 caps!
---
I was happy to trade caps for score.
---
Amen! It's insane. I've always done it though. Skyrim got so bad after a couple of hundred hours that I couldn't travel between locations without a book handy for the loading times.
---
The brick set works pretty good. That's what I plan to make my Slocum's Joe shop out of. More options would be better though. It would be nice if they brought over the coffee and donuts from the FO4 Slocum's Joe though. At least I was able to get one kind of (Fasnacht) donut to sell, along with canned coffee. I wish there were more kinds of non-perishable prepared foods. I'll have to clear out some stash space and farm up pre-war snacks.
---
Meaning for the last week we've been knowing the exact score we get from challenges daily and it's always been the same score each time but this week one of those challenges got an increase in score so now we can't predictably tell if it's possible to get all the awards within 10 weeks because they seemingly can increase or decrease score for a challenges at a whim.
---
Do it and let us know, it's a small amount of gold anyways
---
So XP buffs DO buff SCORE, nice. Thanks for commenting.
---
Which four?
---
Been requested since BETA. What is the hold up Bethesda? That slocum joes sign they released today is so incredibly detailed, but they can’t make an Im sorry emote? C’MON!
---
32
---
Same as the other person. Level 25 space plaything. I only need 400 more to next level. I think I may jump 2 levels tomorrow. Well at least 1 and a half. Got to do those repeatables it's like leg day. Never wanna miss leg day.
---
the only problem to that is to farm that every day couse it spoil fast, I had farmed like 20 of each and forfeit about it
---
We can't have both?
---
Can I just say... it’s baffling how devs (Bethesda)  can be so lazy. It would’ve taken maybe 10 extra minutes to record a second opening line for the daily rep quests so you don’t keep hearing the same shit.
---
No not score I use the exp buff to do the repeatable weekly score quest for 10k exp! It gives 100 score for every completion I use all the exp buff to get that 10k faster
---
Unfortunately Bethesda listens to the cry babies. They should just bring back Survival mode and make it how the game was at launch. If they did that maybe there wouldn't be as many trap bases and griefers
---
so im level i think 43 or something like that, think ive done most of the main missions :) just looking at what people that have done that all spend their time doing!
---
:)
---
Why not both 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
They made the level up daily worth 500 instead of 250 so thats already 1,750 more for the week if you do it everyday
---
You can, with a trick. If you start with door frames you can place them back to back so the interior side is on both sides, then change them to walls and wallpaper them. It's a little, but not that annoying to do. It would be nicer if they just outright gave us a double sided interior wall though. One bonus to  this method is you can have different wallpaper on each side.
---
It's easy, you'll unlock the beanie shortly before the Skeleton. I got the beanie last night and thought 'oh shit, I better get that skeleton now just in case they patch this tomorrow!', got it the next game!
---
It can take awhile, just need patience and to get in the top 10 a lot(So basically turn into a bush or water wookie if your team goes down)
---
Long ponytail with bangs!!!
---
That's what I want! And a body tattoo would be kind of nice, I don't understand why we don't have them. but of course I don't understand why we don't have running water for a shower or bathtub.
---
Idk who you mentioned, but my Fuck Trump neon sign is still up.
---
Are you using XP buffs? Another guy said this so I want to double check that its not hax.
---
Source?
---
I'd prefer this to the level up one. I'm level 106 or so, and I can still reasonably crank out a level per session, I'm really uncertain how long that will last.
---
I deployed my CAMP then made a joint suicide pact with my buddy so we ran and leapt from the nearest cliff. We had auto fill off so we died in synchronicity...it was beautiful😁😂
---
Salvaged assaultron head
---
Lol... oh, cause mine was eerily similar.   ;)
---
We do need one! I'm always annoyed there's isn't an actual "sad/i'm sorry" emote, there are times where i feel the need to use it, like not being able to participate in an event in time or if i couldn't revive someone :(
---
Should you have a blast of fire lasting longer than 4 hours consult your local physician.
---
“I’m sorry”emote has been requested heavily since the BETA. Bugs need to be fixed anyway.
---
I want Adrenaline back first. No compromises.
---
I'm in week 82 of waiting for the poodle skirt to come back LOL
---
Yes true true true! I found it in the pink forest. Scared the crap out of me. I couldn't even scratch it. It got in the way of my farming nuked flora. Curse you Earl Williams! I now know your name! I'm telling on you. I know John Jingle Heimer Schmitz! He was number 1!
---
Damm i didn't know brb
---
Especially the 45 smg needs love and attention
---
Yes, yes, yes!!
---
Agreed
---
Yeah, games used to actually be hard.  You'd be crying to your doctor about your Mario PTSD if you had even the slightest idea.
---
The plasma caster, gauss shotgun, Minigun and pistol.
---
I do buy ammo from low levels but lows only. I have all the mutations I need and serums are for selling to robots only. Caps are cheap because of large handmade presents so I’m sitting on my good plans and recipes until the caps market equalizes.
---
 It is an atomic shop item, from the contemporary pack.
---
I closed the game with 1 minute before the reset and came back after 3 hours and everything was fine with my challenges. It sucks for the people that don’t access reddit or other message boards to get these tips. You shouldn’t even need to log off during reset but it is what it is... shitty
---
Take one for the team.
---
Because they are already in the game since Day 1.... go visits doctor offices/hospitals/asylum more often you will eventually find them. I sell them occasionally at my camp for 20 caps each.
---
Oh me too. Big black clock 69
---
I doubt it unless someone reported you. I've seen some players spell out less than savory things on walls and have bought from the same players camps days or weeks later with it still being there.
---
I was that way with the .50 cal, I scrabbled maybe 10 or 11 before I even got 1 mod. Currently trying to upgrade the gatling gun and I've supposedly unlocked multiple mods for it but none have shown up in the crafting menu. Is super duper worth it?
---
It’s a great spot. Best I have found so far.
---
some memer came through and bought all my funny named notes and holotapes for 420 caps each.
---
My sex bed gives me 3 hours lol
---
Bethesda can suck my big black clock... I don’t know why they let the Austin studios work on this, the Maryland studios would have done a *far* better job.
---
Thelma and Louise style. True heroes.
---
Exactly. I'm personally well ahead of schedule of score needed/ days available and I barely play 1-2 hours a day. I even missed a few days not playing. I don't comprehend how people are so butthurt they don't get unlimited time, taking away any achievement of the people who actually play the game and work towards the goals. Or acting like it's mandatory content and someone is forcing them to spend all day everyday playing the game..
---
The score system literally gave people something to do, which people were asking for, with FREE cosmetics, which people were asking for, with more perk card packs / gold cards, which people wanted, and people still find ways to complain or turn it into "Bethesda's So Greedy!"
---
And completely ignored the fact that my ~~main~~ only point was people are complaining about this while barely 1/10 of the way into the season. We haven't even had the first double score weekend yet, we haven't gotten an official response from bethesda yet, we haven't seen whether they intend to somehow even out the leveling curve through either a cap on the score requirements or an increase in score provided from challenges, we haven't seen whether people will be reimbursed lost score or if everybody will receive a bonus. And yet despite that people have already been whining like infants since day 2. I don't come here with the intent of insulting people, but if it honks like a clown, snaps its suspenders like a clown, and throws pies like a clown, I will call it what it is 🤡
---
Because I don't want to have to reply again, I'll just make it even clearer that I never said anything about autocompleted score not being an issue, that's something you put into my mouth in your frantic attempt to find something to further complain about with those paragraphs of yours. And yet you've forced me to do the same, so I guess double clown on me for taking the bait
---
You should be able to finish the board for free as long as you don't miss 2-3 weeks of dailys/weeklys.
---
25
---
Stalker's __________
---
KRUSTY KRAB IS UNFAIR
---
This is why I apply  atomic shop skins to everything I use if possible because it makes them impossible from accidently dropping them , scrapping them or selling them.
---
if you don't is use the *good with salt* perk you should definitely get the refrigerator mod for your backpack
---
I dont think pacifist helps much if Im the one that "attacked" first though.
---
That's what its supposed to do with the scatter barrel. It vaporizes the plasma turning it into a Plasma Thrower.
---
I was disappointed when I realized that it was not possible, it is supposed to be fertile land, why not plant a tree there?
---
Where are those damned counters in the menu?
---
Ghoul slayers radium rifle, not as bad as the gamma gun but STILL
---
It’s the same button combo as putting one down in adventure. And you are not old you are vintage.
---
21, still have a weekly to complete(Aside from leveling/NW). Would be 23 but my weeklies auto-complete glitched last week despite being 'fixed' :/
---
I'm reserving my energy for the double XP and Score weekends, don't want to go too crazy as if I'm worn out during those periods... well that'd be bad lol
---
nah I'm good, farm when I need it, it's a shame Beth will take out the food and water thing, they could just take the spoil thing of, would be better like others MMO
---
Captain Cosmos
---
I bet you get it but can’t spend it until you finish the quests.
---
I go back and forth on this. Adding more voice lines into a game is a lot more than just '10 extra minutes'. Not even taking into count the writing and programming it into the game time, every line recorded is going to go through several takes most of the time, and potentially re-recordings. All of that takes up studio time and resources, plus the voice actor and recording crew's pay... It can all add up to a tidy sum in both money and time for those few extra lines. Developing a game is a large part in deciding where to focus your resources.
---
On the other side of it, the daily quest givers are going to be some of the most frequently interacted with NPCs. So that's obviously where they should have put more focus and resources. I've spoken to Ward way more times than the Overseer or anyone else in Foundation. And because of that reason, no amount of additional lines recorded will be enough, we'll still hear it dozens and hundreds of times doing the daily quests.
---
Ultimately though, they should have done more daily quests in my opinion. Two at the Crater is at least better than just Ward and his pretty poor security that someone can walk off with vital equipment every day. Even Preston didn't have that much of a security problem...
---
Hold down V? 🙃
---
Quick math, assuming it's gonna be 25 more points for every level, shows that we need 223,750 total points for making level 100. So 22,375 each week. Currently, if you exclude the repeatable xp points, we can earn up to  2k per day and 7500 per week from dailies and weeklies, leaving us 875 points shy of what we need. Therefore, if you finish all the dailies and weeklies, and repeat the xp challenge at least 9 times in a week, you'll make it to the end. (Though last week will require more repeatable xp since the level ups were worth less.)
---
Also the pool cue
---
Oh wait you are PC. I have no clue. Consoler here. Sorry. But do that anyway.
---
I deadass kept thinking you were talking About gage the mechromancer from borderlands lmao
---
i have an alt that uses a full set of weapons reduced weight armor, has got about 800ish weapons on him (its cheap scrip food mostly that i buy) and the lag can be unbearable sometimes lmao.
---
they arent kidding about there being technical limitations. however they could choose to create an ammo box and med box just like the scrap box and alleviate storage issues.
---
i also wouldnt be surprised if they introduced some sort of longer term, off server storage that you dont have access to on the fly as to not bog the servers down. could be an "instanced camp interior" feature or something like that. 
---
at least if like to see an official transfer option between characters, so that people can essentially do the same thing with mule alts.
---
Open pip boy, hit place camp button
---
Oh and snap about 10 pics, place your camp 7 more times and boom... easiest 1250 score youll ever get
---
Sshhhh. Dont give away the magic shotgun build lol
---
~~Unlined? Bugger all. The plans arent hard to find to make your own~~
---
EDIT: Disregard. I forgot about the outfit. I was thinking underarmor.
---
No, now nuke it again. And again. Teach them fear.
---
Same here.  Also had a bug that granted the Jack O' Lantern Paint for the 10mm Pistol and the Bats Paint for the Minigun that happened today.
---
But you can’t harm others with pacifist mode on. I’ll launch grenades from my two shot auto launcher at my friends for fun and never do a single bit of damage.
---
What armor set did you have?
---
If you mean the actual outfit, probably in the realm of 20k caps.
---
Instigating, 33% VATs, and whatever last modifier is, deal 1.5k damage on just about anything if it's a VATS headshot. Love it.
---
In terms of trades though?
---
Yeah, that.
---
Idk what it is i traded ot i just know its a BOS Jumpsuit
---
It would still be nice to have the option. Modders have added in body tattoos to Fallout 4 and Skyrim after all.
---
there is a surgical mask in the base game already, and it would be pretty tone deaf.
---
Good weapons only trade. Caps are worthless because of all the duped presents.
---
Oh? Well shit. I thought I had pacifist already on but from that it seems I dont. I better check that when I get on and fix that. Probably explains why Im getting in the shit. Thanks for the heads up
---
Back when Games cosmetics were unlocked with a controller code or by just connecting to the internet
---
Part of the red rocket bundle not sure if they’re still available. I’m too cheap to buy the real slocums joe counters.
---
You can refund it in support and you'll get to keep the items  
---
Bethesda is really polite on refunds, I got refunded 1 item and 1 bundle without any problems and I still have said items so go ham :)
---
Thanks, I'll give it a shot.
---
Do it.
---
not the underamor, the rare outfit.
---
Open pip-boy, press Z to place you c.a.m.p. device. If it's for daily challenge you can do it 3 times in one NW game.
---
Hope you saved your Atom
---
Get killed by a player is the only way
---
I have all my plans listed for 0-5 caps. (Mainly to get rid of them). No one ever stops by to shop. :( My brother says I should move closer to Vault 76 so new players will come and get them, but my treehouse in the mire took a lot of work and planning and I love it too much to move.
---
Drop off all your junk and scrap at home and find a player to kill you
---
If you’re on xbox... that may have been me. I typically also sell tons of cream, one perfectly preserved pie, and a small amount of canned meat stews. I’m a big fan of the whole deal, always have tons of donuts and lemonade.
---
It's twice as long as Uranium Fever, gives less caps/sellables, less ammo, less steel/lead scrap, less legendaries, while fighting far more deadly stuff like assaultrons and takes far more work babysitting wonky AI.  If you run kelp you might get less XP on top of it all.
---
A lot of these quests have some serious asymmetrical problems that suck the fun out of them.
---
Forced to play an instrument to get the meter to move because people show up?  You get no XP, loot or legendaries from all those ghouls in One Night of Violence.  You get to sit there and watch everyone else get it.
---
Run ore in Radiation Rumble and you miss out on a huge chunk of XP from the ghouls and again all their loot and legendaries.
---
And of course all these open events pretty much completely disincentivize melee builds who will never get a kill before everything is shot to death.
---
The game hasn't even come out yet
---
I guess just a guitar sword, sunglasses, and metal right arm?
---
Oh shit sorry. I forgot there was another outfit. I was thinking the underarmor "jumpsuit". Yeah the one you have is worth a bit (assuming its the type that looks like a mechanics jumpsuit but different color/logo) because they are a really rare drop
---
compared to radiation, falling nuklear bombs, deathclaws, mutated bats, shooting sonic attacks and sloths the size of a small house, covid might even wont be recognized in that world.  
---
also, im quite happy not to be reminded to that in a video game i play for fun.
---
Oh man hopping between vendors every day to run out each set of caps. QoL improvements are few and far between but THANK FUCK for that.
---
(Also just in case anyone asks, not sarcasm)
---
Crap thanks for the correction. I forgot all about the outfit.
---
I've seen camps that put the wallpaper side out as well, so you could definitely use it to add more options in your walls. And a side benefit of using double walls is you can use different wallpapers on each side. Used sparingly it can be good for larger buildings without sacrificing too much build budget.
---
The sub really needs a list of things that the community overwhelmingly supports adding to the game so people don't feel like they have to make these posts.
---
Ok thats the one
---
That's why I said "I'm waiting". I know the game hasn't come out yet
---
Do you think its worth a BE AR
---
I used to wear the plague doctor mask. It's creepier
---
 No your right there is a train car around the corner that's a cafe i always go to for coffee and donuts living here in Los Angeles they are so common!...lol
---
Did you do one of these two things:
---
1. Stay logged into a server during the reset (doesn't matter which game mode), or
---
2. Check out the Atomic Shop first after the reset, before logging into either an adventure or a private server?
---
If you answered Yes to one of these questions: don't do that next time, and you should be fine. I don't mean to sound like an ass, but I might. Sorry for that, just trying to be helpful. The bug has been around for months (and yeah, it's entirely Bethesda's fault and they should fix it a.s.a.p.).
---
I had to beg people to kill me for hours, it was such a dark and lonely world.
---
I'm having this issue most of the time when I'm playing on my private server though still not consistent. This needs to be fixed.
---
Ahh, Z no wonder I've been having issues. 
---
And yep, for the challenge, thanks a bunch 😊
---
Thank you enlightened Canadian for explaining Americana to us ignorant Americans. We would be nothing but worms rummaging through the dark without your guiding light.
---
I thank god every day for me to have an opportunity to grovel at the feet of someone who will condescendingly explain something to me while pointing out that my ignorance stems from where I was born.
---
Some may call it xenophobic to characterize a large and diverse nation as a land of knuckle dragging simpletons, but I call it the truth.
---
Really
---
I would love to have shiny metal diner walls in game though. That's VERY era appropriate. Or a build set like the Drumlin Diners from FO4.
---
Nikto Modern Warfare? Is that you?
---
1\* Stalker's hatchet.  I own this.
---
Add in the SS jet pack and I’m floating back and forth from one corner of whitesprings to the other
---
Same here. My favorites mutations by far...
---
I don't remember so give Angry Turtle's video a watch when you get a chance to find out: https://youtu.be/2Eaju0Q_eYY
---
I am on Xbox could anyone help me? I can't see any players on the map
---
Its worth whatever you are happy to part with it for. Theres a good chance you may never get another. Also be very careful with trading because it is pretty rife with scammers and people who will rip you off. Its not an area I have any knowledge of value or how to go about it safely so hopefully someone with better knowledge can answer
---
31. I get at least 100k xp per day, all dailies except NW.  Weeklies as I can get to them. INT 40, Berry Mentats, Herbivore/Brain Fungus soup, Egghead.  Stay well rested and hydrated.
---
Add coffee on quick select wheel... you dont have to touch the ground for a good while
---
I just want you guys to know that at least one high level player (me) leaves the legendaries alone in that event for the people who actually need the scrip.
---
Would love to have a cat. One of my favorite things in FO4 was the animal traps. Had a settlement with just a bunch of cats in it.
---
All the vendor cap resets also still confuse the hell out of me. Been standing in front of a train station vendor holding bulked junk, legendary items, or w/e in my hands, ready to sell, many times just to see a big fat 0 on the right. Jesus. Just let me sell my shit.
---
At the very least add a timer in the pipboy or something so I don't pack up and travel for nothing, wondering if it reset by now.
---
Can you glitch it there with the rug trick?
---
I keep almost taking another crack at FO76 but then I remember that there's still no text chat.
---
Meh, scrapped my pistol and minigun and never made a plasma caster.
---
Minigun is like, okay, I'm going to give up having a girlfriend so I can keep this thing fed.
---
Pistol is just a really anemic shotgun that won't randomly kill you inspite of having rank 3 fireproof.
---
Aw.. I wanted some Ultra Cute power armor...
---
Not sure if it’s the amount of recipes or your inventory (including misc items like a billion keys) that causes the slow down.
---
But it is soooo noticeable
---
I've just started a new toon and got a TS single action revolver in the wolf pack event and damn, that thing takes an eternity to recharge. I like the sound of firing, tho.
---
There’s only two small things. It launches rockets and it heals stuff. Other than that, it’s a gem.
---
The teeny combat knife
---
Egg head does wonders with this season grind. 16% xp bonus plus another 6% if you have herd mentality (both needing teams for that high, only 12% for egg head without strange in numbers). The other two reasons I'm teamed up with mutants or switching teams
---
I would of been savage
---
Few posts here every day about it.
---
Did you play NW before you last logged?
---
I want a middle finger emote.
---
I think in Cyberpunk lore Johnny silverhand used a pistol specifically made to work with his arm (Malorian Arms 3516 I think its called). Although I don't know how you could recreate his outfit, A pistol build would be a good start at making him in game.
---
I don't have the Atoms!!! Nor the money for 2 weeks!!
---
Never seen any bear arm plans , or any mod plans for those. They are still exceedingly rare.
---
So useless you can't even sell them...100% agree.
---
Absolutely beautiful
---
Thank you, this helps. I just gotta get a similar outfit
---
But my house around murgle for this reason
---
This has been happening for a long time. It's really annoying.
---
lvl10 Nocturnal Combat Knife... i'm lvl100, kind of precious to me, considering how useless it is
---
The community is amazing in this game, mingle and make friends with passerby’s but you must be vigilant. Scammers kinda flourish with the current trade systems. Join the 76 Marketplace subreddit and use pricechecks, check the player blacklists, etc etc, just to be safe that you aren’t about to get scammed out of something you might’ve worked hard for. Now it’s not a guarantee you won’t be scammed but it’ll leave you more aware of what you need to look out for. Plus the marketplace is great for making caps, ammo, and finding specific weapons and armor for your character
---
Bethesda: No problem, that'll be 200 Atoms.
---
Yeah, I know. I hadn't seen anyone posting in the thread for that mod (which I thought was popular) since update 20, so I wondered if it was working for everyone else and something was wrong with mine.
---
What do you mean by tent? Do you mean its part of a random encounter spawn or a players tent? if its a random event spawn you may just have to jump servers but its going to be a recurring problem.
---
I don't know why this is addressed to Americans, like we don't know this already.
---
Munitions factory and the raider max rep camp item provides all the ammo you’ll basically need.
---
Idm the season stuff, it appeals to me actually but I hate the fact I'm forced to do NW just to make sure I get level 100
---
lmao, most dupe glitches involve crashing the server. If you can crash a server with just emotes I'd be amazed.
---
MR KRABS IS IN THERE
---
Thanks for the idea my dude
---
I started basing my camp off the prefabs. It seems to save me a lot of budget compared to the traditional floors/walls/roofs.  My camp has 4 of the bigger prefabs (Bungalow, Shed, Railroad Car and Log Cabin) all decked out with a full workshop and living quarters, a shop, lots of crops, lights, max turrets, some purifiers and a flying saucer.  I have about 30% budget left.
---
A bonus is that it only takes me about 10 minutes to move and set it all back up again.  And everything is easy to place.  No more fidgeting around trying to find that perfect flat ground.
---
If you build a traditional camp, I agree.. the budget needs to increase.
---
Same here on ps4
---
Idk if it’s an event? There’s a tent a couple crates and 2 chairs with a light in a blue barrel and a cooking pot none of which was there a couple weeks ago...
---
Well what would stop a player for being able to use that as a storage for food for themselves and not intending to sell it? They price it at a ludicrous price that way no one will want to buy it and there, they have a vendor that acts as a fridge but better. The only way I can see this working is if there was 2 separate meters, the outside spoilage and freezer spoilage. The outside spoilage applies to the seller, meaning that if they intend on using it as storage, the food will be spoiled as soon as they take it out. However, the buyer gets the freezer spoilage rate, which spoils a little slower than normal due to it being frozen/refrigerated. Both the buyer and seller can see the freezer spoilage rate.
---
You get the bullion, I was in the same situation as you and now have 25 bullion, it's safe to do.
---
This is not true. Sounds like somebody was getting salty actually lol. There's people out there, myself included, that haven't actually repaired anything at a work bench since Scorched Earth started awarding repair kits.
---
“Help Step-bro I’m stuck!”
---
Okay just making sure I wasn’t going crazy haha, thanks!
---
Hey I’ll be on in like 20 or 30 mins if you don’t get killed by then
---
I had to do this on a private world
---
like something youd see in a raider camp!
---
Bulking crafting in general, stims, ammo, smelting. All of it!!!!
---
10 out of 10 would upvote again
---
Thank you so far no one has came to me I am just waiting out front of my base it's a 10 cap bounty
---
Wastelanders changed things a bit. There spots where various random encounters spawn. It could be a npc trader or npcs at a camp etc. Sounds like its one of those. Its possibly going to be a recurring problem at the very least. At worst it may be a new permanent change. The only way to fully resolve it long term may well be to move your camp a little
---
I can second this. the amount required does not increase. actually you start to have a problem with the amount of kits you have. I have 350 improved repairs kits that I cant sell, transfer or give. 35 pounds of my stash reserved to repair kits.
---

Cheers
---
Damn that sucks lol it’s just plopped right where my stairs meets my garden 🥴 also you seem like a knowledgeable player do u know if there’s a way to add wallpaper to walls with windows I can’t seem to find the option?
---
Not sure if this will work for everyone...but I cashed in my claim tokens from the lode baring event and...the message finally stopped!!! I hope this helps someone!
---
I'm cap limited and hate buying stuff I can make earn or even RNG roll, so I always rock bottom my prices and go buy a bunch of. Bulk screws and give them away. Screw you Bethesda and your 30k limit WAY too low.
---
:D
---
bethesda still struggling with monetization. I get it, it’s a live service game. they need the income.
---
but the free item they gave 1st subscribers today would make people go nuts to buy. 
---
also, road goggles from fallout 4.
---
Same exact way as in adventure mode, just in Nuclear Winter
---
If there's a stashbox and scrap box, its a player survival tent. You can probably switch servers and it won't be there (unless you reconnect to the same server).
---
Madness!! :D
---
You are the plucking man
---
*Welyn intensifies*
---
Thanks mate!
---
Theres some issues with some of the wallpapers and walls. I think it mostly affects the wooden ones. The work around is to use the "replace" option to change the wall piece to a plain standard wall, add the wallpaper you want then "replace" the wall again with the window one
---
Yes sir they are!! I eat once a month at one in sunset blvd. Here in Los Angeles!!!
---
Same. I did so many Scorched Earth events since the legendary run startet that I have now over 50 improved repair kits in my Inventory
---
Thanks for taking the time to check. Sounds ok. I don't have a door on my current shed so,no,it wouldn't matter. Definitely worth looking into after i knock off work. Lol.
---
No stashbox just regular crates😕
---
Does it get you every login?
---
This reminds me of the sleeping in mid air glitch.
---
You can store just ten individual items. No stacks. Not worth the CAMP budget.
---
No worries, building CAMPs with no budget is not an obvious thing in NW. You can extend your life a long way by developing some good blueprints in Adventure mode to lay down in NW.
---
Yup yup, 2 separate pieces for all your mix and matching needs :P
---
Thanks for that!
---
The heart Emote is what I used.
---
I had this issue as well today. thankfull the workshop was close to my camp, so only cost me 1 cap to travel to defend
---
Meatwad gets the honeys, G.
---
Happens when events finish while you are either down or dead.
---
You can fix this by building further (as dumb as it sounds).
---
Attach stairs and try to connect it to another foundation in a different spot. Once it’s anchored there you should be able to remove parts from the original set. You can also attach stair pillars to foundations and then snap stairwells to those to create a floating anchor point but that can bug out too
---
Wow that's a super close comparison. Nikto years later after an apocalypse lol
---
There are players that intentionally get wanted, but would have damage-resultant gear so you couldn’t really kill them. 
---
Then there were those that would be “bait” to lure people to kill them only to have their crouched (hidden) buddies pounce on the would-be attacker. 
---
A lot of people got wearied of that. A lot of times I see wanted players just leave the map after 10-15 minutes.
---
"It's a super epic challenge now. Even getting in is hard!  Now, where's my non-legendary combat rifle?  I totally play (this game)  :D"   \[Imaginary Bethesda Spokesperson\]

I want this as I had my Jukebox hugged against a wall I didn't know was backwards and now I cannot have it close to the wall on my camp.
---
Xbox
---
Exactly
---
Rofl what?  This has been a problem for decades, acting like it isn't already ingrained in the culture is foolish at best and accomplishes nothing.
---
Unless people stand up for it as it happens, and gaming companies start having their backs, nothing anyone does or says anywhere else to curb this behavior will matter.
---
Coming to Reddit to cry about it in a circle jerk contributes less than nothing.  The chances this actually even happened and this isn't a pseudo-repost copy paste (like every other topic on this sub repeated ad nauseam) for fake internet points is pretty low to begin with.
---
Permanent non-removable [DUNCE cap](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/86/1e/eb/861eebb8a1a44559794f5601fd315c5e.jpg) a la GTA.
---
Teammates on a event team that dont do events
---
How do you get the different color neon? All I've found is blue.
---
Just like Wastelanders, patch 19 and patch 20.
---
Yay...
---
What's wrong with your voice box?
---
After finding them in the wild post patch 20 I was so glad I never water bullion on them.
---
It’s a known bug for a long time. We all want this to be fixed.
---
Supposedly they run side by side.
---
But I’ve been grinding the last few hours for the NW jacket. Got everything else but that and it’s taking some time even though I got the glow in the dark skeleton at the proper 14k xp mark.
---
That worked perfectly thanks a lot m8 cheers!
---
Try the mountains in the savage divide, some places have nodes and little to no spawns.
---
Adventure time!
---
Gotcha, thanks. I just got the winter armor paint. How close am I to the skeleton haha? After that I’m done
---
No in those cases they run side by side concurrently so you will get both unlocked at the same time
---
By armors pharma, there is a lookout spot on a hill overlooking lighthouse and almost entire forest region. Copper excavator place there as well. Unique cliff build. Pretty solid
---
Youre welcome
---
Bethesda is getting ready to take the need for food and water out of the game so food spoilage will no longer be a problem.
---
Hey what’s your GT?
---
I’m level 166 on my third character. Legendary grind, trading with other players for high tier of items, leveling up, refining my build, I do all that stuff.
---
Sometimes I just build up my camp for a day
---
FlutterShyBot
---
I would not mind if the refrigerator thing if it did not take up the camp budget I mean ok give it a set amount of items it can store at 1 time but not use up the camp budget. Why does food take up the camp budget? It's like the devs just want to piss people off at this point.
---
This has been the story of 76. There's always going to be those who cheat and those who don't. I don't have envy for those who hit level 100 by cheating. I simply play the way I play and enjoy it. It's extremely doubtful Beth will do anything but as far as I'm concerned I'm having fun and will hit 100 legitimately.
---
Yes i eventually stopped using the combo that triggered it.
---
Cool I’ll be there in a second to kill you lol
---
Thank you lol
---
Atom Shop Large Letter set.
---
You’ve got a few more grinds.
---
Once you get past the jack o lantern armor it’s just ahead, but it may vary based on your current xp.
---
Which you can’t see unfortunately.
---
21.  Unfortunately, as the amount of SCORE required for each rank increases I think I'll eventually fall behind.  Play time is going to be decreasing for me over the next few months.
---
The neon lights spelling "fucked" are an atom shop item.
---
Same except for my automatic doors(pressure plates). I plan on changing those to MOSTLY hidden soon. If my vision works, that is.
---
How did you get the pint sized slasher outfit?
---
Where are you by on the map? I can’t seem to find you
---
Right in front of sunshine meadow's industrial farm
---
20. I saw someone's camp that had the giant sheepsquatch plush today, what rank is that? 30+?
---
Maybe this is Bethesdas secret way to stop everyone from using the XP glitch to easily get tier 100
---
Did the new character thing. Boy have I been doing things wrong this whole time....
---
You can hide almost all conduits in walls if you place them before the walls and use doorways and replace For the bigger pieces.
---
Jacket is 14k.  I had to do beanie and that, and kept up with xp rewards right after beanie.  
---
Not sure of interaction with Halloween for those interested, I had all of those already.
---
Oh ok thank you kind wastlander.
---
I had a full set of ultracite with a jetpack.
---
Maybe she'll be with the BoS when they'll come back.
---
You actually just taught me the TLDR! (I mostly only use lol and smh), so I guess I'm guilty of using the acronyms too, it just gets annoying though when I see new ones.. or new to me anyway lol.
---
Fuck man. My two best weapons by a mile
---
As a dev I have to imagine that programmatically it can’t be very difficult to add an additional opening line.  
---
I do agree that it takes up a more time and money in regards to audio recording though.
---
I read on another forum that they both are 14k for the suit and NW jacket/beanie
---
Wow I actually burst out laughing!
---
lol
---
Por que no los dos?!
---
It is unreasonable to think one can have every item in their CAMP at the same time. You have to pick, choose. We were meant to move our CAMPs but we kinda don’t.
---
If you send a ticket they will refund you and let you keep the items!! Bethesda has been great about that
---
That would be super secretive indeed. It's a shame people are doing that though, makes legit accomplishment a lil less satisfying, know?
---
Everything working my end.
---
„Faces“ ;)
---
Oh cool
---
I wasn't watching my vendor yesterday and suddenly realized I was at 29,800+ and had to drop everything and sprint to Whitespring to buy another Serum recipe. 
---
I only have 5 recipes left to purchase, so not sure what to do for a cap sink after that ...
---
Nice. I’m consistently getting 5-3rd place. Hoping it doesn’t take me 3 more hours😭
---
Beanie was 7k, fur lined jacket 14k.  I’m very certain of that as those were the only 2 I needed.
---
Thank you again for helping out and the loot!
---
...and you can get token amounts through the Legendary Run.
---
Yep.  Back in the day I scrapped my ultracite set!
---
Yay Tacos!
---
I have my own personal pond with a stream. It's beautiful until a random Scorchbeast attacks. However if they add all these crops they should reduce the CAMP space they take up.
---
I think Whitesprings sell them
---
But they're just decoration basically
---
Ok!
---
I looked in every whitesprings vendor none are selling any
---
I think stash needs to go back down to 600 pounds and everyone should get the Scrap box.
---

---
Probably
---
I'll check out herd mentality. I don't use class freak, so healing factor sounds a bit too much for me. Thanks
---
No necessarily, I unlocked the skeleton suit but not the winter fur suit. So im guessing that one is bugged among the bug.
---
The stuff in the box is from the raiders previous victims who put stuff in the box  (npc's) he comes out and attacks you because he wants to rob you hence the note telling you to put stuff In the box but doesn't expect you to try and rob him
---
I got this one and naturally looted the box. Stupid sexy Raiders.
---
This *10000000
---
I’m currently level 30 and have been lucky enough to not lose any score
---
Yes I just got my first gauss shotgun this week.  Rolled a one star Bloodied and an anti armor.  I have noticed the vats is s little strange with this gun.  Often does no damage especially with SB.   Hopefully this gets fixed.   But still, quite the gun in general.
---
Been like that for a long time.  It's lovely when my gauss shotgun doesn't even move the bar on the mob but kills me with fireproof and good armor.
---
For goodness sake don’t talk about these “bonuses”. I’ve built up 7 days of bullion purchases by just - HA!  I’m going to follow my own advice and not spill the beans. But I assure you it’s true.
---
Ceilings would be nice too
---
If you put stuff in the box he leaves you alone and doesn't come out from what I remember
---
You can view all NW challenges in Adventure mode, but not all Adventure challenges in NW. So, you never have to actually play NW to see what you're required to do for that mode.
---
Store your junk and fast travel to Whitespring Station. Go take a walk and come back 10 minutes later. Someone should have killed you.
---
I hope we get a quest to find her brother too.
---
My favorite line is them saying: “Lumberjack Protectron does not want to lose job to cheap human worker.”
---
Or something like that.
---
Also update the UI... Yes, that UI that was developed for FO3.
---
With it being a limited time item have they said if we will lose access if  we don’t keep our subscriptions active? Or is it like previous items where we get to keep the skins and outfits and only  loose access to private servers and the tent?
---
You're using a small scale nuclear bomb launching weapon. Do you *really* need V.A.T.S. for that?
---
Sorry if I don't want to hear afk people eating cheetos  every time I go vending machine hunting.
---
You used to be able to hit a sb in the air with vats on a Fatman.
---
Smiley. Once/week for 6k.  That’s literally it.
---
Yeah the rock just lifted it high enough to build a second floor. I think I'm just going to have to sacrifice the junk pile in order to build a second floor. Thanks for your help!
---
Useful having a full set of unyielding armour in your stash box for trading with vendors, doing certain things around camp or talking with NPCs as part of a mission.  They will boost all your special points.  However, if you are a dedicated PA build then, yes, no need to wear conventional armour while in your PA.
---
It’s literally the same Thing that we were doing before but with less freedom. Same/easier lame ass challenges dressed up as a fantastic adventure across the stars. It would be laughable if I didn’t love fallout lore so much.
---
They have a star next to their name. Which is really easy to see. I agree they should glow or something. But it’s not like they are impossible to see.
---
The Christmas stuff all requires the xp it says, it resets after the last rewards. So you need a full 14kbxpbafter the beanie to get the jacket. The holloween stuff stacks so you only need 7k after the pumpkin paint for the skeleton
---
Love how you assume I wasn't around for the NES and SNES.
---
Not having Becket as a shop seems like a missed opportunity for me. It would even justify the 10% tax
---
Thanks! Got some grinding to do tomorrow then!
---
I dropped my hot pocket on the floor and I was pissed af. Your comment made me chuckle and I feel better. Thanks mate
---
Mine were also at the time. Basically I’m changing how I play the game every 2-3 months based on some new bug in the game. It’s almost fun if you think of it more like a progressive step up from familiar territory to unknown play styles. And by fun I mean forced evolution.... “and here we have the Toddicatus Howardotus, the elusive fistula predator feeding mostly on carrion and excrement.”
---
All jokes aside, I fucking love fallout 76.
---
Until when? I wanna get it!
---
Weirdly fatman's don't really do much damage to a SB Queen. You'd think tactical nukes would wreck, but this fallout nerfed it to basically a, well, Nerf gun
---
I approve the cats - however, they must also come with a feature where you come home to find that random stuff have been knocked off your display cases and are now sitting on the floor.
---
Funny enough, I just won my next game and kicked ass, unlocked the pumpkin armor immediately. So not far now right?
---
Brings a tear to my eye every time
---
Pretty you cant build your own camo.
---
 My fire axe with no perk cards does more dmg  than a fatman. I don't understand it. I really don't.
---
The scatter barrel is useless on a non explosive plasma. Put the focuser on it and you'll be much happier
---
The last thing SBQ dropped
---
Yeah I was near 30k, around 27,000 when someone came along and purchased like three of my high value weapons out of the blue. I wasn't expecting that at all. So basically one item maxed me out and I guess the other 5k went into FO76 Rad-Vapor. :(. So now I'm just buying stupid shit to keep my money down to like 20k so I dont have to constantly worry what I'm putting up for sale so much and for what cost.
---
What the heck Bethesda is the 30k cap limit for anyhow? Bet you  wouldn't do that for Atoms!
---
Edit: word.
---
Damn I have 1 extra
---
Yes this is true. It's still a fun weapon to use though. I just wanted to speak up about it being broken in vats though, it was so satisfying to see a mininuke curve towards it's target in the sky.
---
Vats is entirely broken with all the gauss weapons.
---
I was getting it earlier today
---
The eastern edge of the savage dive has amazing eastern views of the bog and mire,  the North Western and North Eastern corners of the map have great views as well and usually your camp spot won’t be taken. There is some really choice high altitude flat rocky cliffs Northeast of Pricket’s fort overlooking the valley and western divide.
---
Could well be. Im not that far in yet and probably a long way off it. Im assuming it didnt get patched out? Figures itd be bugged because its the one I prefer over the skeleton suit to be honest
---
&gt;how is it that a research-based post on huge bugs cant get 100 upvotes in 4 hours??
---
Welcome to reddit.  If you want upvotes say Trump is Adolf in the title.  If you want downvotes, point out hypocrisy.  If you want to be banned, post facts.
---
I get ya. I get ya. But this ain't your daddy's fallout. This is Todd's fallout, and 'it just works'
---
"Don't stress, buddy.  You can BUY your way to the end for a mere $150.  It's super awesome!  :D " \[Imaginary Bethesda Spokesperson\]
---
Agreed. 
---
Also: Large meat pile (comes with Deathclaw) 
---
I know they can be tamed, id like an actual pet one, preferably that can't be murdered.
---
Not what I’m talking about. Please view imgur link before ID ten-t error occurs.
---
Are you using other AP boosting things that it won't stack with?
---
Sounds pretty funny. Too bad you don't a recorded to upload to YouTube. I would like to watch that.
---
If a wheelbarrow and haybales can spawn a Brahmin, then I don't see why this shouldn't be possible.
---
You're probably giving them ideas for the next season, lol.
---
Raider bot vendors always have surgical masks
---
Even the one in the whitesprings
---
Pheonix at Watoga sells it I think but he wont always have it. You might need to server hop to get it
---
I always do the thumbs down and then a heart and hope people understand that I’m shaming myself and sending them lovely apologies.
---
My Grim Reaper's Sprint periodically doesn't work for me either.  Because I forgot to swap Super Duper back out for it after crafting.
---
😁
---
As the saying goes. Fix one thing break three more.
---
How so? Seems like they could play with the idea cuz of the whole scorchbeast plague
---
Any idea how long this has been a thing?
---
No problem, good luck with it.
---
This... This right here. If people actually played the game for themselves and don’t listen to whatever idiotic Youtubers say about it, they’ll see how much of a good game it is. I was one of those people who didn’t play the game for the first 6 months it launched because of what some idiot Youtuber said about it, tried it one night after Overwatch pissed me off beyond all belief and honestly I wish I had played it sooner.
---
(Now anytime I see someone bashing 76 for no reason, I assume they haven’t even played the game for themselves and are just going off of secondhand hearsay, thus anything they say is irrelevant and they just look like a fool.)
---
Love the gas bag moan/howl.
---
Like IRL plants many can't grow in the same area even fairly close in distance. The Forest vs the furthest SE where I've only found Cranberries is quite tedious. Other players can get them before you, server hoping until you get more, and if you don't have "Green Thumb" all extend the game time.    
---
Considering it is an ingredient in 3 foods which provide XP buffs they are being stingy with it.
---
Escape Artist kinda works.  It goes off on certain weapon swaps too now for some reason.
---
It looks like the Fallout version of Vigil from Rainbow Six Siege and I love it.
---
Chainsaw, cryolater, Mr handy buzz blade, asualtron blade, lead pipes, grenade launcher, black powder bluderbuss, alien blaster, laser____,  and many more👍
---
He is at his desk 90% of the time for me but at night he goes to his bed (which makes sense) I’ve never had issues with him being in his bed unless everybody just meant that it’s annoying to wait 3 seconds for him to get up?
---
If the created a freezer they'd get my atoms. I really wanna ditch good with salt but it's just worth it currently
---
We also need a laughing emote
---
Well I personally think the cheaters are a bigger issue than this, but yes, it is not very funny when you depend on others to gain something.
---
Ive seen them at the Brotherhood vendor in Watoga and on Graham. They have a small chance to spawn though so it may take a while to find.
---
I found a two shot broadsider recently that I thought “could” be powerful.  It took half the damage off a level 30 scorch on a direct hit.  Boring.  Lol
---
How did he kill you of you didn't want to pvp
---
You're half way there.
---
On my 10th crafting i got a 3\* Bloodied +33%vats chance -25% vast cost.
---
I have 1 PER and 2 AGI i can use play as i rifle build haha
---
Timegating creates the *illusion* of content, but the content ended after the vault raid. Now we wait for the events on the roadmap, and give our honest feedback in the hopes that it will improve the next expansion.
---
This game will never be what we want it to be, so just try to have a little fun in the meantime. Hopefully someone will be so enamoured with what *could have been* and decides to go ahead and make it - so something better grows from the ashes when this all finally burns down.
---
At least it’s not a paid DLC 
---
but I understand the struggle I dont know why I’m paying money just for me to grind to make my money’s worth
---
I’m not sure. I’ve heard wastelanders, I’ve also heard fallout 4.
---
Oh no.  Ok.  Thanks
---
How am I gonna stealth nuke my buddy's camp in his private server then?
---
So I have 7000 out of 14000 instead of the ghille suit rewards being like “do 7000, then next tier do another 14000”
---
As u/Azure__Wolf mentioned the munitions factory near the top right of the map is great for passively farming ammo
---
Also a nice tip is that this gun is very ammo efficient. With a good legendary effect, the right perks and mutations you can kill lots of strong enemies with 1 or 2 shots.  
---
Plus if you put a Prime Receiver it not only will do more damage but you i'll be crafting 4x more ammo at the cost of a single Crimson Flux (you get Flux as a reward for Scorched Earth and Blast Berries are common in the area.)
---
I guess you could be a mysterious benefactor, buy a players stuff, and then leave it on the ground for them/someone else.
---
You're straight from Hell.  
---
I love it.
---
Though what if my English pronunciation is terrible, while the writing is good enough for others to understand. Others won't even bother to have a microphone, or if they have it's so terrible you'd rather mute them than listen to the screeching microphone they have. Anyway there is a reason why most people want the text chat, so why not implement it? I do understand that the cosmetics are more important but, would be great to have this useful thing.
---
Great roll!
---
Wow, given how well it performs in V.A.T.S, that is a perfect roll, congrats.
---
Smiley?
---
Tbh I've already gave up with the legendary run the game has too many dailys.
---
Deaf people exist too.
---
That's amazing! I might just have to borrow your idea! Ha ha ha.
---
I thought they do glow like a green energy
---
Broadsider is a sad weapon. It should be a lot more powerful, I've also heard the weapon itself is bugged and does little damage on a direct hit.
---
I emptied the box and nothing happened 🤷‍♀️
---
The gold bouillon guy at The Wayword. Once/week, you can pay him 6k caps for 300 bouillon.
---
Ah the good days of Fallout 1...when the [Turbo Plasma Caster ](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Turbo_plasma_rifle_(Fallout))was so overpowered!   
---
With the right stats and perks you could fire that beastie 4-5x in a single turn. I was basically a death machine.  
---
Trivia: it was actually called "Plasma Rifle" in Fallout 1.
---
I’m not sure if it’s the case for everyone, but before the patch he wouldn’t wake up and you had to wait until daytime to talk to him.
---
Atom shop
---
IIRC They actually increased the AP cost in Fallout 2 😝
---
Well, as long as I didn't miss out on anything unique. Thanks for the reply!
---
&gt;and a chance of surviving, it needs to be level 1. 2 is better and 3 is ideal. You can fill the feeding trough to level 1/2 on your own.
---
I mean personally I'm not doing them for the xp or legendaries but for the plans. I happily run the ore and play the instruments :P Project paradise i've never actually completed with all three habitats though
---
Unfortunately I did. Wasn't anything too crazy. Just a raider and his dog.
---
It is well known bug, I am not sure but it still prevails from the launch :D
---
See, I cant play games everyday.  I can usually knockout around 5hrs, give or take on a weekend.  So anything I was playing, that adds a battle pass like system, is worthless to me.  The only way I'll ever possibly complete them, is to buy the tiers.  Since I'm not gonna do that....I usually don't bother to look at the rewards so I don't know what I might be missing.
---
Hell, I might not even get the ammo converter while its available.  I havnt even finished a single tier move yet, I think I've only done 2 or 3 dailies. Luckily, I have seen the rewards, and I just don't care about whether or not I'd get them, because I'd never use them.  Especially not the final series, I think those PA skins and that gatling skin look horrendous. I really don't care for the 20s idea of future tech.  That pulp comics Flash Gorden style stuff is not for me.
---
Guess he didn't think I was worth it lol
---
Ah gotcha ... I haven’t finished wastelanders yet because I’m waiting to take sides until I have top favorability with both factions.
---
Come to think of it, I sold a bunch of stuff last night as well. More than usual anyway.
---
And if you're now always enjoying the teams herd mentality is amazing
---
But that doesn’t benefit me ... might as well leave the vending machines running and sell past the cap. It’s a loss either way.
---
Technically we were getting free cosmetics before
---
Here's a tip for the future, if you have issues finding creatures in NW. While the spawns aren't consistent per match, I have the easiest time finding AI creatures at the Power Plant in the Morgantown map, and around the Flatwoods Church in the Flatwoods map. The Plant tends to get a lot of bloatfly AI (I've seen around 6 or 7 at a time at its peak), so they're super easy to take out, while Flatwoods gets up to 3 ghouls in and around the road in front of the church. Creature kills in NW are incredibly simple, but you do need to get to them before others, and know where they spawn. Carry a crossbow or quick melee weapon, and you can take them out without drawing any attention with gunfire.
---
I haven't moved my camp ever since I found my spot. Moving it would be way too much a hassle. I haven't tried bc my whole house is one big piece and I don't think it will blueprint that much at once but idk.
---
I added stuff and nothing happened, on the next one I found, I took stuff and nothing happened.  Next one I find, I will just ignore.
---
It prevails from fo4 actually so I think it's either a feature, which doesn't make sense as getting a few extra HP from gear is no more overpowered than extra melee DMG from STR or sneaking from AGIL for example. Or its a hardwired bug that is impossible to fix given that it's been known about for 5ish years.
---
I played NW for literally the 3rd time today to place my camp and somehow ended up in 7th place.  The only other person I saw killed me, and I barely saw them.  I did kill a Mirelurk. Went from level 1 to level 4.  I unlocked a couple things, one was a photo frame and the others I have no idea where to find or what they were.  Are all the rewards still available?  I chose to spawn in a remote place as to survive awhile, and I was surprised how easy it was to hide.  If most of it is still available maybe I'll even try to learn the mode, but just knowing the map should buy me some time each match.
---
Have you heard about the train driver who ran over a bunch of people? Apparently he has a loco motive.
---
mostly not in a team, only since the the new update.
---
Jeez... give him a break. Everyone makes mistakes, just ask your parents.
---
I had this problem, but was for the map mod I had. I deleted it and fixed.
---
I did too. I was tracking it and saw the first one tick off after I deployed my CAMP 3 times. I missed it awarding another (thinking it was killing 3 creatures), then at the end I ranked up and it gave me another one. 
---
It’s like it knows the daily challenges that are coming and when you complete them it counts for the weekly. Hopefully it doesn’t autocomplete those dailies without giving SCORE.
---
The most frustrating part of NW, as someone who plays it a ton, is just how long it takes to get a match going. I know comparing it to other battle royale games isn't incredibly fair, but Apex Legends gets matches going SO DANG FAST. With NW, there's this long loading screen just to get matched, then loading the lobby itself, then a wait for more players (if the game feels this part is needed), then a wait for map voting, then choosing where you want to spawn before loading the actual map. And if you die early on, that much loading is incredibly frustrating because of just how long it can take (whereas the likes of Apex is super quick in all aspects; again, unfair comparison, but a good quality game to aspire to be similar to).
---
I really do love NW, despite how little focus it gets. But damn I wish it wasted less time to get things started.
---
Yep.
---
Sort of cheesed the fight... Oh well, I'll take the W.
---
There should be but i want to point out not every1 who watches those does them
---
Good advice
---
Yeah i spawn in a mountain lol but usually when i fast travel again it works
---
there’s gotta be some consequence
---
I'll definitely try that, I'm okay with it being kind of annoying if I can use the wallpapers I want.
---
Me too! People bought almost all of my plans that I sold for 20-100 caps
---
Someome even bought my legendary handmade that had been sitting there for over a month
---
Yes its a random bug
---
Weren't we supposed to be getting pets? I vaguely remember something about pets coming this summer.
---
Stop carrying around junk to events, or stop dying 🤷‍♂️ Would you rather your loot just disappeared entirely and you had zero chance to get it back? Cos that's the alternative. They aren't going to make an instanced loot container to cater for scrubs who carry to Encryptid..
---
Thought so. It’s been a while, so I put that disclaimer in to be safe.
---
Oh okay that would definitely be frustrating so I can understand how people felt about that.
---
We need a crying emote
---
That's actually a pretty good point. I might see the argument if there wasn't a pacifist/opt-out of PVP, but there is, so... 
---
??? 
---
That's kind of bad design. I expect I'll see some realism/"muh immersion" arguments, but nothing about this game is realistic lol. And for me at least it's immersion breaking to have to worry about it. 
---
I could see a "consequences of dying" argument but PVE gameplay should have PVE consequences.
---
Edit: and I say this as someone who almost never carries anything I'm worried about losing. It's just bad design. It forces you to play the inventory management hell minigame, which might be the least fun part of this game. 
---
I'm sure they don't mind that it pushes you toward their dumb subscription model, either. It's not that they can't fix this problem. It's that they want you to pay monthly for the fix.
---
I found it to the east of Pleasant Valley. I read the note, emptied the box, and killed and looted the Blood Eagle that ambushed me. Then, I went to the Blood Eagles that spawn nearby at the Central Mountain Lookout, killed them, and looted all their stuff.  
---
I figure with Blood Eagles, you're not getting anything but hurt, so pre-emptive strikes were the way to go.
---
"Hey, buddy!  Why not take a break from the fun and buy some Atoms?  No limit there!  Now, where is my non-legendary gear?  I totally play &lt;this game&gt; .  It's super awesome!   :D"  \[Imaginary Bethesda Spokesperson\]
---
Yeah this is what i do also and will give the heart emoji to anyone that does it for me :) No need to rush it, only takes an extra minute to wait for ppl to run over and tag
---
Rose is proud, my friend.
---
I lost about the same amount as you. Submitted a ticket and haven't hear back.
---
Dude that’s awesome.
---
dO yOu GuYs NoT hAvE pHoNeS?
---
My ward is clipping through the top bed
---
I prefer brain fungus.
---
love them brainzzzzzzzzz...
---
1. He was level 170 and I was level 28
---
2. There were also a number of colonel Gutsy robots and an assaultron nearby.... he basically just had to finish me off.
---
Open a repair shop!
---
I'm surprised at how limited they are when Fallout 4 had more. *This* is the one area Bethesda has issues w/shamelessly ripping assets from a previous game?
---
I love this so much!
---
For real. And a laughing one. How the hell am I supposed to be myself if I can’t make people laugh and also apologize all the time?
---
Dude and don’t even get me started on the atom shop D: 
---
IF WE OWN SHIT THATS IN A BUNDLE WE SHOULD GET A DISCOUNT ON THE FUCKING BUNDLE, BETHESDA. YOU MONEY GRUBBING CUNTS
---
After July 14th all the die hards will be walking around with what they want from the season. They will buy it. Lol
---
Bethesda confirmed with one of the other dataminers that the lack of XP carry-over is intended :(
---
Second toon, 1st roll was a two shot.  The caster is perfect for switching to during a queen fight to plink at mob critters without using 200 ulty .50 cal ammo.  It is like a heavy sniper rifle.
---
Do you realize there are different teams for these tasks?
---
Wait till you get secret service and t 65 power armour
---
I think this item was datamined like two weeks ago? Something like that, so some of us knew it was comming. Personally, my F1st ended a while back and don't feel like it is worth it rn. When they drop heavy content and I play a LOT again I'll buy it. Hope the outfit is still there by then.
---
I'd guess that it is because you would insta die if you removed the underarmor if at low health.
---
And then lie naked on a deathclaw pelt in front of a fireplace?
---
It’s actually become way more engaging than I ever have it credit for. Pretty glitchy still but I think people are having a good time
---
Brilliant, seriously.   Love this.  👏
---
How
---
LOL is that a real thing (in Fallout)? Can you actually get addicted to spoiled food? 🤣🤣🤣
---
On the topic: if I get bone worms with lvl 3 Adamantium skeleton do I still take limb damage?
---
there is a fountain at the golf course that cures diseases..
---
the last thing bethesda would want to do is try and monetize something by using a global pandemic that is killing people. it wouldn't really be funny.
---
video games dont need tie ins with real world topical disasters. people are playing games to avoid shit like covid, not to be reminded more of it.
---
For every million atoms you buy, they'll put half a developer on the game.
---
I love marsupial. Even if a ghoul can still high five my rump as I jump to avoid it.
---
where did you read that about patch 22, i cant find it.
---
I get that, too, sometimes. I'm on Xbox and while camp build isn't as slow as you describe, my activities in the Workbench screens are the same exact way. It takes absolutely forever to cook and make chems, and it takes a long time to register repairs as well.  
---
Everything seemed a lot slower tonight. Loading into Camp, one item at a time loaded. Even talking to NPCs, shooting enemies (and having them respond to damage), rebuilding my vending area. Refilling the Vending Machines tonight was excruciatingly slow. It would take a long while to scroll to highlight the item, take a long time to choose the item, a long time to slide to the price...   
---
Things have been running slow for me, too.
---
Kudos to you. Even with god roll stats I scrip those things. I hope it works out for you! If not... I know a machine that’ll give you 40 scrip for it... ;)
---
You’ll save a lot of caps if you are close to molewoman’s shop I can tell you that
---
I labeled it below 400caps since it was free for me and only lvl 35. But you got a point. If is sits longer than one session i will search a random player on the map and gift it i promise.
---
It's like nobody's ever played an mmo before.
---
Did it for you
---
I was lucky because it was my 5th or 6th try. Figured Howard's RNG smiled on me and I quit right then and there. Lol. Gauss Shotgun.... Still working on that. 20 modules in and still nothing good
---
Absolutely true. I’d go run a silo couple times a week if things were slow, but now I’m doing events I’d have otherwise skipped because I don’t want to fall behind.
---
There's not really new content, it's more about them trying to have more engaging ways of playing. I personally am enjoying it but can see it wearing thin as I don't like the seasonal FOMO. That's what ultimately turned me off Destiny 2 and so far that seemed easier to compete the season. Very early days though. Some of the new group perks such as the confetti version of Bloody Mess are very fun.
---
It's kind of a luxury item. Not something I would use often but still kind of a bummer.
---
Time to buy
---
I've really been enjoying it.
---
Whats the cost
---
Wasnt until lvl 100 that i got into mutations. Since then its been a slippery slope. I keep going out ti get my next mutation.
---
(For real tho, when i started it upped my game 100%)
---
Same.  The 5-10% of people too stupid to know how to use a mic and think everyone needs to hear them type / breath / threaten their girlfriend with death / beat their dog / constantly belch / scream "I'm Pickle Rick" every 30 seconds etc. really ruin it for everyone.
---
It's the same as literally every FO1st outfit. You have a limited time to get it (so if you don't sub until next month, you can't get it) but once you have it it's yours.
---
He IS Foundation
---
No, I just have a problem. I cannot bring myself to eat anything other than spoiled food.
---
I'm on xbox, and yeah, it does it to me, too. I have to quit and restart.
---
I'm just happy I paid for 2 months but got 3 sets of stuffs (desert ranger, nuclear paints, this outfit). Yay?
---
The season thing REALLY makes me angry if done poorly. I don't really have FOMO, but if the game makes me feel that way maybe I'll just pass on this season :(
---
Any new game breaking glitches?
---
Then immediately trigger the trap element of your camp!!!! Maybe write some really fine print under it that peeps have to read up close.... Right over the false floor....
---
Glitched nocturnal rolling pin. Apparently you can get bash damage on melee weapons?
---
Me
---
It's how I get back down to 20% health.  :)  That makes it the 2nd most useful weapon in the game right behind whatever bloodied weapon you're using.
---
You dumb
---
This game is basically a mobile game half assing everything and breaking things more than fixing things like a typical bethesda game especially the fallout series
---
you'll get all initial fo1st bundle items - ranger outfit, tent, scrap stash, icons, 1650 atoms, &amp; 1month private server. plus the current 1st atom shop freebies, which is the bogwander outfit. unfortunately, the rest of the freebies from the previous updates are excluded since you don't have an active 1st sub at the time of their releases.
---
Just down the hill from Lucky Hole, there’s a number of pools with views of the hospital and the bog.
---
Cliff southeast of Whitesprings have good views of Whitesprings.
---
Exactly, I get so pissed when shit like this happens. I couldn’t do anything except for spamming the thumbs up emote, or drop a bunch of mentats. Simple horrible.
---
Log out before the daily renew will ya? Bethesda should fix the bug, but u can prevent it too
---
No. The length of time between repairs doesn't change, regardless of method used to repair.  
---
If anything, it seems like I use more repair kits because I'm lazy and don't feel like going back to my Camp (or anyone else's) to switch Perk cards around to repair the weapon when I could just use the damn kit and keep moving. OR the damn thing breaks during the heavy firefights where I can't just up and leave to repair.
---
looooooool
---
Garbage?
---
They have SLIGHTLY lower per-shot damage (when comparing auto/semi versions of the same gun).
---
They make up for it with VASTLY higher RoF. 
---
Overall DPS is much, much higher.
---
I have a BE lever action. Massive per-shot hit. But Queen fights? It's the lowly B Handmade I bring.
---
Why are you even making this post? I appreciate the accuracy, but as an undereducated American i gotta say that i already knew and know absolutely nobody or have ever heard of anyone questing the train cart. I appreciate the content, but please rephrase or repost the content in a different manor.
---
Same with Destiny 2.
---
Developers cannot make content at the rate we can consume it. It just isn't physically possible. They also don't want you to move on from their game for months at a time by letting you blast through the latest content in a week. That means more chance you won't come back to the game later and less chances to sell you microtransactions.
---
It kinda sucks, of course, but as they are a business, i completely understand why they do it. Doesn't mean i'm happy about it.
---
Personally i'd love to see a Wastelanders style update every couple of months, even if i had to pay for it. But the time it takes to come up with quests, items, voice recording, bug testing (haha) and more, it is literally impossible.
---
Yep. This has been going on for a very long time. It sucks.
---
Thankfully, it doesn't happen to me often. (But when it does, it pisses me off.)
---
You will. I run a hybrid melee setup. I can change from 1 handed to 2 handed, and then to unarmed on the fly to suit the weapon I'm using. With 1 and 2 handed I can one shot every enemy in game except max level SB. My unarmed on the other hand will one shot all in game enemies plus one tap a maxxed out level 80 SB. You won't have any trouble. I love combat knives but you can use a lot of 1 hand melees. Bloodied SS Baton is a blast. Bloodied SS Assaultron Blade.
---
Bloodied SS Hatchet is brutal. Lol
---
Theres way more but just experiment with different gladiator melees and see what feels right by you. No one can tell you what you like. Wing it. If your on PS4 I have a lot. My PSN is same as here if you wanna send me a FR.
---
Deathclaw nest (Comes with Deathclaw)
---
I don't think they fixed the bug yet but people can use the explosive bait to damage camp's
---
Can confirm
---
My first CAMP spot will be a house. The second spot will be a hotel (because I got kicked out of my house). The third will be a tent (because I got kicked out of the hotel)...
---
Even more, we were getting OUR CHOICE of free cosmetics before.
---
Now, everyone gets the same cosmetics, like it or not.
---
Just emotionally......
---
27. Have made sure to be logged off at reset time so no glitches holding me back. 
---
I was grinding hard in the beginning but I'm at about an hour or two a day max now. 
---
I missed the first few nw dailies but started doing them especially since a weekly is tied to it now.
---
Have the names of players different colours, example the friendly yellow for pacifist, red for hostile and like an orange or blue for PVP turned on. Pvpers will always know who they can PVP with before shooting someone to see if the damage marker comes up. If pacifist is turned on then even in a team you remain pacifist but being back team PVP. I. Rarely if ever PVP but the few times I did it was because it was team vs team that was fun
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hmtiww/list_of_currently_broken_perks/
---
There are a few notes though that once in your stash you can't get them back out. It should be fixed.
---
Another fire pit tip; you can stack one on top of another to make a two tiered full circle pit that looks lovely.
---
Not a bug. NW is the closest to balanced PVP the game has. Ghillie skins would be unbalanced.
---
Bethesda made the right choice here.
---
It was explosives, I got the grenade indicator warning. Wasn't aware its a bug.
---
That'd be nice. The workaround is to start a new character and you'll pretty much level up each time you leave the vault.
---
Just make an alt.....
---
So don't do the grind. There's a glitch with the raiders. If you do the quest for rocksy after you kill the raiders (yes kill him) she says, "can I scratch this name off my list or what? Say the wasteland has another corpse and immediately press back. It ends the conversation without completing the quest and you can do that over and over until your at Ally. It takes a while but nowhere near the month and a freaking half it takes to do it once a day. As for the settlers...no glitch far as I know but the shotguns blow in this game anyway.
---
The fasnacht ones can't be taken out. Definitely should be fixed.
---
and rightfully intentional. NW is the closest to balanced PVP the game has. Ghillie skins in it would be unbalanced (because not everyone can/will get them, especially new players who join in 4 months)
---
Yeah it's a bug unfortunately
---
I’m not super surprised. On XB there’s at least 4 challenges and 1 achievement that won’t unlock for me. It’s been more than a year on some.
---
Yeah this is not call of duty don't expect that
---
Filler seasons, events, and rewards to give their devs time to finish the next expansion is technically still content, I suppose. But the big miss in the legendary run, I believe, is not adjusting the rest of the game to better handle the surge of player activity and lengthier play sessions. This would have been a great time to put all the currency resets on an unified schedule, ideally timed with the daily challenge reset. This would be a great time to tinker with upping or removing buy and spend limits. I hope they make an effort to improve the economy. For two straight days, I’ve been in on epic SBQ fights, one nuke after the other. A lot of fun. Until my toon gets crushed under the weight of the reward drops. I’m not even looting much from enemies except materials to craft ammo and basic aid items. But there’s only so many legendary and bulk junk I can sell a day, and I am having to drop perfectly good loot just to stay mobile. It’s crazy how the season encourages continuous play, but the economic rules remain oblivious Appalachia has a big block party happening over the next several weeks.
---
oh shit, that works?
---
There was a FO4 forehead tattoo like the Jokers that said *irradiated*..
---
This actually looks like something Bethesda would put in lol
---
i ended up buying the slocums joe counters because i got pissed that my red rocket ones wouldnt snap the the vendor😂
---
It's happening to me on xbox, too. VATS only works part of the time.  
---
I've also noticed that my guns get stuck in the manual aim animation and won't release for a while. I was trying to access my Pip-Boy and it wouldn't let me because I was stuck in the aiming mode. I finally walked and accessed a world container and it released the aim.
---
100%. For all of the times I accidentally “attack” someone. It would be nice to let people know rather then start a stupid game of tag.
---
Had someone scoop a bag after scorched earth a while back and he was in pacifist mode. Couldn't do anything to retaliate for him picking it up and he just threw taunting emotes. 
---
The fix unfortunately just getting fallout 1st and storing junk every 5 minutes like your life depends on it. Lol
---
On PC - "TAB" first, then "Z"
---
Oh my fuck. It makes sense now. Like three people yesterday at different times bought 1 x .38 ammo off me and I was telling my buddy I team up with that I thought something was wrong with my vendor. Glad I ran across this.
---
Thanks God I don't reply on an aimbot mechanic to be good at the game
---
Nope
---
progress on legendary run is account wide. so a level up with a new character gives you the points, just be sure to claim the rewards with your main (or wherever you want it).
---
If I drop something for someone then I don't care what they do with it. I try svd drop something I think may be useful for them like now I've got turbo fert grenades I've been dropping them for people. But if it's no use and they want to sell it well then it's still been useful for them. If they gift to someone else then it'll eventually find a home to someone that needs the items.
---
Thats the worst part about it. The scrap box is such a huge quality of life improvement that you almost can't enjoy playing without it once you hit the endgame.
---
Anyone else having trouble claiming it? I feel like I’m just being an idiot but I can’t seem to find a mural option in the shop that doesn’t cost atoms
---
That's what people keep saying. I'm going to try it myself but couldn't for today's daily since I had limited time tonight.
---
Same. Level 108.
---
I completly agree
---
The daily and weekly challenges aren't hard at all. You could knock them out in an hour or two. I was excited for the ammo converter till I actually tried using it...
---
Have you got fusion cores?
---
I get this occasionally and the only way I fix it is to respawn far away from my death location.
---
Common here in WV as well. Pocahontas County and the CASS Scenic Railroad comes to mind.
---
sonofarobot-kiwi australian if anyone wants to adopt one to play with on pc..
---
What about all the hacked guns? I'm seeing multiple a day now; before it was just lots of duped explosive gatling plasmas. Now it's beam splitters on handmades, 50cals shooting like an splitter explosive gatling plasma on crack...
---
I report them. No shame. Doubt it does anything, but it's all I can do.
---
I agree. One of my most disappointing parts of loading up that game for the first time in 2020...fucking pipboy screen from 2008. And what was worse is the mess of a “skilltree” UI...
---
Folks are having a lot of trouble with SCORE dailies autocompleting and not awarding points. I’m pretty casual so I’m not too worried about not making it lvl 100.
---
Had the same thing happen to me for the first time yesterday. I was afk doing something for my kids come back and some dbag is blowing the crap out of my camp so I messaged him asking why. Are my prices too high? Does Ally wearing nothing but a nurse hat and prisoner collar offend your sensibilities? Nope! he replied " because it's fun" that's it. Fucking wow people. Don't be that guy everyone...please?
---
Knowing Bethesda I wouldn’t be surprised...
---
...possibly broken.
---
Of course. I usually carry 30 fusion cores, with the energy ammo perk card
---
Got it twice this week -- it appeared and then reset if you did or didn't complete it. So free 1000 score.
---
i dont mean to call you an idiot, but the suit does have a core in it right?
---
I just traded to acquire the plan so though I don't have a spare plan to offer as I learned it I can offer to build one in your camp on xbox. I mostly wanted it for the door
---
I do silos quite a lot and only noticed yesterday how low the XP from the bots is. It definitely should be a lot higher!
---
Well done, Sir. You have won Appalachia!
---
Haven’t missed any dailies yet and I’m nearly to rank 23! Overall I’m enjoying it, but I’m already feeling some fatigue as the grind slows down and I hope that they can add some interesting new challenges. I will also say that I love the public teams feature and I’ve done more events in the last week than in the last 18 months.
---
man i’m at 16 and haven’t looked at my challenges at all. have a feeling some got bugged. Id be happy with just the white captain cosmos PA
---
The season been out for a week and I'm already at rank 35 so it is not this impossible task to complete 100 ranks like people trying to say it is.
---
But who has to actually write the code for the emotes? The same people who write the rest of the code. There’s cosmetics, which are that. But this is a whole new animation which obviously requires coding.
---
It does have a cool door! Found it while messing around, lol.
---
Bruh
---
Oddly specific, but... go on...
---
seems like everyone's got this bug happened, so do I.
---
I lost ~6000points because of this.
---
I think you guys should hire more debuggers!
---
Why don't they just give us the points and not make us have to do anything cos it's so hard?  
---
/s
---
Yes PA has core in it. I carry at minimum 20
---
Do you have other AP regen effects? I expect they don't stack additively, so multiple effects will diminish the apparent effect of each other.
---
It doesn't work on Gold Bullion items. It'll play the sound but not actually duplicate (playing the sound is the bug here)
---
Extremely quick and overly easy to do. Did most of the weeklies in like 30mins, but personally don’t really care too much for any of the rewards as the amount of GB, cap, and scrip you get from it are trash. Most of the skins are buggy and have a lot of clipping (look at the bow skin 2nd picture, yikes).
---
Wish they were going for a better ttp ratio. Not just on 30-45min a day then get off until the next day.
---
You mean the developers right? Because i’ve played mmo’s and if you wanna grind legendaries or faction rep, you can. As much as you want.
---
Well I get to play...like a lot but I don't use everything in the freaking game to increase my xp. And I'm at like 25 at the start of week two. If the season is 4 weeks long and each level takes more score points then there is no way I'm going to reach 100 by the end at this rate. But there are going to be double XP and double score weekends so hopefully I will get close. But other than the ammo converter and a handmade skin I really dont want anything so it's just a matter of saying I was able to that would be nice lol
---
It has never changed the damage numbers. I'd rate THAT as a bug but previous testing indicated it DID actually work (here's a big bug that's been here since they added damage numbers: They aren't even CLOSE to real. they're client side predictive, and poorly done at that).
---
There's reports that it's also ACTUALLY not working post-wastelanders. I haven't investigated myself.
---
This. There's something else that behaves the same way but I can't remember what right now :P
---
Looks weird as hell next to my pond but wtfe all the crafting stations fit in there
---
well i was about to try this but now nothing shows up on the terminal. luv this game!!11!111!
---
I welcome it lol. I want to see some of these out in the wild besides just my own place
---
OP is RIGHT
---
There is a bug, somewhere
---
I did several events today, some of which require you to run (Lode Baring, Uranium Fever...) and sometimes I can run, othertimes im walking.. even while pressing RUN key
---
Underweight in carrying cap,  100+ Fusiuon cores, does not matter..
---
Very annoying BUG
---
Regards
---
JM
---
PS make sit very hard to do events with limited poeple... Fix it Beth !
---
And again and again
---
Glad it's not just a one-off thing.
---
I moved more often in the first year to be closer to my quests. Now, I move every couple of months just to have something to do besides actually play the game. It is my manly dollhouse game then.
---
He's pretty cool but with the odd shape and the singing and dancing, I don't think I could handle multiples in camp.
---
It's the same thing as the craft bag from ESO, quite frankly. Similar ideas. Similar concepts. And evidently, their servers can support that? At least, support the scrap box? So they've made some changes server-side to enable that. It isn't impossible for them to up the limit or make positive changes to support players. To be honest, the only people that don't want the bags to change are people who take advantage of it. PvP in this game is inherently imbalanced as a nature of the engine it was developed in and thusly it's not really the best in any environment not specifically designed for it. You can argue that NW is fine for what it is, but PvP in adventure mode will always be with issues. And losing all of your junk to a player who just is an opportunist douchebag because he saw you die infront of him is just as scummy.
---
They aren't even offering 150 Atoms as compensation in order to be able to buy up a rank in lieu of the autocompleted SCORE challenges?
---
Same haha
---
I think it's a cool idea. I jetpacked up there myself earlier and walked the rail trying to come up with a similar idea. My only worry is spawning at the bottom.
---
You have no clue about coding and animation, do you?
---
I am halfway done 
---
*cries*
---
He was a dick. I’m sorry about your camp. Approach your mobile campsite device and it’ll prompt you to either press square to build or triangle to repair all structures.
---
[reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15HTd4Um1m4)
---
Suppose I can just make 2 identical handmades, one with a reflex sight and one with a recon scope then just use the previous weapon hot key.
---
Public teams count as groups so it won't work, it's why herd mentality does work.
---
I feared that as well, but after I built the camp, my spawn points changed. The only time I appear on the ground is sometimes when I first join a world. The camp sometimes takes a while to load
---
Rank 27 to 28 here
---
If food didn't rot so fast I would be all over the place gathering ingredients to cook and sell.
---
Your medal is in the mail. 
---
Asshole
---
Dogmeat or bust!
---
🤣
---
I wanna see3eeeee333eeeeee
---
Scrip
---
You can grind at ohio River adventure. I spent well over 50+ hours server hoping and killing mirelurks to max my rep. It was gross
---
I believe there’s an exploit or glitch people are doing. That’s how they are further along.
---
I’m rank 23, done most of the dailies and all last weeks and half of this weeks weeklies, just for a point of reference.
---
The season is 10 weeks, i think
---
I'm on xbox, if you provide the mats I can make you serums
---
I have been completing the daily challenges and doing it repeatable everyday and I'm level 20
---
lol I wasn't upset, just raised an eyebrow when the purifers started exploding out of nowhere XD
---
I started building a generator shed whenever I moved, keeps things so tidy.
---
How hard would it be to have every currency reset timed around when the new daily quests drop? Every day, the game refreshes across the board.
---
Ah darn i want to get up on the ranks but i dont really want to use any exploits because i dont want to be bot in the rear in the future when i was still playing gta alot there was alot of worry and people upset because rockstar was banning their accounts and whatnot for doing a casino glitch
---
maybe just for people with obscene vendor prices, wasteland justice
---
The people who are insanely high are either no lifing(?) it and farming high exp areas over and over or using glitches/bugs to boost themselves up. If you have limited time to play knock out the weeklies first as even they are normally extremely quick and easy, then work on dailies with remaining time you have.
---
If you don’t play NW, don’t worry about those if they are out of your comfort zone. Easiest one is place your camp 3 times. Just spawn on the edge, place it 3 times then just die.
---
Ive been doing those minus the Nuclear Winter ones but im not really worried about those ones
---
I think it's good as an experiment.  I'm at 24? and feel like I'm not gonna be able to finish it out.  I have to atoms to cover it, but it's more a pride thing and I don't have the time to worry about it this far out.  I love this game, but it can't be my 2nd job.  Double score weekends should help.
---
They snap to the robot, have you tried that?
---
It does same with NW.
---
I made a lengthy rant earliest but it was too edgy and angry to actually post here. This is unacceptable. How many icon and UI mods exist out there? I'm sure a single modder overhauled the whole thing once... Bethesda couldn't be arsed to do something like this?
---
Actually, there is a point in using the normal 10mm smg and .45 smg, so much so that I consistently carry them around. The .45 Smg only really gains a purpose when the FFR legendary is applied, but the 10mm SMG has high base damage, good fire rate, and fast reload time.
---
Both weapons are underrated in general.
---
The .45 smg used to be a PvP monster as the FFR legendary effect on that weapon grants extra fire rate (more than 25 percent) and buffs it past the point of most other commando weapons, as well as having small AP cost and a massive mag.
---
The 10mm was much similar to the .45 but was for a more blitz heavy playstyle.
---
I use both weapons consistently and the both see good use and clean house. I actually like the low mod list because I can mod them easily for both me and my friends.
---
agree with the event part, I feel like I’ll get decimated as soon as the event ends and I see the “Attacking” pop-up.
---
Luckily they don’t really attack and neither do I, but I do get a mini heart attack when that pop-up comes on.
---
Someone needs to enhance their calm!
---
You can try to stack different XP buffs like sleeping,eating specific type of food,opening the new lunch boxes and grinding out XP allowing you to repeat the 10,000 XP for 100 score
---
Yah, I have no idea why Fallout is being extremely slow with certain items that differ from others. I hope it’s on Bethesda’s end that they can fix it eventually, because I really don’t want to be stuck with me having to deal with 2 minute wait times until my item places or if I want to scrap a wall or item in my camp.
---
Does commando boost SMGs? I thought there was a different one for that...
---
Does dying reset it to where you had your camp last ?
---
I wish I could, lol
---
This would be awesome it’s a little thing but would give us a little something to up our building game.
---
Lol right! I sell everything under what the game says to. Like ultracite pa plans for 5 caps
---
[https://youtu.be/XQ7z57qrZU8](https://youtu.be/XQ7z57qrZU8)
---
I'm English &amp; I agree with you 
---
At best schooling someone from another country about their own country &amp; culture is bloody rude &amp; patronising
---
At worst it reeks of an imperialist attitude &amp; is borderline racist
---
I recommended doing a nuclear winter ones most days because they're pretty simple like today is deploy camp three times and you can do that as soon as you load in and there's no cooldown or anything to grab that just do it you're done like 3 minutes
---
I just got 19 today after having done most of the dailies, all of last week's weekly, and one of this week's.
---
You'll get there. If I'm almost 1/5 done in the first week and I'm really half-assing it, you'll be fine.
---
There will be double score events and opportunities coming up, too.
---
Let it all out, buddy.
---
Click under the “Free” tab at the top
---
Right. I shouldn’t have to mod a Triple AAA for Quality of Life improvements. No one should.
---
I mean in NW, placing your camp in NW doesn’t bother your adventure mode camp at all.
---
This English girl agrees with you, it is bloody patronising &amp; unnecessary
---
Oh well that ine does sound pretty easy
---
Ditto. I burned out hard on ESO( yet another new indrik this month...). I played that game 2 to 6 hours a day for 2 years straight. Grinding for those asthmatic gazelles ruined it for me until winter, I'm betting.
---
I haven't been playing this long enough to let myself get sick of it yet.
---
So many team bonuses depending on your perks and mutations, I've not used lone wanderer since early last year.
---
Herd Mentality. Empath. Strange in Numbers. That 15% XP perk. 
---
Now with the PTeams benefits (you get caps for teammates completing quests.... extra free fast travel points...) it's just that much more.
---
Thats a pretty good idea is there any specific buug stuff you use ?
---
Oh wow okay well that adds on a whole new thing that can help alot
---
I had a session where everything exploded, not just robots. And I've had times where my melee weapon chops up the enemy into pieces.
---
I do like when I have the confetti perk and everything explodes in confetti.
---
I have an AA/25/25 .45 Submachine gun. Thing murders mobs, and bosses. It used to murder players before they broke the Vats PvP damage. 
---
Very good weapon. Needs more recognition tbh
---
Even "altruism" is inherently selfish.
---
😭
---
No
---
It takes like 2 minutes to make a new character and run out the vault, which would Ding you level 2...
---
That's been happening with me with the magazines challenge too. Very frustrating.
---
If he wants to educate simpletons he should start with Castro's lovechild aka the Canadian Prime Minister. Maybe explain why it is not a good look to appear in blackface more than your natural skin tone
---
I can’t remember at all where i got mine but if you’re on PS4 i can build it for you. I don’t get off work for another 4-1/2 hours though. :(
---
Yeah, Bethesda’s ban wave is hard to predict, I wouldn’t advise using the exploit, tbh, rank 30 something is the last thing I actually want, it’s a ghillie skin for a hunting rifle, after that, anything else is a bonus.
---
There is a double score weekend on the horizon, that will allow you to catch up 3-4days of missed daily’s. I hope the rewards for the next season are better, I find these ones abit meh. I’m not too fussed if I don’t get them all.
---
There there
---
I’m on Xbox
---
 Nukes can just be for fun, I was almost finished with launch prep and a dude runs in and tries to launch just as it finished and he wasn’t able to for whatever reason so I dropped the nuke on his camp, I had people voice chatting that was hilarious as we killed what little their was in the area and farming flora.
---
Only really want the vendor and the train car.....dirty wrong-uns gonna make me buy the big pack.
---
 double score thats gonna be awesome! That would help out alot
---
These are the same types of people who refuse to wear masks during COVID.
---
Anything that even SLIGHTLY inconveniences them is unacceptable.
---
Doesn’t always work but I can be handy.
---
Unfortunate. We need cross platform compatibility.
---
What train car?
---
Unfortunately, workshops are PVP areas. The only PvP area, as far as I know. You should have anticipated this. Always stow your junk in stash.
---
That being said, I don't think Fallout 76 should have any PvP. Fallout has always been an RPG game. Some may call it a FPS but with VATS it isn't. VATS was the transition from turn based RPG FO2 to action RPG FO3.
---
There are so many PvP FPS games out there Fallout 76 should not jump in that crowded pool.
---
Prolly not supposed to do this but are you in any 9fbthe 76 discord? Shoot this name is my psn too
---
Yeah some of the rewards im not to worried about its mainly the camp cosmetics that i want im not to worried about the power armor because i mainly stick with one type anyway
---
Sorry for my tacky typos, i suck at the keyboard while I'm drinking
---
Have you tried not using vats?
---
Love the outfit, mask is ok, works better with the recent flight helmet imo.
---
I'm level 19 in a week. I'd like to finish but if I don't, I don't. It's not the end of the world.
---
The "good" thing is, I'm laid off till at least 9/8, and everything is closed or cancelled... I've got some time on my hands. I won't be able to do the same for the next Season...
---
Seems to be the same.
---
Not a trading sub.
---
If I understand the situation as you described it, you legitimately killed a player character that was spawn camping. He had the nerve to get upset with you? The world must be so nice for someone that self centered.
---
Dear Canadian
---
If you want to school someone, try looking in a mirror &amp; explaining to yourself why patronisingly assuming that people from another country are so backward they need you to explain their own culture to them is arrogant, imperialist &amp; xenophobic.
---
P.S I visited Canada, it was lovely. Canadians were lovely, you do not seem representative of the majority. Also is your PM still getting about in blackface?
---
Ha ha ha this is great.....but I'm getting PTSD flashbacks of staying up all day/night hoping for a Raven making and only getting the Sun mask 40,000 times....
---
Wait can you elaborate please?
---
Not the bug you're referring to but I got one the other day while trying to exit my Power armor. I got the  "You cannot exit your Power armor here" message no matter where I was. I logged out and back in and that fixed it, not sure what caused it though.
---
Yeah, I don’t like the look of the new PA skins, the dark cosmos one is nice, but not bothered if I get it or not.
---
I really hope the next one is BoS themed though, tie it into the new content being dropped
---
I always keep 5 kits in reserve for emergencies. Anything more than that, gets used anytime something breaks in the field.
---
True i want more responder stuff honestly thays what would make me go crazy lol
---
Yes you do there's one in Copenhagen
---
Thats pretty cheap and I'm sure you can find someone to take you up on that over at r/market76. Don't forget to say what platform your on.
---
If you Google ohio River adventure rep glitch you'll find info on it
---
It prevents airborne disease? It should really specify that I didn't put it on because I thought it didn't have that feature.
---
Can I ask how you got started? I can't find a spot to place anything other than the camp kit itself.
---
Would love this. Forgot to swap some stuff off during Uranium Fever a whole back and one shot a legendary before anyone could tag. I felt so, so bad. Guy turned around at me and I just fixed my loadout and stared at the ground in shame.
---
I hate players like that. It's a game stop taking it so seriously!
---
i shall do that, is it for raiders rep?
---
I’d love a diner set, like the ones in game at Watoga and Bog Town. They already have doors for it in game so why not the rest?
---
Yeah, expand on all the stuff for the current factions would be nice
---
No, but I can join. Which discord?
---
ily
---
64 currently.  Did day 1 and then took a few days away before coming back and starting the hard grind.  Aside a few video chats with the SO, bio, and working out a bit this is all I do with the day.
---
The lumber camp NE of Rose usually has 3.
---
Finally something better than the toddler's vomit armor skins.
---
I'll warn you it is painfully slow though. It took me a ton of time to max my rep
---
The same happened to me. Maybe it should have an amount. Not too high, so low level characters can do it but a reasonable amount to make a difference. OR maybe just buy from 5 different players. So even if it is 1 bullet per purchase it is getting people to vendors where they might be enticed to buy more.
---
Was a limited atom bundle promo. No idea if itll ever pop in the atom shop.
---
Leave the sea wookies alone.
---
Now that was the tricky part. After placing the camp at the top I went into the circular part and started throwing down carpets. You can't build floors up there, but carpets are the next best thing.
---
Sea monkeys  
---
Bush wookies.
---
You will be surprised what you can build on carpets.
---
I am 64 currently.  Did day 1 and then took several off before starting the grind.  Aside some video chats with the SO, bio, and working out this is all I do.  59 felt like the first noticeable area for some reason where progress slowed down.
---
Try not to pick a popular one otherwise you’ll have the issue i had before i finally moved mine. I got tired of it taking 6-7 tries to load into a server. 
---
But a little advice, near train station are great for shops and hardly ever even spawn enemies, and when they do they’re low level. 
---
Fuck white springs. Every server I’m has two or three there and I’m not going to go to your camp if my frames drop to 2. 
---
There’s a really cool campsite waaaaay north of the map with no marker top left above vault 79, you’ll see the trees. I had a beautiful and well blended camp up there but it spawns high level super mutants, floaters, and wolves. I got tired of repairing half my camp every time i went out for a while. And yes, they can spawn inside your camp, that’s how they kept destroying my generator. 
---
Or also way up north but opposite side of the camp site are some really nice cliffs with good level grounds and an AMAZING view with no FPS drop while looking out at it. Just northwest of that blood eagles(?) camp above the whole grafting area. 
---
It just sucks for selling stuff since hardly anyone wants to go all the way up there. 
---
Best of luck on your search!
---
You could try and kill them with you winning personality?
---
Two is like 10%+ on your budget. 
---
I build bases frequently, even post them occasionally. I like to build huge and max the budget. If you are on Xbox I’m happy to share some tips to reduce your budget
---
You get them randomly during the match I believe, they should appear under effects just like adventure mode.
---
I'm in two different servers, the Volunteers Guild and FO76 Settlements official
---
Wierd, I haven't had that happen yet but if it does, I know how to fix now. Thanks
---
People on ps4 and Xbox dont have that and not everyone can hear me with a mic
---
Hit 21 tonight, which really surprised me considering I work full time and can only play on the weekends and a couple hours during the week. Joining event and hunting groups helps a lot.
---
That's so cool
---
Err, bad breath, colourful language, feather duster... what do you think?
---
I would like to think many Americans know this but one can't be certain these days.
---
They are still around in the NE of the USA. But have been going the way of the drive-in movie.
---
Same card (Sapphire RX 5700 XT Pulse), got a bit higher FPS when I run it at 1800p and 2160p compared to 1080p and 1440p, on the latter the GPU usage is only around 40-50%, at the higher res its around 70-99%.
---
Because many of the posts here are "what does a train cart even have to do with a diner theme?", so I guess that's what op is arguing against.
---
I get that. But they could keep the max cap limit a player can hold while doigg away with the other limits, I think.
---
Ah well, it's never gonna happen anyway, so this is all moot.
---
Add ceiling skins while you’re at it
---
I've heard it both ways.
---
That sounds cool. However as a customer seeing a camp with a vending machine I would steer clear of any camp that was built on top of a monorail or senneca rocks etc fearing a trap and an untimely fall to my death.

---
Indeed. Especially since not all players would have the Ghillie skins (some might come after the Legendary Run is over, etc) it would be imbalanced.
---
THANK YOU SIR
---
I did 2 days ago... The thing that put me over was the Scrapbox. I actually got the game 2x and made a mule that also acted as a teammate that I just have sit on my camp. Then both their Stashes filled up.
---
Then Monday night I bought a year's worth of FO1st. Was almost second guessing my purchase till I logged in today. I'm using the bathroom with the ranger outfit atm.
---
That does sound awesome I got excited when it first explored that place thinking I really might be able to change the weather. Sadly not.
---
I love the bad weather in fallout and wished it lasted longer. I used to love the old GTA games and the cheat codes you could put in for extreme weather.
---
No chance of stopping it in affraid
---
I haven’t tried it personally but I came across this video from this channel on YouTube InnovSurvivalist where she explains how to play with double XP everyday you should check the video she goes into detail on how to activate the bonuses
---
Only thing your friend can do is sever hop
---
Get them to log out before it hits.
---
What are the magic weapon effects that work?
---
Also the no loot drop for this event needs an extension of a minute after completion because of the delayed corpse explosions - lost my junk two times to that shit and asshole players.
---
If you store and place your brahmin pen, you can milk your cow every time it is placed.

---
Everything they tried to do with this game simply failed. I really had hopes for this season but it's ANOTHER time-gated bullshit. Just like yourself, i can't play everyday but i do get some weekends when i can spend 6-10 hours but that won't help.
---
  For 1.5 years i've been asking myself the same thing. Why is it like this? They never seem to change.
---
What are the magic weapon effects that work? Also, you still got that shotgun? I'm on PC.
---
It's how basically every other online game with dailies operates, and rollover time is usually very early morning so that it doesn't rest during most players playtime (sorry third shift workers).  It baffles me why they thought having different timers for different currencies and quests and what not was a smart idea.
---
I don't, I do what's fun for me to do. I'm not going to turn the game into a fucking job and then whine about it like 75% of the people on here. I don't have to have everything day one. I can wait like a big boy.
---
You can go in with them and shoot them I believe
---
Boom
---
I'd like to see some snow in the game at some point, even if it's just as a christmas gimmick.
---
We know the game engine is capable of snow weather effects and having it land on surfaces and such, because that's what it did in Skyrim.
---
It would be totally awesome if we could build SAM turrets (like at Fort Defiance) at our camps and shoot down incoming nukes. 🤔
---
Only 76 would get better running at 4k as apposed to 2k, haha
---
When the Brotherhood of Steel arrives then we might be able to control the weather in the Atlas observatory
---
I would rather pay $30 for a DLC, but that's just me. Remember Nuka-World and Far Harbor DLC ? With the same amount of money we got great content + lots of skins. Now we can only buy skins .
---
I haven’t played until a few weeks ago since after launch because there was nothing TO do. Now there’s shit to do but it takes an absurd amount of time to accomplish.
---
I mean let's be honest here, us Aussie's are well versed in the ways of the apocalypse.
---
Wholesome story, nice to hear people finding good friends in the community 🤗
---
It did that to me twice in a row. You have to dashboard and start the quest over, it sucks.
---
If it's one big piece, it will blueprint it automatically when you move your camp. I've done it plenty of times. (My camp is basically max budget)
---
 Only the stuff you place outside probably like water purifiers and such won't be included in the blueprint. Thus, i designed my camp to be very portable when moving.
---
Can't find the discord :(
---
Gotta love em !!
---
That is fair, fortunately I am a kind soul, lol
---
No thanks, I just want my character to stay 100% human no matter what it gives.
---
Wow, I didn't know there was so much to do and so much XP to be had inside the vault - TIL.
---
You don't get burned out feeling forced to play a game an hour every day to keep up?
---
Laughed so hard.
---
Do they stay? Or do you start fresh every match?
---
"One 'Sorry' emote? Why that will be 500 atoms please."
---
Had a guy today jump in front of my minigun after the event surface to air.  Lost my junk because I was still trying to kill the scorchbeast still attacking.  Messaged him and he responds with I need caps and left.  Just wish there was a way not to start a pvp fight.
---

---
It’s because you’re whining about what they said they’re fixing and on top of that people gave a reason (though not official) fits it well
---
I hope that poor developer gets his legs back someday.
---
I have been slowly working on my collection of Serum recipes. Every time I get over 20k I go and buy another one. I've only been working on it since they opened up Player Vending again and I already have half the recipes. I don't know what I am going to buy when I have all the serums.
---
The Volunteers Guild is a more exclusive group and i cannot invite anyone as today is my first day in. They usually deal in Help all sorts especially trades.
---
I think they reset after each match, I only play NW for the Dailies so I may be wrong
---
Love it. Also most people in the thread were -1 so I upvoted everyone. Don’t thank me just have a fucked day.
---
I joined the settlement discord  but I don't have permission to post...
---
you will lost favor with whatever one you don't choose, so you will still have to grind some rep afterwards
---
You could just let the jukebox do the work in One Violent Night and farm the XP...
---
Killed it tonight along with 8 friends. Zero plans. 1 3* (boxing glove lol), the rest was 1* garbage. Super long fight, fun, but disappointing.
---
Double xp would definitly help with the repeatable lol
---
There you go! Definitely *will* look at it.lol.
---
he couldn’t just get the caps from the event lmao
---
I wish you could start pvp when both parties melee each other and a timer counts them down, like dueling in borderlands
---
Or have public teams that are mainly for pvp, possibly fight in their own team or fight against faction teams. 
---
Pacifists shouldn’t be able to engage pvp at all or get the “attacking” pop-up at least
---
Because you'll stay for longer and increase a chance of buying Atoms / f1st.
---
Think from monetization point of view, not from players enjoyment.
---
It's worth noting that Fallout 1st members have a discount Starlet Sniper Skin for the lever action.
---
Only if Bethesda is the first to use it.
---
Are dog helmets in this yet? I dont believe so but may be way off.
---
Yeah I've noticed this too with 85+% chance to hit in vats and I miss just thought it was bad luck.
---
Quad doesn't really work with the assaultron head. Because bugs.
---
The assaultron head barely works as it is, when you overcharge it beyond it's base 5 capacity it really bugs out and just flat out does not work.
---
That's cool, is that a legendary perk?
---
I disagree, but you're right in that Bethesda probably wouldn't risk being interpreted that way
---
I swear they used to do this but now it doesn’t work
---
It wouldn’t bother me so much if it was leveled. As it stands I have a cool looking PA helmet that I won’t use because it’s only level 15 and vastly inferior to what I have already.
---
&gt; a bunch of level 140+ players waltz in and start insta killing every enemy before we can even tag them. 
---
I can't   understand why anyone who is that level bothers with that damn event.  
---
Most common answers are "I'm farming scrip" or "farming weapons for low level  alt." 
---
Just use your goddamn alt to farm uranium fever if your alt needs weapons.  As for scrip farming, I routinely have more weapons than I can scrip without ever doing Uranium fever. 
---
I am well past level 400 and I never even bother with Uranium fever.  
---
That's because I run challenging events made for high level players- events like project paradise, radiation rumble, and AWOL armaments and scorched earth.  And I farm the burrows, west tek and Charleston capital building.   
---
That stuff not only provides stuff for scrip, but occasionally drops stuff that is useful to a high level player.  Uranium fever is a bunch of level 40 shit.
---
Look up the Flamingo Unit guide. Helps a lot with deciding what to include and what not to include.
---
For example, I love lights but lately I've been just adding more windows and going without.
---
You need to do the verification im utec_The_Hero 8142
---
Settler Mechanic Outfit goes well too.
---
Holy shit Rank 35!!!
---
You use to be able to get them from the dogs at a Queen fight
---
NW challenges are way easier than earning the same SCORE from XP.  
---
I quite like NW but if you really don't want to PvP then just spawn in a quiet edge of the map and be as sneaky as possible while moving.  Only move when you have to.  This behavior is called 'bush wookee' for a reason.  Someone hiding in a bush can have a whole squad run past them and not be noticed.  You'll be burnt to a crisp or out-gunned eventually using this approach but you will complete your challenges.
---
I like the he idea of melee each other. That could be a fix
---
Probably because balance reasons.
---
Oh dam... i see what you mean! I just do what the quest marker tells me :P
---
Pretty sure it's Cobalt flux but yeah, very ammo efficient.
---
Yeah, the perk system has a learning curve. It does allow for adaptation of your build to fit certain situations. You will end up temporarily swaping out for a pick lock or computer hack when needed. 
---
Perks do have a minimum level. **You can Tab back to exit the selected SPECIAL. So you can explore all the perk cards available to you at your level. **
---
Up to level 50 each perk you select also raises the associated SPECIAL. After 50 you can move one SPECIAL point instead of picking a perk each level.
---
Every 5 levels (I think) you can open a pack of cards. This just gives you more random cards in your deck without spending a level point to pick them.
---
Create your own team. You can get bonuses with just yourself in it. Anyone joining and staying long enough to bond is extra multipliers of the bonuses. 
---
Events teams for example you start with a +25% xp with just you on the team for events. If you have a full team the bonus is 100%. 
---
Doing SBQ last night I had very well rested bonus 100% canned meat stew 5% and a full events team another 100% and I popped a lunchbox that gave another bonus. And there was another effect +10 or so. And that’s just scratching the surface of what I COULD have stacked with just using the in game options available of chems cards and food. 
---
I’m at 22 or 23 right now. Ignored a few NW ones. This is more than doable if you just look at what’s IN the game and use the system before you. 
---
I think sometimes there’s soooo much to read look at and keep track of that we all forget what’s available.
---
If that happens they should raise server cap to double too or even triple if they throw pc in there too.
---
Me too, but it can be considered trolling.
---
Been playing since the beta had no idea lol.
---
Dog helmets were removed from the game with wastelanders, and where one used to spawn now you get a random bandana. Must've still been in the guy's vendor and he never removed it.
---
I think it has to do with being stuck in aim animation. Sometimes after aiming down sights in PA I move slow like I'm still aiming when I'm not.
---
Bashing, switching weapons, or reloading gets me out of it sometimes.
---
Moved again today to the southern spot with the lead up top and acid cave. I like building a big lookout tower overlooking the fissure site and it has a cool rock arch so I put my new train car up there
---
Because this is BGS way of making players come back every day. It is done poorly but that is the reason.
---
Why? Because the average daily logins is a typical objective parameter used by many online gaming companies to rate the succes and viability of a game. Aside the normal financial numbers to show to shareholders, this is one of the other parameters companies can show their shareholders to evaluate the succes of the game.
---
Good to know, what would be the ideal charisma perk to replace it with when in a team?
---
Okay, they remove FO1st, and then the Atom Store isn't enough to support the game pay the staff and yield enough if a profit to make it worth it. So it's either shut down, or a mandatory subscription model is imposed.
---
Choose.
---
I think that would just cause more issues. FR drop is already bad in some spots, imagine how bad it would get when there’s 3 times as many people shooting at the queen and having to spawn the proportioned amount of enemies too. I’m fine with the amount, honestly.
---
Terrible interface, simply needs a list of ammo you select fornimlut and output, it displays the exchange rate and you you dump the ammo in, how hard is that?
---
Honestly yeah. Everything about the way Bethesda handled FO1st was extremely scummy. 
---
They saw a decently loyal fanbase sticking with the game after all the negative reception and decided to charge them a ridiculous fee to make the game more enjoyable.
---
And laugh
---
if you have a ultracite gatling laser with a "magic" effect, 
---
as long as you dont use the slow barrels,
---
it should work 👍🏼
---
in ESO your craft bag is also accessible to all toons and not toon specific. personally I can't play ESO without craft bag and after trying a month with fo1st I'm nearing that point too.
---
Yeah
---
What system you on? I’ll buy it from you if On Xbox. I always wanted to try a quad one of those to see what it did.
---
So it doesn’t need 200 fire rate ?
---
LulZ So RanDoM :)
---
This is the kind of simping a bot would think was legitimate praise.
---
People have already glitched 100. No idea what happens though sorry.
---
If you didnt know this ,your not a real American 😎🇺🇸
---
This aquaboy afk thing can easily be countered.
---
Only Morgantown has bigger water area so in Flatwood it has barely any use.
---
When you see one ( go out of the water if you are in) start shooting them. Water will not protect them and while swimming they cannot shoot at all.
---
no the 200 fire rate is just a rule of thumb,
---
i had an anti armor vats hit chance ultracite gatling laser and it did work 👍🏼
---
Usually between a few minutes to maybe a couple of hours
---
Do the SBQ fight as much as possible, I’m drowning in improved repair kits so I never have to use materials to fix my weapons or armor
---
The asylum has military bags.
---
Show offs never like to be shown up...
---
also i just saw your gatling laser has the twoshot effect, so your hitting the enemie twice as often anyways so youre definitely fine
---
That’s irritating, I’m only at level 18 and pretty much dont do anything  besides work, sleep and fallout 76.
---
Servers will randomly go down for general maint, not just patches and/or fixes.
---
It resets every 20 irl hours after you buy something. This is also the game for script machine and gold buillon machine.
---
A good routine is to set a timer on your phone, but/sell something and then continue you gameplay, coming back when you need to as your daily timer will reset from 20 hours of your first interaction with vendors.
---
XB1 / NrdNParadise / Building - interested in gaining XP... more of a solo player most of the time. Friend me if interested.
---
Check in 20 minutes
---
My brahmin hates me, and kicks me every time I do that.
---
Field surgeon and born survivor are also a bit wonky probably due to server lag. 
---
I've had it happen a few times that I am downed and then my perks kick in, giving me full health while downed. 
---
This is only a problem for me at encryptid but still annoying.
---
I need some damn fine perfectly preserved pie.
---
Thanks mate, appreciate ur help 😁 I’ll be sure to try it out on the queen
---
Holy shit never thought of that.
---
Haven't been there yet on my alt but thanks.
---
+karma
---
I disagree. The locking of quest items is a proven tactic learned since gaming started. It is a good thing. NOW, once the quest is done, the item should lose the lock and be a trash item.
---
The whole "mystery" ensemble requirement that you have one in your inventory forever, is just wrong.
---
No there keeping foodspoilage. Kind of odd because some things spoil and other things don’t. Granted anyhing with a buff spoils.
---
Haha drowning thanks I'm close to 50, just three more levels
---
but make sure to do it on a private server, i dont think youre melting her too fast but just in case dont ruin the experience for others 😁
---
have fun with it :) 👍🏼
---
My experience:
---
\- I cannot enter VATS if the sight is blocked by any natural NPC or player. Also object that you can shoot through can block VATS like fences.
---
\- I started in wastelanders. Robots (mostly gutsies) which can explode a lot of time will explode without any warning (no visual or audio sign for the explosion). I know there should be a heating visual effect with a whirring up loud noise, but nothing instead. So If I kill a legendary robot and it is close I rush and loot then run away or I wait 20 seconds. Unfortunately after explosion there is a chance the body will disappear.
---
It worked for me to place the vendor first, then snap the counter to it. 
---
So you might have to place some counters out to where you want the vendor to be, remove the counters, place the vendor where it would go, then snap the counters back. I use the floor tiles to help with measuring/aligning.
---
Though I didn't make this [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/edit?usp=drivesdk) I absolutely love it 😁.
---
I’m level 24 now and not really played loads.
---
I'm not saying that you have to keep it in your inventory. What I am saying is that it should at least have a pop-up saying that it's a unique one-time-only item and make you confirm that you want to get rid of it.
---
From atom shop sales to the fact that this is a full priced AAA game makes it hard for me to be sympathetic to their speculated financial issues.
---
Not saying remove the scrap box, but make it available for all, and make somthing else that appeals to those who want to pay a sub.
---
Wow you just described me in social interactions. (there's a reason I became a family hermit)
---
i only bothered to actively do the more simple challenges so far like eating 5 cooked meals for example,
---
on day one i reached rank 11 i think without any real grind
---
since than i ranked up like 6 times or so during standart gameplay 
---
so you really experience a big slowdown once youve done the weekly challenges but overall i think the progression is quite ballanced so that you rank up pretty consistently just by playing the game
---
i dont expect to finish the run 100% but i personally am fine with that as i dont really grind it 👍🏼
---
IRL you can buy a train cart without a restaurant coming with it. More expensive than digital ones though.
---
Also indoor walls so you can place wallpaper on both sides
---
I’m literally just doing a murder build. Base Damage is 50
---
Wait, hang on. You said preselected, does that mean I can apply them elsewhere?
---
Sounds like settler wanderer tent.
---
TbH i don't use them, because they take too much AP per shot in Vats. Rifles get a 50% cost reduction if you mod an automatic receiver on them. SMGs are automatic by default, but have the AP costs of a semi automatic rifle.
---
You are probably having a server shit down not a maintenance. Just hope worlds
---
If this works, you're my new hero
---
That'd make sense. Thanks!
---
And then there will be another bunch of whiny posts asking the the *next* thing to be free..
---
They are a business running a product, not a charity running a passion project. There's a freemium version if you don't want to pay for the scrap box, but if you want the premium features you will pay the premium price 🤷‍♂️ if not, you will move on and find something else to throw your money at.
---
Just like you only get one chem buff you only get one rest buff. But the time does vary.
---
A sleeping bag or cot (for example the 1st tent) gives one hour.
---
A bed gives two hours.
---
Having the hippie settler companion or a romanced companion will give three hours. If you sleep in a bed.
---
FYI, you can use the settler's own guitar chair to get the Well tuned buff. You don't need your own music chair.
---
Camp McClintock and Fort Defiance have the most, although in my experience Camp McClintock is often picked clean. All those military installations around the Cranberry Bog have 2 or 3 military ammo bags each, as well.
---
Bloodied makes everything good, even mr handy buzz blades.
---
Wait, really? Is there a source for this?
---
Just going to bury this comment here: My Gauss Shotgun is immortal. It takes NO damage AT ALL. Thousands of rounds put through it. Must be a bug so ssshhhhhh!
---
It does work, I have a cow launcher on top of my camp and I accidently milk it all the time.
---
FO1st Silver: Has First Rewards and Scrapbox
---
FO1st Gold: Everything plus Private Server and Atoms
---
600 lbs for regular players plus scrap box. 1000 lbs plus scrap box and a freezer or maybe a bigger camp budget or storage boxes separate from stash FO first people... plus they get the tent.
---
Any chance you have one for plans too?
---
You sent this straight to Bethesdas feedback Page right?
---
There should be no sorry in the wasteland....
---
It's a % chance to get milk. Idk what percentage, but you don't get milk every time.
---
Ooh thank you, I'll try that next time. As of now, I need a new controller due to rage lol
---
You can do this with a trick to place double walls. You do go through some of your camp limit though.
---
You can still get the repair kits even if you’re not level 50, I always see level 30s and 40s at the fight. It’s worth a shot even if you die a bunch it’s still fun
---
In case you didn't know, you can actually get cranberries in The Forest. You can find them at Aaronholt Homestead, up in the north-west corner, so that's not actually quite the best reasoning for their exclusion.
---
I think it's probably just because they're one of the most useful, less 'basic'/'normal' crops.
---
I still have locations to discover even though I can fast travel to them and have taken the workshops in a couple.
---
Content takes way longer to produce than you play through it. That little dungeon you ran through in 10 minutes? Took at least 2 weeks to make that. So Devs have to keep you busy, so they have enough time to produce new stuff.
---
Time zone? I always try to join building team but yeah, everybody usually up and leave within a short time. My time zone is HST. Gt Egaman69
---
The mutation only lasts for one match. Once you start a new match you have no mutations
---
This makes the previously amazing Gauss Shotgun really shit too. Before VATS broke it was aiming all bullets into target every time they were in range and now it's super random and does nothing a lot of the time with majority of the pellets flying nowhere near target even with crit activated.
---
It usually takes like 15 min or less to do the dailies...
---
You're not alone
---
Yeah, I have the opposite reaction to FOMO that devs want and it makes me actually stop caring about cosmetic rewards and thus quit playing the game if they're the only real reward structure. I get that it works for numbers, but it definitely makes the game worse.
---
Mmm if the train wagon can be destoyed with a flane trap,you can destroy it,build a foundation with a wall and then repait the wagon. If possible this is the only option.
---
Right but most games manage that problem by actually providing enough shit to do to fill your time. This is artificially filling my time in the cheapest way possible
---
I think people forget how much companies make selling the game itself
---
I’m not positive. I thought it said a shutdown for maintenance
---
It was on bethesda's roadmap. Look at the fall or winter update.
---
The SCORE system has been out for a whole 7 days, and people are complaining about being burnt out...
---
It seems if the game crashes when dailies are changing over u auto score without actually collecting the score points. It’s happened to me twice already!!
---
pretty sure he was American
---
The amount of EXP needed to level up in the higher levels is the same from level 100 to level 999.
---
Of course, it will be easier if you just cheese it with a fresh character, but with appropriate buffs it's not terribly hard.
---
Just try hoping.
---
Good idea to add time zone. I'm PDT, so 3 hrs ahead of you. Add me just in case though if you want. I'm always looking for a fully bonded building team.
---
This would be a good step forward.
---
Yep. Will add. Hope to see you in the wasteland bud👍
---
I just double-checked the roadmap and I'm not seeing what implies that.
---
https://youtu.be/hqe3MRb3StY
---
Pretty much this. It’s the sane thing in every game. TF2, for example. Nobody can be better than them or they’re cheating.
---
Thanks. I remember reading about Frog Legs and how OP it was. Is that still a thing?
---
Gotcha. Thanks.
---
Let me guess, your adding all these patches because  "it just works"
---
And so what? Do you think they'll use all that money and let their profit dwindle, rather than create a sustainable business model?
---
On the contrary, i think people forget that all the additional content since launch has been absolutely free, and after the initial purchase *you do not have to pay a cent unless you choose to**
---
Compare that to World of Warcraft;  
---
monthly subscription, paid dlc, microtransactions for cosmetics/pets/mounts/gold.

Don't need to go make it look like a bar to make use of the vendor and the bar pieces.

Brilliant thank you! I have no gold but take an upvote &amp; virtual donut instead! 👍🥯
---
Floater nades are 150 sold each? I found two in a box yesterday and immediately wasted them because I thought they were a new common grenade added with seasons.
---
Have a NUKED day....
---
Lunchbox effect.
---
My bad. I told you incorrect information about where to find it. It was in one of the YouTube videos I watched. He was talking about it. I can't remember his name at this moment. I will definitely get back to you.
---
Oh, yes. Noticing a small nod to another game in an obscure Easter egg is quirky and random. 
---
I’ve known about the chicken chasing a settler since Wastelanders came out, but never knew it was a nod to Skyrim. Even though I don’t care for that game, I still like finding out the meaning behind it.
---
I think the average is around 20 so you’re right there. There should be plenty of time to get to 100, I heard about a triple xp weekend but I haven’t seen any real news about it
---
Just tested it out and I’m in love with this weapon
---
Corpse, corps is a military thing :-)
---
It's basically the width of the seedy shed but twice as long. One side has a open doorframe and the others boarded up. The insides are empty to be expected. Imo the entire bundle isn't worth it just for the train. But it's interesting looking.
---
And I thought people on Fallout 76 were nice smh my head
---
This. When the Survivors challenge was going, I decided to finally take a shot at NW. Sometimes I’d actually play right, and I think I’m slowly getting better. PvP in this is a lot different than in TF2, which is my main PvP game. Anyway, one match I got to 2nd place, just by hiding in a bush.
---
That's all right. Let me know if you find out. :)
---
&gt; saying *it's* inclusion

Now quick, make up a different excuse for why your French+English phone is autocorrecting this contraction incorrectly!

Just posted a link for you :)
---
Don't even compare them to this game. Endless bug/glitch list.  If majority of them would be fixed I would subscribe, but as I stands I don't see myself spending $$ on a broken economy.
---
Luckily for me, I have two sets of armor with -50% fall damage. I can jump from the monorail elevator and not give a single care.
---
That’s great. I like that he kept you in mind one his travels. Very wholesome
---
For the most part everyone I've met on this game has been really cool. I'll be on tomorrow on Xbox same gt as on here I'll fix you up with some guns and ammo if you need just shoot me a message. Got tons of stuff for ya if you need it.
---
And therein lies the real truth:  
---
People are misdirecting their attention by making whiny posts about how much the scrap box costs, instead of the fact that Bethesda are releasing new Atom Store cosmetics and game content without fixing the bugs riddling the game. And not only that, but they are complaining about what you get with FO1st rather than
---
Hint hint: Please sell cheap plans for me, It's literally the only thing I buy from vendors.
---
unarmed power armor arms... 
---
it doesn't matter how much you try boosting damage or exploit it , still useless.
---
Thata whatbim really hopinh for is a weekend like that
---
Just...turn pacifist on? Nobody can PvP you outside of workshops with that? It’s already in the game and takes 5-10 seconds to do and takes less time than Bethesda coding something?
---
I could probably give it a shot then lol
---
Well now hang on, you don't know for sure that the Fireflies haven't established some sort of militaristic social structure as part of their mutation
---
Where at in black water mine? I’ve searched up and down there and didn’t find it.
---
I’m at rank 25 and don’t do the level up grind. If I level, then cool. This is more than easy to complete, and the people whining about the NW challenges are fools. Those things are so easy to do. Either place your camp down there times in the first 5 seconds of a match, or find a nice bush in the middle of the map and play a few rounds in the background while you watch YouTube or clean your kitchen or something. Easy stuff.
---
Thanks! That was an interesting read; I'm surprised I haven't come across it before. It does say that either being properly fed/watered will provide buffs or the foods/drinks themselves still will, so I wonder if spoilage will still be an issue? I'd certainly consider that part of the 'drudgery' though, and I definitely wouldn't be upset if it was removed. Although it'd make objects like the fridges and slow-spoilage bags useless, though, so I'm unsure.
---
Why did you censor "butt"? This is a mature game, therefore a mature subbreddit, words such as "Butt" aren't even censored on Primetime TV, let alone a community about a game where profanities are the norm
---
We should be able to stomp them or even kick across the map while in PA.
---
When you first walk in, go to the locker rooms on the right it should be on one of the shelves
---
Can we not have this every 10 mins...
---
Well ... there is one exploit I do believe in.
---
The radiation free nukezone Power Armor glitch.
---
It literally doesn't hurt anybody and gives me plenty of time to gather raw fluxes without having to worry popping rad away like an addict.
---
Also works wonders when trying to fight a stubborn wendigo colossus that refuses to leave the nukezone.
---
Sucks you can’t do one of the weekly challenges this week then, pal.
---
Ah 76 and crashing, I guess it's just going to be a game of chance, regarding whether or not the challenges bug out then...
---
Nice! I been trying to learn all the tricks for building so this helps greatly.
---
Predatory business practices in Bethesda game have become commonplace now.. People memed about the horse armor when it happened but it really was the start of the slippery slope.
---
I agree with you:  it is astronomically worse.   They are absolutely wrong.   I've been playing it over a year, &gt;1700 hours.
---
I am... lacking in the endurance category
---
That’s a lot of shaking your head. Be careful.
---
Yup sry, forgot to hide the first one
---
random.
---
YES
---
But directly when it ends is when it happens usually.
---
thats a result of Bethesda ignoring balancing or removing broken weapons. 
---
you can kill SBQ in few hits when you use broken weapons with hidden legendary effects or use tons of boosting with perks, drugs, Bheads, magazines, meals. OR you just meet cheater but I doubt that, its easier use broken game.
---
For the amount that drop in the world you are better off just learning the plans and crafting low level ones to scrap. The only static spawn is at Berkeley Springs in the Blood Eagle camp. Other than that Blood Eagles and Mothman cultists occasionally carry them.
---
It’s not there... even on my private world so no chance someone picked it up already.
---
Are you sure you’re not thinking of Emmett Mountain Disposal Site pre wastelanders? Because going in and to the right was where you found it there before, but it’s gone now after wastelanders. (Supposedly the level 50 variants are legacy now.)
---
Where do you find the plans/ get these lights?
---
Happened a lot with me on scorched earth, it's super annoying to lose your Flux...
---
I didn't think scrapping ones that don't have mods would give me mods.
---
I already have the plans for them so if that's the case then sweet, I'll do that!
---
I dropped the cap investment for the plan at white springs. One of the weapon vendor robots has it. If they don't hop servers and check again.
---
You'll spend forever looking for hand made to break down.
---
It's much easier to make and scrap then to learn the options for it.
---
Yeah you are right. My bad I just checked a tutorial. If it isnt at Emmett then it is most likely a legacy outfit. I cant think of anywhere else it could be
---
There is a static spawn in The Burrows. 
---
At the marketplace, it is on the wall in a locked cage next to the weapons workbench.
---
Why even shoot. Melee those for fun and saving ammo. I keep a shovel with me at all times, as that comes handy in the event, and also when I try to burry some Civil War bones for the n-th time.
---
Omg yes dude, I had to claim a workshop and it said unowned but then claiming it from some dude, he was a level 12 and I felt so bad. I ended up giving him back all the caps I took from him and a few more plus some armor and weapons as a sorry
---
The weekly challenge is just leveling up 3 times. So if you already leveled twice this week in adventure and completed the match to get enough adventure experience to level up, it probably counted that. I could be wrong. I dunno. I’ve been up for like 20 hours but it makes sense to me.
---
while i believe there is a chance to get a cat via the current taming system i haven't seen one, i can 100% confirm you can get a dog though as i had one.... ya know before he vanished like all my pets do because the taming system stinks.
---
You guys are the best! I did not expect this many responses and some really helpful tips/info.
---
The community for this game seems awesome. I’m really enjoying my time with 76 and a lot of that is helped by the community. 
---
You guys are the real MVP’s. Thank you.
---
exploits? when you level up on adventure mode it give you xp to NW. Maybe, someone using god mode and make lvl 2000 in adventure can turn ton of xp to NW.
---
I believe they're in the Light Brigade.
---
Must of the people that i know who plays NW are very high level because they just play that mode since launch, they stop playing adventure mode because it's boring (for them).
---
I have 1 friend that has never actually played adventure mode and only use it to change their SPECIALS, he's level 120 and start playing the game on may lol.
---
Legitimate legendary drops that Bethesda ~~is too lazy to fix~~ hasn’t fixed yet.
---
I sense a Soldier main here.
---
You are able to learn mods out of scrapping unmodded weapons.
---
Nope, the xp you get of adventure doesn't transfer to NW, I'm level 91 if that would be the case, i for sure be around 100.
---
Haha of course exploits I would imagine so! I thought it was the other way around as experience earned in nuclear winter also results in experience earned in adventure mode but not vice versa. Only saying because I'm level 302 in adventure mode but just started playing nuclear winter ( currently level 22 ) but I haven't gotten a single point from playing in adventure mode. Also I didn't even know God mode worked in nuclear winter the more you know!
---
Wuh-whoa. Prepare for ban hammer. No trading in sub.
---
Throw grandes
---
Glowing creatures is just that: a glowing variant of anything. Radroaches, deathclaws, mirelurks, etc. cryptids are more folklore stuff. The Grafton and Flatwoods monsters, the Mothman (which can also be glowing), wendigo, snallygasters.
---
Yeah, Molerat football!
---
Now that I think about it, I actually want this. A lot. :D
---
More shanty building kits too!
---
Lucky mine I think it’s called
---
So it's just a random. Encounter? What about cryptid?
---
20/10 I love it! Perfect for the harsh wasteland with all those raiders!
---
There's lots of little things like that I think they're cute too. Except for the old horsedrawn carriage just outside of foundation tho..
---
Because they actually like and enjoy the game mode?
---
you are sure? as i remember correctly. You have cards pack with little bit of xp for levels in adventures. When i log in in NW first time a must open like 100 cards packs and already got few levels in NW.
---
how??? a player Cant do damage on you if you dont shoot back (dont even mention passifist mode). i think you are not telling us all
---
There was a thing a while ago that had something to do with doing stuff in adventure gave you perk cards in NW. I don’t know what it was, all I know is the first time I played NW to get the antler chandler I had 80 cards to open. Opening those gives experience. And besides that, maybe those people just really like the game mode. 
---
Or you could go the route that anybody that’s a really high level is automatically a cheater/hacker/exploiter. I know this sub likes to do that a lot.
---
Only slows food spoilage by 50%.  Good With Salt is infinitely better with 90% at max rank.
---
~~Glowing creatures is just that: a glowing variant of anything. Radroaches, deathclaws, mirelurks, etc.~~ **Cryptids are more folklore stuff. The Grafton and Flatwoods monsters, the Mothman (which can also be glowing), wendigo, snallygasters.**
---
Oh wow. I mean I figured there are Alot of people like that but level 500 seems a bit extreme since nuclear winter hasn't been out for all that long and the rate at which you earn experience is very slow all things considered ( unless levels are a fixed XP requirement rate ). All in all I'm leaning more towards just simple godmode XP exploits at this rate.
---
And add budget god damned
---
Just checked Bethesda website. July 16 is double xp weekend and July 23 is high score weekend
---
Well, today I level up 3 times and I didn't get any pack or xp. I started playing the game mode 2 months ago when I was 87 in adventure, now I'm at 227 and I just get packs from leveling up in NW
---
2 birds with one stone:
---
There is a trainyard at the cranberry bog, near watoga. There are glowing snally's. They are cryptids AND glowing ones and tgey are static spawn.
---
You get xp in adventure from wins in NW, not vice versa.
---
Ah sorry didn't catch that. So it's just pure randok spawn? You have to be lucky to find them in their respective areas?
---
What about their levels?
---
As far as i know, it was a bug, because when I return to FO76 few days later I got like 100 packs, but I didn't level up as much
---
Yeah mine was bugging out in my last session too. For me it was the weight.  Usually if i go overencumbered I'll just bust out my Excavator PA and fast travel with that no problems but last night for some reason it was adding both to my carry weight and to the max carry weight, so when i stepped into it i ended up MORE overencumbered then i was without it.
---
Hello, underwater player here. If I get rumbled, I’m usually taken out with explosives. 40mm and standard grenades.
---
but thats the only upside to FO1st, the tent is convinient, and the outfits are meh, so, without the scrapbox behind the paywall, nobody would buy it anymore
---
But bruh... what about Cryptids...
---
Well yes but nuclear winter isn't the same as adventure mode where you can bust through white springs murder every ghoul and robot in 15 minutes and earn well over 10,000 XP vs nuclear winter where the bulk majority of XP is earned from time survived not just kills and even after talking to a few people the most XP they ever gotten on a regular day was about 800 XP. Even if you where absolutely perfect I highly doubt you could hit 500 when the game mode has been out for a little over a year in time.
---
Try to do something nice for someone, and no matter how selfless the act, on some level it'll make you feel good. That's not selfish I dont think, just human nature?
---
No. There’s a trainyard between Watoga and dropsite V9 that can have glowing snallygasters. I don’t know what level they actually are, since I kinda just headshot them and keep walking.
---
so, it must be nerfed because im 100% sure i was getting XP from opening cards packs.
---
Ever since I started running healing factor, and starched genes, I always end up collecting so many stimpacks. I really only use them at encryptid now
---
For some ridiculous reason Bethesda will patch everything that could possibly ruin player economy or if it regards their precious atomic shop but there have been huge bugs since launch.....legendary perks like stalkers is broken as hell and will out compete a bloodied gun any day despite on paper bloodied should be doing much more but there are several legendary perks that are super broken. Not sure how anyone can take the end game seriously when you have guns that are broken and an exploit with life giver/speed demon that’s grants you basically god mode....
---
Wait, what? Pet?  
---
Is that something you can do with the "% chance to pacify creature"?  
---
Deathclaw? Seriously ? :-D
---
They had them in FO4, might aswel just copy paste them over
---
The weekly NW challenge is to complete 3 NW dailies. Somehow I already unlocked 2/3 despite the challenges having just reset. There's definitely a bug with this challenge but I don't know what triggers it.
---
Servers already struggle to load my camp assets, adding more can't help
---
Expeditions and the new vault system sounds good.
---
Oh awesome well thats some good news then
---
It does, isn't that appropriate!
---
You can get more than 800 on a win. I regularly get around 1100 when I win games. Double exp weekends were great for grinding to lv100. Most I've gotten was close to 3k exp from a single match.
---
There's not godmode in NW (not in xbox at least) or a trick to get insanes amounts of XP, i have talked to a bunch of high levels and be friends of many others and they only played that game mode lol.
---
It's super easy getting XP when you have friends to play with. In two months i level up to 91 and i don't play as much. I tend to get 1200 xp per match.
---
Half? Maybe 3-5% less, but no way near half.
---
Just to weigh in for the robots, there are three states for robot to explode. 2 of them are predictable and one is a wild guess.
---
1. Legendary robots always explode after 7 seconds.
---
Sentry bots always explode. 
---
2. Destroying it's weapons, the robot will try to charge and self destruct with audio and sometimes visual que.
---
3. Bug, yeah that happens some time...
---
I dunno man, grinding for and then cafting my very own excavator PA was a very rewarding experience, he effectively robbed you of it. This is the reason I always decline the free shit that others throw at me.
---
Hehe, on the sale. 500 otherwise.
---
And also, you have double XP weekends when you get 3k per match  so it's very possible :)
---
All the perk card pack were from a bug that has now been fixed
---
That sounds worse than what we have now
---
I'm not spending 10 seconds swinging at a tiny flying insect with this games shitty melee hit recognition when I can shoot the ground and kill 3 of the bastards with one fusion cell from my Tesla. Even if I lose the occasional firefly in the grass it's still less of a headache than trying to use with melee was.
---
It's designed to get you to spend real world money on atoms.  Full stop. 
---
Personally i realized early that i can live without all ther rewards. If i wind up only at rank 20, oh well. None of the rewards are that amazing.
---
Back in the start of the game ,you could do damage,but only small amounts meaning you could kill low levels,but only if you did enough damage quick enough,since it regenerated aswell,so 4 lvl 50s could gang up on and murder a lower level
---
This.
---
And here I was getting met outside by lvl 100s with flamethrowers. Hit lvl 5 an died instantly then got chased around flat woods an anywhere else on the map until I finally quit.
---
What I read was that the hungry/thirsty debuffs are going away, not anything about removing food spoilage.  Do you know something I don't?
---
Yeah feels
---
Hell yeah 👍😊
---
1000 atoms available next year.
---
Hmmmm maybe yeah 🤔
---
Yeah it is hey?! 🙄
---
&gt;Well what would stop a player for being able to use that as a storage for food for themselves and not intending to sell it?
---
Why would you want to *stop* someone doing this perfectly sensible thing?
---
Lol, classic.
---
I want legendary weapons to work as intended and not have the ability for essentially god mode....we should not be able to solo scorch beast queen with a bloodied build using a stalkers legendary gun....on paper the guns that are broken make no sense why they out compete others that are centred around our build. Also with life giver and speed demon you basically have god mode and will never die as long as mire lurks aren’t around. It’s ridiculous...end game can’t be taken seriously when we’re running around with god mode and instant kill weapons
---
Yeah true, didn’t think about the Super Duper Perk 😊
---
I've found heavy weapons build with explosive damage perks to be just as destructive if not moreso than perception builds 
---
Stabilized's armor penetration is really good in NW and for only 3 perception you can get the explosive perk that doubles the explosion radius, paired with heavy weapons damage boosting perks, and the explosive damage boosting perk, it's been a breeze 
---
I also grab the hacking perk because that's the best way to be able to grab the grenade auto launcher
---
Some would say that the cap limit itself is also a really bad idea.
---
Glowing creatures are just glowing versions of normal creatures. If you want to find some at lowish levels, the town of welch in the ash heap has glowing mole miners.
---
Cryptids are mythical creatures you can find throughout the world, they are as follows, flatwoods monster, grafton monster, mothman, sheepsquatch, snallygaster and wendigo.
---
If you're looking for something to kill for the challenge, you can do the grafton day event in grafton, that spawns a lvl 30 grafton monster. You can also find one behind the charleston capitol building in the stream sometimes.
---
A wendigo usually spawns up at the house of scares at the top side of the mire, and you can find snallygasters at the flooded trainyard in watoga.
---
They're in the atom shop called something like "large neon letters"
---
For a joke... this made me burst with laughter. Thanks for making me smile. Sucks to be your buddy. There should be a warning, “Nukes are not toys.”
---
Sure, experiences differ, naturally. With same repulsive discust, I refuse searching tiny insects in grass, when I can 1hit them right at my feet. The shovel *ding* on every hit makes me happy. Sure, Tesla is efficient weapon here, but I didn't refer to that, but only to the fact that I often see people just waste their overpowered rounds in this simple low level event.
---
congrats you are now part of the other 80% of players who are bloodied builds
---
Go to the top of the monorail elevator fast travel location and be amazed at how many bags of precious concrete you can grab up there
---
There's something S.P.E.C.I.A.L. about this sign...oh I know: It's  BRILLIANT!
---
my vendor
---
Head back to the top floor of the Hornwright Building. The card should respawn on the CEO's desk, I believe.
---
Not while they’re crouched, no.
---
I'm definitely playing more now but whether I last to the end of the season is another matter. ;)
---
Feel free to scroll through several other posts about this item. 
---
After the 15th "Bethesda is just being greedy by putting this in the bundle, what do train cars have to do with diners? Nothing. They just want you to spend atoms"
---
I'm not assuming anything. It was a response to a continuing pattern in comments and reaponses on this sub.
---
Oh, and by the way, I'm glad that you visited Canada one time. We are lovely and friendly. To a wide range of individual people. 
---
I want to let you in on a little National secret though. We're extremely arrogant when it comes to Americans as a whole. This is not me just being an asshole. It's the honest truth. 
---
Give Anti-Armericanism a Google and have a read. 
---
Make no mistake, part of the Canadian National identity is Anti Americanism. It's a long standing, multi generational attitude.
---
See, most Americans don't know much about Canada, but we all know alot about the United States. It's why Americans don't know about this attitude and just think we're the nicest people. 
---
Arrogance is our default setting when it comes to the US. For generations we've been shaking our heads, angry, or just out right laughing at the US. It's the butt of our jokes. We literally volunteer that we're "Not American" when we travel abroad. It's the sole reason we put flags on our backpacks, jackets and suit cases. 
---
We mock your politics, militarism, prison culture, inequality, intolerance, accent, education system, Detroit, beer, sports, hair cuts, condiments, chip flavours, history, health care, COVID numbers.... You name it. 
---
So yeah? Arrogant towards the US? That's Canada. A streak of Xenophobia when it comes to the US? Yep. That's Canada. 
---
To Bob from the Bangor? Nice guy. Nothing against him. To Samantha from Duluth? Lovely lady. 
---
But the country as a whole? Lol. You Yanks have no idea.
---
I don't mind the limit to the budget but why not have a choice of builds to pick from? You should be able to have X amount of camps. Upon entering a world you can chose which to place.aybe you want to vend maybe you want to xp grind. This way I can build multiple bases and just chose which to use.
---
I tried, it won’t let me pick it up. Super frustrating.
---
ahahaha you'll be a great raider!
---
Yeah, I just finished uninstalling. After the recent changes and the institution of a STRICT and somewhat impossible seasonal schedule (when placed beside my irl schedule), I no longer felt I could play the game the way I enjoyed it. I like to just drop it, fuck around a bit, then go do other things. Now, the game expects me to treat it like a job and I'm not about that life.  
---
I know a lot of people are having fun with the new stuff and I was one of the biggest supporters in the first days when the game was admittedly complete dogshit. But, the Dude does not abide.
---
Burned out?  By shit that's the same general difficulty, or in some cases EASIER, as the daily challenges ever were?
---
If you're burning yourself out then you'd have to be doing something stupid like trying to rush through the ranks 100 score at a time power leveling or something, and if so that's your own dumb ass decision.
---
Get with the fucking times.   We're already a week into this shit and most of the whiners have realized they're already ahead of schedule and that Bethesda is already throwing extra challenges, double exp and bonus score at them so they have little reason to keep whining.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0raSbTxHfZ0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0raSbTxHfZ0) , there are plenty of legit documented builds....and some that are not so much
---
Pacifist mode fucking garbage, you cant do damage but you can still be killed. It's more useful when you're higher level of course, but not when you're low level like I am.
---
I've been a bloodied build forever, the new thing is the unyielding vats heavy.
---
There were bugs in Skyrim and Fallout 4 that let mannequins move around from time to time. I guess they try to fix that before patching them in the game. Or they tried to fix it and couldn't (like so many other things).
---
Just keep an eye on the atom store, maybe you can buy it sometime now.
---
Do anglers and deathclaws count as cryptids? Or are they just animals. I know what they’re based off of, but I’m just unsure how they still might be categorized.
---
I also ended up getting this bug, but I wasn't online near the reset time. I have however found out that accessing the Atom Shop before loading in can also cause it.
---
However this was the first time I'd heard about the Atom Shop breaking the score challenges, so I wouldn't be surprised if there were more unknown triggers at this point.
---
I’ll give 5 caps for it
---
I suddenly have hankering to try this. Anyone got a B/33/25 LMG looking for a new home? 
---
I too also love my commando build but I haven't found anything that's as much fun in PA yet. Now I have something to try out.
---
Mutations are TOO good and TOO worth it.  Bethesda f'd up in letting us just stack every single one and then ditch almost all the negatives.  At a bare minimum they should have limited the number you can have active at a single time so people would have to pick and choose instead of just taking the  buffet.
---
Super duper works for weapons so make sure that’s on if you have it.
---
I haven't figured out which to go with.
---
Is there consensus on benefit one way or the other?
---
It doesnt work in PA. You need unyielding for VATS.
---
9 times out of 10 it’s because of [this](https://youtu.be/eKo_8XKVqGQ)
---
That's even better, I misread the post.
---
Yes, it's common sense indeed. So much that the 2008 FO3 [has it](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Keyring). Just another corner cut on Bethesda's "biggest project ever".
---
Bloodied FFR gatling gun with speedy reciver, fire rate is significantly better than standard but still great on ammo, doesn't drain vats and is still really accurate and a headshot is worth 1980
---
You're welcome. 
---
You've learned something about Canada today. Something Americans rarely do. 
---
We do not think highly of the US. Individual Americans? Great Folks. Wonderful people. We, as a country however, have a long standing tradition of not liking the US.
---
Wins net a lot of xp. Double xp weekends are a thing.  Good players who have a lot of free time can rack up levels. 
---
Iirc it's not the same amount of xp per lvl as adventure mode so not sure your example isn't valid.  In any case I personally know a couple ppl who im 100% sure are fully legit 200+ and freakishly good and they don't play constantly. 
---
If those dudes nolifed for a couple months im sure they'd easily hit 500+.
---
cheating is also a possiblity I just don't think it's a certainty.
---
You can pick up the gnomes, I believe that they're concrete. They're all over the place.

Our group rarely does it on public because 
---
* chances are too damn high the other players don't pull their weight/don't know what to do/start it way too soon/... 
---
* a public server could be full so not everybody in the group can join. Combine that with noobs starting it too soon and usually a few people are stuck in the queue for too long and miss the event.

* we have done it so much on private worlds that everybody's characters have the bear arm plan and stimpack diffuser plan. Getting the bear arm mods is the only reason we now have to do it so it is not high on their priority list anymore.
---
So basically most of us (our group) only join it on public when we have nothing better to do. And then we are usually dissappointed with the other players. Succes rate difference between public and private is simply to big to bother with it on public worlds.
---
I'm afraid this situation will not change unless bethesda includes more information (for example in the loading screen) so more people know how to do the event. How many people here know about the alternative AI program for example? 
---
but, for what it is worth, here are some tips I rarely see on this subreddit:
---
* only have ONE person in A. For some reason the spawn rate is higher with one person in A, he/she will get almost overwhelmed with radstags. You can solo A to max rank because of this.
---
* getting the B animal to level 2 is IMHO better than level 3. The level 2 snallygaster is a lot more mobile than the level 3 megasloth, making it easier to keep alive.
---
* in C: you can collect radkelp before it starts emitting smoke. If you wait for the smoke, you won't reach level 3.
---
* Once you have started the event, get to the basement (code = 970930), get to the room with the terminal, select 'shutdown code', run back up to the terminal where the event has been started and select "shut down". An alternative AI program will take over the event causing less (no?) robots to respawn plus the friendly animals are healed a bit in between waves, making the event a easier.

I have a B3325 Gatling Gun, for my taste it missed too many shots. Tried it a lot.
---
Thank. I'm going to do my best to get them out so they are short n sweet but also informative and easy to follow. Glad you liked it.
---
They’re just creatures.
---
Yes you should do that, it's hard on the screws but it's by far the best way to learn all the mods.
---
Glad I could help.
---
This. All NW challenges count, not just the NW daily.
---
Hmm. That worked for me. That is frustrating. Apart from that, I got nothing. My sympathies. It might be submit a ticket time.
---
Gotchya. Thanks
---
No. It only works with pre war booze.
---
So what's the minimum daily S.C.O.R.E per day to reach level 100 before the end of the season?
---
Weird, i use PA so maybe its the stabilized perk that's making the difference
---
I am on ps4. My psn is captnbeardy. I'm a bit busy atm but I'll try my best to be on at a decent time.
---
Yep. My Prime Minister did something pretty insensitive. Pretty awful. 
---
Fun fact though. Our Police don't go around murdering black folks for being black folks.
---
So yeah. PM in blackface? That's pretty shameful? 
---
Decades of police murdering innocent black Americans?
---
Maybe worry about your own shit.

---
I'm gonna be honest. I don't get it. These dailies are even easier and faster to bang out then they were for Atoms. Also this is a marathon, not a sprint, I feel people want to be done NOW and it's not possible (unless you exploit).
---
Yeah, I’ll do that. Appreciate the help!
---
All you have to get is 1,000 damage to receive all the rewards, i believe. I heard it from a stranger on the internet.
---
Well, i'm using [Inspirational](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Inspirational) to get even more XP from events etc. and bcs i have 6pts in Charisma, i also use [Bodyguards](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Bodyguards).
---
I hardly have screws as it is haha.
---
This is what I’ve heard also, just find a heavy gun and unload a clip on her when she lands and it will be plenty
---
Yes it does. With stabilized it misses a lot less 95% shots in VATS. But without Unyielding, you have to get pretty close to do 95% VATS head shot.
---
Yep. You need it maxed out i believe and then it’s still only a chance. But they sometimes die very easily and can be heartbreaking when you come back to your camp and see it got beat to death by a radroach.
---
Hi English Person. 
---
We Canadians reserve being rude, condescending, arrogant and patronizing specifically for the US. It's a long standing part of our National Identity that, as a non Canadian, you are likely unaware of. 
---
Second. I'd very much like you to explain to me when being American became a race.... 
---
Borderline racist. Hilarity.
---
Can you place more than one train car?
---
Be nice to do a long train type thing.
---
Yeah you'll be farming them for a while. My favourite route is, Sugar Hill &gt; National Isolated Radio Array &gt; National Radio Astronomy Centre &gt; Abandoned Bog Town Main Building (Enter form the roof) Grab all the fans and typewriters. Don't forget to use super duper (assuming you are high level enough to have it) for extras to scrap.
---
That's so me. Two days in a row now I've planned to do a certain thing but get disteacted by someplace I haven't been yet.
---
Or be a real pal and get a cryolator. Lol.
---
I'm level 55 at the moment. What SPECIAL is super duper a perk card in?
---
Nothing is worth 70k
---
It's under luck, and at 3* it offers a 30% chance to double what you craft.
---
I’ll raise a forest healing salve
---
This is the correct response
---
I just started playing NW, and hiding in the river seems to work pretty well for the ‘survive 30 minutes’ challenge. My wife tried it and got killed right away, and I wasn’t sure how they killed her. Sounds like it was probably a grenade.
---
Not true at all? Specially with how useless caps are atm. They were supped to hell and back
---
Ah right, I'll keep an eye out for it.
---
What do you mean?
---
[Where to Farm: All the Things](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/)
---
TL;DR: 2nd story of building at Abandoned Bog Town workshop, top of Monorail Elevator, behind the house at Clancy Manor, around the chemistry station at Harpers Ferry, and several other places.
---
Time for the big guns. I’ll raise you a single 10mm round AND.... a small drinking glass.
---
I've been playing for a year and I still haven't finished the main quest line. I log on, do daily quests, build up my camp (if I move that's 4+ hours of structural changes), take a workshop or 2, defend said workshop(s), consider some side quests, get distracted, remember my treasury notes, do my daily challenges, remember my treasure notes again, remember to scrip stock piled legendaries from yesterday because of the damn limit, go shopping because I'm also at max caps, then realize I need to log off and go to bed because I also have to work tomorrow. The game is what you make it 🤷‍♀️
---
Since you question your own statement, that means you agree with me. No take backs.
---
THIS!!
---
It takes like 7k after the pumpkin armor for the next reward, next you should get is the beanie
---
I’ll see you raise and add in 2 cork scraps and fusion core at 5%
---
He means he spends no time on the market subs and has no clue what you can get for items there
---
It’s very possible to get over 1000 NW XP per match if you hit all the bonus XP markers and win the match. I’ve been playing this week and did have a lot of perk cards to open that yield 50 overseer xp each. Plus double and triple XP weekends help a lot. There’s no exploits or xp cards for NW either (I speak only for PS4)
---
This is getting too intense for me. Final offer... spoiled meat
---
Yeah yeah. 
---
Unfortunately you only met individual Canadians and are blissfully unaware of Canada's dirty little national secret. 
---
Anti-Americanism is a multi generational , actual, legit part of our National Identity. That's not a joke. 
---
Nothing riles up Canadians, nothing gets our arrogance ramped up like the US. 
---
I'm not just being an asshole about this. It's an honest to god thing. Google it and have a read. Your opinion of Canadians will change almost immediately.
---
Yeah it's horrible with VATS at a distance, what sort of range are you getting with the LMG? Close to rifles?
---
Hell of a grind. I got the skeleton outfit and beanie yesterday, all I have to get now is the cold weather jacket 👍
---
Seems the xmas stuff is making you earn it from scratch i.e. if for halloween you get something at 3000 then something again at 7000 then by earning 7000 you unlock both. For the xmas stuff it seems like I've had to earn 10000, like the full amount for each rank, starting from scratch after unlocking the last reward which isn't how it worked at Xmas I believe.
---
PC? If yes, that camp owns. It's like an altar to the TP god. :D
---
Yeah, lol. He must think 30k caps is a hard limit on putting value on items
---
Bioillumineces fluid
---
Might be the same damage bug I get with my Bloodied Handmade &amp; SB's. I can empty 2 mags with 3,75x sneak multiplier on a regular SB before it goes down, should go down in a few shots.
---
According to the damage numbers I'm dealing something between 20-30k damage to it but the health bar doesn't move.
---
That fatigue part. I’ve been grinding that repeatable til about 4-5 am. Do I need too. Not really. But the more I do now. The less I will need to pay later. I’m a little tired of read about those that can maintain a high int exp build.
---
I fold
---
Yes!! Now to sell that camo jumpsuit for 70k caps!!! Mwhahahaha!!!
---
The United Nations &amp; WHO both use a definition of Racism that includes discrimination on the basis of national origin.
---
&gt;The United Nations use the definition of racial discrimination laid out in the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, adopted in 1966:
---
... any distinction, exclusion, restriction **or preference based on** race, color, descent, or **national or ethnic origin** that has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life. (Part 1 of Article 1 of the U.N. International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination)[91]
---
😂😂👏🏻
---
Omg ffs just double scrip amount.
---
I have both a heavy and commando, you can't stay hidden with heavies. It doesn't seem like a big deal right now because everyone is using the bugged guns but, as a commando with 1 piece chameleons you can stay hidden even vs the queen, which is full uptime on sneak attacks which is a big deal.
---
Oh wow so I’m not even close then? How much longer after beanie?
---
Christ, I’ve jsut sbout had enough of NW haha, how much longer after the beanie is the skeleton?
---
Deathclaws don't count as cryptids. But Anglers actually do count (or at least did when I tested them a few patches ago), although they probably shouldn't.
---
Ffs I’m rank 27
---
Eye roll. Yeah I know you use other characters. 
---
What’s really stupid is what are you going to do? But other gear? Legacy gear? For what? What purpose is this all for? 
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Overseer_rank#Rewards
---
The Halloween rewards stack so after the armor skin its 7k for the skeleton. The xmass is for each. So after the beanie the jacket is 14k
---
Frog legs is a perk card. You have to have 9+ agility. Mutations reset after each match. You can either get them from rads or find serums. Radaway doesn’t exactly cure them like it does in adventure.
---
Yeah under 15 mins is not accurate and a bit of an exaggeration.
---
The United States is home to people of many different ethnic origins. As a result, American culture and law does not equate nationality with race or ethnicity, but with citizenship and permanent allegiance
---
Sorry. Still wrong.
---
it is how it worked back then: [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Overseer\_rank#Christmas\_2019](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Overseer_rank#Christmas_2019)
---
to get all halloween rewards you need 14k XP, but for all the christmas rewards you need 27k XP
---
My bad, I meant how much longer after the beanie is the skeleton in your experience? Definitely not even bothering for the jacket
---
There’s a crystal node East of the fair ground by vault 76. Really good view of the western area. I thing problem is the area to the north of it is a death blooms event spot.
---
Or give us a lockout timer.
---
For a casual player (like me) it normally takes more than an hour to complete the dailies. If i have to kill 5 robots 5 times i need to search them. You will have to search for items, enemys, resources etc. Server hop. If you are not constantly stocked up on every item or have Fallout 1st, you probably don't have stock of all you need. Just grind, just a chore. i would only do easy tasks. I don't have time for this horseshit.
---
I brought one for 80caps👍😁
---
You know you don’t have to actually do the track, right...?
---
If players expect a battlepass, something you notoriously need to grind for usually and one in an MMO mind you, then you better expect to grind.
---
The track could be better don’t get me wrong and it seems as tho they’re working on tweaking it slowly considering we got QoL changes to weeklies this week. 
---
You just stated your playstyle was something you can still do. Ignore the track and just fuck around, who cares? If that’s the make or break for you it sounds like you’re just burnt on the game in all honesty.
---
Get a mic and find a high level player in their camp and ask if they will sell you some concrete. Likely they will drop a ton on you.
---
There’s also a concrete node at the Morgantown junkyard.
---
Build a camp at a junk node, and it will provide concrete. See fo76map for junk node locations.
---
I really shouldn't be, but I'm pissing myself laughing. 
---
I'm sorry mate. 
---
Did you try the back door?
---
Ah thanks for pointing that out. I was sure that I'd read it on the wiki as being the same as Halloween! Perhaps it was jusy wishful thinking eh? 😉
---
You'd have to do the math haha. But I think it was pretty quick. Got the skeleton from a random match for the dailys and I stopped grinding after the beanie
---
Wtf are you on about? You said my item wasn't worth 70k when a quick glance on trade offers and price checks clearly show the market at being around 70k. I almost gave it away at 3k. That was my point. Get it?
---
Zero new content, just new dynamics
---
It’s casual players saying they will have trouble hitting 100.  Rank 35 your no casual.  Let’s be real
---
^this. And as for the not wanting to mess up your adventure perks you can always make a new character and tweak your NW perks on that one.
---
It's all on the wiki, it works out difficult to calculate as it's different amounts required for each, they don't line up in tandem.
---
I've always been sick of it however with Covid I'm working from home so just leave myself Bush Wookieeing in the background 😄
---
Only the best and brightest at the Enclave 
---
I say that as an Enclave myself lmao
---
cabinet wookie
---
I’m level 210 and have leveled up each night since the legendary run has started, and I only play 2-3 hours tops. Utilizing the right XP buffs and joining a build team makes it pretty doable.
---
I think I'm about level 22/23 atm. I have no idea if I'll make it to the end though. It's already starting to feel like a grind.
---
Side note but anyone know if there is a reliable way to hide the platform down into the ground? I wanted to camp out in an old train but it looks so out of place with the cement platform. ._.
---
Close to a silenced handmade/fixer
---
Best value purchase you'll ever make on this game
---
Haha that’s awesome man! Good luck! I’ve been doing it since 8pm eastern so I think I’m gonna call it for tonight. I’m sure I’m close
---
where do you get that clown mask?
---
The glowing is an excellent idea. Colour code the stars as well. Red for 1 blue for 2 green for 3 purple for 4 and gold/yellow for 5. I know 4-5 aren’t in game yet. But it’s literally a colour change. 
---
The sound I think should be slapped on the glow sight perk. While the perk is meant for glowing. It would be nice to use for legendary farming. Instead of nuke zones.
---
I though community patch made it working, but .. it is a long time since I was wandering commonwealth wasteland :)
---
Yeah stealth without a silencer mod isnt easy but if you keep your distance+escape artist+unyielding it works.
---
I've been hiding successfully for about a week now haha.
---
Just got down to me and a 2 man team in the final circle. Bush wookiees for life!
---
Try leaving your front door unlocked then see what your insurers say when you claim after being burgled.
---
Even if they moved it ANYWHERE but directly in the middle of your view, it would be a massive improvement.
---
VATS + melee = pure joy
---
I agree the scrap box should be available to everyone, but you won’t see that happen because people will cancel 1st. The survival tent is nice but I can go without it, the new cosmetics that drop rarely are good but something I can do without. The atoms are nice but if I really want something Ion the shop ’ll spend money once in a while rather than monthly. I’ve only kept it because of the scrap box and I feel a lot of people are the same
---
I do hate NW at this point but I need that skeleton costume 😭
---
&gt;I'iam glad you enjoy the game so much you cans spend 7-14 hours a week playing it and searching for bubblegum or different creatures.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;I can afford to play about 2-3 hours a week. Before i could spend some of that completing easy dailies or weeklys to also get some atoms (that is fun for me) and play like i want. In that time i could also spare some atoms and buy something from the atom store every now and then and i could buy everything  
---
&gt;No i wont get any more "free" atoms (yeah maybee 150 for 15 hours of work) and i won't get any "free" cosmetics from the season. Only option now is to handover some 80-100 USD to Bethesda. Yes, thats greedy.
---
I want a mister handy as a vendor. He doesn’t need to float around or anything. Just float in place and chill. Maybe a sentrybot that counts as 4 vendor stations would be cool too.
---
Kind of related but do you know why there's a native American at the top of the loading screen?
---
Yeah would be dope, fallout 2 and new vegas had some interesting takes on how cultures influenced their post apocalyptic tribe counterparts 
---
I could see some interesting stuff being done
---
Keep in mind that godmode still a thing, weapons still broken etc. 
---
I like positive changes too but things they breaking along with it and controversal game design decisions that adding up with current problems is just way too much.
---
Sweet. Hoping to snag it soon. Gonna call it a night. Hope they don’t patch it before I can finish haha
---
Oh well. I never visit that town and we got no such thing where I’m from
---
I’m about to get the ghillie hunting rifle skin. Whatever number that is. I play from about 1-2pm to 5 am. At least these past few days with season 1. Once I saw the whole thing about having to repeatables and having to X many a week. I just decided to get it done. The more I do now the less I will need to pay later.
---
Yep couldn't believe my luck
---
Love it! Slight suggestion though, change it to fooked day to fit in with the hill Billy theme of fallout lol
---
Meat cleaver. It does the same damage a throwing knife. But requires wood. Over the knifes steel.
---
&gt;i will log in do my daily for S.C.O.R.E (usually 1 hour) then leave.
---
I think that's what Bethesda wants. For whatever reason they have they seem to be trying to get people to log in once per day, but not for very long, and they prefer this to people who play longer sessions less often. 
---
It probably has something to do with statistics around number of log ins correlating with atom purchases, when the true correlation may be total play time.
---
How did you get the vendors and those counters to all snap to each other?  I can snap a counter to a vendor, but not a vendor to a counter.  So I cant string them together.
---
The part of black water mine where you do uranium fever has 3bags
---
End game is all about grinding but you can't grind all at once because then you wouldn't logoff anymore because you wouldn't have anything to do. And then you don't buy atom$
---
....why didnt your friend check the map and log out?
---
You must really hate me then.  I do the same as him just practically all day that I am awake and am at 67 now.
---
I find the poison to be the most effective. Explosive is nice but I find them to be situational. Cryo tips do slow her down. But only use them when she’s coming down. You incur the wrath of many if your freeze her mid air. 
---
The plasma is good as well. The flame ones do with thing where they sound and act like Molotov’s. And it really weird. Like my first time with them they made the ground/camera shake.
---
And PA Displays
---
Imagine having paintings on a ceiling. Or a mothman skin.
---
Well I have a job so if you have all the time then not really. Lol
---
That'd be beyond sweetness
---
Watoga isnt a good place to go at level 18 if you havent done the Mayor for a Day quest
---
not the worst idea in the world.... but also not the best.
---
i can't imagine bethesda would treat it with enough respect to go beyond just the most basic stereotypical items, and the massive cultural appropriation can of worms that would come with the stereotypes.
---
in world, in terms of lore, there hasn't been any explicit mention of native americans, that i've seen, in any modern fallout game.  that doesn't mean that they weren't in the universe, but without any kind of racial support or lore to go with the items...
---
you'd basically just end up with a pack of rando items, that people would strew about randomly.
---
now if bethesda say, partnered with an actual tribe from the viginia area, or their informed descendants, did a respectful pack following their input and say, added a little something into the game to acknowledge their existence, like how they have civil war items being sourced from civil war locations....
---
i'd be all for that.  i'm not trying to be a "delicate snowflake" or anything of that matter, and saying that anybody can't enjoy cool stuff, but especially at this point in time, with what is happening in the real world, the LEAST any of us could do is take the time to learn and be respectful of the real traditions and history behind the multitude of items we've at times reduced to being just gas station trinkets and tourist souvenirs.
---
as a youth i LOVED dream catchers, had immense fun with the vintage cowboy and indians toys my dad passed to me, and he even made me a MASSIVE handmade wooden fort (and a multitude of teepees and other villiage items for an indian settlement).  so i'm totally guilty of this kind of thing myself.
---
the least we owe these peoples and their history is to not reduce them to in game trinkets sold for profit hamfisted into a game that doesn't mention them.
---
feel free to correct me if fallout 3 to 76 does indeed mention them.  i've not played through all locations in all games, nor listened to all holotapes and read all notes.
---
Saved up some 5mm in hope of making 5.56 out of them. I must be doing it wrong, cause I saw no convert all X ammo into something else. I pressed E until I fatigued, never gonna use that station again
---
Yes they still work. The pip boy number won't change. But it 100% still works
---
isnt that the mothman building set
---
35. Almost caught up with the evil doctor lol
---
You can get around 8-900 for a third place finish too, if you can survive like 20 minutes. 
---
Feels like survival time is the big XP giver, everything else just tops it up.
---
Agreed. I didn’t actually notice before how low the XP was in there until I did it for an XP run. I realise there’s a semi decent payoff after but that shouldn’t matter, especially when you can do stuff like radiation rumble or line in the sand and get endless Xp farm. 
---
You can do the entire silo AND the queen and not get the XP you can get from one wave of glitched line in the sand with one well placed m79 shot sadly.
---
Me too but they've realized it's easier to sell $30 worth of some 3D models some people did in a day's work.
---
Mines still working that I can see.
---
Getting told about every workshop needing defending etc.
---
Also affecta Gauss weapons.
---
What do you mean? You cant sell ss armour @ the vendor,  but you can scrib it.
---
At your level the best places to go for a cryptid would be Charleston. From the Train Station fast travel point head down the train track then head right at the dried river. Theres usually a Grafton Monster thats not super high level stomping around there. They are slow and should be alright for someone your level to take down if you keep your distance, dodge its rock chucking etc.
---
As for glowing creatures check out the farms in the forest for glowing radroaches. In fact if you jump into either Tea Time event or Campfire Tales you should get glowing ants, specially if you collect the wet kindling around the base of pine trees in Campfire tales
---
Where in the menu can you find this item. I have unlocked it but can't find it.😊
---
Nice photo.👍
---
Why aren't the doughnuts made in dozens uggghhhhh
---
This is gonna be alot of work.😞😞
---
Refunded the Screaming Eagle skin for being absolutely dire and broken (which Bethesda let me keep) so it was a win-win!
---
Im pretty sure nothing happens, and the spaceship is just the countdown to the end of the season. So if I think if he hits level 100 the season ends so you have to get there befor he does
---
Hehe well actually I think it's the cards, have read a few posts where people say that it performs better under higher resolutions than 1080p and sometimes even 1440p for some reason :s
---
Worked the same on Call of Cthulu, at 1440p I could sometimes see dips to around 55 FPS, but it's not happening with 1800p :s
---
Place the counter, eye where it sits, then remove it and very carefully place the vendor, then put the bar back and hope it snaps between the 2.
---
If you've done all the dalies and weeklies available so far (excluding the NW complete 3 challenges one) you should be level 24.
---
Anything below, you've not done all the dalies/weeklies.
---
I had the same thing with 2/3 completing. At least it didnt rip me off of SCORE so far. Im not really complaining at this point
---
I like playing a match or two of NW because I just use it as chill time to go critter hunting in Animal Crossing, lol.
---
And it doesn't use up 1/4 of your budget!
---
Lol that's actually a good idea
---
I agree... as long as they let me plant squirrels.
---
There is literally nothing stopping you from still "dropping in and fucking around a bit" other than your own mental block that you *should* get everything on the board.
---
If you're on xbone i can give you some
---
Gimme a reskin of the Vendor and the rest of the bundle with Nuka-Cola flavoring and I'll drop ATOMS faster than this game's score dropped on release!
---
It's one of the best perks in the game, without a doubt. Especially when crafting ammo. My usual ammo route is testing site #3 for iron ore and Lucky Hole for lead ore, which I smelt with Super Duper, and then by the time I finish crafting with Ammosmith &amp; Super Duper it's all worth about 2K 5.56 or 1K .45 cartridges.
---
Yeah, good luck keeping a security clearance with that sort of attitude.
---
people using gg ez mode
---
Wait, that's a challenge? I never saw it on my list :/
---
The public teams update reset people's pacifist mode settings I think as I had to redo mine.
---
People have calculatet it. If you do EVERY Challenge, EVERY day for the duration of 10 weeks you will only get 215 000 Score and you will be still short of 220 000. You could get it if you faktor in every 100 (?) Score from a level up. In addition you get 1500 atoms for "free" which you can reinvest in 10 levelups in the roadmap (but then again you won't have had any "free" atoms gained in 3 months).
---
Pretty sure the main reason people are upset is that they want to buy it without having to buy an entire bundle of things they don't want, but okay. Not sure what being Canadian or American has to do with any of this.
---
I’ve heard FOMO used,but what is it?
---
This was posted before the reset
---
on what planet?
---
For what?
---
Yes, and if you Are close other player lost health....
---
I was about to start farming the burrows, is it worth it for a level 40
---
Oh my LORD this is the best idea ever and I'm stealing it, because my log told me to.
---
Of course I got it. What are you on? Seriously, nothing in this game is worth 70K. People put high prices on such things, to make them seem valuable. But they aren't. Mostly the people who start this kind of High Value items are people who have found a way to make actual money off of these games. 
---
They turn peoples needs to have it all, to profit. And you all fall for it, and you all believe it, and you all live it. And you all are hilarious for falling for it. 
---
Yes, maybe not you specifically are looking to make real money. But real life money is what starts and drives all this 70k and up prices.
---
And you bought into all the way. Anyone that even questions it, here you come, WTF angry. And all the other people that believe it too, come and attack. Oh you must think nothing is worth more than 30K because of the caps limit! Oh look at him and laugh.
---
It's hilarious! You all think you are smart and clever but the truth is, you are just being manipulated. And in the end, it will still mean nothing, and you'll stop playing FO76, or it will end, and you will move on, and do it all over again in some other game.
---
And it will be just as laughable then. 
---
I so hope you get your 70k. I hope you use that to by some duped legacy item that doesn't drop in the game. Or some equally other rare exotic item, that is either cosmetic, or makes you a teeny tiny better at killing the big bad monsters of the wasteland!
---
There should be no limits. Especially if you’re a FO1 member.
---
Glad you don't have this issue, I've lost now about 1800 bullion, I've stopped counting.
---
What a thoroughly nasty little comment, and all emotes 🤷‍♂️
---
The exception doesn’t change the rule. You’re not level 300 plus.
---
lead pipe
---
I'll try that, so it has to be Sunday and if you miss that it resets to the following Sunday? Seems a pretty petty mechanic.
---
for that suggestion we need that in the game
---
Possibly because I thought I had it on. I rectified it this afternoon anyway so hopefully no more issues
---
But hey it does a little dance and song performance.
---
Yes I need this. I recently started a bloodied build so I went from not doing hardly half health to just 1 shooting and I feel really guilty
---
I get the same types of players in other games like monster hunter worlds where they are only happy if it dies in x amount of seconds and nobody else gets near it
---
Welcome lol.
---
I don’t think it’s quite as bad as people make it out to be. Interesting discussion though. I actually like having a terminal interface but
---
Agree it could be improved.
---
pretty low? boy you just started and you already wanna kill radiated monsters 10x your size and level?!
---
go to whitespring and see if there are glowing ones
---
Nice. I've got one already and a bunch of donuts in it.
---
For the upcoming legendary perks where light,sturdy,heavy gets away with some ranged. I mean to sell my non ss armor parts. Ive been keeping them for a while and need stashspace (not on 1st)
---
It's really only worth what someone else will actually pay.
---
my vendor 
---
literally handmade
---
I think 3k is a fair price. People who price things over max caps are living in a bubble that hopefully one day will pop. Don’t support hyper inflation.
---
Not much to it... You can't harm others therefore they can't harm you when it is turned on.
---
Do you use the Blocker perk? That one is also broken, as is “randomly” Fireproof. This would have a major impact on your damage numbers in many situations.
---
This is what happened to me when I posted this. Lol
---
Weird, I guess they set it to count all challenges, even though it mentions daily challenges
---
at least in europe, a contract is not valid if it is contrary to current law, dont matter eula said
---
If you hop servers the quest restarts. It’s what I had to do.
---
some fallout players are really serious about max damage, so they have the best bloodied weapons there are, gained from grinding scrip at least 12 hours a day and server hopping another 6 hours just to find vendors that sell their desired weapons 
---
then they also do the calculations and research on the perk cards to optimise their dmg
---
Wait what?
---
I hate going to that place, I know Smiley won't sell any gold just repeats the same line.
---
 **"Check back Monday I should have more stock then"** 
---
Have missed out on 1800+ bullion. 
---
Bethesda will not fix this as it only a negative impact on players, it does not cost them short term sales.
---
Nerfed Demolition Expert but it still works with legacy exploding weapons.
---
That’s what I did last night. That’s what I guess I’m doing this morning. How do I make sure it never happens again?
---
”Please add more microtransactions”
---
I thought we wanted to move AWAY from those. Meanwhile we have this sub begging for more on a daily basis. 
---
Good luck on ever getting Bethesda to go back to the golden days.
---
Unfortunately not, no. I just happened to come across the one for outfits awhile back when I was looking up pricing for a few pieces I picked up.
---
Go to toxic Larry's. It'll get both of them done... 3 glowing snallygasters
---
ESO is honestly more of a grind than this games challenges.
---
In fact tbqh these dailies and weekly's are simple enough to be done within a 2-3 hour sitting if you're really dedicated and don't want to waste alot of time on them.
---
Fear of missing out.
---
Fear Of Missing Out
---
You have a very nice CAMP. :) The Kidz Zone is a cute idea and I'm absolutely in love with your little bedroom and how the Mothman effigy looks with the star wall!
---
Ctrl+Z
---
At level 18 Charleston trainyard has a grafton monster in the dried up river. Keep heading south into the ash heap and you should find a glowing mole miner or glowing mole rat
---
I'm pretty sure it takes 10%
---
Glowing mole rats complete the challenge
---
I just gift the legendary's that I don't have space for to whichever vendor has something i want at a good deal, or whomever is at my vending machine when i am at camp.
---
Reddit moderators have a reputation for over zealously removing comments containing expletives.
---
I now just take reasonable precautions because it is boring having to edit a post and resubmit.  👍
---
This topic is brought up almost everyday and just like the topic there is someone who has never heard it.
---
Bethesda really needs to make this more well known.
---
I'm either 27 or 28 rn
---
This is awesome! I will indeed have a f'ed day 🤗
---
Yeah I bought it when I was on earlier and did a test build. Id say around 10% is about right. Not great but not terrible either I guess
---
Have you sent a bug report?
---
Same for me!
---
Yeah, I build specifically with the terrain. So if I want to move, I'd have to build a completely new CAMP, which feels kind of daunting.
---
He sells without fail every Sunday for me. I don’t know if it’s a bug etc as a lot of people seem to have issue with it, and his dialogue definitely doesn’t fit his timeframe and is misleading, as he doesn’t restock for the player when they visit for their first gold stack, it seems to be a set scale on server end of every 7 days beginning Sunday.
---
I would love to use the new glowing stars skins on ceilings.
---
Gold 😂🤣😂
---
The ground textures need fixing. Simple job for an artist, but nope.
---
You make it sound like they are not the same thing..
---
Yes some logic here.  You're quite right.
---
Raiders have an exploit with their rep that Bethesda hasn't fully patched, so Settlers are generally harder to raise....especially with the bug when turning in Ward's stolen item and it doesnt actually reward rep despite bringing up the bar.
---
I would love to make this idea real but probably won’t happened or at least not happen soon. Spread the world maybe can become true. (I doubt but I can hope)
---
Plz
---
Big F. Did you tell him it was an accident? Haha.
---
I was completely insane at that point...I would have bought a missile for 2 caps!
---
Finally. Someone with the guts to stay up all night.
---
Well you obviously never built a settlement in Fallout 4. The Engine is not the problem, and the netcode is supposed to be newly written for this game. But anyway i'am nitpicking.
---
Yes, you can replace your current pet by successfully taming a new one.
---
Hell yeah!
---
Or only make them only killable by the 'owner'. I've never bothered getting a pet because I don't like the notion that any player or wonky CAMP load-in can just kill it.
---
I just gotta other idea, maybe we can build robot like fallout 4 to protect the vault, inside and outside and maybe the outside you can build own small town but this happened vault have instance and outside of main man but maybe in mountain of West Virginia and can see map from location. Be cool if you can see Watoga or even see queen get nuke from the outside of your vault. :D
---
I sometimes see these ''rare and valuable'' outfits for sale for very cheap (100-500 caps), but I never buy them because they are ugly and I would never use them. If caps had value I would probably buy them to resell them tho...
---
~~What exploit?~~  Edit: nevermind I don't want to know.
---
But what about after the Vault raid?      
---
Does one side give an advantage over the other?
---
It’s stunning looks really cool I love the design. I have a similar floating build but I’m struggling to get another floor up for some reason it won’t snap on I want all my stations on one floor and living room bed etc upstairs . Jeez I built a whole vault in F4 and now am struggling to snap another floor! Tried taking most of my roof off and jumping up there to try &amp; snap it on from there but it still won’t work building is just so much more difficult for me in F76 for some reason (PS4) it just keeps saying object is floating etc..🤷🏼‍♀️
---
But most people who post that the grind sucks want it to be easy and get all the items for no grind
---
And me. Every week. In fact this week he said he had an extra 1800 as some dude hadn’t been in for awhile.
---
Find a bush and chill while you do something else. I've stopped opening boxes for gear unless I have to kill a creature that day.
---
I wonder if that will be a feature that comes around instanced camps that they are talking about on the road map.
---
I'm pretty sure the xp requirement to lvl up doesn't change after you lvl 50. So it doesn't matter what lvl someone is as long as they're 50+
---
Same. I'm cooped up unable to work, but this gives me something to realllllly work on and show progress...even if it's just a hobby.
---
Is that counting the double score weekends?
---
Not always glowing, but usually one for sure.
---
Nice. I'm rank 34. No doubt we'll easily get this.
---
terrific. thanks for the LOL.
---
There's usually 2 snallys by the ruined bridge in Charleston on the other side of the capital from the grafton monster too
---
I'm running 2 to 3 accounts/xbox's at the same time usually ... I'm not even burnt out yet nor do I think I will be. Being stuck at home with nothing productive to do it's a very good distraction from things.
---
??? But anyone can pick but the bioluminescents from the corpses ??? It's like in project paradise, no matter who kills the rad stag any player can pick the meat, but the meat is shared, so it can't be looted by several players simultaneously.
---
I'm somewhere around 23-24 but still have some of the weeklies to complete for this week.
---
You do know there are some events that can be knocked out in 30 seconds or less lol?
---
if you have a free slot, start a char, go directly to grab the perk cards on the table and delete it.. 2 minutes.
---
Bethesda needs a revenue stream of some kind to justify keeping the lights on for multiplayer.  And what about new content like Wastelanders, and the upcoming Brotherhood of Steel stuff?
---
If someone is playing the game so much that having that scrap box becomes a **(must have)** then they can shell out the $13 or $8 a month for the 1st subscription.  That's the cost of a movie ticket once per month for what's probably the game playing time equivalent of 20 to 50+ movies in that month.
---
Sorry but I've got no sympathy, I just pay my $13.
---
This would be great on the personal terminal.
---
That still doesnt explain how he was able to trigger pvp on u...
---
But still nice lil story maman...
---
I live down the street from a [streetcar diner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chadwick_Square_Diner) built in 1930. So I know all about it.
---
The bundle is "donut shop," not "classic Americana." They don't build a fucking Dunkin's in streetcars.
---
It’s only a job if u treat it as such. Just keep having fun and running around
---
You’re not alone, I spent a good 20 minutes looking for it too
---
Good to know thanks
---
Not a good Idea. The current system is made to adapt the reset timers to the player timezone or the time you can play the game. We Just need a way to see all timers.
---
Can't speak of exploits on here anyways. The only advantage/disadvantage is your access to the higher rep gear before the other side. So go with that. You can always decide to split the gold evenly with them. You miss out on 1,000 gold but you can get 1,700 max gold a week and rep is harder to get then gold IMO.
---
Unfortunately yes. But hey, entitled people gunna be entitled, can't do much about that.
---
Nah Im good without any exploits.
---
Dream on. There problem with auto completion has been around for over a year. You think that they have the ability to fix it in that timetable?
---
Yes, no reply yet. I may have messed up the ticket submission the system is so awkward.
---
Forced is the wrong word there. Nothing is forced on you. You can choose to do the grind if u want the items.
---
Hes just hideing hus watercooled bonesaw...
---
I'll pay Cranberry Relish for all that sweet gold.
---
 ^^^ someone didn’t have his Wheaties this morning
---
Gatekeep quests behind a paywall? People would love that.
---
No more useless atomic shop items plssss...
---
I want Dogmeat as a companion or nothing...
---
#1 &amp; #3
---
I see regular food selling more like a role play thingy... It kind of cool but in reality you can eat spoiled/raw food literally taking it from the ground in the game and then pop antibiotics to remove side-effects (which are low anyways). 
---
Now if we could freeze something like cranberry relish (+25% XP buff with proper mutations/teams), Brainbombs (+7.5 INT etc) that would be nice from vending perspective as this is something that could sell for game play reasons. Keeping that stuff in regular containers make them spoil quite fast.
---
Many people have calculated it and gotten vastly different scores. Some say they can make it with weeks to spare
---
If it was unclear, I have a set of ss armor, but mean to sell my other set which is good enough for vendor. With the upcoming perks, I was wondering id the ss set has gotten a tag, light,sturdy,heavy, so I can sell or sprap my older set, which Ive been keeping just in case
---
Wouldn't count on it. 
---
Remember, they let players continue to lose things from the vendors and punch bowls and only acted when the dupe was publicly spread. I really doubt they're that concerned about players losing out on score points.
---
after losing a fuck ton of score i kinda dont care now beth can almost never get anything to work right so just abuse the fuck out of it
---
Yeah, it does. I have a JE gatling plasma and the change with the demo expert perk is big.
---
Any game I play I shoot the chickens, if there are any. Because of skyrim.  
---
It's like checking if fire can burn you in a game.
---
You got a point, i didn't think about it like that, thanks 👍
---
I looted the box. I was hoping for something a little better than a raider and his dog but it was still a nice little encounter
---
Just getting out off blue
---
Just getting out of blue
---
Takes you as much EXP to reach level 999 as it does to reach level 101, bud.
---
Have my upvote
---
Yes no junk on the ground.
---
Yes it disappears on the ground
---
&gt; I'm personally well ahead of schedule of score needed/ days available 
---
There's a schedule???
---
Somehow I missed that -- what's the deadline?
---
I know what you're trying to say, but your last sentence up there doesn't make much sense. As far as I'm aware (please correct me if I missed something in the patch notes *again*) it's just gonna be a standard double XP weekend, so the only extra s.c.o.r.e. that folks will grind will come from the repeatable weekly (1oo score for every 10k xp). And it seems like that one challenge is safe from autocompleting.
---
What you mean is that lots of people will just throw the towel if next week's challenges will autocomplete on them, right? I agree, but everyone can avoid that fuckup easily enough (and I'll repeat this all week): **DON'T GO TO THE ATOMIC STORE, NW, OR THE LEGENDARY RUN S.C.O.R.E. BOARD FIRST THING AFTER A DAILY OR WEEKLY CHALLENGE RESET. LOG INTO AN ADVENTURE OR PRIVATE SERVER FIRST, AND YOUR CHALLENGES ARE SAFE.**
---
No. I a had a French style omelet, toast with butter and blueberry jam and jet fueled coffee.
---
I guess next time no pass just throw all the items into the atom shop
---
It doesn’t take a genius to assume that if you’re friend were to leave the server temporarily, their camp wouldn’t get blown up
---
No. Actual content should not be behind a paywall.
---
It probably won't help you get the SCORE reimbursed from what I've seen, but perhaps there will be an effect if the support team gets inundated with messages from those screwed by the bug.
---
Again, the absolute only time that you can be killed is when you absentmindedly take a work shop with pacifist enabled.
---
Do you have screenshots of the map locations?
---
There is a double xp weekend followed by a double daily score weekend on the community calendar.
---
I think you or someone else needs to kill it first before you can get a new one but I'm not 100 %
---
Use this. I'm convinced the last day is September 14th, which is 68 days from now. [https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/score.html](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/score.html)
---
Yes. Fo4 had mods that allowed for a keyring I think.
---
&gt; This game has single handedly been the worst gaming experience I’ve had in my life.
---
Stop playing.
---
Seriously, this isn't me being pithy. If you hate the game this much, if it's such a miserable experience, don't waste your time on it. Find a game you enjoy more.
---
This-is-fucking-brilliant
---
(Instant idea steal inc.) 
---
Well done!
---
There's a double SCORE weekend a week after the Double XP one.
---
Totally agree
---
I can tell you what will happen; nothing till a shitstorm starts at double score we. If enough players complaining we will get “we are investigating the problem, stay tuned.”If not we have to wait another few week till more players join the riot after they realize they can’t complete without spending money.  Than finally there will be either get a “we are sorry” event or extended time for score board.
---
It is from [this interview](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/gsbntt/news_new_interview_with_jeff_and_ferret_one/) that One Wasteland will remove negative survival elements. According to the latest [road map update](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/55xUO5myjkzlgAewWjzCxl/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-july-updates), One Wasteland will launch with patch 22.
---
I'm in the same boat, picked up on the summer sale and although haven't played as much, lvl 9, I've been loving it so far. This is my first fallout. 
---
And the content creators for this game definitely have some weird goals it seems like
---
I have three points endurance. Try bringing a vampires weapon, equip first aid and nerd rage for when you get low. Dodgy perk is also good.
---
Are you in PA or out of PA? I've personally never used close 70. And I tend to take all three pylons and damage sheep
---
It’s still working for me.
---
Even better idea. Simply make events give score.
---
Why does the dog get a house and the cat get a bowl? Why cant the cat have a bed. Lol
---
Yes it works. It works on my TSE Gauss Rifle, I can't imagine it wouldn't work on any other legacies.
---
Flatwoods has a few bags
---
Never had i play a game where such bullshit was done. I dont play the same hour every day. Its beyond fuckin stupid, that gold machines, vendors and legendary scrip machine all have seperate timer. WHHYYYY!?!?
---
STANDING AT THE CONCESSION
---
I always check the shop before I log on and it hasn't yet. I have heard multiple people say playing NW is the issue. I'm on XB1 but I doubt that changes much.
---
nope
---
Every one has some rads only really non radiated people come from vaults or certain government facilities on sea. Rest of people are just freakin mutants.
---
HAHAH omg.... yeah I didn't even remember that. Last time I played 3 was.... idk. Maybe in 2010? xD But man, that's just sad.
---
Good to know, thanks.
---
Go south from Monongah mine until you see a cage being suspended over a mine cart track. The support for the suspended cage is weighed down with quite a few bags of concrete.
---
I would be happy if they just added a new map.
---
Pretty sure it is heavy. But it doesn't let you know. I'd keep you old pieces (on a mule if needs be) till the legendary perks comes out. Someone will test it and we'd know then.
---
Yes there is one very specific method for cancelling a nuke launch.... Oh wait, it's way too late now, never mind.
---
I want all the Animal Crossing emotes and I'm not even joking.
---
Yea it doesnt work like that. It pisses me off is what it does. So one day i play at this hour, but next day if i have more free time, i have to wait to do anything useful to the time i played yesterday? There is no logical explanation to this, other than it was easier that way, so they didnt bother to do it the way that doesnt make players play at specific hours..
---
Have my upvote.
---
That was a bug and has been patched. You do not get NW cards in adventure mode.
---
that is false
---
I don't use neither, blocker couse is too much desync to use it in time.
---
Bethesda be like "hi gamers here is another 3 week grind for you to complete to earn mediocre rewards and is incredibly bugged. Hope you have fun and dont forget about fallout 1st haha :)"
---
This actually use to happen with bloody builds and buffout.
---
I can do that
---
I think it’s pretty damn balanced...
---
And yea... if you happen to be able to get nuke codes and briefcase you should be able to do some damage. It’s no easy feet.
---
In the PTS, Secret Service armor was classified as heavy for legendary perk purposes, while Scout armor was, I think, classified as light.
---
The ammo converter does what it says on the tin. It converters ammo.
---
That said the interface is the worst, most painful thing to use. Its not impractical but you do have to just mash the A/X/left mouse button in order to use it.
---
So I guess it is a Chindogu.
---
Well, sorry to break it to you pal, but if someone unfriends you, just beacuse you dropped a nuke on their forehead, can you really call that person a friend?
---
That's what I thought may be the issue. Mine has not worked at all since the update.
---
Buy plan. Craft and scrap
---
I read the note, then looted then box, then I looted the raider.
---
Hello, I'm not sure if there is any way to officially report bugs but perhaps if I comment here someone from Bethesda might see it. Since the latest patch VATS targeting appears to be bugged. It misses multiple 95% shots again and again and then happens again on the next enemy. Sometimes it works fine but a lot of the time it doesn't. As you can imagine this is wasting huge amounts of ammo over time.
---
They get lost in the grass. Much better to melee and pick them up immediately.
---
Please do, and if you feel like it post pictures when you're done :).
---
Well supposedly we are supposed to be getting a new pet system soon since the taming function is so broken but that seems to have put by the wayside and no new news. Besides building your base on the bar in the ash heap that has a named cat linked to it it is not possible to get a dog or cat, maybe a feral hound or something.
---
&gt;DON'T GO TO THE ATOMIC STORE, NW, OR THE LEGENDARY RUN S.C.O.R.E. BOARD FIRST THING AFTER A DAILY OR WEEKLY CHALLENGE RESET. LOG INTO AN ADVENTURE OR PRIVATE SERVER FIRST, AND YOUR CHALLENGES ARE SAFE.
---
This is false. I have had the bug happen to me doing exactly that.
---
FYI always equip white knight when repairing armor. Save your fiber big time.
---
Lol. Yep and my luck sucks
---
Broken builds that need to be nerfed and hacked weapons
---
\*Double Dailies
---
If I had known the benefits of squirrel and tatos I would have hoarded them during Fascnacht.
---
Nice
---
Fancy
---
Thank you! I appreciate the compliment, the bedroom is simple, yet I find it quite charming too. The bed is hilarious, its so small when you sleep in it you tuck your legs up and stuff.
---
Toxic larry's meat and go always spawns 3x snallygasters. However since it's in the savage divide they will be high level.
---
Behind hemlock holes there is a Grafton monster and if you are lucky 2 snallygasters will spawn there as well sometimes.  3 cryptids in one spot.
---
Yeah, i just did it manually
---
It's just not working for me, it's pissing me off.
---
Francy
---
You're first obstacle will be convincing 95% of the Fallout playerbase that PVP is a good idea in fo76. 
---
 As long as gear have legendary effects PVP will never be good in fallout 76.
---
I’m a 1st member and I would agree with this. 
---
Would really be bad rep for Beth.
---
That would be cool.  Both her, and her brother.
---
Are you serious? I got one a few days ago and didn’t pay much attention to it lol!
---
From my understanding its just completely random when and which reward you'd get.
---
Pretty much always find glowing roaches at Camden park while running the lucky mucker route.  2 in the tunnel bridge thing and 2 in the bathrooms usually.
---
For me it's unbelievably laggy for me. Frames drop to  what feels like 20fps.
---
True, it’s feels weird. Shots don’t land and some build are op at one fight then next fight it glitches and does no damage. The other day I one shot someone then next time I shot them 3 times and no damage. They gotta do a pvp overhaul or a combat overhaul in general.
---
Certain challenges like new challenges will earn you new atoms like leveling up, your world and social challenges .. not all but there are some that give you atoms on new characters.
---
If you are already level 24 you are on track. Don’t worry
---
It might be a timing thing, I had similar “stuck” bugs with the new questlines.  I make sure now to never rush the dialog - let it play out and don’t “skip”.  Seems to help.   Did all on 4 characters, since I started not skipping dialogue on new quests haven’t had the issue.   It might be coincidence though.
---
They are. It is a big though and no one knows how long they will be available for
---
All the greed in this world makes me sad...
---
Why should they be banned? They effect no one but their selfes by ruening their own game.
---
I was going to say I think he was trying to point out that theirs the caps have no value and in turn overcharge market and a marker where people value thing a lot lower based on the limits in the game. Mean 70K and say 25k caps both would be fair depending on which you go with. (3k is a steal either way hahah)
---
But scrolling down a little I think he is just trying to troll or something as he's rambling about the market where people sell stuff for real money when you never implied that.
---
Kinda hard to put eso and fallouts inv against one another since one has weight limits and one has slot limits with stack limits:
---
Legendary robots always explode. When wastelanders dropped I noticed my first time doing fertile soil event that every damn farm hand exploded. Same thing happened with a new character last week. Doesn’t seem to happen when I do the event later. Very weird bug, but made for an intense event for my level 4 character.
---
Buying and reading the plans for the four outs them in the pool?
---
If you haven’t already, completely exit the game and go back in.   Wait a few minutes before retrying as it takes a bit to reload all quest status.
---
I finally managed to find my first pet here! He's a little stunted bear but he's pretty cute stomping assertions my base. Thanks for the tip.
---
How on earth you think this is a good idea?
---
Fashion and building are the true end game 😉
---
But seriously, I agree - need moar endgame options.
---
I’m super confused here... how are they dropping a bag if they didn’t die?
---
Are they supposed to snap?
---
I would recommend you finish the quest line ASAP so you can begin collecting gold. I waited because I was just being casual, but you’re losing out on gold from a bunch of other things like completing public events. 
---
Make no mistake: the rep guide sucketh and is one of the least fun things about this game so far.
---
this works way better than it has any right to

Life time challenges do not reset in any way for new characters. All characters contribute to the progress however.
---
That’s cool! And hey no problem :)
---
I see some misinformation in the comments below so I just want to to clarify. When you make a new character, you do go up a level leaving the vault, but that one level doesn’t count for the challenge. You need to basically gain one level AFTER leaving the vault. This is super easy and what I’ve been doing for a few days now to get this challenge done in about 5-10 minutes. 
---
So, once you leave the vault, head straight for Lacey (I think her name is) to learn about the wayward. Then run to the moonshiners shack nearby to discover it. Don’t have to fight anything there. Then do the same for the lumber mill and homestead on the way to the wayward. Once you get to the wayward, just skip through all the dialog quickly, kill the intruder, and skip through more dialog. As soon as the quest ends, you’ll gain that next level.
---
Neither advebturr has the same amount of xp per lvl,but i think the curve is different on NW.
---
Yeah, the bar to the vendor on either side
---
Honestly, a great idea.
---
You probably have one of the equipment pieces in your inventory under the misc tab. You can find it in the world
---
SHHHHHHHHH
---
One can spawn in the 3/3 lock in the burrow.
---
There was a key word before forced, "feeling".  Obviously no one is forced, but it is purposefully designed to give people fomo, which in turn makes them feel forced to log on even if they aren't in the mood, or to feel bad if they simply aren't able.    
---
It's a classic f2p tactic, and it's gross.
---
Same for all players. If you’re holding one of the quest items, quest ends. Since these items occasionally spawn in the world, you didn’t have to “find” one for Ward. Don’t lose it!
---
More normal hairs that does not look like a mop
---
It’s not a miserable experience all the time. It has its ups and it has its lows but when it hits low it hits it hard. That said, there are many many games out there I simply don’t play and probably never will that could easily take the title of “worst gaming experience”
---
If I can hit 100 in 2 and a half week. Casuals can hit 100 in 2 and a half months.. Let's be real.
---
There is a certain glitch with the reputation quests. I read some recently did the previous finding the items for Vital Equipment and turn them in multiple times.
---
Now it looks like its even more advanced.
---
There is.
---
I'm pretty sure the consequence for dying is having your weapons and armor break. You don't necessarily need consequence for dying, you are already losing time compounded with the two other things. I think that's a fairly silly argument.
---
Let's say you're at the Queen, right? You want to participate. You want to help kill her. You want to tag the rest of the trash that spawns. The junk that's taken from you prevents you from playing the game. Well-designed timesinks are good. Losing everything you've gathered is not. Especially if that consequence is utterly mitigated by being a paid subscriber for private servers where you are of no consequence to have things taken from you aside from an unstable game with a bad engine.
---
Thanks, I only ask because I didn't see it stated anywhere that it was an included functionality.
---
In the burrow,there's a lvl 3 locked fence in the old raider abitated area.  It won't be easy to get there as lvl 55,since the ghouls will swarm you.
---
Yep, If you sell/destroy the item, the bug will be fixed and you can go track down the thief and kill them again if that’s what you’re wanting to do.
---
That level up doesn’t count towards the challenge though. You have to gain one level after that one. Still very easy and doesn’t take long, but I just wanted to clarify this
---
This is true... but have you seen the market subreddit?
---
People pay a lot for them.
---
Each level requires more and more score. It’s not linear. You don’t need to “beat zora”. Just make it to level 100 in 10 weeks
---
Or just put them in the game not the item shop.
---
Your math is off by about 3475. Level 1 is free
---
Some of them trade well for good weapons or lots of ammo and junk.
---
Your weapons and armor don’t break upon death.
---
Love the idea but most likely will never happen.
---
Every time I see native American stuff in a game. You get a army of people going to war with each other over is native American or Indian is correct. (which both is, a lot of natives feel native American is too over inclusive)
---
No matter the level of respect shown. If the game doesn't show white people slaughtering natives its racist for not showing their history, or the game does and its racist for killing natives.
---
Regardless if Bethesda can not be stereotypical with it (which Fallout has always all about stereotypes by design) there is no winning in today's SJW Woke times.
---
Just keep riding that wave. Will save you tons of time
---
Ahhh good to know, bad assumption on my part.
---
This isn't at all what they are talking about 
---
You are actually giving away the big secret- that everybody already knows about
---
They take damage, I'm pretty sure. Even if they didn't, that's a worthwhile swap. You take damage to your weapon/armor during combat, either way.
---
Shh! ^^It's ^^not ^^a ^^mask.
---
Tadpoles Unite they are  after us!!!
---
Uh.. I dunno what you're talking about, there is nothing buggy about Ward at all and Bethesda need not investigate these outrageous claims, he is perfectly fine thank you.
---
just happened to me, I started it up, went straight into adventure and all but one of my dailies were auto-completed
---
what is it then?
---
Just something that anyone who plays the game would have noticed and desired....
---
You make some valid points.  Play the game how you want, adding cosmetic rewards for specifics doesn't remove that ability. 
---
Everyone has to agree that some of the rewards are pretty uninspiring (I'm looking at you perk card packs).
---
I personally like some of the later cosmetics, so I'm willing to put in a bit of a grind. But no one HAS to do the pass if they don't want to. (Getting a Jangles backpack will not change how the game is played. It's just visual.)
---
I took off all my gear and it did nothing.  I tested in NW too which has no variables for my AP regen  I guess I'll test again tonight when I get home since others have conflicting information but it didnt work for me :/
---
The test pattern at the beginning is based off [a real one](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian-head_test_pattern) used throughout the 50's and 60's.
---
I put stuff in the box. Nothing happens. Also...
---
I found the mysterious pipe yesterday. Took a whiff.
---
It's in the bundle to manipulate you into buying something expensive you might not otherwise buy.
---
Too many times I think to jump in to sell off some more loot and then I see where I’m still waiting on the timer so I just exit the game because there’s no reason to playing if I can’t do anything with my results.
---
Not sure if it's just been a lucky coincidence but at dolly sods in the little gift shop there is a corpse on the floor by the cash register.  The last 3 times I've been there for stings and things the corpse has had a handmade to loot.
---
Really though, like others have said, get the plan and start crafting or you will be at this for a long time.
---
Anytime they do something in this game it’s rarely to make it more fun.
---
Aye forgot about there tbh
---
I know right. I wish people would leave Ward alone. He just wants to sleep floating in mid air in peace.
---
Robots are pretty easy to find. They're everywhere in Watoga, and more than 5 Liberators spawn right by Vault 76. Worst case there are the ones at the Whitesprings.
---
I know you were just using that as an example though, and I will agree that some of the challenges mean playing for longer than an hour for most of us.
---
That goddamn stings and things quest. Where things are marked on the map, they're never there.
---
But yeah, I got the plan for it a while ago but didn't think I could do it like that so I'll just do it that way.
---
Thanks for the tip.
---
Are you in Xbox? I can help you do both if you are.
---
Every time I get a kill a glowing creature I kill a mirelurk has for whatever reason it completes the challenge.
---
There is a Griffen monster at the far south of the forest (green area on map) nest to a power plant. Might be a challenge at level 18 but you can do it if a bit of extra ammo.
---
To clarify, it should only reward skins and add-ons for fallout 1st items, that will say items that's already behind a paywall and these quests shouldn't be hour long quest, but instead of just clicking a button in the atom shop it'd be funnier to have a small quest to get a skin for the bog wanderer outfit or the tents. 
---
And it shouldn't reward much xp/caps or not at all. 
---
The same quest could also be available to non 1st players and reward something else that evens it out.
---
People used it for a month and now can’t not use it so they want it for free since they believe they can’t live without it
---
Yeah that’s true, there are quite a few places for the cryptid stuff. I usually just go to the mire or bog and forget about the stuff in the toxic valley and divide.
---
Aren't the outfits already behind a paywall, or is that not content? 🤔
---
If you die during an event your bag doesn't drop. 
---
After the event fair game so always go for a stash box if you don't want to lose anything gained from the event.
---
I’ve done all that plus every questline. If you go out of your way to not progress, acting like you’ve somehow found a loophole in the game is asinine. This game is what you make of it, if you intentionally don’t finish, is what you’re saying. Ok. I get repeating the same tasks might amuse some people, others want a little more from the game than taking their thousandth workshop.
---
Gnarled shallows north east in the mire.
---
Always has 3 submerged anglers, one closest to the big tree is always glowing.
---
Anglers count as cryptid.
---
Get both checked off in 1 kill.
---
Wouldn’t call it content. More cosmetics
---
Naaaa.  Its all magic weapons.
---
Your comment might get downvoted to hell but this need to be heard
---
Stopped 4 days ago doing the board. There’s nothing fun about it.
---
They don't but I know I get atoms for certain things like leveling up, so there are a few that kick off. I was surprised as well.
---
This
---
Shadowed works on thorn. Search angry turtle
---
you two been waiting since release at the vault door for someone? now thats real love.
---
The best part is you can fight the SBQ day 1 so it’s really not even endgame.
---
Ive done this daily on all 5 characters every damn day without missing a day since wastelanders and have never been lucky enough to have this happen..   :(
---
It’s not that simple man. It happened to me on Saturday. I launched the game in the afternoon hours after the reset. Joined a world right away. All but 2 dailies were completed already including the “complete 5 daily challenges” even though only 4 dailies were checked off.
---
Literally everytime I see "Have a ... day" I immediately think "Have a *good* day", I can't be the only one who thinks this right XD  
---
Scarred for life by the L.A. Beast  I suppose lol.
---
I'm on Xbox, but thank you! What's your build look like? Perks and Mutations, specifically?
---
Thank you.
---
The UK [had this creepy thing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Card_F) for a long time on the BBC.
---
And then when you do absolutely nothing happens. It’s never acknowledged or matters. You don’t get a credits scene. The Overseer will comment on it and that’s that.
---
I find stashing junk and sitting at Vault 76 looking at the wonderful view works. 
---
Although did have one guy turn up look at me jump onto the bench next to me and proceeded to drop a packed lunch in a bag for me haha.
---
I’m at the beach all week. Glad they didn’t release any good costumes, I’d be bummed if I was away when they did
---
Yeah, I think that's bad design. And that isn't always true, no. Sometimes, you can lose your junk after an event. There are times where mobs can spawn and still kill you after an event. Anywhere. Radiation Rumble and Scourch Queen. I don't think the problem here is to argue 'fair game' because that isn't the point, the point is its a stupid system that has no purpose in the game other then to make you more miserable. It's dropping on the gamerpass soon, which will guarantee far more players giving it a try then ever before. That might stick with it. I'm sure the hordes of players that swing in here might agree. I think a lot already do, frankly. 
---
But R/FO76 is also full of people who are unabashedly sole supporters of Bethesda and do not believe that you are free to criticize the product despite being a consumer. You are allowed to do so.
---
It's a problem the game has that could no longer be a problem. It'd make everyone happy. It'd make a miserable thing less miserable. There is no losing. There is only winning.
---
SCORE should be renamed CHORE, amirite?!
---
Fallout 76 has mannequins. Problem is Bethesda just forgot about them.   
---
Hackers spawned them in from the game files and had them at their CAMP.   
---
With armor on them. SH Games did a whole bit on it ages ago.
---
Can't believe you got downvoted for this lol.  The ticket system is abysmal.  They try to pidgeon hole you into picking a certain category and it just so manages to always happeb where the issue you are having is literally NEVER one of them lol.
---
I too want two main things fixed. The game, and it’s content.
---
I got on 5hks morning after not playing at all yesterday and 5 of my daily and two weekly's have auto finished, without giving me score. This is the first time I've been really disappointed playing this game since I've had it and given the limited time to finish, probably won't keep playing as much anymore if this is going to happen.
---
I would prefer a profile systems, do you can have different configs for different usages.
---
Skipped most because after that walk of text you just seem salty about losing loot. Systems fair we need a penalty for death. Otherwise what's the risk. Plus people don't always steal your bag. I've had some people sit on my bag waiting for me to return. Goes both ways.
---
That’s just normal combat. They should be a reason to avoid death, otherwise why would you even bother with stimpacks?
---
perk loadouts are coming. So maybe then
---
There are players who take it real serious like I'm extremely serious about my max dmg build, I can deal well 15k but only if she lands.
---
But I grind my best weapons from legendary enemy runs, atoms take too long.
---
No, it's merely a mediocre thing that is deemed to the Worst Thing Ever by people so spoiled by technological marvels that they think themselves hard done if they had to twitch their finger five times instead of three.
---
Hoepfully its not like the burrows and just super disappointing and easy.
---
I really really want the captain cosmos costume at the end, but I know that I will never dedicate that much time to grind. Took me a couple hours just to get to level 3.
---
I imagine it would take me about 3 months to complete it all, and I didn’t enjoy getting to level 3.
---
I would rather just pay to win in this case than endlessly grind. I think I’ll sit this game out for awhile, while checking each week for cool costumes in the atom store
---
I usually have pretty good luck finding Snally's at Willard Corporate Housing in the Toxic Valley (SE of the Wavy Willard - the big green gator at the top of the map).  This area should be well within your XP level.  Plus some of the Snally's will spawn Glowing - so two birds, one stone.
---
i said no bootlickers because your opinion is shit there are plenty of ways to award consequence for death its garbage and its trash and whether or not people do doesnt mean shit because it can happen and that's the bottomline
---
You could have just came on here and asked :p
---
because you have to wait to respawn? you lose time fighting mobs? you don't get to tag shit? i'm pretty sure people use stimpacks not because they're gonna lose their junk, but because they want to participate and actually do the shit they're trying to do lol
---
Might as well get the experience points 
---
As little as they may be, you don't get anything for quitting
---
Curious about the details of your Gatling? Thanks
---
I think the "its just not for you" attitude just ins't a good one.  It SHOULD be for everyone, or at least beth should WANT it to be for as many people as possible.  This system is likely going to be the bulk of day to day engagement from here on out.    
---
I know I have quite playing multiple times for lack of something to do, and if people feel that seasons aren't for them, I can't see why they wouldn't do the same, and a lot of them won't come back.    
---
Hopefully they allow some kind of points banking (like pretty much every other pass system) but I still think the time requirement is too high myself.  I play two other games with passes (Rocket League, and MTG Arena) and both are considerably less than 7 hours a week, and a ton less than 14 to get all the rewards.  Obviously not every pass is going to be as casual, but the whole point of passes is day to day engagement.  People shouldn't feel like it's daunting.    
---
SCORE shouldn't have even been based on these mini quests IMO.  It should have just straight been based on regular gameplay, XP, doing quests, legendary kills etc, with a weekly max points so people can do what they feel like doing at their own pace.
---
Agreeing that a game doesn't need a change to this system doesn't make anyone a bootlicker. Plenty of other more serious problems that need sorting WAY before this that actually do ruin the game. 
---
Adding "Changing Lootbag drops because Snowflake here lost a few pounds of Junk and couldn't handle it" is what I'd call Bottom of the List changes.
---
I agree with you. A 100%
---
I came back after a year off and decided to make a new character. I didn't mule any stuff over to them and walk most places. So far the game has been fresh and really fun.
---
I’ll give that a try, thanks!
---
Man I have debated in the past moving my camp, the the spot I have is just so great.  I know i can always move back but I've been at the same spot with the same build for like a year, hate to undo it all.
---
How about this. This is just a trade post trying to look like post that doesn't go against the rules. So it should be reported.
---
Lol downvoted too hell because I’d of been savage if the player killed me in return and took all my stuff, even though i tried to return his......ok
---
'snowflake' lol you have nothing of value to offer in any constructive conversation to begin with.
---
yes, the game has plenty of problems that need resolution. several, as a matter of fact. i'm pretty sure this is one of them. it's trite meaningless and does nothing for anyone. it doesn't even necessarily make stuff more challenging. 
---
anyways we're done here, any credibility you might've had went out the window when you thought 'snowflake' was a credible insult because im shitting on a system that's just shit to begin with
---
I dont understand why they cant just pick one reset time for everyone — make it midnight the studio’s time. Why do we all need individual timers for everything when they also dont provide in-game timers to check when they reset?!
---
&gt; I know this came off rough but fuck man it’s so frustrating when i wanna play Fallout 76 but Fallout 76 doesn’t want me to play Fallout 76. 
---
This is my primary feeling as well.  I really do like the game, but they make it so hard for me to feel good about logging on.
---
Agreed.  I'll spawn at my own camp and hang around for awhile waiting for my camp to magically materialize from the ether before my eyes.  My budget is completely maxed.  I had to scrap corn just to plant gourds!
---
So you can't have everything today or tomorrow.  Just play the game and don't worry so much about things you can't control and have to have over things you want to have.  It's a game and it takes time.  Just grind, the Gauss minigun is awesome!!!
---
ZIP IT
---
Hmmm downvoted too hell because i would of been savage if the player killed me and took all my stuff, even though i tried to return it......ok
---
Or at least have a set friggen time script resets. Jesus tap dancing christ this is the thing i hear the most in my group "let me see if my script reset". 90% of the time it has not. So aggravating.
---
i'd much prefer to see tiered weekly challenges than daily and weekly
---
so what exactly takes you more than 15 minutes?
---
That's... terrifying.
---
The powerfist.the pa damage is actually useful. And the pf is just the better weapon over all. They have the same base damage but the puncturing mod give the pf a slight edge
---
+this. DM any level 200+. They’ll usually be more than happy to give you excess junk they have. When I was a lvl 25 I needed black titanium scraps. Just messaged a random lvl 250 player if I could have 20 or so scraps to finish my excavator armor. He showed up to my location within minutes and dropped 100.
---
I'm level 729. Got all 3 of my level ups last night in maybe 3 hours... It's like mjs says. If you're using the right build and buffs, leveling up is a breeze. 
---
With full Unyielding, Leader Bobbleheads, Cranberry Relish &amp; Brain Bombs (with the Herbivore mutation), a full Building team, Shielded Casual underarmor, Night Person, Well-Rested, Berry Mentats and a Lunchbox.... I was getting 820 XP from each SM Warlord I killed on my route.
---
They were attacking another guy and I came over to check what was going on and then they started attacking me, and level 8 me thought I could take them on and boy was I wrong
---
no thanks
---
Power fist, limb damage isn't that useful and that power attack bonus it makes a massive difference on tougher enemies. But might aswell hold onto that DCG until you get a swing speed or power attack one since its 90% reduced weight
---
Welcome to FO76. Your a bit late. Been here sense beta lol Fair warning its going to consume allot of your time. XD
---
I think the ammo converter is more useful for lower level players, who don't have the perks yet. What I'd suggest is for some sort of upgrade for higher levels.
---
Or Todd.
---
Personally, I like to think of it as a "Space Race." To get to level 100, Almost half way there and I'm still enjoying it.
---
\+300 hours.  no interest in fallout 1st.
---
oh you must have a scrapbox.....then pay for it.
---
some of us don't equate making an easy game even easier with having more fun. we enjoy earning our inventory management degrees.
---
have a downvote for entitled whining :)
---
Find me someone who plays this game who wouldn't prefer that?  Free DLC is just the rallying cry for people to justify the greedy and predatory monetization strategy.
---
Most of the complaints I’ve seen revolve around timegating and needing to sign in every day. People have repeatedly said they don’t mind a grind, but want to the option to do big chunks of it during weekends. 
---
Sure, there are those who just want something for nothing, but a lot of folk have been far more specific and justified in their critiques.
---
I would consider myself an end-game player.  Have done everything you can imagine, Character levels at 463, 222, 193, 154, 151. 1100+ hours.  Even went to Vault 94 and back again.  I complete my daily challenges everyday in like a few minutes.  My weeklies were all done before I got off yesterday as well and I managed to hit the XP repeatable probably about 15 times.  As an end-game player it is EASIER for us to gain SCORE because we know where things are on the map and how to do things efficiently.  Even if you "only farm queens" you can take like 10 minutes out of your session to do the dailies.  
---
Compared to a game like Modern warfare, it takes exponentially less play-time for me to rank up the 76 battle pass.  It's actually brain-dead easy.  
---
You do have a valid point that battle pass items should not be available later on.  People who were here for the inaugural season should have exclusive stuff for that.
---
I only wear power armor for the boss fights. Carry a suit around with me but 90% of the time I'm using legendary combat armor and underarmor. Most high level veterans don't use power armor all the time. 
---
The emergency protocols mod and the radiation resistance of power armor can't be beat, though. Plus it does make me a little more tanky. So even at high levels and late in the game it has its place.
---
Yeah, and it was predominantly on overnight!
---
Asd to the list:
---
F**k You

Salt Bae
---
True I love to see melee player in pvp it’s always a fun time I didn’t want to be rude befor bro hope to fight ya soon
---
It’s a tactic that you yourself need to learn to not give in if you truly hate it
---
I was very pleased!
---
&gt;people are complaining about being burnt out
---
Maybe that means there's a problem with how the system is?
---
Are you on PS4?
---
I sold off my PVP setup when it became apparent it was a waste of legendary star slots, but I'd be happy for a duel sometime
---
Not even Bethesda can contain him! He's constantly flying through the bed doing the getting out animation for me but at least he's on his bed lol.
---
Level 340 here, 1k+ hours in. It takes me all of 10 minutes to do my dailys. And less than an hour to knock the weeklys out. They are a chore and not something I really enjoy doing. But they're not a huge inconvenience either. I do not love the new system at all. But it's not a huge deal
---
I uninstalled the game.
---
BGS said waay back they where going to change how legendary looting works so we should get it between 2021 and 2030. ish. maybe.
---
Upvoted because I saw it in game as well
---
This is exactly my experience.  The thing works fine usually and then suddenly it does nothing at all.
---
shhh, don't say anything! They'll hear you
---
That didn't turn out bad at all.
---
Yes, I've wanted a new vending machine that acts like a freezer door you'd see any any super market for some time. The vending machine itself could just be a separate one that HAS the spoil reduction to something like 90% or even 100% because its FROZEN. Make certain things unfreezable if needed idc, but these XP boosting items need to be sold I over did the farming...and can't profit from it.
---
Produce stand for veggies, meat locker/freezer for meats, go nuts.

I've seen some drop from killing blood eagles, so maybe  clear out their places to get a few? I'm about to go through the same issue on pc since I started from scratch over there. Found a bloodied handmade but don't have the mods learned to go with my commando build over there.
---
You have an interesting way to write "20 minutes". And who exactly forces you? 
---
I'm not a hardcore player, i just play my two characters for 1-3 hours an evening, and i'm already at stage 21.
---
Maybe my point about high level players isn’t very clear, it doesn’t get harder it would be easier but more less enjoyable to go out of your way to do it, and it’s more to get across the point that there’s still no endgame.
---
Broken furious effect on some certain weapons. I use a 2* Bloodied Limb Damage LMG on my power armor character and have to hold back if others want to get anything off of her.
---
What they need to come up with are bike racks, I know there must be a million bikes in Denmark.  Actually, they should give us the ability to ride a bike from place to place in FO76 since none of the cars are operable.  And why is that?
---
lel, this is gold
---
Haha, no we just tried again after all this time, were too frustrated back then
---
SBQ came to the wrong neighborhood. Motherfucker.
---
Get rid of the NW requirement altogether.  Give NW players a 50% xp boost, since XP comes slowly in NW.  Everybody wins, since that would incentivize the NW mode for players who actually want to try it.  Stop with the arm twisting.
---
See my other reply.  FEELING forced.
---
You know what? I think j will have a fucked day. Thanks. (This is like “ bad” right? Fucked is good right?)

[No, its a real world thing.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian-head_test_pattern)
---
Correct, but it is so much easier to blame something on the company if you are not willing to change your attitude towards "the thing" just a tiny bit. If you aren't in control of your FOMO, it is *your* problem. It is a game, not the real life. Nobody dies because you don't reach stage 100.
---
Lol. A loading screen is not an adequate consequence to dying. 
---
Without a consequence to dying you can just brute force any quest. Talk about bad design.
---
I have seen ONE and I was just a little tardy to the party to fight it. And I've done a bunch of nukes.

Nope - it's just the legs that they've employed.

Here is the issue though they shouldn’t be a chore for the most part and should blend into base gameplay, this puts more emphasis on challenges lasting throughout the season
---
This looks so good! I couldn't figure out the vendor bots in my camp, but you have given me some inspiration!
---
You forgot the extra hour of farming XP.  You know you do it.  Everybody does.
---
A "fucked day" would be a bad day.
---
Nothing constructive. 
---
I mentioned that your immune to dropping junk during an event. Then offered advice that after an event your junk is fair Game so go stash it immediately. 
---
That was constructive advice. You jumped into a wall of text to defend your daft idea. I merely stated that by going to such an extreme about it makes you come across as salty about losing one junk bag. 
---
Bottom line you either lost a small junk bag so who cares...
---
Or
---
You lost a HUGE junk bag worthy of this anger but sorry if this is the case that's on you for carrying so much. 
---
Either way who seriously cares about a few pounds of junk unless they are dumb yes dumb enough to be carrying a small junkyards worth.
---
Makes sense. But at this point at least they give me something to do for a bit lol. I don't do much anymore. Mainly log on and mess around anyway, just love the world and how mindless I can get
---
Its probably the health rubberband bug. Sometimes if you do enough damage to oneshot something, instead of dying, it will regen a chunk of its health. I see this all too often with my stealth shotgunner. Certain mobs are definite more prone than others though: Assaultrons for example. They are just buggy in general.
---
I mean you basically reiterated what I said, there’s no difference between a small amount of score or xp boost to go towards score?
---
Agreed.
---
Yeah, now I will start fearing this too.
---
Your problem, and *only* yours ... 
---
And you didn't answer why you need an hour to do such puny, little tasks. What was it? Kill 20 creatures (2 minutes)? kill a Cryptid (Wendigo at fixed spawns, another 2 minutes)? Level up (make a new character if your main is too high, which would be 5 minutes)? 
---
Those challenges are so undemanding that it hurts.
---
too true! I'm still baffled by that item drop lol
---
couldn't agree more :P
---
This was the first one I had seen after about a month of finally having the perk. 
---
Were they more common before? 
---
Here's hoping more animals are found.
---
Eh on my alt, level 70, the level up takes me like 30 minutes. I just run west tek 2 or 3 times and it's done. I run full unyilding and r3 inspirational though. So it comes relatively quick
---
People are already at level 50. It’s totally doable.
---
The robots seem to only wake up when you walk up to them, not 100% sure though since I've only had a few minutes to mess around with them.
---
Oh yes there’s a lot of bikes! 
---
Would actually be real fun to ride around
---
Ahh okay.  I misunderstood your post then.  It's still quite early.
---
I mean, I can see how the challenges aren't exactly fun for people who have been around for awhile but.. (and I'm willing to accept I'm just weird this way) I kind of enjoy the charm of the challenges and getting home from work every day and having these challenges to do.  Some of them take me to places I haven't been in a bit or just break up the general monotony of my normal grinding.  It takes so little time I don't really have time to even think like "oh this sucks".
---
You're right that the distinct lack of any end-game progression content for groups is the biggest non-technical issue with this game right now.  Ever since vault 94 closed we don't have a single piece of difficult content to try our hand at.  All of my end-game Vault raider friends pretty much up and quit when that happened.  We really need something like 94 back but I am worried that people will once again just piss and moan that it's too hard for them to do solo and it will just get closed or nerfed.
---
Those didn't affect their monetary gain. This does, directly, in fact. Zenimax will want people held accountable. Bethesda will have much lower figures than they presented when they presented this idea.
---
Good.  I hope no one spends a cent on seasons.
---
Except NW xp doesn’t currently could for the 10K weekly
---
do the photo glitch through the doors and silos only take 8 minutes.
---
Rank 18. I think.
---
Putting in pretty minimal effort. Don't really care about most of the rewards. I've gotten most of the daily and weekly challenges done but if I miss one or two I'm not fretting.
---
This answer is spot on.
---
It's just annoying behaviour, particularly for those who don't get to play every day, but can play for longer when they can. Bethesda will get fewer microtransactions from these people, as there will be little to no investment in anything that seems completely unobtainable, so those people likely won't play as long.
---
Can we also get an eye roll? Took a level 30 around for a few events last night. Probably five different ones. Every time it was full of glitched weapons. He got credit on maybe three regular mobs lol. I wanna make these guys feel bad at least. Using the angry face just makes them feel good I guess.
---
LOL Yas, sounds like a good time. gives the game new life with that unlimited scrap box
---
double kill
---
I have no clue about when it will reset but I know I have not materialized seed a Sunday yet. And yes, it is petty mechanics.
---
I find the things you said not overly annoying, but i get what you're saying. What sucks donkey balls is the reset of the companion quests, i *guess* they are on a 20 hour timer taht starts when you finish it? I wasn't able to do them 2 days in a row.
---
It's clearly not only my problem, there are people all over the forum that feel similarly and don't like it either.    
---
Not only do I not like it I think it's dumb design of a pass, when they have like dozens of others games with decent pass structures to cheat off of.
---
Shared cards dont stack if its the same card.
---
Did they get there legit though? I saw there was an xp glitch
---
I didnt realize, I never get to checking the datamines. It may come back in the future but as of now its only available for 26 more days
---
We had vault 94 which was really good.  Sure it was buggy on public and week 2 was pretty damn counter intuitive but weeks 1 and 3 were amazing and I can count on 1 hand the amount of issues I had with it on a private server after hundreds of runs.  But, people complained a lot about how difficult it was and how they couldn't solo it and I think this had a big part in it's demise.  I worry that if we ever get difficult group progression content again, people will eventually complain that it's too hard until it gets closed or nerfed.  Hopefully I am wrong.
---
Fingers crossed for Q4.
---
And forget to mention if insults such as snowflake invalidate opinions don't call people bootlickers. One rule for one...
---
How did you get you damage so high I've only been able to get to about 1500
---
They affect Bethesda's revenue directly with this one, actually. This is to be monetized in only a few days now. Their figures will be much lower because of the cheaters.   
---
If someone stole from you, and you had undeniable proof, would you simply say "Well they didn't effect me, only my belongings." and move on or would you get your money back?
---
There is also the chance that each proc is calculated seperately, which would mean that we could get 4x the items with a chance of 30%\^4 (0.81%)
---
They will never give a *free* respec. BEST case it would be like 2000 atoms.
---
I found him once during a nuke. While I’m fighting him and barely hanging on, another nuke was launched. I said screw it and tried to kill him before touchdown. No luck. Nuke dropped, I hightailed it right back instead of queen. Ha ha! He was dead from nuke. I collected my loot and boogied right back to queen.
---
If it works like everything else, that would be an extra 90% of the 70% not covered by your card.  So something like 93% for any particular individual.  Super duper only dupes for base craft value, not the ammosmith amout.  So that proves that this perk is already trying to cheat you anyway.
---
after they fucked up so hard and a lot of people losing a ton of score, no
---
Legit. If you know how to optimize xp (inspirational, well rested, High intelligence,cranberry relish, lunch boxes) XP is super easy to come by. Especially when you are grinding high level mobs.
---
Actually, its stupid simple. I killed a raider randomly and got an item Ward wanted, microscope or something, so whenever I get the daily the quest turns in for free and the item never leaves my inventory. Didnt even do it on purpose
---
If only that'd work
---
Apparently they don't stack...
---
Maybe we'll see
---
Damn! Thankyou for the response. Saved me some caps on this. Appreciate it!
---
This I wasn’t aware of, the fact that it works like that is so stupid.
---
any faster fire rate black powdered weapon
---
&gt; EVEN JUST DISABLE THE CHALLENGE that is tied to the Score for leveling up 
---
This cannot be done, this would basically destroy the chances of many to even get to the top which would piss many people off even more than any glitchers
---
The effects of the the exploiters is overrated, people who were going to whale are going to whale anyways.  Anyone else who spends money is likely not going to be doing it until the end to get the last few ranks.
---
I mean, you kind of already can though? Just pay a subscription and never worry about it. How is that good design? It's literally pay to win at that point. 
---
I could *maybe* see your point if they didn't have a way to circumvent it by paying a subscription for a game that wasn't supposed to have a subscription, but they do.
---
That’s a “bruh” moment
---
I honestly almost ended up with soda coming out my nose.
---
"I hope no one pays to keep the lights on".
---
I really don't understand this kind of attitude.  So bitter towards a business attempting to monetize their product.
---
you can only hold 1k script at a time so if you are at that then yea
---
Agreed.  They really need to disable the goo and ash pile effects.  If this is even possible.  Hopefully the exploiters are punished.
---
Hopefully someone wasn’t selling the mod for a lot. It’s nice to have but really not worth more than the flux that goes into it. But glad i could help!
---
Hundreds of dollars you say?
---
You serious?
---
Yeah I think a much better system would just have been getting Score points for XP, Events, Legendary kills, just regular play stuff, and obviously with some sort of banking/catchup system.
---
Okay, than the other option. Easy peasy lemon skipped a paragraph of writing, squeezy. This is directly taking from their wallet. This isn't comparable to people that have done any other exploit. This should and most likely will have repercussions.
---
Wait until lvl 45, if your are holding 1000 script already just get like one or two weapons for you to make some room for more script
---
I always hover around the 900 Scrip mark, if you're not level 50, definitely spend some on Legendary Modules.
---
Was just gonna grab it for about 6,500 at Modus but I'll let him keep it haha
---
Experience as taught me I have to go Saturday night or sometime on Sunday otherwise he won't have anything for me.
---
Two wrongs do not make a right.
---
Fasnacht proved that the upcoming DLC's will need new completely separate servers, but I know this won't probably happen, so there will be huge issues with new content ahead.
---
I think many of Vault 94's issues would have been solved if it had it's own servers.
---
I agree with you there. Xp should count regardless of where you earn it.
---
I will be to make up for those that cheat their way to the top.
---
Today, or tomorrow, or next week, or the week after, or the week after. It’s so shit
---
Hundreds of dollars, I would say.
---
Yes. I think it's been there since launch.
---
the beanie is at 13k XP, so only 1K more for the skeleton
---
To be fair a message with an offensive GG is kind of bad mannered although that guy is a moron for not expecting someone to off him when taking their workshop.
---
I’ve never heard of someone buying 1st because they don’t want someone to steal their bag. 
---
Either way we need a consequence to dying. If not this, something else.
---
on PS4 I can't snap the vendor to the bar, but I can snap the bar to the vendor, which is how I solved it.  I placed the vendor where I wanted it, and then snapped the bar to it on either side.
---
If it were a free to play game you might have an argument.  If it didn't have a very expensive item shop you might have an argument.  If it didn't have a subscription you might have an argument.    
---
How many layers of monetization do they need to heap on us?
---
Oh the plan. Yea, not worth it. Lol. At least imo. If anything you’re just way better off getting the mod itself. Screw the plan. A few hundred caps (at the most) is way better than 6,500 for something that you’re probably only going to build once.
---
but there wrong stop you doing it, and its the same issue just a different skin they have had for over a year. a lot of people are at 5k or more lost score thats 50+ times of being made to do the 10k repeatable. so really its just fixing there massive fuck up and inability to run a game
---
How is GG offensive. Thought it was Good Game as in fight was over. He left the zone didn't seek so it's all over. 
---
Did I miss this meaning changing?
---
I'll assume that those damage numbers are realistic for actual combat situations you find yourself in.
---
So, if you Power Attack when fighting the SBQ (or the upcoming Wendigo Colosssus boss), or if you like to solo her, use the Power Fist. If you don't, use whatever you like more, aesthetically. With those damage numbers, the only mob where the additional armor penetration from the Power Fist puncturing mod has any effect at all is the SBQ. And Earle and her are the only mobs where the additional power attack damage is going to make a difference.
---
Well they need to work on this right away! Hundreds of dollars! Hundreds!
---
...dude that’s a rounding error. It would cost more to fix the issue than hundreds of dollars.
---
Yeah just be careful on modules there a quarter pound each. If your banking script some of the lightweight ranged weapons are OK to hold
---
A trick I learned when I had pets:
---
Never leave the game while in your camp. If you load in somewhere else then walk to your camp, they won't die when loading into the server.
---
I had my camp near the water treatment plant, so I would always walk over there when I left the game. Then when I loaded in, I'd just walk to my camp and they'd be fine.
---
My problem was Grahm kept killing my sloth whenever he passed my camp, as I was on his route. Though this isn't a problem with all pets, just the ones that still have a red health bar after taming them, and even then not always.
---
Anyway, I gave up on animal husbandry, but hopefully this helps.
---
&gt; I’ve never heard of someone buying 1st because they don’t want someone to steal their bag.
---
is there a compelling reason to buy it other than for the unlimited junk storage? private servers are kind of okay I guess but they're less useful if you want to run events. the tent is eh. it's not useless but i can't imagine many people would pay if that was the only feature.
---
They make it pretty obvious.
---
If, like me, you're doing both sides at the same time, each faction will present you with a "siding with" quest at the same point in the story.
---
Nice thx for pointing this out, there’s probably a ton of players that could use this knowledge
---
The usual supects:
---
1: fallout 76 Update from PS home screen
---
2: PS Update vom home &gt; settings screen
---
3: disconnet WiFi Router from Power supply, wait 5 sec, connect again.
---
4: Bethesta Ticket.
---
I mean I don’t buy 1st because I don’t think it’s worth it, but yes people buy it for the scrap box alone. That seems to be the biggest draw.
---
Thanks for that, I think I'll spend some during the sale as I'm gonna hit the cap before I get anywhere near level 50 at this rate!
---
Yeah that's why I truly appreciate you stating it won't work for the one and only reason I wanted it. My caps pouch thanks you
---
I buy faithfully on Sunday. No issues on that day
---
At least mark them as wanted for the rest of the season lol
---
Well I wouldn’t say remove the challenge, I like getting score for levelling up, but they could easily fix the godmode glitch
---
This just happened to me a couple days ago, though I have no idea what event gave them to me. Been grinding the heck out of events for the scrip and public team event bonus xp. I just noticed them all in my inventory when I signed in yesterday. Fun surprise.
---
Odd choice by Bethesda to put these all in a bundle.
---
Seconded! It never really bothered me that hazmat suits don't allow anything over them, since those are usually only used for short periods of time, under specific circumstances... but the Stealth Suit is something that'd be great to use all the time. I usually don't at the moment, though, because while it's cool, sometimes I prefer a more casual look for my character.
---
Plus, well, short reason they should: if I really want to use it because of stats, but can't use outfits with it, I might be less likely to buy any additional outfits, then, since I'd never get to use them...
---
Honestly, that could be very smart strategy. He's tough! That fear attack is really neat too.
---
Idk how much money is this game making?  What is their profit margin?  We don't know.  Is it possible that this game is raking in hundreds of thousands or millions a month in profit?  I mean, I guess but based on what we know about the size of the player-base I highly doubt it.  Paying your employees and your rent and your server costs and development costs all cost money.  The subscription is totally optional and  since they spent so long giving out a crazy amount of free atoms I imagine they weren't making as much out of the atom shop as people expect either.   
---
NOTHING they have done monetization-wise with this game has been anything shocking or groundbreaking.  Battle-pass and a sub and a cosmetic cash shop have been in online multiplayer games FOR YEARS and yet in this game people can't stop whining about it and it really makes me wonder what their experience is with other online multiplayer games.
---
Well we will wait till they patch the glitched legendary mods and see how it works, for now I agree with you I just destroy things by pointing my guns at them with heavy build and currently commando can't achieve that rate of fire.
---
If only there was a way to make up for it:  
---
Disable the challenge, fix the glitch, then give us a triple SCORE event on the 21st to the 31st. Apologize for the rough start to Legendary Run and promise next month to be better.   
---
That took me about 1 minute to think up. I'm sure a handful of developers with years of training in this field and are paid hundreds to thousands more than I am can think of better.
---
For the longest time I didn't know what to do in the event, and people on here were very upset because people didn't know what to do in events specially this one. So I avoided it until one day I saw a few people were doing it and I felt it was oky to take my time read the instructions and figure out what to do, without them being upset that I wasn't pulling my weight.
---
I'm not saying that people who exploit shouldn't have repercussions, but I'm saying that the impact to their finances is over exaggerated.
---
It's similar to the argument on piracy.  The people who are exploiting likely weren't going to spend any money anyways, sure maybe a handful, but not a statistically impactful amount.  
---
The people who were going to spend money for the majority of it, planned to anyways, and the actions of others won't impact their decision.
---
The remainder, the ones who will buy the last few ranks, are going to grind out the majority of it, regardless of what others are doing, because they wanted the rewards.  They'll bitch and moan (and for good reason) about the exploiters, but if they haven't left the game up to this point with dupers and people destroying the economy, then they aren't going to leave because of \*this\* exploit.  Those players may still pay the money because of FOMO.
---
I'm agreeing with you, I want the NW quests gone and replaced by something else.  If they are trying to push people to NW, then give it a big fat XP boost so that people who want to play it can do so willingly, rather than basically force it onto people who aren't interested. 250 score is more than a small amount.  It takes 25000 xp to gain that.
---
I always run in to try to find him when other people launch, never did. I was over the moon to see him on my launch!
---
Hey, do what you feel is right.  I personally am done being bilked, and I won't shed a single tear if they make no money off this system.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesnt this only work for the brick wall set?
---
But bro this game is about endless Grind, endless Grind and even more endless grind, and thats how we like it dont We.
---
Would be like soccer without Ball in my opinion 😂
---
Same. Turning off voice chat was one of the very first things i did after leaving the vault.
---
You can put ANY wallpaper. On ANY material wall.
---
yea they have had all year to fix the bug since it showed up so don't think they will even try.
---
They need to just add more bosses like SBQ I can’t understand why this hasn’t even been considered, surely the queen is one of the most done activities, not expanding on it is 2iq
---
I was referring to the double stacking glitch
---
Nobody got banned for the workshop scrapping exploit, which pretty much gave people the only real benefit of fallout 1st without paying for it. Same thing with the real money traders
---
Well I didn't know that lol I thought they worked off contracts that are paid well in advance of them making a game? (The Developers)
---
Lol. No problem
---
Probably team do quests but the notifications are bugged. I get this at times where it just stops telling me anything.
---
I mean offensive GG as like you were the one who was on the offense and won and said GG first.  Idk but in games that I play where you say GG to your opponent at the end it is usually the loser who says GG first and then after they leave the game and when the person who is winning or won says GG first it can be considered BM.  Idk I could be reading too much into it but it could've contributed to triggering the guy.
---
Either way he should know the rules of workshops.  You were not in the wrong for defending yours.
---
That’s...strange. They’d be the only thing from FO4 I can think of that does count, then. Which wouldn’t make them very crypted...
---
Brick. Barn. Garage style. Metal walls. It works. Tested it about 10 minutes ago c
---
You'd get plenty if you did even a few of the dailies in those few hours. And yes, your reward is proportionate to your effort and investment.. That's how things work. You can't practice cooking for 2-3 hours a week and expect to be a chef. You can't work out for 2-3 hours a week and expect to be fit. Stop being so entitled. You want more rewards? Play more. Or pay a few dollars to get to whatever tier you want to get to and support the time and money they spent to build those assets... They're nice enough to give you a method of earning it for free. Most games just make you buy it at 15-20 dollars per skin. You are greedy.
---
Most definitely!!
---
They aren't hacked it's a bug and Bethesda incompetence.
---
Part of it does, or at least it is listed as adventure mode xp in the scoreboard.
---
I’m struggling. Just came back to do Wastelanders right before the update, and found myself doing dailies instead.
---
On balance, I like the changes - climbing the board is fun, and it’s a reason to go and do stuff I wouldn’t normally, like Queen of the Hunt, or, well, Nuclear Winter.
---
But I’d be thrilled if the challenge list was static, rather than tied to dailies/weeklies. If I could log on at the weekend, when I might have an eight hour block free, and knock out a load of challenges, rather than having to find an hour or two on a weekday - which isn’t as easy as it used to be!
---
I’ve resigned myself to only getting some of the benefits, and that’s fine. But I’m not sure why the challenges are structured around the daily/weekly clock; it’s a shame for those with less flexibility in their schedule.
---
If it's taking 16 caps from you it's a bug. If it's giving you them it's a feature, or rent from your camp ally /s 
---
Are you in a public team? then it's ally quest reward. The UI is not the most reliable and that's the amount you seem to get from teammate quest completion.
---
Dudes haunted by people who have no guts, levitation is a given.
---
Different game but I was playing Stellaris last night and the Dancing Plague event happened.
---
Yeah, I don't bother doing the quest using the little circles.  When campfire tales pops up collect all the insect parts other than radroach meat.  Store them in a vending machine so they won't get auto scrapped.  
---
One campfire tales event can give you a weeks worth of everything you need or more so you can do the quest in minutes just by grabbing stuff from your stash and then grabbing radroach meat (since it spoils).
---
I was on the defence though haha he started the attack. Plus I honestly just GG after all fights whether I'm the attacker defender winner or loser.
---
"YOU CAME TO THE WRONG HOUSE FOOL!"
---
The reason is that there isn't enough content ingame right now so they stretch it. If you could, like you say, max out your faction rep in one weekend what else would there be to do. The hardcore players would do anything in a matter of days and then there is absolutely nothing to do besides base building or hunting for cosmetics and maybe some legendaries if you don't already have a stash full of god rolls already. 
---
So it's either. Log in every day for an hour or two (or less) and have nothing to do after this or do anything in a few days/weeks and have again nothing to do at all.
---
I think there are perks which allow you to craft weapons/gear with a higher durability. I haven't made any energy weapons. My main is a Stealth Sniper but hasn't found a lot in terms of ammo or mats for making them. Maybe someone else has better info.
---
I can't wait to see so many people use it in Uranium Fever when they one-shot all three legendaries.
---
All gauss weapons or just the new ones?
---
I really dont understand theese post in my experience playing online games with a similar battle pass system not a single one was designed for every person to complete.  Theese battle pass type games are literally made for the dedicated player and are ment to be an actual challenge.  I dont want to be a jerk but all the casual player complaining are gonna ruin it for the actual dedicated players and I'm sure will turn an already easy system into yet another super easy thing that everyone can do with no effort at all
---
The two arguments I hear all the time about the monetization is "Bethesda has enough money" and/or "This game has so much monetization it's raking in the cash"
---
* No company uses money that it earns from other products to keep a product afloat unless: A.) it's a loss leader (meaning it's existence brings people in buy other products, like FO76 brings people in to buy Elder Scrolls Online) or B.) They are contractually obligated to do so. 
---
* With things like royalties paid on music in this game, and the advertising that was spent on it, it's possible the game is not doing well financially. This can be somewhat evident with the pace of content.  They likely had to reduce their staff and so a smaller staff is the ones creating the content.  This last one of course is assumptions, unless someone can get on an earnings call to see how the game is doing.
---
I get so annoyed when people complain certain content is too hard. Shouldn’t we have some things that are just a challenge? We should have variety. Vault raids were great. I didn’t do them frequently but I enjoyed them.
---
The only thing thaty worked for me was to fabricate a card using a terminal on the top floor of place yoy can't get in to. There is a terminal and clues to help you get it.
---
are  you're caps actually going up or is it just a notification?
---
And a dual wielding perk card please.
---
Id honestly rather it reset every 24hrs rather than trying to log on at the same time each day, or trying to remember what time I might have sold something yesterday.
---
You ever tested the OP's scenario?
---
Ok, so lets say even with seasons sales the income is still too low.  Will you defend the next monetization push?  How about the one after that?  Is there a point where perhaps they spent more of their time adding actual content to the game rather than trying develop systems to make people spend more money players positive perception might go up, and draw in more players?    
---
Also just because what they are doing isn't new doesn't make it defensible.  It's not just 76 I don't like these practices in, and I don't support them anywhere else either.      
---
If you don't mind it that's your call of course, but I do, and I just can't support it any more.  I think if more people would say "ok enough" instead of just letting it pile up over years we wouldn't see these trends.
---
Perk loadouts have been here for a long time if you're in PC.
---
Im curious to know without perks and such. Just in general using both rifles,  laser explosive and non explosive if they both degrade equally or not.
---
“We’re gonna need you to come in on Saturday...”
---
(More seriously, I assume there’s a points-per-day ratio to get you to rank 100 before the season ends in September)
---
I can't personally vouch for all of them, but many people have said so, and I can vouch for the Gauss Rifle. I tested it last night.
---
Seems doubtful since you start with 1 point in each special
---
AFAIK that xp does not contribute toward the challenge.
---
My camp is up by WV lumber so that's usually my go-to when I see kill cryptids.  Train yard in the bog after that if I don't get the snallys at hemlock holes, though I've gotten unlucky there too and had it filled with robots instead lol.
---
Saying GG used to be about manners, no matter if you placed first or last.
---
That explains so much
---
I'm not a big fan of it since most of the time I get weapons my char isn't specced for and gear I don't like.    
---
I don't like gear that requires you to be low in health and stay that way. I have mobility issues with my hands so I'll never be really good at games. IDK if the weapons drop per char level or not. I wouldn't risk it though. Some events early on like "Leader of the Pack". That one nets you a potential of 3 lower level 1-2 star legendaries that is good for levels 10-20. You have a limited time so IMO, you should open up as many points in the Forest around the fairground place and several points above and below it. If you don't like what you get you can sell or add to your script. They won't get much but it's better than cloggin up your stash.
---
Bethesda: "And miss out on the money people will spend on atoms next week to advance down the board? Lol get fucked, we're a mobile game now!"
---
Explosive weapons degrade faster.
---
Seems to have stopped now it was happening a bunch for like 20 mins straight. Probably procced like 20 times or so. Not sure if I actually got caps or not.
---
I saved up and finally hit 5000 candy for the ;nuclear surprise'
---
Got a 2\* mutants wooden armour piece. what a fucking joke RNG can be.
---
However i will recommend it as you almost always end up in there solo, and at the very least 1 or 2 legendary enemies will show. and the XP of course.
---
Bugger, that happens to me sometimes. Luckily I can usually fix it by doing another, different, emote.
---
My issue (and I see more of it in this thread) is that there’s no flexibility in challenge timing. You can’t sit down at the weekend and knock out all the challenges for the week, then bank the points because you have a busy work week coming up. It’s a couple of hours a day, or nothing. Maybe some people want to be done now, but some people just want to be able to do stuff when they have time.
---
Explosive weapons degrade at least 2x as fast. Since durability is lost on hit. So if the explosion hits multiple enemy's it degrades even faster
---
Mabye if they fix people losing thousands of points worth of score I'd care. And they have no intention of fixing or doing anything about it l, the same bug has been here for a year some people have lost over 10ranks to the bug
---
I really like the point about the movie ticket thing, which does make me feel better about buying it. but I don't agree that the issue is playing the game 'so much' that you have to do x or y. my argument is that it makes the game waaay more enjoyable with the scrapbox, and that isn't a good thing. surly the game itself would benefit from being better overall by not locking it behind a paywall. The fact that we have to buy something to alleviate frustration **built into the game** doesn't ring any alarm bells for you? or is that just the norm now? I agree that fo1st could be a good source of revenue, though I am skeptical as to whether any excess revenue would go to development costs, or just to appease shareholders.
---
It's exceptionally annoying when people complain about that.  
---
In any MORPG game you will have players who are not good or knowledgeable enough to complete certain content or earn certain rewards and this irks them to no end.  It bothers them and eats away at them so they need to come on to online message boards and demand the content gets nerfed or ask for another way to earn the rewards because they don't want to put in the time and effort.
---
They don't care that this would invalidate the time and effort of other players who put in the time and effort to earn the rewards, they only care about their selfish agenda of wanting to be able to solo anything and everything.  This is why we ended up with a closed vault 94 and all of those hard earned rewards now available for doing events and dailies...    I was so upset when I Found out vault 94 rewards wouldn't be legacy.  That was Bethesda spitting in the face of every person who put time and effort into vault 94.
---
When you think about it, it's enough to make you sick to your stomach.  It's quite literally my main issue with MORPG games in the last decade.  Every-time I find one I like, the game ends up changing and transforming to cater to the "casual" player and nerfs or removes the most difficult content.  It's a vicious cycle and it ruins MORPG games for me.
---
My explosive handmade doesnt degrade as fast as my explosive laser rifle. The laser rifle degrades extremely fast. 
---
But if i get a regular non explosive laser rifle will it degrade like a regular non explosive handmade?
---
I just want to make make sure there isnt a problem with energy weapons degrading faster in general and that its simply a problem with explosive energy.
---
I didn't make either of those arguments.  I said it already has THREE income sources, yet it keeps adding more.  If the game can't support itself, then it can't, I don't see that as justification as a consumer who happens to like the product to put up with more and more monetization.  You obviously have to draw a line somewhere, slashing free atoms, and pressuring people to spend on yet another source was it for me.    
---
If you are ok with it, have fun.
---
What about the Indians in INDIA?    
---
Can't call the Native Indians here the "YA YA YA YA Indians" or the "Dot Indians" to differentiate without 'some people' getting offended.
---
I second
---
Hit R18 last night and ive been completely ignoring it. But my char is still levelling through the main storylines and has not hit the dull endgame of just mindlessly repeating dailies. Once that happens, ill probably stop playing rather than grind the LegRun.
---
Nobody has admitted to getting banned for those, however RMT players have been banned numerous times. They are who Bethesda mainly target with their ban waves every Patch update. You are aware they have ban waves every major patch, right? Spoiler alert.
---
What’s the point? There is almost no difference between player models
---
Idk I used to play Warcraft 3 and Starcraft for a long time and have came back since Reforged and saying GG is a integral part of the player2player interaction there and the person who won never says GG first.  Has been this way for almost 20 years in RTS games but other people are allowed to see it differently.
---
Just the way I learned it gaming in RTS games growing up.
---
Seeing him down there is normal for nuking that area even though the odds of him spawning are low. The event you're thinking of will be in another area of the map. This guy is there so we can practice tactics on killing him so we'll be ready when the event drops.
---
Ah cool, thanks for the advice, I'll definitely be sure to check that event. I'd love to pump more hours into the game, but I wasn't (un)lucky enough to be furloughed haha. 
---
It's also really great to hear that your hand mobility doesn't stop your gaming, I think the pace of the game and vats etc. probably helps too. I'm really enjoying playing it a bit like the older games, making sure to take time reading everything to get the lore.
---
It's blatantly obvious that Bethesda does not care that people cheat and exploit. They didn't bother developing any tools to catch these people. 
---
Now if the atom shop got hacked or glitched they would have a patch the same day.
---
 It's not hard to see what their motivations are.
---
 The people that don't cheat are still spending money.
---
 So all is well for them.
---
I’m upset I didn’t have time to get the 94 emote. I’m glad you can’t just buy it, just wish I could still earn it.
---
Same tho, there's so many great outfits and I wish I could change it up with more than just the headwear! This really seems like it should be treated as underarmor
---
No, you can’t. I do that event every time it pops up. You cannot get the bio unless you hit the firefly
---
A well-cushioned hoverround.    
---
Highly durable dual wrist braces.    
---
Endless supply of Mountain Dew/carbonated high sugar bevarage of choice.    
---
Endless supply of Hot Pockets, Pizza, Pizza Rolls, etc.    
---
A mod to said hoverround that allows person to piss/shit into a drainage receptacle that also cleans them without getting up and leaving that thing.    
---
An eventual learned ability to go without much sleep and powernap for 30 minutes.    
---
Rinse and repeat.
---
On that, we can agree.
---
Love the fear attack.  First time I had it I was totally WTF!?!?!  Then realized what was happening.  Great mechanic!
---
Y E S!! Like, were playing a game that takes place post nuclear apocalypse. Yet, everything we get looks like it was manufactured that day.
---
Yeah I've received almost all of the Christmas and Halloween rewards between the SCORE challenges, and trying to unlock the ghillie suit
---
Yeah. I think cap is 100. Seen videos of people using exploits to get there.
---
There was an affliction that hit where I live in the 1800’s called “Jumping Frenchmen” disease, as it affected the French Canadian lumberjacks that worked in the woods.
---
But they won't be max level
---
thanks
---
I lost my deathclaw while loading in for Fasnacht at Helvetia, so I don't think it's that simple, but I'll try that if I ever bother to get a new pet. Thanks.
---
Your question is worded a little weird. 
---
Simply put, an explosive handmade degrades faster than a non explosive handmade. 
---
An explosive laser degrades faster than a non explosive laser. 
---
I think energy weapons in general degrade faster but I cannot confirm.
---
Atom shop item. Bunch of months ago.
---
I saw some guy capped at 100 every stat expect endurance with unyielding. Its glitch but max is 100 as i saw. Its affect ur stat bc his carryweight went up from 400 to 800.
---
That could work, too.
---
I've been in a fight with her 3 times.    
---
I'm not sure if she's a Legendary every time but the last time things weren't going well. I got some shots so I could loot her (main is only level 63) and running to people to heal them. She regened out of nowhere at less than half health back to full health.
---
No, but my comment was that Sharing perks is not new. In order to test OPs scenario, you'd need 4 people with 9 Charisma all sharing Super Duper 3. And as others have stated, same card Sharing doesn't stack.
---
They are developing content but this takes more time and money and resources as opposed to adding new atom shop items or a battle pass which is easier.  Any content they put out we are probably going to gobble up in a few days anyways and people will just complain again.  After the 1st week of wastelanders and getting through the main quest on all of my characters I was pretty much done and over with it.  It took them months if not years to make that and in less than a week most people were done with it.  At least a battle pass keeps me engaged for longer.
---
The trends are here.   The cat is out of the bag man.  Gamers as a consumer-base missed the boat years ago in terms of stopping this micro/macrotransaction trend.  At this point, for every 1 person that has this attitude of not spending money on microtransactions there are 10 more opening their wallets because the majority of gamers just turn on their PC/console and play the game and buy what they want.  They don't come on message boards to read about boycotting the atom shop.
---
I think Bethesda wants players to have a certain amount of freedom but they also want to probably make some money off of something they add that's meant to be monetized. 
---
The amount of people that knew and did those exploits you listed prior were small groups. This was spread like wildfire in a matter of like 3 days. "So all is well for them" - That's your opinion. :)
---
So even at 100 intelligence, the can still boost the XP gain even more? If I remember correctly, every Int point increases the XP gain by 2%. So with 100 int alone, they gain a total of 300%? Whoa!
---
Got it. Its that last part i want ti confirm basically.
---
There's a problem with random enemies disappearing from the game world upon death. I've done that quest a few times recently and was close enough to the bug when I killed it. I saw it drop and disappear. I've seen enemies die and ragdoll backwards only to glitch through the wall with tons of holes in it to go THROUGH the ground and are gone.
---
I do believe they are planning on it, in one of the archives there's a sound file for `ui_pipboy_emote_anim_so_sorry`.
---
Same.
---
Yup.  While it'll be nice when I finally finish the battle pass or finally get every single gold bullion plan, it'll be nice and I'll feel relieved but I won't get that sense of accomplishment that I got when we completed 94 expert runs with tons of time left on the clock.  It's just not the same.
---
I did see a couple posts yesterday complaining that they threw the train car in the joe bundle because they know people only want a train car, people were acting like it was only in there to make you want the bundle, people just didn’t understand why it was there lol.
---
I want an emote that plays the chorus for "I'm Too Sexy" by Right Said Fred so we can flaunt whatever we're wearing.
---
Gold maxs at 5k just so you know
---
Did someone else experience not getting points for the weekly? I lost 2k for no reason
---
It sucks people cheat but you shouldn’t let others actions affect your happiness  the fact you made a post shows it bothers you.  What do people get who cheat score?  Cosmetic items, atoms?  Doesn’t affect you really does it?
---
I’d totally get it if you were talking about cheaters using aim bots in nuclear winter or cheaters stealing your stuff.  
---
Seen too many people worried about people flexing because they got an outfit that maybe others don’t have. I still don’t have a red asylum outfit but don’t suggest they remove them from the game since the majority of people with them got them from dupe glitches.
---
Im a DCG user i have blooded powerfist as well but it feel slow to me so i always stick with DCG.
---
How about XP gain? Have you noticed them getting 600+ XP per high level super mutant?
---
If anyone has a fix for this that would be amazing, it’s really really annoying since I’m a stealth commando and I crouch everywhere
---
Yeah. If you server hop while in a downed state you get an extra boost from a full unyielding set. Maybe another 10 INT.
---
They all have daddy issues.
---
\*Mother of God.gif\*
---
Drivin in ma car, livin like a star.
---
Wow, never thought you can reach this kind of heights of special :O Let me ask, at what level You're on Legendary Run? Considering about giving INT build a shot :D
---
We Canadians only kill all of our native population and act superior when our country has a massive history of genocide and drug issue.
---
If your friend couldn’t take a joke, better off without him. I’ve had my camp nuked plenty. You have the option to log out before it lands. He should have done that
---
it'll cost around 50 lvlups if they ever do that.
---
Absolutely. I want to look and live like a scavenger, not like a real estate agent staging a home for sale.
---
I try and jump or something to say sorry but then people think I’m a griefer 😂
---
I got an AA/FFR/ 90RW on my first roll so I'm passing my luck onto you
---
Good post! Do shared team perks stack? Im new to using teams and I've been sharing Strange in Numbers and noticed other people share it too. So does this mean we are gaining a boost from each of those cards or would it only apply a buff from one of them?
---
What are the actual candy rewards, im almost st 1000 after one go of the event and dont know what its used for
---
He get 900+ Xp for some lvl 21 crature. So its gives more and more Xp but with higher and higher stat the difference is lower.
---
Definitely a strategy.
---
You will really need to prime it to get the full value (once you get a good roll).
---
You mean people in this day in age are only reading story titles, using half truths, and stating  answers that fit their narrative?  In the age of social media? No, couldn’t be
---
You never know, they might invent a time machine in the atomic shop that allows you to skip ahead to a better patch release for an hour
---
Requires each patch to be rebought though
---
Ty ty! Might have used it though when I get a furious explosive fixer the same day I learned the plan lol
---
I've found that by bouncing around to as many Events as you can while hitting every enemy you can will net the most experience.  
---
There are foods, drinks, and chems that add XP but you can't use more than one of each kind. The most recent food will overwrite the previous one.  
---
Cranberry Juice and Cranberry Relish are good.  
---
Also, romancing an Ally and getting max with them nets Lover's Embrace when you nap at your CAMP. 25% XP bonus I believe. Take one each of a food, drink, chem that aslo gives and XP Boost.  
---
Don't forge to interact with the Mothman at the end of that quest b/c he gives you a unique 2 hour XP buff as well. Plan out your play time and max it.
---
ammo dump for almost always a '1 animal alive (bear) reward.
---
personally always  go even to try solo.
---
They shouldnt have left that money lying there where i could get to it inside that locked vault if they didnt want me to steal it.
---
I maxed last night as well. I crafted 5 of them. 4 of them were 1 stars but one was bloodied at least. Now to mod and test it out
---
Thanks, I've turned the entire area into a kitchen now, added a few benches and stuff, its a bit of a tight squeeze in there (but then I imagine a real cafe is probably like that too) but its turned out quite nice.
---
As someone with a full time job and a 5 month old kid.. I'll never see the last tier:(
---
Yeah I got the prime receiver and Gunner sight with the gold I has saved up
---
UGH! how did i completely forget the PERKS! I'll add them now, but short answer is stack? No, but I haven't tested something like sharing inspirational rank 2 and 3 to see if those stack...I did/does for weapon cards like rifleman from what i hear.
---
I'm still in the middle of the first part. I can't play that much because of some RL stuffs. So, I can do 2-3 runs of on National Isolated Radio Array, Wes Tek research center, Huntersville, and General Steakhouse(rarely, because it is far from the other 3 palaces).
---
+12 Standard STR
---
Iron fist +20%, radicool +5 STR, Strange in numbers, Party boy, Nerd Rage, Class freak, bloody mess.
---
Deathclaws steak +5 STR, Glowing meat steak +25%, mutant hound chops +25%, Ya Gui Ribs +25%, whiskey +6 STR
---
Unyielding, bloodied @ 20% health.
---
I think there's more buffs I could take like bufftats &amp; nukashine.
---
Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction
---
please NUKE away.
---
High Rad Fluid is my new holy grail in this game.
---
&gt;the fact you made a post shows it bothers you
---
... "the fact that you replied to my thread shows it bothers you"   
---
tone down the captain obvious levels man.   
---
this is not the same as a dupe or any other exploit. this is literally over $100 being handed out to every cheater that does the glitch. how is that comparable to a red dress?
---
Wait, why does strange in numbers work then?
---
Yeah, I ended up using the contemporary set for my hybrid house/donut shop.  The thing about that set, though, is that you really need the porch, because without it, the exterior walls are so plain and flat on a 2-story structure.  We don't have things like awnings or other exterior wall decorations to break up the flatness, so you have to do interesting things with the roof line, patios, or decks.
---
Okay, will try some experiments tomorrow. But I avoid using glitches because I'm afraid that it might bite back at me later.
---
Well-Rested? Gives you +5%, length of time increases if you've got an Ally, even longer if you Romanced and sleep near them.
---
Fair enough... I mean Indians in India have been called Indian for longer. Didn't stop native Indians being called Indian and a lot of them identifying as that...
---
Just tell your friend then. Not us.
---
Adding to what others said, explosive shotguns are probably the fastest degrading weapons in-game :D at least from what I had tried. Especially if using magical exploits because then all the pellets hit a target (degrading happens after the successful hit). Regarding PERKS I always use [Weapon Artisan](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Weapon_Artisan) Lvl 3 when I approach any weapon bench and [Gunsmith](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Gunsmith) Lvl 5 on my build because otherwise my shotgun just disappears in seconds. As well I try to use exploding shotgun on stronger enemies only to conserve ammo and weapon's durability.
---
Basically all of the content it has to offer? That’s impressive because most people are still grinding gold bullion and reputation.
---
Yea that's such a no brainer i just forgot to write it down...thanks!
---
Takes for the heads up, I should avoid server-hopping when I die. Well, I haven't did this even accidental. I'm afraid taking advantage of glitches because of possible repercussions later. And the game might become even more boring with cheats.
---
Why not just like, voice chat?
---
Never underestimate "no brainers"
---
But if I keep a team that's 3 less people trying to kill me.
---
Is that information new?
---
First of all, I do get what you are saying, because ironically I actually like the game a lot, I was the last person in my friend group that started in beta to keep playing, and I like you starved for content was looking forward with reservation to what seasons might bring, but my reservation ended up being justified, so I just uninstalled.  The reason I'm still posting is that I like the game, and it's still occupying headspace so I'm here to talk about it, and read about it till that passes.  I get why you are happy to have something to do.    
---
The rest of it, no.  Trends change, not just in gaming or in any other markets but everywhere, but they absolutly won't change if people just shrug and say "they have us over a barrel, what can you do?"    
---
I have no expectation that anything I type will have any effect on beth (or any other posters even), not why I was posting.  I know devs gonna do what they gonna do, and beth doesn't seem real big on listening to feedback.    
---
I just can't support what I can't support, so I gotta move on.  If you are still happy, keep playing.  If you feel unhappy but somehow helpless because the market has spoken, I would suggest you reconsider you position and seek out games that treat their customer base better, because they do exist.
---
As long as they don't remove the xp giving score I'm game.
---
Best sources are Sheepsquatch fur, military duct tape, and military ammo bags from Camp McClintock And Ft Defiance.
---
vendor bots for bulk, under 300 caps I’d you have grape mentats, hard bargain3, and some charisma boosting alcohol
---
Thanks. I’m close to 3000 now.
---
1,000 DMG is enough for anyone but I want to achieve the max.
---
Sadly the game encourages it. If you're AFKing or hiding the match or what ever. Your after the big xp boosts when only 10 people are alive. Having 3 people not out to kill you makes you more likely to survive.
---
Yep pretty much this spot on. Best part? Not everything is cosmetic or a time limited cosmetic. Hell, I bet you they'll just reshove all this stuff into the shop 3 months later anyways either way.
---
I think the fact that roughly half (??) of the track is a mix of caps, bullion, scrip and perk cards - ALL things you get in game for just playing the game by the way - makes the track more casual friendly and is more of a "Hey, here's some help along the way for *playing it casually."* 
---
You don't *need* anything from this track. The only thing that's questionably a game changer (it hardly is) is the ammo converter and it's very, VERY easy to get it if you do 5 weeklies. Definitely doable for people who can only play a few hours on weekends.
---
All of that information is not new.
---
Exactly, this isn’t a dupe glitch or exploit that affects you.  If those people still play they are going to get score points anyway. It’s not like they finish the season and quit (at least I don’t think so, don’t know anyone who hats done it)
---
TBH, if Bethesda was gonna fix anything I’d rather they fix the fast travel bug. That has negative  impact on the whole community. Some people want to fast track and cheat to get there that only affects them.
---
Well, I think one of the whole points about the Legendary Run is being able to earn unique gear that not everyone has.  To say that, yes, I got this far, I *earned* this reward.  The exploiters make a mockery of this.  And unlike things that were mass duped in the past, like the Christmas presents or those dumb hacked .50 cals, these items are supposed to be quasi-Atomic Shop.  They will eventually be purchasable.  So, to allow the exploiters to work around that isn't just bad for legitimate players, it's also bad for Bethesda's bottom line.
---
Great idea, but then my refrigerator would be obsolete :/
---
Maybe even a display case 🧐 🤔 
---
Not to be a jerk...but if they made a vendor like this (that was better than the refrigerator) I’d probably put all the food that I want to use in it for 30k, sorta like what people do to save their junk from being scrapped (when display cases are disabled)
---
I'm hoping for deep pocketed for SS legs and arms.
---
well no brainer for me, been using since beta. But yes deserved to be added thanks for catching that
---
The roadmap, in the Fractured Steel section (winter), says "C.a.m.p Shelters, build instanced interiors", I'm hoping that will help with the budget problem, but there's still a lot of things that aren't interior items so idk
---
I'm going to remain hopeful
---
Not everyone a first class member.
---
True but then your ruining the game for other people, your going to do around the same time anyways by the fire so there is no point in full when your afk
---
Farming DLC!
---
Yes absolutely fix this.   Some things that seemingly help me with this is sneaking when teleporting, running a bit in random directions between attempts, and killing nearby foes.   Not sure if any of these items actually help, but what else is there to do when you're bugging?
---
Well, probably when the Brotherhood becomes a thing. Maybe.
---
I believe a few people have done the math, and yes you can. Clear the other dailies and weeklies, and the amount of playing should also get a few of the Repeatable XP SCORES.
---
The cap is 100. Though without exploits and glitiching you unlikely ever get there.
---
My raider camp really needs more stuff than just yellow crates, NW crates, and the skull totems.
---
Because they don't want you to advance fast. You will get bored after a week with the non-existent contents.
---
But by grinding a little bit each day, it's super more fun.
---
Aren't you having fun? Pew pew.
---
Yes. You can do the xp repeatable, and there are double xp and score weekends coming up.
---
Fab, yeah, I worked out the Mothman buff last time. I also managed to get a random settler bloke to come back to my camp last session and noticed a slight xp boost. I'm assuming I can romance him? I'm not gay but 25% extra xp is 25% extra xp... How do you go about romancing the settler?
---
.... I think he means when it ends and robot explodes, someone always dies and gets robbed
---
You can earn about 500 atoms a month now so new players can adopt that idea in about 4 months of playing every day.
---
Yes.  If you didn't look, there is a repeatable challenge called: "gain xp" so you can just do that over and over to replace those points.
---
But honestly don't know why you wouldn't just pop in to NW to do the challenges really quickly.  Today's challenges was place a camp 3 times which literally takes 7 seconds once you spawn in.  The only excuse for not wanting to do this is laziness.  You can't even say "but I don't like PvP" because you could go into the match and put down your camp 3 times and leave 10 seconds later.  
---
Good luck on your pass!
---
I get super skiddish around decon arches after that twat in the enclave tried to lock me in a halway and cleanse my precious mutations. All 11 of them.
---
Luckily i was able to dash back out before the door closed.
---
Tomahawks too if you pick up any.
---
I have an explosive 90% rw auto 10mm I carry with me for tagging legendaries. I have no perks for it, the auto decreases the damage and explosive area effect helps to tag  (so I've heard anyway).
---
I didn't say it affected me. This says "Bethesda, Will YOU" - I think you're confused with that part. I'm not Bethesda.
---
Team Fill turns itself on every restart now since Patch 20 (at least on PS4) and I have also had it turn back on *between matches!* It honestly never did this for me before - instead it was just a seperate setting for each character that stayed toggled to the option you selected permanently. If it happens to me, I leave the match before the "Participants Are Confirmed" but damn it is frustrating after I've waited almost 10 minutes for a match. 😭
---
Still - between the Halloween/Christmas rewards, NW EXP Challenge rewards, Overseer Rank rewards, and now the daily and weekly SCORE challenges.. you guys must be having a hell of a hard time over there! *Especially* considering there are probably breakpoints where the number of bushwookies/seamonkeys are more likely to tick you over into waiting for a new match to be filled rather than just filling the empty slots and increasing match frequency.
---
So maintaining my Int at that level isn't pointless huh? I avoid exploits because of fear of repercussions. Thanks
---
&gt; Now if the atom shop got hacked or glitched they would have a patch the same day. 
---
Well, the Legendary Run gear is technically tied to the Atomic Shop, so...
---
I'd like it but there has been stuff like that and yet it never comes back. That kinda tells me very few people are interested and prefer seeing a floating brand new middle class home instead.
---
This was in the slocum bundle? I don’t recall seeing it. Is it in the misc tab?
---
Yep I've got around a half dozen in my stash right now. I put them in my vendor for 0 caps hoping someone might take them. Might put up a sign for it.
---
Also I wonder if the keys contribute to this as well, since there are so many.
---
Same here, I’m grinding xp and finally have sometime to reach for. The repeatable weekly is the first time in fallout 76 that there is not limit to the rewards you can get
---
Yeah its pretty lame of people to ruin teams like that.
---
They should kick people who AFK in NW after a few minutes.  No one should earn xp for standing there and doing absolutely nothing.
---
They need to award more XP for kills and less for time survived to encourage active gameplay and less cowardly actions like afking or hiding.
---
After you finish your build just don't don't do anything with the new perks and eventually you can save up to 50+ level ups
---
Yeah, people are sleeping on the repeatable XP - it's quite possible to get 5 - 6 of those per day, easy.
---
I'd kind of be happy if they just removed them completely...
---
I mean, if they aren't causing the headless invulnerable respawns, then they're giant hitboxes are blocking the ability to loot the normal meat piles adjacent to them.
---
Because knowing Bethesda the entire structure of the game is tied around those reset times for some reason and if they aren't setup so stupid the game wouldn't work. lol
---
Yeah, NEVER skip out on the "Place your CAMP 3 times" NW challenge. Load into the match near the border, drop the CAMP, open up Pip-Boy, drop it again, repeat. Run into the storm and kill yourself. With lobbies and loading times it's about 5 minutes.
---
I'd love ultralite for the legs.
---
Yeah, it seems you didn't. Every mmo has gated content but also have a relevant farmable content. This is a gacha game mobile model.
---
There is not cap for INT on XP gain. I've landed 52 Intelligence at base INT of 9. Did extensive testing for XP farming. You can see my post on that now if interested.
---
Dropping your tent 3 times or taking 6 pictures isn’t that bad. And you don’t have to do them, you could just grind xp (weekly challenge) to replace it
---
LOUDER FOR THOSE IN THE BACK. yeah I feel ya. I was able to get it pretty damn close.
---
My conspiracy theory is that they don't make them because the beehive did so poorly in both sales and reception that they aren't interested in the design cost.  They really should not have started with the beehive.
---
This seem to help me to
---
You can use this calculator to see where you are at in regards to getting to rank 100. And how much xp you need to farm daily if you do not do the NW dailies/weeklies at all.  [https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/score.html?](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/score.html?)
---
Bethesda's old reliable, it'll probably be the Secret Service Armor MKII, MKIII, MKIV, etc as well as gauss weapon equivalent
---
Prime it.
---
What's wrong with fast travel?
---
Every gold plan can be purchase in 40weeks, and a few more to max the 5k stash limit. If they haven't got plans in hand already its all going to grind to a halt and Reddit will implode...again...
---
I expect, or at least I hope, that the Season 2 update will bring new items.
---
You can build floors..... It's gotta be at a 45 degree angle in the circular part lol (BTW the contemporary bundle with the foundation porches places very easy) 
---
Was planning on building mine but preferred water
---
So it depends. Yes wait till 50 for weapons, but modules should be bought if you are getting close to cap of 1000. I'm not sure modules go on sale, if they do it would be worth it. Historically, only the random items have gotten it though from what i remember.
---
Bug
---
If you don't want to use exploits but you can maintain a 45 Intelligence or higher than do it if that is what you want to do. 
---
Personally I'd only try with strength, agility and luck. But that is because of my play style. Other than xp I dunno what a high intelligence does to be honest.
---
That's a good point and it would solve the respawn issue too which is especially annoying and has been around FOREVER. I wonder if they even know about that.
---
Yeah I visited a player from my public team and bought something to complete the challenge, they were happy
---
I see your point but I'll raise you this question, if the "its just not for you" attitude isn't good then wouldn't every single game in the world be appealing to every single possible person? Yes, games should cater to as many people as possible but it isn't possible. People will not enjoy a game for multiple reasons no matter how hard developers try.
---
Just gonna throw this out here since a lot of people don't seem to understand, truth-be-told the legendary run **does not change the way you play the game at all. Nothing was removed from the game with this update besides the amount of atoms you could get.** If you played for atoms, you were already grinding mindlessly, this is no different.
---
I think the legendary run should 100% be open to criticism and needs a ton of changes. There could be more ease-of-access quests or more casual ones. Quests that carry over between weeks. The new NW weekly is a great example of them realizing people don't like NW but will encourage more people to play it. It's certainly fair people can stop playing because of it - but it seems a lot of people legitimately think it's the sole reason they are done with this game and it's just silly imho. Just play the game. It's not different. **The game was played the same pre-legendary run.** 
---
You mentioned the time requirement is high but go on to say it takes less than 7-14 hours a week for other games. Are we playing the same Fallout 76 here? It takes me an hour max to do all my dailies and some of the weeklies end up being the same as dailies but more points required. I don't even try to do them for the first 30 or so minutes and just dump out a quest real quick since I made a new character as of Wastelanders. I finish them within 8 hours of playing as of last week and that's on top of doing quests in between that have nothing to do with the dailies/weeklies. 8 hours is a rough medium of your hours for other games, am I misunderstanding something here?
---
Dude we deserve some exploits with the shit show theyve given us. Sooo that being said how do i get free xp with a spacesuit and goo?
---
I have not thought of this, Will keep it in mind.
---
I think they need to add more value to hair styles or drop the price if they're going to try making money off them.
---
They could:
---
-Drop the price
---
-Include with bundles
---
-Release them as "packs" that have 4-5 slight variations of the hairstyle, like a beehive with a flower/sunglasses/bandana/etc in it
---
Fists?  
---
Honestly a guy made a video of a sneak drill and it wrecked things.
---
There is no soft or hard cap for any of the specials. Who ever the youtuber is has no idea what he is talking about.
---
Do you know the math behind Two Shot? It seems logical the 2nd shot doesnt do as much damage as the 1st otherwise Instigating wouldnt be used at all. I cant see the numbers on my screen as they overlap each other so I cant really tell how much less the 2nd shot does.
---
With that much INT, how much XP you get per high level super mutant?
---
Do some challenges auto-complete without giving the reward?
---
I disagree. Rep is harder to get than gold.
---
Then again, Smiley sells me gold every week.
---
The camp is piss easy lol I'm just afking at the mansion rn placed 3 within a minute so
---
Should be pretty easy. Already at rank 25, don't think I have any this week's weekly eiter - just yesterdays daily, 1 weekly tops (legendary kills).
---
I also ain't touching NW with a 10ft pole. First because I don't enjoy BR games, second bc I am running a few mods and would fail integrity check (like inventory sorting icons that directly change .ba2 archives)...
---
I crafted my first one the other day and it was only a 1* 
---
Is that random or does 3* only come from purvayor/ random drop?
---
This! It is so frustrating that NPCs have better hair options that the player character.
---
I heard an overproduction of adrenaline can lead to things like anxiety and high blood pressure so in these times I like to think Bethesda is doing all of us a favor.... I'm sorry for this post
---
And they said the fixed it? Bunch o’ flakes 😂
---
Ignore what smiley says with it resetting mondays, I had the same problem by trying to buy it during the week (mon-fri), then i switched to picking it up on sunday only, and it has worked fine since.
---
Some weird bug with the way its been coded to reset.
---
Theyve known about it for over 2 months and havent bothered to do anything.
---
Last update they provided was this:

---
I got worried because of his statement, that maintaining that much of INT is pointless. Thanks!
---
If your friend had half a brain he would have checked the map and looked at his base to see where to nuke was hitting, someone to stupid to do so... Isn't worth your time friend.
---
Yeah I've done those things as well, sometimes they work sometimes they don't. I just don't get it how Bethesda can allow this to happen and not fix it right away. Fast travel is and has been a basic part of every fallout game and it's broken to all hell right now. Now they are promoting new stuff, this is what iritates the hell out of me about them. Fix the damn game before you add more new stuff 🙄
---
Decide early what weapon types you want then keep a eagle eye out for the scrap types you will need to craft that ammo. Shotguns in particular. You need plastic which other ammos do not.
---
Watch angryturtles "How to get all mutations for free in 15minutes" video. The game feels SO much better with speed demon and especially *marsupial*.
---
If you play solo on a premium private server, create a group anyways. You will still get the 25% xp bonus. And it will activate the positive aspects of the group mutations such as empath and herd mentality.
---
Going back to the mutations: there are two mutually exclusive mutations related to food. Herbivore and Carnivore. Plant based food, and meats. Each of these can utilize certain recipes for 25% xp bonuses. AngryTurtle also has vids on these.
---
Great post! Turbo-Ferts are so handy, I've managed to free some Camp Budget by cutting down on Crops. Doesn't work with wild crops unfortunately.
---
-
---
Another thing to think about is the new Teams. Setup a *Building* Team and switch to *Events* when finishing up an Event, or *Hunting* when you're about to take down a Legendary. Switch back to *Building* afterwards to continue reaping more XP!
---
Without lunchbox buffs its around 450XP for a lvl 68
---
400XP for lvl 62 charred ghouls
---
I felt so bad when I shot someone during an SBQ fight yesterday .  To be honest, he did just walk through my line of fire.  I got the warning about pacifist mode, and moved to the side.  I don't think he noticed.  But if you did notice, player in red power armor, I did not mean to shoot you!
---
I've won rounds doing nothing but hiding till the very end.  The bush camping isn't going to end until bethesda reworks the point system.
---
If you went to the bottom of your recent list it shows the people you have blocked :/
---
Glad you are enjoying it! I’m from beta and still having a blast
---
I agree they should fix this bug as a priority, but I have a work around and been doing it for ages, just lob a grenade away from yourself  and then fast travel, I figured out the bug is when you are undetected to a nearby npc either friendly or enemy. Making noise alerts nearbys putting you in 'caution', if you are 'hidden' that's usually the problem. Hope this helps.
---
So after reading this post I had an idea, sleeping in a bed the game will still kick you for being idle after about 30 minutes. So I tried setting my guy up in the trade menu at the station vendor thinking I wouldn’t be kicked for going AFK. (I was in my private world and I had to go make breakfast.)
---
Did not stop me from being kicked. So it’s not possible to be AFK at a station vendor for “hours” like what players claim to see.
---
Another thing, if your game crashes or something, your character will still be standing there. Noticed this many times when playing with friends, then they log back in and there’s two of them. (The one standing there when they crashed, and the real them walking around.)
---
My theory is if you see a player in the trade menu with the station bot for hours, they aren’t really there. The game crashed and their character is still there stuck in the trade menu.
---
(Don’t know if this is actually the case or not, just a theory. Anybody wants to test it feel free, I don’t really care that much since If someone is AFK at a vendor I can just fast travel to another one and continue on my day.)
---
They say it has to do with crafting. But I don't actually care about that. XP is my only reason to boost it that much. Specially for the repeatable one for SCORE. And having lots of extra perk cards for the upcoming legendary perks would be helpful.
---
great post, I can move some points around since adrenaline is currently busted.  I have been using some of the consumables.  I got some caps to burn so I will get those serum recipes.
---
Yes. Just need to grind a little xp along the way
---
I had no idea about Pleasant Valley tickets. Now I do. Thank you and take my upvote.
---
On Xbox when you pull up the map and highlight where you want to go when you push the fast travel button it exits you out of the map and you go nowhere. I've put tickets in twice about it. It's been going on for more than 6 weeks now
---
I have a quad regular laser rifle and it melts like a creme egg in the Sahara desert, i dont know if its cause i have auto and it goes super fast, i dont know if its because i fire like 117 shots very quickly
---
Cheers for that, I'll wait and see then!
---
Out of curiosity, who was the tuber?
---
Weird, I can get 490XP for high level super mutants. Do you have cranberry relish and inspirational?
---
Thanks, saves me testing wild crops and therefore xp/hr is saved. I'll add the note. OMG how did i forget the building team...I've been running that and it was the inspiration for this whole post...I'll admit I rushed this post before work
---
Are you on PC? Any mods? That’s a weird one. Maybe file a support ticket.
---
Well now I'm sad because if i do then I'm just copying you 😭
---
Oh good finally a reason to keep some grenades 😂 thanks I'll try that
---
I would imagine that is likely
---
I just put my gun away and run from the person I wronged.
---
Here's the video
---
https://youtu.be/eMKCXi1QGFA
---
Scorched Slayers Furious Double Tap Gatling gun?
---
I didn sort of the same thing after project paradise recently.. I joined as the friendly animals were just coming out.. so I decided to protect the lvl 0 bloatfly while 5-10 other people stayed in habitat A. After the other 2 friendlies died they all flocked to where I was and I did the thumbs down emote after the grafton monster got killed. But then I got stuck standing there booing everyone and didnt get to loot the grafton monster... 😖
---
This game turned into Destiny 2
---
Yes on the minigun as well
---
Dang I'm starting to talk like Ward I've been playing this game too long now 😂
---
Junk walls and more raider camp items!
---
Atom shop item, pint sized slasher. May have been part of a pack if I remember correctly.
---
SUCK!
---
2 hours from now. But it seems to be best to be logged off 15 minutes before that time, and log in afterwards. People seem to be getting auto-complete glitches without getting SCORE for it if they're playing during the switchover.
---
Yeah i think i hit it like 20 times yesterday lol.  Public team i was on had guys that kept using those lunchboxes.
---
Yeah hes not hard to fight in the sundew grove to be fair and i always make sure i hit it whenever i launch nukes at fissure prime but i rarely do so as i find the queen fight boring and repetitive for potential crap so i tend to nuke whitespring, morgantown or wherever the hell i want
---
They said they will remove negative effects from food/hunger system. So if you don't care you don't need to eat/drink. But if you do you will get benefits
---
Edited my post, sorry numbers were wrong.
---
I did see a camp that had 2 cats so I think it is possible
---
No. Just tame another one and the game will explain that this will replace any current pet.
---
12 Noon EST
---
The 20 hours is so those that DO log on every 24 hours, will have it already reset, with a little leniency for those that had a delay to logging on their normal time.
---
Great - thx
---
yeah even with the few things that I wanted with the gold. I still needed like 8k gold.
---
Tasty squirrel soup is the same as cranberry relish (for the carnivores out there)
---
It's funny - for a while there, the guys I play with thought you were stalking me, since you were showing up at all the Encryptid events we popped.
---
Xbox one no mods
---
LMAO Im just a whore for treasury notes and i know where the action is xD
---
Agreed, get me some raider stuff!
---
I have over 1200 Treasury Notes now...and 21 Fixer Plans.
---
There is a lot of them in bog zone. When people usually nuke area to fight queen. There is cranberry bog that looks like alien zone. You can get there around 20 of them without herbalist perk
---
Where does that sign show up in the build menu? I grabbed it for free but can't for the life of me find it in the build menu to use it.
---
Played NW for the first time ever this morning and it was not at all what I had expected.  I've heard so much stuff about bush wookies, afk and hackers I had really low expectations.  Ended up on a team with three other dudes that were playing well.  
---
They ended up winning.  I didn't make it though because when I got downed the game teleported my character 3 feet forward over the cliff ledge I was standing on and I fell 100 feet where nobody could get to me.  Not sure what that crap is lol.  Had fun though and will play some more matches now probably.
---
I want the Quonset hut that you find in several places across the wasteland.
---
Very cool! didn't even know this was in the game. I'll dig in and add it. Not sure it passes herbivore since scorchbeast brain does not pass brain fungus soup. squirrel are harder to farm too...
---
21 fixer plans.. damn lol nice.  You got caps to fall back on for a while
---
ahh i've seen this on xbox. Usually I run a few feet and try again and it works. But I'm on PS4/PC
---
Yes. Just run with an events team of 4 and do the repeatable XP score challenge. You get 4x XP plus use leader bobbleheads, cobbler, juice, etc.. You can get the repeatable 10 to 15 times in one day, depending on how much you play.
---
That makes sense, I was think of grinding a new character is when the double xp weekend happens.
---
Yup, just playing the game there is a chance you will lose your gun randomly. Lost my favourite legendary a while ago and still haven't been able to replace it. Support will just say "we don't have the tools to return items, thanks for your understanding!"
---
You don't make it better. And again, you are using those ambiguous words, in this case "other feel similar". There are things in game people don't like, because "it doesn't feel right". And guess what, this is ok. And is this case the current whinewave is based on 2 pillars.
---
1.) People doing the math wrong and tell the people that there are not enough points to finish the run. Which is wrong, those people always forget the double SCORE weekend and the repeatable XP challenge.
---
2.) The erroneous assumption that everyone has to finish the complete race. The other rewards you got will not dissapear, because you don't reach stage 100. 
---
If you are too casual or have not enough time to get to stage 100, stage 100 wasn't for you. As easy at it is. Because you got a buttload of rewards on your way to it. 
---
This whole whining is a perfect example of people that can't get enough. Before the season, most of the players got NOTHING for just playing the game. Only the ATOM farmers did their ATOM grind and will now have less ATOMS than before (and no, those people are not the majority), and instead get a more scattered array of rewards (which are worth WAY more than before, ATOMwise). EVERYONE ELSE now gets a bunch of rewards for nearly free for *just playing the game*. But it not enough, they want ALL THE REWARDS!!! 
---
Beth underestimated the FOMO and the inability of the people to contain themselves extremely. That is their only mistake. Examined with a little common sense this pass is absolutely fine, because it gives out rewards to everyone, even the people only playing 10 minutes a day or once a week. 
---
And again, if you feel that it is a job, you overestimate the effort to finish the challenges by a wide margin. If you think that doing those challenges 20 minutes a day is a chore, you should better stop playing the game, because it looks like, you didn't like playing it in the first place.
---
That doesn't count all of the ones I've sold....it's ridiculous.
---
That is awesome!!! I'm glad to hear it.  You have no idea how many people have told me something like this before.  I thought NW was gonna suck too but after my first game i just kept playing.  Every single one of my friends who i have introduced to it as well also was reluctant to try but ended up liking it afterwards!
---
The thing everyone here forgets is that the people most likely to be exploiting the game and doing shit like this are also not the same ones willing to spend the money to progress through levels. 
---
I personally don’t care if they lose out on someone else’s money. I only care that I get to play the game I paid for. Sure this exploit is the worst for Bethesda. Who cares. How about all the exploits that are bad for players? How about the hacked items and NW hacking? What about that time that hackers literally opened and emptied players like they were a common stash box? I don’t care how bad this is for Bethesda, as a customer I’m concerned about how bad it is for me, and as a customer that’s where my concern will stay. 
---
Oh, and if you’re gonna use the “they need money to operate” excuse you can sit back down. They’re already going to make more money even without people buying levels because people won’t be able to afford as many AS items anymore. Without the daily and weekly atoms we’re down about 4500-5000 each season. Considering there will be people who buy levels anyway and then more sales that purchase atoms now, they’re making a bigger profit either way. This will also increase FO1st sales as people will buy that instead of an atom bundle and then stick around for the Scrapbox
---
True I have played for exactly 1117 hours and haven't ever subscribed to fallout 1st. The scrap box dosen't make the game more fun it makes people more lazy. However if they were to make it to where the scrap box was in the game for free I think that most people would jump on that, and I can't really say I wouldn't. 
---
It's a dumb thing to pass up, but also a dumb thing to buy.
---
So only 19 lvl68 super mutant for 100 SCORE huh? Where are these sentry bots that gives that much of XP?
---
Hell, I Bush Wookieed for two matches the other day to hit my 30 minutes.
---
Nice! If you don’t wanna get waxed then you can enable passive mode, which will prevent PVP unless you’re wanted or you claim a workshop.
---
Welcome back!
---
Ah okay, well I wasn't 100% just knew you can only have one at a time.
---
Communal firepit gives 2 hours as well.
---
fyi there's a timer in game above the challenges for daily and weekly
---
Did it just stop working out of the blue or are you recently starting to use it with a new build?
---
Good on you for getting in there and doing it even if you dont wana fight.  Tbh that's the most difficult out of all the nw challenges as well so once you do that one the others seem so minor.
---
Just stopped working out of the blue.
---
I've got a 1000 hours in the game and never had this issue on ps4.  Definitely file a support ticket.  You may get that stupid canned message but it also might be the drop of rain that breaks the damn.  Also what is a double tap?
---
The defense takes longer though as you have to deal with the slow wave spawns. More loot and xp that just letting it get captured and retaking though.
---
Have you changed to a different primary weapon or switched perk points around recently?
---
Yeah if they are low level i just leave it but if its a useless workshop and a higher level i go over to give him the spooks, i dont usually have PvP encounters with low levels as when i was level 10 some level 200 came over and tried to pvp me and i stupidly engaged as he kept harassing me just cause i only had a hunting but guess what, i recently encounted him taking one of my workshops as a level 300 and i am level 160 and i recognized his name and went over with a metric ton of stealth boys and a quad tesla and proceeded to destroy him for half an hour with teslas and explosive minigun, it felt so good avenging my house before my teammate repaired it
---
I forgot to mention the guy was 247 haha was funny
---
No I been using the same weapon and yea I switched perk points only into strength it that’s as days ago
---
Different weapon types degrade at different rates. However the explosive effect degrades your weapon faster.
---
So in sort, yes.
---
Fixing the problem won’t increase Bethesda’s income stream. People buy new things, which increases their income. We all know where their priorities are.
---
Before the queen dropped improved repair kits I'd just buy it from bot vendors.
---
It's too much work to farm the stuff.
---
Once you start killing the queen regularly you'll never need it. Those repair kits pile up. Saw that I had 97 of them the other night. Dropped 60.
---
Except for the 'revive 2 players' challenge.
---
is vats mode being activated or just lack of targeting? if its going into vats but not targeting different limbs make sure you have concentrated fire on in perception
---
Fair enough man wasn't thinking
---
It's very handy indeed! And yeah, I agree with the Hunting one, just keep it as Building!
---
Another quick and easy way to grab XP - Sentry Bots. I'm quickly jumping to The Whitespring when I join a new server. Easy Peasy!
---
25k a day. That’s it. 
---
And with the public teams option, along with the boosted effects for a lot of XP foods, that’s pretty easy. 
---
At about 400 XP each, that’s about 25 for the repeatable. So about 63 will do it. 
---
Granted, most of the NW are pretty easy so far. But for those that really don’t want to play it at all, it’s not necessary.
---
Converserly, mine is usually reset in the morning. However if I happen to play again after the daily's reset (5pm here) then I get all the daily's done for tomorrow, today. Which means that if I have to do things like shopping then I dont need to log on until after 5pm tomorrow as thats when the new dailys will be available.
---
But if I do that, my vendors wont be available in the morning the following day, because the reset will then be 1pm instead.
---
Which then ends up with me having no idea when my vendors reset, because I cant remember exactly what time I logged on the previous day, and if I went and sold first, or if I did a bunch of events.
---
If it instead simply reset at midnight, then it would be available whatever time people log on.
---
I wish the same as i really want to full flesh out my heavy build but have 9 perception for my quad tesla and vampire fixer, i hate getting good weapons that arent for my build like my bloodied explosive black powder pistol but im not a pistol build.
---
What is your peception at? I could be wrong but I thought perception points affect how well VATS locks on to targets.
---
&gt; ... or just to appease shareholders.
---
That's all there is to it you commie bastard.
---
The game needs to generate more money than Bethesda puts into it.  Otherwise they'd shut it down, *hopefully* let us host our own servers, &amp; never release another update or patch again. 
---
Is one particularly useful item locked behind a paywall?  Yes.
---
But did they give everyone a free DLC in the form of Wastelanders?  Yes!
---
When I consider the totality of what they give away for free vs what they're trying to keep behind a paywall it really doesn't bug me or ring any alarm bells.
---
Anywhere you find the, one usually patrols outside watoga towards sunken rail yard. Also you can find one at robco where AWOL armaments is.
---
i think it's pretty obvious why we cant plant cranberries. i doubt it'll ever happen
---
Easiest way to see the rest timer is by looking at your dailies screen. It will show the time until next reset there.
---
If you ask a friend to help you its really easy to find a high place for you guys to jump off of and trade revives.  If you dont have anyone you can ask and are on xbox id be willing to help you next time it comes around.
---
Haha at level 15 i realized that workshops are warzones and to only take them if you are confident to fight the owner if he decides to defend his territory
---
No VATS just doesn’t lock onto nothing despite me spamming L1 all it does is just drain my AP. It worked in the queen fight yesterday
---
Toxic goo or a gamma gun works just as well
---
My perception is at 10
---
From what your saying then yes. Though I can do about 3-4 in 10 minutes depending if all the objectives are lose to each other so if you're in a group, then it could be them competing quests.
---
I can totally understand. The downside is that I end up frantically trying to get the attention of someone so they can tag a legendary enemy, only to find that they have voice chat disabled, so then I frantically have to use the emote wheel, only to find that they don't pay attention to that either.
---
\*shrug\* I suppose there's only so much that can be done. I tried.
---
Oh, but what what about the shit with my score challenges auto completing fucking me out of everything. Whilst I send a ticket to bethesda and they basically say "you're fucked, we can't give you the lost score." Yeah. I have proof. So it's not a lie.
---
Absolutely.
---
I think I had the ammo converter in the first day, but again, I was willing to grind. Just playing a little on the weekend should get you that. Maybe if that gets reworked to be more user friendly, someone could argue that they NEED it...but they don't. Ammo is pretty easy to come by in my opinion.
---
If the ammo convertor can be built in someone's camp who doesn't have the plan, I'll happily build one on PS4 for whoever didn't have time to get to level 5. 
---
And you're correct, the non cosmetic stuff is caps, scrip, or gold bullion...all of which are pretty easy to get in game.  And the lunchboxes, but, they don't do something incredible either. 
---
If level 100 was some overpowered legendary, I could see the complaint or argument. But really, the hardcore player is going to get some extra caps, etc.  That's not really an advantage since the hardcore player is already getting much more of those from playing every day than a casual weekend player could possibly get.
---
I just got a fancy single action from the bellhop, so I was running around the airport with amazing vats accuracy again. My main is junkie stealth commando, but the guy I was playing is a bloody strength build that's been using shotguns as ranged for a while. It was awesome popping folks from far away again in vats
---
I do not have friends and trying to find someone is far too much hassle (On PC But thanks for the offer!)
---
I've heard that's an exploit and refrain from its mention until proven otherwise. The fact that their loot appears and disappears kind of solidifies that for me. I'll earn the "hard" way i guess.
---
The robot challenge was the weekly one, not the daily, so your whole point is invalid. The daily challenges are finished in 20 minutes, less if you know what you are doing.
---
And as i said in other posts, why do you think that you are entitled to stage 100?
---
Mad Dog never go back to jail. NEVER!
---
\*15 minutes later the Warden be like\*
---
Aaayyyy you got a minute? Mad Dog has escaped. Again!
---
Are you using rifles I assume? If so do you have a sight or scope on it? I’ve read claims in the past that scopes increase your VATS lock on range. I’ve never tested this though personally. I always use a reflex sight. My VATS usually never acts up. I have 15 points in perception.
---
What do you mean by "village camp"? Do you want a CAMP in  a village?
---
It’s just one wasteland. The changes are only for level discrepancies. Nothing weapon or legendary wise will be changed.
---
Simple answer is to remove the time limit from SCORE. If new seasons come up then they should be available after you complete the first one. Bethesda’s artificial scarcity is stupid, the game already lacks a significant amount of content as it is and charges too much for the rest. It is absurd.
---
Never mind, i had sludge lung and that was causing me not being able to use VATS. I just went to white springs fountain then went to test my vats and it worked. Thank the lord
---
I've been wanting to move my camp to that part of the Savage Divide for awhile... So many awesome views of the bog and mire. My problem is I've had my camp in the same spot for well over a year now, and I have setup pretty well exactly how I want it. I'm having problems letting go lol
---
They’ve said before they’d be balancing weapons and effects before. I know about one wasteland but I know we got a comment that soon it would happen a while back
---
Nuka perk does boost cranberry
---
I got all 3 NW challenges done in one shot surprising me completely.
---
* place camp 3 times
---
* But then i got other things considered challenges!
---
   * Rank up to 25 for the first time (gun paint reward)
---
   * rank up to 25 (perk pack reward)
---
Done with NW this week haha
---
It's under Misc Structures
---
Because you can use your brain and came to the conclusion, that before the season you got NOTHING for just casually playing the game. We need more people like you, and less of these common senseless whiners.
---
My fallout first ended recently and you can withdraw mats from it but not add to it, you can no longer place the tent and you can still place a new one
---
Same! I keep trying to find them in the wild and tame them and bring them home, but I've had no luck so far.
---
This is the auto completing bug. It was doing this before they released the game board season bullshit.
---
I feel you. I have moved my base a few times, but I want to go back to my original locations, over looking White Springs.  
---
It has such a beautiful view.
---
You can pick whatever perks you like.
---
i needs that how i find said sub?
---
Don't forget a random puke pile/hairball every now and then! Cats are so generous with "gifts."
---
Maybe I'm missing something, but you can just pick it on your next level-up.
---
No, that’s three people to not run up on me and kill me.
---
One wasteland is the balance change. Technically it balances weapons and effects because if I’m level 300 and you are 20 I see a level 68 super mutant and you see a level 20. It makes your weapons just as powerful as mine.
---
The weird thing was, this wasn't showing up for both of us, maybe because we got each other banned on day 1? Dunno, it popped up in the recent list once I met him ingame though
---
Oh no, I'm sorry you lost all that SCORE :( This happened to me twice now, but I think I was online both times during the reset I didn't know we had to come off. So at midnight it resets and we should log off before that and wait for a certain amount of time? Can anyone kindly help me to understand the timings for it to be safe to load, as I didn't know it was to do with being online. I am GMT so not sure what time that would be for me. Its good to know we can at least get around this one though, right? :)
---
Ahhh I missing all the food buffs I forgot about them, though I don't come across too many deathclaws
---
Yea most say its role playing, some dislike marsupial because it makes the game like Halo. Me, my time is precious. I'll take the completely honest easy path where i can find it. Yes please double damage and free armor (adrenal/scaly skin/talons/twisted muscles/empath)...Yes please gliched obstacle avoider (marsupial) and finally, hell to the yes INT booster for XP grind (egg head and herd mentality)
---
There are 5 squirrels spread around whitesprings and 7 salt in the WS club house. I plant tatos in my base. Pretty easy to make tasty squirrel stew.
---
I’ve seen the comment you refer to as well, they’ve even taken feedback on the weapons from  this very sub. However it’s not been explicitly stated if one wasteland is part of this or not, so it’s safe that it’s a not at this point.
---
Content faster than we consume it? Well yeah, but cosmetics that have been added are hardly content and there is a ton of stuff still broken. It’s obvious this is a cash cow for Bethesda and they want to min-max. Minimal effort to maximize profits. The fact that it’s working puts the quality of their future games in serious jeopardy.
---
how many vending machines long is said train car?
---
The counter isn’t in the bundle?
---
You have it, you just need to pick it at your next level up, or right now if you have spare points.
---
I understand and already know about that. But a dev comment that was made a while back was going to re-look into balancing legendary effects and such. It’s not one wasteland but a separate thing. They also said they’re more into buffing instead of nerfing around this time
---
riveting read
---
Don't forget Butcher's Bounty while you're hunting squirrels.
---
Exactly what I was going to say.  The puncturing mod will make the power fist do a bit more damage vs SBQ, Colossus and other big enemies with a lot of dr.
---
almost all of the masks. minus any oversized ones, example the ones withete rocket sticking out of its face will not display. nore will any large mascot heads
---
Ohhhhhh it’s prob cause they opened saves card packs instead of hitting that lvl up
---
As others have said, there needs to be a consequence to dieing.
---
Bit dropping junk is in my opinion a bad way to go about doing it as you can either:
---
 have a load of scrap or flux on you and loose it all if a player finds you bag before you do,
---
Or, you are carrying no junk on you when you die and therefore there is no risk to dieing, you can die over and over with zero consiquesnce.
---
I would suggest that players drop a caps stash equal to their level, up to 50 caps. That way we all have consequences to dieing.
---
So a death results in dropping a cap stash, like the ones we see in the world,
---
But dropping junk through the pipboy, will still show as your chosen drop bag. Guts, gift box, pot of gold etc.
---
There could even be a charisma perk, similar to travel agent, that  halves the amount of caps you drop so that newer players don't suffer too much.
---
I tried to display my red rocket helmet and the WV Day Bear mascot, but no louck with either of those :(
---
Junk walls that are snappable would get my atoms
---
It includes both Colossal Problem event and updated legendary perks
---
yes
---
To each their own, your easy and my easy are different. Those would make 2.5 stew? One cranberry relish run for me nets nearly 15+ and with good with salt perk it lasts me 4-5 play sessions. I never run out and i use them every hour they expire. Good for you to find good salt and squirrel locations though. I'd honestly do that if i wanted more combat focus, because the HP regen from scorchedbeast food is NUTS. It lets you tank imposter sheepsquatch. I used to do that. If I find a veggie meal that gives me carno/scorchbeast steak levels of HP regen, its all over.
---
Place a new one, as in place a new scrapbox yes?
---
You only have an 800 pound stash so you have to be careful of what you keep. You can't hoard everything like fallout 4, junk you only need to keep about 50-100 of each. Stick to the forest area early on as the map is divided into 6 different sections that vary in difficulty!
---
meh.. only using you for my own gain anyway...
---
no shortage of team leaders 'round here.. Ill live...
---
I actually don't see that many people competing with me on the Burrows and West Tek clears  (Whitespring too spread out for my taste).  Reddit is a minority and a lot of players most likely think events are the way to go.  That and the vast majority of players are not optimal with their time in game.
---
What about the outfits you get from it?
---
Hi, were you able to unlock the Fallout Forever trophy (getting lvl 100) still?
---
True commitment, in fallout camp time thats like being married 20 years haha
---
They take there 10% from our vendors. Murph was designed with more decency, just won't rip you off. Who applies a flat tax in a post apocalyptic wasteland.
---
Ending was brilliant.
---
Well every time I see someone afk on my team I bring a AI to them and get them killed faster, but if your going to afk and not even be at your computer u should just go no fill, it won’t even effect your XP really and you wont be a dick for AFKing too
---
The reset is at 12 noon EST, so in about an hour and a half. Seems like consensus is stay off for 15 mins after reset to have best chances at not getting the glitch
---
If you can't suck it up to complete the extremely easy challenges, that's your problem.
---
Id say 3-4, but you can JAM that thing full of stuff looks like. Didnt have room for it at my clutter camp but its DEFINITELY long
---
also Contemporary. I did all of mine first go with the Contemporary walls.
---
We need more snap points. Why do stairs need to be dead center? You could add it to 1/3 and use the half wood floor. Why no corner staircase? Why no double sided wall-paperable wall? Why does the build overlay light up green even though you can’t actually place something?
---
Why!?
---
do we know if the P is public or private this round? (at work, bgs forums hate my mobile)
---
True, but he sells at 300 per 6k caps per week. So 500 extra is essentially ~11 days of gold, with a rep loss that recovers in less time just doing dailies.
---
The challenge yesterday was place your camp 3 times which takes all of 7 seconds.  The only reason to not get in there and do it is laziness.
---
You silver tongue'd devil you
---
It seens public again. I am just an xbox player though. 99% sure public though
---
Yesterday I took several claimed workshops, nobody defended them. Though I gotta be honest... It takes *forever* to claim them.
---
What are the changes to the perks?
---
I laughed. I cried. I may have even peed a little
---
I dont like camp building so can we not have any of those challenges too!  I mean placing a camp in NW takes 15 seconds so I cannt do that for score points.
---
It's random how many stars you get.
---
The dev team and hours in days are finite. You paid $60 for a game, and you got your hours out of it. If you have nothing left to do in the game, do something besides play. Be grateful the team still makes ANY content. Some games are $60 and last eight hours. You're not running a sweatshop of 24 hour-a-day developers to make eNd gAEm cOnTEnT for that measly $60 you paid.
---
Gonna have to hop in and check. It just went live, and I am on xbox. Check out the forums
---
Bashing damage increased by 40% on pump is one I know.
---
Fire rates over 200, with some legendary effects have been rumored to be as well. I'm not sure. Angrry Turtle has videos on them.
---
when i play on my fifth toon at level 15 and have nothing to share anyway, you can be replaced easily with someone more fun team with.
---
Depends on circumstances. If the other 3 people are spawning in individual spots I’m afk or bush Wookie. If we spawn together I stick with the team. What the team does dictates what I do.
---
Reset to one in each then
---
Welcome home friend 🤘🏼
---
Oh thank you so much! I'm so pleased you answered so quickly as I'm online right now! Sorry to ask more questions, but would you suggest I go offline before the reset or can I stay in game but just not log off or change characters for at least 15 minutes after the reset time?
---
Oh snap, they gone fix the ammo converter by 21
---
Yes and it is beautiful.
---
This sound like a YOU problem not a problem with the game. I for one am really enjoying the run.  I'm just waiting for Bethesda to cave and turn something that is great for dedicated player into a steaming pile of worthless crap cuz the casual player wont stop crying about it.  And since when have you ever played a game with a similar battle pass type that was made for everyone to complete, I've never seem a single one.
---
Can someone explain the “coin” he’s referring to? Yet another currency?
---
Thanks for checking! I wish they would list which ones can be displayed. I would be way more willing to buy the ones that can be displayed.
---
I actually played a match of NW and got all 3 done at once? Weekly and daily so that’s strange.
---
Come on...don’t by shy. You know you peed a lot.
---
No i don’t mean people camping In the bushes or going off on there own or anything like that, I mean the people who use keyboard auto clickers and go away from there computer and AFK for hours and hours, just jumping in 1 spot
---
I guess your right, I’ll bush wookie the rest our
---
It’s a trap
---
Isn't there also supposed to be and option "buy levels for Atoms" at some point?
---
Not sure what the cost on that is, but if you're not into cosmetics you do accumulate some Atoms as rewards along the way which might allow you to "buy" your way forward and skip a few levels
---
Clever!
---
The revive 2 players I did not complete but the next day while playing for the thirty minutes I ended up reviving 6 different team mates. Had me so mad lol
---
Most people say get offline. I've been online with no issues. I think the issue is logging on while it's trying to reset the challenges, it autocomplete those that haven't loaded but that also means you cant fast travel or enter/exit a building while it loads. I'd be safe and log off
---
I had to strip back pretty far but I just squeezed a dinner in.
---
Only with an MOD not an official port.
---
Sure, I'll share something useless because I've got less than 6 CHA and all my Perks are level 2 or higher.
---
Why does everybody stand on that building during SBQ?   I'm always running around trying to collect fluids and mass.  Usually just ignore the queen until she lands because she can't even hurt you (and I can't do squat to her in the air anyway).
---
Warframe has a battle pass done right. After you complete the current weeks challenges then you can do previous challanges from other weeks.
---
Your point becomes moot the second you take into account that some people (including me) paid full price for this game when it came out. 
---
There’s your revenue.
---
Nevermind the fact they absolutely butchered the launch and shelled this mess out for half the price like two weeks later.
---
Guess we who paid the extra cash just turned out to be the guinea pig idiot beta testers, huh?
---
If you wanna run a subscription service that is pretty much required to enjoy your game, you don’t just take 60 quid on top of that. 
---
And to stick with your analogy, I‘m not paying a movie ticket every month for a movie I‘ve already seen a hundred times. The endgame is grinding the same dailies and nothing else.
---
My ticket got locked too. This sucks.
---
I never claim workshops so please don't include those either! :(
---
It is not just SCORE challenges.
---
When I need milk for pepperoni rolls, I usually start Riding Shotgun.  The pack brahmins seem to always give milk, and always at least 2.  The cows outside seem more normal.
---
Get over yourself
---
Bruh, crying about how he can’t be bothered to place down a camp 3 times
---
Yes sir!! Rich bush wookie are you
---
IDK.  
---
My main is the furthest along as far as progression in 76.  
---
I completed Beckett's and astronaut lady's but as a guy it feels so wrong and weird to do it to a fake male NPC. I haven't met the other two yet but I think the option is there for all 4 of them.
---
Yes, mod or not it still works great.
---
Dang. Well thanks for the heads-up
---
Burrows has least traffic maybe because of the loading screen for entering (same with west-tek? But i do see people occasionally. 
---
Based on game mechanics though, you definitely want to broaden your routes. Because 1, it takes 10min for an area to respawn for you again with you away from area, and 2 the game is said to keep a list of last kill creatures. Sticking to the same place may impact legendary spawn rates, as well as overall mob spawn rates. I've not tested but from the limited experience i have doing runs the past week every day, i noticed a bump in legendary kills at a single location, that i had not visited in awhile. I'm not sure if its coincidence, but if the trend continues this week, that's good enough for me. If i stick to only the top 3 places, i find that i'm lucky to get 1 legendary let alone the 5 I've seen people get.
---
I carry a fair amount of weapons.
---
Bloodied Lever action, handmade, pole hook and switchblade. Those are my everyday all the time weapons.
---
But I'm a heavy guns user, too. For boss fights. Got a junkies plasma caster, bloodied 50cal, (for the queen) and a vampires LMG (for encrypted )
---
I could keep my heavy guns in my stash and pull them out for the boss fights. But that's not always convenient. Better to keep them on me.
---
I completely agree on this.
---
Thank you, I wasn't too sure!
---
It is the perk coin system from scrapping your regular perks for legendary ones
---
You dont have to actually build anything. Just build a decoation/ foundation and delete it 10x. But making us log into NW just to artificially inflate the number people that play the mode is stupid.  For the most part the season rewards arent useable in NW! So why include that mode in the grind..!?
---
I have it but it's not an official port an you have SFE dependencies + many people don't want to install any mods.
---
Hard to say they are ruining their game by not being forced to grind daily for a “challenge” that asks you to pay money for time you didn’t get to commit to the game to earn rewards. This is a greedy cash grab by Bethesda disguised as an in-game event. If they truly wanted this to be free content they wouldn’t ask for atoms or they would just remove the time limit and add more season boards as time goes on. You complete this one? Advance to the next one.
---
Not everyone has Charisma.  Some people don't have it in real life either.
---
Also in fo4, since they reused most of the stuff.
---
I know I got lucky and every team won't be like that but it was a nice introduction.  Everyone worked and moved as a team.  I was struggling to find anything better than the cultists blade and revolver I picked up and one of the dudes dropped me a Tesla which got me those 2 kills against level 50+ players with my level 0 dude lol.
---
Whelp there’s nothing to complain about on my end, plus I got to do the 5/5 workshop one x2 so 2k points.
---
It’s carnivore only (like scorchbeast brains). Yes, harder to farm, but more xp. Scorchbeast brains gives +3 while brain fungus soup is only +2
---
No problem man. Happy to help you out!
---
It is a weird one, that the other Robots don't give XP. Recently they changed it so that they now don't drop any loot.
---
Equip Machete and chase teenagers from the campground...
---
Best thing I found to cope with it, is to have a few characters each with their own theme to their camp.
---
Make them small and detailed, don't just cram every new thing you earn or unlock just because you have it. 
---
I mean if you want a horrible ugly camp with plushies and lights everywhere go ahead, but I find them to be  too gaudy.
---
Thanks, i fond it.👍
---
Ish. Scrapping a Perk Card gives you a Coin. Coins are spent to buy Legendary Perks. At least that's what I've been seeing.
---
Thanks.  I unlocked the guile suit already.  Does that mean i will not be able to get them now?
---
True.  
---
However, the ones here were/are in different tribes and not all got along. I'm part Cherokee (not enough to get anything out of it) as are many on my maternal side of things.  
---
My 4th great-grandfather got killed by Cherokee Indians in a shootout. Yes, Indians here got guns at some point.  
---
For me, I refer to 99% of people by their name in any situation. If I have a brain fart then I'll use a random applying descriptor until I'm reminded or said brain decides to work properly.
---
This is him. This is the guy one shorting all the legendaries at uranium fever. 
---
Fucking fun sponge cyborg.
---
Then they don't want perk loadouts, it not hard to get up and running.
---
the amount of xp given for living just a bit longer vs killing someone is part of the reason there is so many bushwookies. It is more profitable to hide in a bush than to engage in combat.
---
So you decide what works for the rest of the player base.  What a joy you are.  I have a nice camp I dont wanna piss around with anymore than you wanna wait 2 minutes to get in a lobby.  So entitled and stop down voting people that disagree with you.
---
I dont understand this so it's a bad system cuz your not good enough at the game to complete it???
---
Yeah I've been trying that on Xbox but last night it sucked! Why should we have to do that is my point I guess
---
Nah, you just gotta keep grinding XP... There's a list  online with the XP required to unlock the various rewards
---
I really really want some perks to boost the damage of throwables. I use tomahawks all the time.
---
Or..  wild concept here... they stop trying to force people to play a gamemode they dont enjoy by including it in content people do enjoy. 
---
Total joke that they've this set as a weekly challenge
---
Common problem. Been this way for a while. It's best to not play during the rollover. I'd suggest stopping and closing the game 15 minutes before the rollover and then opening back up afterwards.
---
4-5 with butchers bounty and super duper.
---
Did you understand? That's all that matters. Want people to know why I kick them.
---
I believe them when they say they can't credit lost SCORE, but what they CAN do is either:
---
A. Extend the season by the same amount of time it takes them to fix this bug (currently at 8 days) or  
---
B. Award Atoms, which they can do and can be used to buy the missing SCORE ranks.
---
Started playing a month ago, and I never actually used the throwing knives or tomahawks, just kinda hoarded them in stash. Super hyped to try this out, thanks!
---
Same thing here. Was farming hardened mass in WS the other day, had around 30 on me. Inside the golf club is a guy swarmed by ghouls so i decide to help him out real quick. I end up hitting him, then when all the ghouls around him are dead he switches to a legacy tesla and kills me. Best thank you ever for saving someone's life, in the end he took all my junk too.
---
I also tested ActionGirl last night and in three tests it is 100% working for my build.
---
Same happened to me.. lost 4500 S.C.O.R.E. 
---
I filed a ticket and got the same useless answer. ALOT of people have had this happen
---
I server hop right after clears.
---
That's not me. And I've got a nice base too. Its extremely easy to build a foundation and delete it. Sorry you cant be bothered to do that... lol.
---
I had this happen to me, with a random emote while doing sbq. I was able to open pipboy and switch weapons, that seemed to get me out of the emote animation
---
Sorry that you.cannt be bothered to spend 5 minutes away from your comfort zone.
---
Larry’s meats. 3 snarlygasters right at spawn point. Bonus acid and extra food items.
---
In my experience they last 2.5-3x longer.
---
Was working well until someone dropped a Nuke xD
---
It's going to be very rare for someone to enjoy EVERY aspect of a game as big and diverse as 76.  I dislike building a lot.  I think it's boring.  But I don't complain when I have to go build things for the challenges.  I hoof my ass over to a workshop and take it and build my stuff and get my score and don't complain.  
---
Some people enjoy different aspects of 76 (yes even NW) and everyone should at least have a minor representation in the challenges.  Hell, how do you think the people who ONLY play nuclear winter feel?  They get totally shafted.  
---
If you want all of the rewards you might have to do something that you don't enjoy occasionally.  Welcome to MORPG games.
---
Ok..........and what lead you to believe they were American
---
I forgot that the burrow existed. thanks for reminding me. they were touting it as being difficult for a 4 player group of 50+. the only way I could see that being true is if everyone is using shotguns but is running a pistol build and using base weapons that they found at the beginning of the burrows.
---
aka, Bethesda doesn't play their own game
---
You get ACCESS to the perk at lvl. 20. Just like any other perk, you go pick a new one everytime you level up.
---
The perk card packs are just extra perk cards.
---
Alternatively Bethesda could remove the time limit from seasons and just let it be a normal game feature.
---
I farmed enough bullion to get the plans I wanted, and yes actually I got the trophy for max reputation for both factions. I had 2 characters. 
---
Was this meant to be a gotcha?
---
Works with gauss shotguns, too.
---
Oh, ok.
---
I've always thought that Power Armor users didn't get enough love, be cool to get maybe some stickers to customize your armor, make it your own. Maybe some addons too, like the Settler's PA skin has tools on the chest, and one arm. Be able to add a holstered laser pistol on hip, Blow Torch on a wrist, stuff like that.
---
Here’s what you’re[looking for](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hj8wac/psa_here_are_the_nw_christmas_and_halloween/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)
---
Okay! Yes I think you're right, better safe than sorry. Thanks a million for your help, you're a real superstar! Just in case anyone was wondering the same as me on timezones, it would be a 5PM reset time in the UK.
---
Thank you again!
---
What's the point! The rewards have nothing to do with NW. Why make people play a shitty game mode
---
It's an extra challenge though from what I understand.  Last week there were only 6 Adventure only weeklies and this week there are still 6 Adventure only weeklies and an added 1 for NW.  It's basically a bonus challenge if you decide to go for it.
---
I can still craft them, i think you keep cosmetic items but you dont keep the actual game changing features e.g. the tent and scrap box
---
The keypad on the pole or the one built onto the automatic doors?
---
Ah I see. Thank you
---
Oh nothing I was just saying what lead to someone even thinking about making a post about the train car my bad if you took it as something else
---
Since your clothes are on the outside of the armor they wouldn’t be invisible.
---
Tom Cruise and his cohorts from Minority Report swoop in and take them off your back and rifle through your inventory and stash to take any in storage......
---
You keep what you have....cannot craft more or new ones even if you accidentally scrap an equipped one.
---
No worries, good luck out there in the wasteland :)
---
Is the violence causing such silence really presenting the need?  
---
When you get Cranberries, you get Zombie!
---
really nice guide!  btw, live &amp; love #8 is plus xp when in a team.  like the bobblehead, its nice to have but almost impssoble to farm
---
I'm hopeful that they will do a double score weekend or something. Most games with season passes do event weekends
---
its a rather safe spot because the fences around it. mobs can access it only from one direction, making it an easy to defend position. people choose this place to dont need to divide their battlefield awareness between the queen and her adds. the position can get ugly when huge predators manage to enter the platform...
---
For the sake of clutter camping PLZ more budget pleeeeeez
---
The prices in the first vendor are terrible! Do you ever sell anything?
---
But The ballistic bock at 5 caps is really low actually, I craft 30 or so now and then when i have too much boiled water, and they sell at 25 caps each straight away.
---
That’s odd because I did get that trophy with my beta character! I actually had to create a new character to replay the beginning after release to get the story trophies. I only have one character over level 100 and that was my beta char ☹️
---
I would spend any amount of atoms for a firewatch/ranger tower.
---
Do you get mad when a restaurant expects you to pay for your meal today because you bought a meal there last week?  You've already paid once!  Why do those leeches want more money?!?
---
This game costs Bethesda money to host in the cloud, to store the data.  Doing nothing new still costs them money to keep the lights on.  That reality doesn't get through a lot of numb skulls.
---
Now to create new content like Wastelanders, the upcoming BoS storyline, etc.  Patches with bug fixes &amp; QoL improvements all costs a lot more money.
---
Yet 99.99% of the game is free to anyone who paid the original price nearly two years ago.
---
And a snooze emote for dipshits and the SBQ
---
But not wrong and weird to do it to a fake female NPC?
---
Oh I see what you did there. NO charisma on this one
---
I find the build mode shitty why make me play that?
---
Why did you add the part of Americans? You know that this post is just some imperialist offensive shit. And im quite the opposite of a patriot mind you yet this still offends.
---
yes, I need to build my camp with an old cargo ship that I found in a land lock state.
---
His TV had a built in microphone?
---
Could be your share of caps from a teammate’s PvP kill if you’re on a team of three?  Maybe?
---
Everybody who plays that way is so selfish. They only think about themselves. Having 3 people not out to kill you makes you more likely to survive, but does having 1 Bush Wookie make the team have a better chance at winning? I think not.
---
i DoNt pLAy FaLloUt sO iT iSnT fAiR tO HaVe ANy cHalLeNGeS aT AlL
---
Drop your power armor like your going to get into in in a power armor station. Their all over the place and then you can do the same thing as a weapon or armor station choose to modify/repair and go to your helmet it will be there
---
Building a camp is 50% of what this game is about. Maybe try playing a different game if you dont like it...
---
tbh i was actually having a good time until they fucked me yesterday. auto-completed challenges dicked me out of 4500 SCORE, and it borderline completely killed the entire game for me.
---
Shit, I thought it was 2k. Any place I can see the current currency limitations?
---
Are those letters part of the 11000 cap neon lights set you get at watoga?
---
Bro, do you remember the hype for the burrows?  NGL we did prep crafting ammo and gathering meds and shit in the week before it came out LOL.  Felt so dumb
---
Could be an interesting short spoof for the channel :P
---
anytime :P
---
Well, everything I say is a me issue of course, I can't speak for anyone else, but I think obviously I'm not alone.  Like I said to a few others if you are still happy cool, and if you aren't I would suggest not putting up with it.    
---
I do play two games with passes that are easy to complete, though one of them is arguable.  MTG Arena is very easy, just takes like 15 wins a week, and completing all the weekly quests, which takes around 4-5 hours at most, and you don't need to log in every day, plus they have small catch up events all the time.  it has a pay track, but the free track is pretty generous.  I have some issues with the rest of the monetization, but it's f2p experience is solid, so I don't mind too much.    
---
Rocket League is more arguable, because it has 70 levels of unique items but after that you get different colored versions (and rare special versions) of some of the things you unlocked, but it's super easy to gain levels with very limited time investment.  I play like twice a week for a few hours and I'm nearly level 300 with like a month left in the pass, and I still have a few colors of things left to go.  It also has a weekly series of easy quests for a boost, and you earn enough for the next pass playing it.  RL also has monetization issues I don't like (non pass cosmetics are astronomical), but it's all 100% cosmetic and the core experience is great, and that's why I play.
---
I can't remember where, I think it was some IGN interview or something. It was just text, no video or anything.
---
They said, and *acknowledged* that it has been the most requested feature for FO76, but they have no "plans" to ever actually add it. For whatever reason.
---
This is a very good Nukashine PSA.
---
I started a strength build to run heavy... But holy donkey balls, unarmed for 1500-2000+ damage a swipe on the queen?! I run around with a shotgun and switch to my melee for the queen... Changed my life
---
I see your point. Why waste 10 seconds sharing a card when you can just be a useless parasite?
---
I'd agree, but, this is an EXTRA weekly. If you noticed, we had one less last week. So this isn't taking up a "slot" of another adventure mode weekly, it's just added on top of everything else.
---
He wasn't using his PTT
---
They only saod that up to the steam release it wasn't a priority, implying that PC folks were a negligible % of the game's population.
---
This may or may not have changed, but the way they keep addressing various things about the game shows that they care very little about PC gamers, despite their history with the platform.
---
O I am sorry gatekeeper of challenges and people play styles.  Man your something else.
---
You care an awful lot about something that doesn’t effect you in the slightest.
---
Any road near it.
---
Where does Bethesda describe the procedure for rollover and not losing SCORE? Can someone provide a link to an official response?
---
I know the mothman cultists headpieces can be displayed in the Thanksgiving display.
---
Besides the golf course, the only two places I can think of that are flat enough for that is the cranberry glade and toxic valley. Maybe one or two places in the savage divide.
---
remember the deep sea diver suit that was shown in the trailer for it that is still not available for the players. you can find the suit on a dead NPC in wastelanders but otherwise you cant get it.
---
The in game community is awesome. Places like this sub are cancer.
---
It’s amazing what you can accomplish when you play the game. Many people don’t understand this or can’t understand this because their skill prevents them.
---
Lazy bastards at Bethesda.
---
so the nexus chat mod is the only alternative way i guess....
---
What’s a PTT?
---
Start another character. Trying to do anything productive with workshops is a bit pointless, especially on public.
---
I've just been claiming them and then running off to do something else. It costs a small amount of caps, but awards some stuff (including plans sometimes) every time you do it.
---
I actually sell stuff fairly regularly. Chems are expensive, but on the whole my prices are fairly low compared to so many other players who like to gouge.
---
25 caps for a beer? Do YOU ever sell anything?
---
Oof.
---
You could’ve told him to check the map and server hop, I guess, but what’s done is done. Good job.
---
Agreeeeed ten-fold, ran into the same thought process last night. More budget and more vendors 🤘🏼
---
that's a sad news =/
---
I bet he was a mouth breather too. The ones that don’t use PTT are always mouth breathers. 
---
But for real, that sucks man.
---
Oh, the one on the pole. I'm not sure about the doors now
---
Yeah that threat might have worked when teams weren't a public thing anyone could start lmao.
---
Yeah, OP is hugely exaggerating. 
---
Those with the mindset of using exploits are rarely the same as those that have the mindset to spend money for advancing legitimately. 
---
And even though the likelihood of bans occurring is slim, those that spend money regularly on the game are far less likely to take that risk. 
---
It’s two different mindsets; those that want to get things for free using exploits, and those willing to open their wallets to gain those things. 
---
The Venn diagram where those two overlap has a very thin crossover. 
---
Yes, those that abuse glitches or use exploits should face penalties. But there is not some huge impact on income. 
---
Considering that we aren’t even yet to the point where the whales could spend their money, this analysis is reactionary and premature.
---
that was me. It was only the evening before the last day that I finally got the Raven and only the afternoon of the last day that I finally got the Crazy Guy Mask. I was going crazy. I am still trying to get rid of all of my skull and sun masks.
---
That is not a bad idea... I have a 2nd character who is lvl 25. I could level him a bit and build the stuff I want. I think I might just do that!
---
Ran into a guy yesterday who said he may have seen a snallygaster and shit his pants. Pretty damn funny.
---
Okay, you’ve got my attention now.
---
Oh I'm just letting people know. There isn't anything I can do about it now
---
Playing on Ps4 I don't see cheaters, or at least I'm ignorant enough to not see them even if they are there, but to be fair, cheaters are the reason I haven't felt the need to get it on pc
---
I'm innocent!
---
This ain't Red Dead, bro. Most try to take care of our own fellow vault dwellers. Glad you had a good experience.
---
Exactly, this is a bonus extra weekly for the people that like NW.
---
I don't like NW personally,  but I'm not going to complain that the people that do play it are given a chance to earn some score.
---
In your camp bring up your pip boy and go to junk. Press Right Button to view components. Tag for search: aluminium, adhesive, screws.
---
i vote for A. as it would benefit everyone.
---
Maybe the wiki, but it's 1k scrip, 5k gold, 30k caps. Think that's all of them
---
What time do challenges reset every day?
---
No girl will ever turn you down from now
---
Jokes aside good job I don’t think I could have done it
---
I saw somebody with the Captain Cosmos Jetpack that you get around level ~80ish and I was like “no fucking way this dude already managed to grind that legit.”
---
This isn't FO4. Learn to use throwing knives and they'll make early level progression easier. Plus they're cheap for only using steel.
---
Bethesda doesn't provide this type of information. It's pretty much all player generated data.
---
They likely don't even care.
---
I didn’t add anything American related? I was just saying people were annoyed / confused on why the train car was in there, I didn’t fully read his original post as I just woke up and didn’t fully realize he was being a dink
---
Just HELL no.
---
Wallpaper is a STUPID idea, because you're getting twice the CAMP cost, but double sided wallpaper walls? That's THREE TIMES the CAMP cost.  Instead they need to make the wallpaper a variant of the wall itself.  Instead of having to apply a skin to the wall, have the wall ITSELF have the variant part of it, so you're not doubling/tripling up on CAMP build cost which is already bad enough.  I don't even do wallpaper at all because my budget is already near max. That cuts down on the CAMP budget AND cuts down on additional rendering effort for a CAMP because it reduces the number of items needing drawn.
---
Melee builds are some of the most powerful if done right yes. Blimey they’re so much to this game it’s hard to know where to start with tips.
---
Don’t rush the main quests. The end game is not the greatest yet but there’s more stuff coming before long so if you can bear it don’t just go straight through it all. There’s lots of side quests and things to get distracted with you can do in between the main stuff and stretch it out and enjoy it with some filler.  
---
Beyond that I’ll just say for a start welcome and good luck in the wastes. If you’re on PC I’m same name in game as here and I’ll happily give you some stuff to get you started if you add me or find my camp. 
---
Otherwise I hope you have fun and people can answer your question in more detail.
---
Look out for people shooting at paper bags and throwing emotes your way including the one where it has a present, they are likely trying to give you a freebie of some sort.
---
I want shipping containers and the warehouse/industrial buildings and gangways e.g. at the back of the west tec facility, FO4 junk walls, plus more crates, barriers, like the tire barriers they added.
---
I took a look through, and I would generally love to read a book series like this! It’s amazing to see the creativity you have, and I entirely just loved this novel
---
hey how do you play music in-game so they others can hear you?  
---
Playing music via Speaker and then put ur mic close to it?
---
Well, gauss shotguns are shotguns. What would be interesting to know is whether it happens on every other multi projectile weapon, like TS and beam splitter energy.
---
Or just have someone like me find you, drop the CAMP, and trap you inside a blue print. No way out until someone with Combat Shotgun blows the walls out and kills you. Maybe have a powered up siren to let everyone know where you are?
---
How would you have preserved the squirrel meat or stew for two months after the event
---
Throwing knives saved me so many times in the early game. Plus when PVP was still a thing they did a number when I was attacked.
---
I think I found their latest comment on it from here, April 30, 2020:

**Q: shtehkdinner asked: “Will an area text chat system be implemented for PC, or has that been scrapped?”**
---
* **A:** Text chat is something we see requested often,  we looked at implementing it early in development. Currently this year  we have a number of other quality of life improvements we're tackling.  As a PC player, I too would like to get text chat implemented in the  future.
---
Nobody Is forcing you to play NW, it's a nice bonus for the players that do play NW and enjoy doing so.
---
It's also very easy to do, so even if you don't like NW, you can still unlock the score without much effort.
---
It's not like it's 'win 3 games of NW' for god sake!
---
Admittedly it is a weak "threat". At worst you are gonna lose a couple minutes waiting for the bond that never happens if I kick you before it happens. I worded it in an intentionally aggressive way to get attention. Hopefully a few readers will say "I should share a card, and be a decent person", a few will say "I should do that too, I want team members that contribute", then you have the fucktards who responded with various "meh, I'm not doing that, it's inconvenient or whatever". Those last I don't care about.
---
Um, this is why it's called a "challenge" - don't bemoan having a challenge that's simply a facet of the game that you personally don't like... Either accept it for what it is, or move on
---
I dont think it would be a difficult thing to implement either.
---
No, more getting to the root of the question. You don’t care for some content and your definition of finished is unique to your play style, so asking people on reddit if it’s worth it to come back is pretty stupid.
---
Same here. I made it to the top 15 by going bush wookie the whole time and was very pleasantly surprised to see that weekly challenge tick when the match ended
---
I almost didnt go through with it, but I persevered. Because I had nothing better to do
---
Noon eastern
---
I gave my year-long CAMP a proper burial by dropping a nuke on top of it. It was easier to move after that.
---
I bought it, then realized I didn't know what to do with it. It's basically a awkwardly long, narrow shed.  I'd really like if the doors on each end and the hatch on top opened, but only one end is open. I ended up just throwing all my crafting benches in it. It would work really well if you wanted just a really small one building camp set up.
---
I agree that we all play differnet but disagree that players should just do things they dont enjoy to get things they do. 
---
I dont expect to enjoy all aspects of this game but do i really have to join a nw world, wait for lobby, join game, spam a camp out 3 times and leave, just so i can participate in the grind fest that is seasons, Where is the value in that??? Im happy to grind but can i at least grind doing something i enjoy?? If you enjoy NW thats cool too, have separate challenges.
---
I think they really need to overall the daily and weekly tasks to be a range of challenges that rewards different play styles. Same limit on how many you can achieve but more options to go about it, that approach makes alot more sense then what they do now with nw, building, collection, killing and levelling challenges mashed together.
---
I 100% do get pissed off when im forced to spend time building random ass wall ornaments to then immediately scrap them all for a challenge. I enjoy base building but on my own terms, not at the request of a daily task.
---
How do you think people in NW feel getting lobbies of shit because people bail out 10 seconds in after spamming a camp out 3 times.
---
Look at gta online, super popular after 7 years, still making bucket loads of cash and its an absolute fucking grind machine but its your choice as a player how to grind and what to do to get the content they release that you want. Seasons content is behind a system that offers only one way to get the content, doing whatever the devs tell you for the day.
---
I replied to their “we can’t credit score” by asking if they can award atoms to make up for the gap.  Haven’t heard back.
---
I know the feeling    I decided to ignore the bullions tho I need to get back on 76 I havnt played in a good few months haha
---
You’re holding back your full potential and creativity by building on flat ground. If you love building than find the most fucked up rake and figure out how to make it work.
---
When your team mate finishes a quest you get some caps
---
It's why I have a few of them. I love the building side of things but sometimes you make something you wouldn't want to replace so it's best to start a new character. If you take advantage of team buffs and perks it doesn't take long to level up. I did level 26 - 50 yesterday on one.
---
When I play NW there is always a loading screen which starts around 2minutes.  How do you get put in a match faster.  I’d prefer to get the challenge done in 15 sec.
---
This was me.
---
I seriously hope you use it and have fun doing so, I just wish that all learned bullion plans were shared across all our characters.
---
Noice, 25% more trash to stuff into my vendor.
---
Could you perhaps give us a small update on this? I worked hard/took time off for each of those events to get those supposed limited-time items. Now I see everybody and their dog getting the rewards and it’s causing my eye to twitch a little bit...
---
YouTube has many good videos to help out. If you want some of the more quirky builds that are very awesome, check out angry turtle.
---
Oh also, mutations hurt and can help if you get one. Radaway removes them, rad x suppresses them for a short period of time, and decontamination showers remove them as well. If you want to keep a mutation but need to remove rads. Use nukaorange or brahmin milk.
---
Beware your inventory limit, stim packs and grenades add up fast, and don't craft too much gunpowder because it weighs more than its ingredients.
---
Personally I discard or sell my grenades to npc vendors because they lack in strength.
---
I found one an couldn’t take it myself.  I begged for anyone on the map to join.  Need a game announce event or something.
---
Yes, I've seen from screenshots that you claim it in the atomic shop, so it's just like any other item from there. Claim it once, own it forever.
---
&gt; so even if you don't like NW, you can still unlock the score without much effort
---
Did you actually read what i wrote?
---
Why can't I apply the damn things to windows without replacing the wall first
---
Bethesda not big on saying sorry tbh
---
thanks.
---
it's looks like that's just one developer's saying, nothing is confirmed. oh boy.
---
I see your point and I do agree with you. But every time you go into combat. The team can get weaker and leads to bush wookieing too due to how you get like 5-10 kills worth of xp. I also found that a team of 2 is more powerful than someone who takes all the ammo and healing items for themselves which is also extremely common. If you haven't the ammo or healing, you're best hiding the match away or till that person goes away. Something I found just as common as bush woolies too are lone wolves, which again if your team isn't very good or you can't solo NW then bush wookieing again is the best option.
---
Bethesda really needs to just change how you get rewarded xp to stop it. Selfish or not, that fact you get so much xp for being in the last 10 means even can if you planed on working with your team, you will most likely benefit from teamwork. You most likely will just screw yourself over.
---
also Herd Mentality mutation for +2 while on a team.
---
Well, with me you're getting "Strange in Numbers" whether you like it or not, it's permashared :-)
---
Our drug issue, namely our Opioid issue is causing ~4000 + deaths a year over the past 3-5 years, making it responsible for something like 1-3% of all Canadian Deaths annually.  Not ideal. 
---
Now our treatment FNP and the decimation of their culture and traditions is arguably what I loathe most about our history. As recently as residential schools, the ongoing poor conditions of reserves, and the lack of respect, dignity and fairness displayed by consecutive governments regarding land has been atrocious. The issue of MMIW is still an unacceptable display of a lack of priorities. 
---
The treatment of indigenous people is a sad, shared history between the US and Canada
---
I've only done 1 NW challenge but the stats say 2/3
---
In case you didn't see it, here's Volume 1
---
[Enclave Field Guide &amp; History 2102 - 2104 Volume 1 - Reclamation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16Ub1sY8nKXr1CSJF--OHXLKLLJjeXxRP3NIBEVsgAbU/edit?usp=sharing)
---
Appreciate your username- loved h*r.
---
Atop in and acrivate riding shotgun
---
I’ll most definitely read that one through in a minute. Really interested!
---
I've had alot of fun with the shotgun and regular SS set. I only use the T65 for nuke zones as my SS vangaurd set has almost the same DR and ER
---
But I cant beat the inherent DMG reduction and RAD reduction the PA gives
---
But it only takes a few minutes... and you get rewards.  It seems so silly to complain about something that occupies like 5-30 minutes of my time a day that gives me free stuff.  
---
Like yeah i guess they could do what you said and create tons of different challenges to make it appeal to everyone and only allow a certain number to be completed.  But this is season 1!  Maybe they will flesh out this stuff in the future.  This is quite literally the live test run since the season pass wasn't on the PTS.  Idk, it takes me a hell of a lot less playtime to rank up my battlepass on 76 than it does on modern warfare.
---
Also I haven't played GTA online in many years but when I was on that everyone cheated so it sucked lol.
---
Damn. I'm trying to do the same but its tough work.
---
thats what youre doing isnt it?
---
you dont care about your team mates beyond what they can give to you right?
---
There were 7 adventure weeklies last week. I'm not completely against an NW challenge so long as reaching 100 is doable without regularly playing NW daily for any extended period of time. Espexially seeing as it messes up stuff in adventure. 
---
Logged into NW for the first time yesterday and when I joined back onto Adventure all my challenges were no longer tracked and my workbenches didn't show anything for a while.
---
[Last weeks challenges](https://m.imgur.com/a/rcH33a9)
---
Yeah, but that’s still just 3 events then. Riding Shotgun is kind of just a boring escort quest event though the reward is pretty good and there’s always a guaranteed legendary.
---
How about the title that starts off with "Dear Americans"? Try rereading what you posted and then comeback.
---
I like challenges. I just hate battle royales. It's a garbage mode that got stale really fast.
---
There is loading screens in adventure mode.. dont be that guy.
---
Bethesda, please add an "I'm sorry" emote and then use it.
---
Agreed, Bethesda desperately needs to re-work the XP for time survived/Players killed so actual PvP will be encouraged. The weak Bush Wookies will lose their main source of XP gain and the weak shall perish. I’m getting buttflies just thinking about it!
---
I'm pretty sure that challenges counts for all of the global NW challenges as well, not just the daily ones so it's even easier to do.  It's literally free score when challenges are things like place your camp 3 times.
---
Okay? That's part of the game if it happens? Cool?
---
Just like my girlfriends
---
It's not just SCORE challenges.
---
When will 21 go live? I can't wait to clean up useless and duplicate perks?
---
Or if your character is just 200+, start a level 1 character and complete the challenge within 5 seconds.
---
The rest of the prices are pretty good in my opinion, just 50 caps for chems rad x and radaway seems very high to me. 
---
Yeah the ballistic bock and high voltage hefe are always a favourite. Rad ant larger I sell for 50 caps just because it uses 5 nuclear material.
---
My camp specializes in canned food and camping provisions!
---
Anyway, your camp looks nice and tidy. I like that it has a theme, too many camps I see are just a mess and look like a thousand other camps.
---
In the vault?
---
You can. Just find a good spot to get food and sell food. Here’s an idea.
---
Build a portable food stand style restaurant. Place a ton of signs for food and use the refrigerated box to store meat for later use. Use a punch bowl and use a vendor to sell food for cheap.
---
You just need to find a way to make a steady supply of food.
---
Non perishables are best and so are drinks, but you could also sell perishable food by writing text on a wall describing what food you might have in stock, and maybe a disclaimer that “some food may be out of stock”.
---
“Deathclaw omelette - $9”
---
You could even put a light next to the name of the item and instruct people to turn on the light, message you, or use their mic to make an order. The just turn it off when the order is done.
---
I can’t say that it’ll be easy. It’ll take work, and I dunno if people would care enough. Some people would appreciate the roleplaying, but others won’t.
---
I’ve built convenience stores and done well in this game for caps. It was fun as well.
---
I tried to build a small sort of playhouse/arcade style place as well but nobody cared for it. I just used a bunch of flashing lights, colorful wallpapers and loaded the place up with those interactive spaceship rides.
---
The plan was to have a huge assortment of intractable objects and then sell toys and costumes in the vendors.
---
It didn’t work and people thought it was pointless. *As if there is some point* to playing the game in a certain way anyway.
---
Take over a workshop, within minutes the event to defend it will pop up. Continue for as many times as you need.
---
I have to say it’s a damn good feeling. Took me a MONTH after hitting ally to land a bloodied ffr gauss minigun. And it does not disappoint.
---
Hey mate, I know this thread is a few days old, but;
---
This entire game, was made to milk the fans. Todd and Co. wanted in on the live-service gravy-train like their peers.
---
It also had a horrible time, all the controversy, things, etc. and has actually less players than FO4, according to steam charts.
---
I wish you'd all just stop playing tbh, to send them the message, as your money, as you highlight is all they'll listen to, care about.
---
me too, but I switch to something else if there is a dupe
---
Riding shotgun got pretty boring pretty quickly I agree with you there.
---
&gt; The problem with auto completion has been around for over a year 
---
That's surprising. Never happened to me with the old system even when I was logged in during reset. Was it related to nuclear winter or..?
---
Man I was just talking about why the train car was in the bundle and why people might ask I didn’t realize the OP was a total tool
---
Like the other person said it's hard to know where to start, when you start playing if you have any questions feel free to ask :)
---
The map areas are divided by level right now (this will change in the future to a scaling system)
---
The Forest (green area on map) and Toxic Valley (Great area up and to the right of the forest) are the low level areas, concentrate on those at first
---
There are crops you can plant at your camp to ensure a steady supply of food
---
If you find Corn, Mutfruit, Tatos, stuff like that, head to or deploy your camp and plant it
---
The following are more Quality of Life than actual game tips:

Turn "Depth of Field" setting all the way down in Display settings. (This makes it so far away things aren't all blurry, idk why full is the default)
---
Increase your Look Sensitivity if you need to, the default is ridiculously low.
---
PvP is enabled at level 5
---
Turn on Pacifist mode, this will prevent you from starting PvP if you accidentally hit someone.
---
server hop. 
---
I usually do 3 or 4 events then hop.
---
Get all the rested, intelligence and xp bonuses you can get, a grenade launcher and ammo and do line in the sand as much as possible so long as there's a bunch of high level players and a well placed tent. You can do about 5 levels in one event.
---
Summer calendar said August 4
---
and a misogynist too.. lovely
---
way to keep it classy yo
---
For me it was definitely more common before wastelanders.  I think they added new random encounters, which lowered the chance of a tamable creature appearing as the encounter.  All speculation though.
---
Alright lol, sorry for the misunderstanding
---
I think when they were working on Fallout 4, the original intent with the modification system was to have the Combat Rifle and Combat Shotgun be the same base gun, like how the Laser and Plasma guns work. But for technical reasons they decided to make them separate. Or they made one of the guns first and decided they could add reuse the assets to make a separate gun.
---
I don't really care, I just wish Combat Rifle skins were compatible with Combat Shotguns and vice versa, same for the Fixer.
---
There seem to be different causes. But it appeares to be tied in with NW somehow. Who knows how these bugs work.
---
You're all over the place.
---
Ah nice, but I just read that perks are coming in 22 not 21 lol.
---
"Push to talk"
---
F-35.
---
This. Why do people run away when I shoot at paper bags?
---
I just thought it was a polite interaction and saw it as it doesn't matter who initiates the GG. It's a hand from the winner recognising his opponent as a worthy fight or the loser showing no hard feelings for the loss.
---
AND misanthropic.
---
Yes, forgot that one. Thanks.
---
Take your time.  Explore everything.  Enjoy the world and setting.  No point in rushing to end game.  
---
Figure out what type of weapon you want to use and build your character accordingly.  A strength melee or shotgun build, a perception agility sniper rifle build, or something else.  If you mess up don't worry too much as you level above max you can shuffle points around.
---
Biggest tip -have fun!
---
Any of the NW challenges counts, not just S.C.O.R.E challenges.
---
Pc? Ign is catpants. Add me I'll food and ammo you. Maybe some nice jammies.
---
I always found that event to be ridiculously easy and a huge waste of time. If I wanted to grind mobs I would just go to West Tek. I’m talking about fun events with actual substance like Always Vigilant, Encrypted, Line in the Sand, etc. I do not want to waste my time killing radscorpions just to get a few bottles of purified water and say that it’s “better than doing nothing”.
---
That is a very clever idea to get around it. But wouldnt you like them to implement this into the game so you (and others) dont have to go out of your way?
---
but at least i share cards. Why don't you?
---
Totally raider stile 🤣
---
and a hypocrite too in that case..
---
Yeah. They are just grabbing some feed back for it. I can not wait either!
---
Yeah, the taming system is total jank, I'd part with some of my atoms to make my snallygaster immortal
---
Workshops need a lot of love in general.  They should revert the resources to what they were back in the day for one.  That would help.
---
Wow, aren't you an internet tough guy. As long as hiding and surviving gives more xp then actually hunting then you know people are going to take the easy way out.
---
I was just thinking this. It sounds like OP wanted to get to 50 with 1 build and swap to a bloody. I mean, why not build towards your final build and only buy perks that you need? I have 2 characters just over 100 with at least 30 points to spare(I would pick up things like super duper and other perks that I needed for my build). I would minimize point usage by only picking perks out every 5 levels until I got to 50. Getting the option for a full respec would take away half the point of leveling passed 50.
---
There were less embarrassing ways to let everyone know you're worthless.  Be gone troll.
---
Just trying to help you get the 10 events bud, good luck!
---
Yea if you're ingame during reset
---
For sure!  I totally get where you're coming from but just wanted to point out that this could've triggered them a bit if they didn't see it that way.  Not justifying their reaction by any means just trying to explain it.
---
Yeah, but we shouldn’t have to server hop for content. And even when I do, the servers are always empty in terms of events. On PS4 the event scene is absolutely barren on all servers. Line in the Sand is something you might see once a day if lucky..
---
Pretty much everything from unlocked settlement objects from fallout 4
---
Nah i'm pretty much on point here.
---
Oh, I thought you mean content. Thanks for the suggestion I’ll try it!
---
Obviously my 15 seconds was an exaggeration but to act like to do my stupid plant 27 vegetable plants challenge doesn't involve load screens or a laggy building interface that is just disingenuous.
---
Laggy vendor/stash/inventory interfaces are my least favorite part of this game hands down.  I HATE having to relist everything in my vendors..
---
You’re good just think you’re worked up about a douchy Canadian when I’m agreeing with you lol
---
Did reddit lie to me yesterday? Or were there 7 last week and now 8 this week and I got the number wrong?
---
Either way I'm worried about the same thing.  Played NW for the first time this morning and turns out I actually enjoy it lol.  I've never had an issue with challenges auto completing in the year I've been playing though.  Hoping I dont suddenly have these issues now when I log in later today.
---
Cheers bud, I’m just trying to tell you that you’re the one who has to make that call, and you’ve made it a few time already, so... asking on this form is pretty pointless.
---
They had guns since Europeans started trading with them. Though I'm sorry about your 4th great grandfather.
---
Then term native Indians or native American is a word to include all the tribes. Similar to say British for example, British can describe people from 3 countries and a province, including minority groups and so on. Only the ignorant would opt to say  native Indian/American to identify a individual they know the name off.
---
Maybe bump that SCORE EXP to 300, please...?
---
A gg regarding whoever sends it shouldn't trigger anyone really. I think the trigger was the fact that they believed because they didn't fight back I should of bowed out and let them contest my workshop. That mindset was the trigger.
---
Not really, I would be if I did NOT share cards, which is the whole point. Not who my relationship with humans other than that, not if I'm not classy cuz i implied you are a useless parasite (which you still have not disputed).
---
Yeah this is super annoying for me on ps4...
---
Bye.
---
And then the 'updated stash' error that doesn't even let you list because of the lag. Grr!
---
So essentially store your items in a vending machine like power armor on a chassis. I also hate moving camp because I dread having to setup the vending machines again.
---
😂
---
Oh boy I had autocompletion almost 15 times now... if you are playing NW at reset hour its sure to auto-complete. Only happen to me once, already in the score system, when I was not playing NW and they've autocompleted because I was on adventure while the reset happens, then 2 minutos later they decompleted... (wierd). Best way to ensure they dont auto complete is to be out of the game completly during reset hour, give it 2 mins before and 2 mins after.
---
No, they want integrated perk loadouts and not have to rely on mods.
---
Yep exactly!
---
In theory yes.
---
But if its not in the list you can't choose it. I know because I checked, this isn't my first Bethesda rodeo. (see the edits)
---
 Guess who spended 1k script yesteday? 🤦‍♂️
---
Well if you don't want to server hop that's on you but i do like 7-8 events an hour easily.
---
It wasn't in the pick list. Edited no note that fact.
---
Good point TXJeepers,. Yesterday I was on a public team and there were 2 3 stars at westtec and not one of them came.
---
by keeping the same pace you will not hit rank 100 in that time as each rank needs more XP, so expect that your progress will slow down gradually
---
I see what your saying, but I have a huge camp, and am maxed out on budget. Wallpaper costs nothing to place, so I dont think it actually affects the budget, but I could be wrong. I still believe they need to increase the budget, and not just keep saying they are going to do so. DO IT!
---
Bethesda has a habit of focusing on fixing things the players benefit from.
---
Look to a few month ago, player vending was causing the loss of items, and they did not disable the system which we know they could have done.  However within 48hours of a dupe method being made public that utilised the very glitch causing the lost items, Bethesda was right on the ball and disabled player vending and display cases.
---
Regardless of their reasoning as the player it paints a picture of priorities.  They did the same with Feed The People, Athena and likely many others.
---
Weak might be a strong word xD I've seen wookies slaughter a whole team no issue hahah.
---
Hopefully Bethesda changes this next patch. Strangers on public teams should not be allowed to change anything in camps.  If they can open keypads. Then i wonder if its possible they could unlock locked door or go through my camp and scrap everything forcing me to completely rebuild.
---
Power armor users can shoot a Tesla underwAter so we usually look for one of those in player loot as a just in case if the circle goes that way to actually be on the lake but that’s super rare.
---
I think I'm gonna go buy me an egghead &amp; herbivore serum, hadn't considered strange in numbers buffing the impact of herbivore.
---
Would love half walls and ceilings as well.
---
There is a lot of lag. Sometimes I complete events with time on the clock, but I get the notification that the event failed.
---
No one is a dick for afking. It’s just the way they want to play that match.
---
Why just events?! Remove dailys and make me earn score for everything... kill 50 enemies 10 score, complete one event (50 score), build 10 items (10 score), eat 20 food (10 score), complete Scorged earth (100 score) and all of these should be repeatable... why add time gates? So I stop playing after all chalanges are done?
---
Agreed, if players are loosing things they are slow to act, the moment players start to gain things they react quicker then the tax man when owed money.
---
Maybe they don't have enough charisma?
---
surprised they havent done it yet, pets seem like a huge money maker
---
Nah, they appear in the Atom shop from time to time. The lights you're referring to are blue. :)
---
I always thought the one on the pole was bugged, it works just by pulling the switch without ever having to enter a password, I keep my vendor and shutter door switches locked in my generator shed for that reason
---
Yea i have seen this "don't be online at reset" but it is not guaranteed to help. There was a post earlier today (or yesterday) where people shared their experiences with the bug and plenty of people claimed they have had the bug even when not playing at the time of reset.
---
Still useless to me, taking a spot that could be filled with someone who can add more
---
7 this week aswell, [link](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/daily.html).
---
I could maybe get into NW if I gave it time, it took forever to load in though. And I would have ALOT to learn. I have no idea how the S.P.EC.I.A.L and perks work, but I have 130+ perk cards to open.
---
You say that like it’s an intended feature. My point is, even when I do server hop there are no events except for early game ones. I’m not concerned about hitting my weekly because I know I will, but I want a reason to play the game besides doing those weeklies, because right now I have absolutely nothing to do besides those.
---
Thats just annoying.
---
I am kind of new, what were they like before?
---
I guess we'll get a lot when interior CAMPs. (Winter Season patch in theory)
---
Oh they could fix it and likely have the fix nearly ready, they're waiting to see how the players react when hit by the bug over a few week, and how much they spend on Atom to skip the missed out levels on the legendary run.
---
Now if the players revolt and kick off BIG STYLE, then they will announce to be "working on a fix" wait about two week to ensure optimum sales, then fix it.
---
Of course the update relative to the timing of season two will all so neatly break it again.
---
Stealth throwing knives is one of the best ways to push into higher level areas as a low level, at least in my experience. Scrap enemy weapons for steel and mods, convert it all into pointy pointy knives! Fun way to level up.
---
I'm quickly learning that. Thanks!
---
I've seen players do this recently, and it's very kind! 
---
I also use the follow me emote if I'm starting a popular event like Encryptid or Radiation Rumble. Not many people join/notice though
---
Yeah, I'm pretty sure Action Boy still works for me. I guess I'm lucky.
---
Right?! Would be great to see🤞🏼
---
Thanks! Still learning all of the intricacies.
---
Fast travel to the statue place right beneath whitesprings,if u spawn in u see a parkinglot,turn left and head up towards whitesprings again and there is a large flat green area with a pond
---
I can make my own team and join with my other 3 accounts. I don't need you, you need me.
---
Soo using a keyboard auto clicker and making yourself jump in 1 spot and automatically while being on fill isn’t being a dick? Lol the only part of that I don’t like is the fill part, u can easily hot no fill and the AFKing doesn’t affect anyone else
---
I'll take it if they give atoms again. XDDDD
---
This really needs more attention, it's the singular reason why they did not fix the damn bug before Seasons rolled out.
---
I only use that word because, in my experience, they never get a chance to shoot back because I’m always gunning them down with my handmade after furiously scanning/panning the terrain with my crosshairs looking for red highlights. 2/10 of them only attack when they know they’ve been found and you’re standing next to them. Most others are either really Old IRL and have no reaction ability at all whatsoever or their just really bad at shooters and that’s why their sitting in a bush in the first place. These people typically just accept their fate and re-queue so I can kill them again.
---
So you ruin 3 peoples match to get a better match for you, seems like toxic behaviour.
---
Noooooo! That sucks...
---
If it was the last challenge for the gold star challenge both count towards the NW weekly challenge.
---
Log out from adventure mode, log in to adventure mode. Forget NW challenges until dailies/weeklies are done. And the most important, PRAY. That's how it works for me.
---
Put your vendors in a little building of their own, then when you move the items are retained in the machines. If you 'store' your machines, you erase all the contents inside them. But, if you just move them as part of a blueprint that you can put back down, all of those items remain listed.
---
Ill be shocked if they ever fix it because plenty of people who lose score points are just going to buy atoms to catch back up.
---
yeah I started with just marsupial, but then I found others that I like. Now I am running 10.
---
Egg Head, Eagle Eyes, Bird Bones, Marsupial, Healing Factor, Speed Demon, Scaly Skin, Grounded, Herd Mentality, and Carnivore.
---
I think saying it ruined anything is a lottle extreme. Its a game bud. Toxic? Again huge reach there. Bethesda shouldn't reward hiding over kills.
---
Or a nice spiral staircase. Would love one of those.
---
This is for the repeatable 10k xp per 100 score. A level 1 will not get anywhere near that on their own. But yea if you need just 1 lvl, a new guy would do it leaving the vault.
---
The currency limits in this game work as well as a stud in a lesbian porno movie. 
---
Created to simply piss off the player, with all the care and grace for gameplay as a ballerina with a case of the deathshits on a stage.
---
I've killed it four times in the Grove.  Twice solo, once with one other random player who was being overwhelmed when I stumbled on them and once when two other players came in the grove while I was fighting it.  Actually, it is just a bullet sink with very mediocre loot.  Recently was fighting the SBQ  from the V9 when she happened to fly back over the Grove and stayed there hovering.  After 2-3 minutes myself and a couple of other players headed into the Blast Zone after her since we had already mutated her and brought her down to about 50% health.  She was hovering over the Grove firing sonic blasts into it.  When I saw the Wendigo spawn I realized she was fighting the Colossus.  Luckily when we fired on her from outside the Grove she turned her attention on us and we were able to kill her without going in the Grove to face the Colossus which, I will not knowingly do anymore due to the lack of suitable rewards.
---
worth a mention thanks!
---
I’m currently downloading it myself. If no one else does do in the interim I will once it’s done.
---
I did make a comment about ya know how Canadians also had a massive genocide still going on and have a huge drug problem lol
---
I honestly wouldn't be surprised if it was a *feature* for that specific reason
---
Its true, happened to me too once, but was at the Challenges era, infact it was in the last batch. Still, I try to log off just in case now.
---
I've got around 100 parade masks in my storage.......anything in my camp is a buzz kill.
---
On PS4 server hopping takes longer than FT to a new location, also I find diminished returns on kills, as well as first time server loads on an area almost always spawn low level enemies..very sad.
---
Brain Bombs give +3 INT (+6 with Herbivore) for 90 Minutes and is easier to farm than Broiled Scorchbeast Brains, which only lasts 30 Minutes.
---
The problem of course is that a lot of people only play NW when they game tempts them there for some standard server reward.  If you suck at or just don't like pvp, why would you ever try to do anything when odds are you will survive much longer hiding?    
---
I tried to do my best when I did play NW, but I suck at pvp, and it didn't help a ton.  I also am perked for sniper, so I tended to be the last one to die and ended up hiding till the end anwyay.  :P
---
Runnnnnn! 🌳 👀 🌳
---
Well your game must be broken then. I just hopped and i have 2 in the bog and 1 in the mire to choose from.
---
With herbivore and strange in numbers, soup gives +5. I haven't seen SB brains give more than that yet.
---
Oh my bad. As a level 153, this guide is pretty helpful while I do my runs through West Tek so thank you!
---
The easiest way for me to find locations on the map is to press RB (on Xbox) while looking at that quest in the pipboy to “show on map”, it will open the map with that marker in the middle, instead of having to find it by looking all over the map. If you’re close to the marker location, it’ll either be a diamond or a square on the compass on the screen and you can see how far away it is if it’s within 100m. If it’s just a general area, it’ll be a circle, and once you’re in the radius of that circle the compass will blink yellow. It definitely took some getting used to for me, so I totally understand! But good luck!
---
Yes youre ruining their match up, and it is toxic behaviour in any other game since youre screwing your team for your own benefits. So what its a video game? They are real people using their spare time to have fun and youre making it worse for your own gains. Toxic as fuck.
---
If that's true, then I'm out of clues. Something **must** trigger that to happen, and it never happened to me, yet. I can take everyone's downvotes, that's fine, but I've posted similar advice before, and no-one contradicted me, so I was confident I was right. :-/ 
---
My bad, I stand corrected.
---
Yesterday I was picking up Iron Ore in the Ashe Heap and there is this level 24 running around in an empty set of power armor fighting off some mole miners.   He seemed overwhelmed so shot them for him, picked up all the guns and ammo and dropped them for him to pick up.   After a few minutes I noticed he was following me so to help him out I dropped him a level 25 1\* FFR SMG and some ammo, he gave me the heart emoji and I fast traveled to Grafton Dam to do the manhunt event.  That's when I noticed he followed me there, it was kind of like finding a lost puppy and he to follows you home  lol  
---
Your story gives me hope that maybe I will get that Unyielding SS chest piece with ammo carry weight I have been rolling for!
---
I used to be cursed with this as well. Had to ghost him for two weeks, didn't enter the wayward, didn't engage him in conversation. Then, on a Wednesday, gave him a try and he had gold for me.
---
If you're on xbox, add me and I can get you a jump start on some plans, food, etc. I'm  Newsman77. I'm on after 6pm est.
---
 Broiled Scorchbeast brain +7.5 INT with all the perks about mutations
---
Blame beth for luring people to NW with daily challenges and events that require hundreds of matches to complete.  Campers don't want to be there any more than you want them there.
---
Also make sure you toggle the quest you want to be focused on as on in the pipboy, it’ll have a square next to it if you select it as active, otherwise instead of being a glowing yellow marker in the map, it’ll be a black square.
---
Thanks I’ll try this. I’m in the ps4 but I’m sure there’s a button.
---
The level of the enemies being lower just means a low level was the only player in the area when those enemies were generated.  There are no diminishing returns on kills.  I'm over halfway done with the board so I am well acquainted with the grind.  Sucks about the console loads.
---
Funfact they also profit from any Anti Armor buff on your main gun.
---
Totally understand.  There is a reason it took me a year to try and even then only because of the damn score system.  Did not expect to like it at all so was somewhat surprised.  Definitely won't be going all in on it though at all.

---
Depends what kinda camp you want
---
log cabin bundle has log cabin and water wheel (which now provides power) and the other has an animated donut sign and that funk vendor.
---
It's tough. Depends on your aesthetic
---
It doesn't for me. I need to lvl up from 2 to 3 in order to do the challenge.
---
Lol I couldn't, it was either run into the fire or die, at that point, I was dead anyway so just died got 6th lol
---
Its not just from the reset.  I was at 4/7 and 4/8 yesterday (loss of 4.5k score), and I didn't get on until 6pm eastern.  The ones that were greyed out were ones I had completed for challenges last week.  This is an old bug that use to happen to Challenges for ATOMS as well.
---
Normal NW Chalanges and level ups also count since each level up is a cjallange
---
I'm pretty sure they would do just fine without me. I think you need to take a deep breath and rework your priorities. Its not like they are storming the beaches of Normandy and im hiding on the boat.
---
Ok, thanks, in that case the OP's statement does make sense: double score challenges bugging out, we can't have that.
---
I'm glad they haven't fixed it, I've been using it to dupe repair kits...
---
;)
---
So basically like the world tree in elder scrolls online?
---
Bethesda doesn’t care about fast travel
---
The movie analogy doesn’t work anymore, so you just bring a new one to the table? Ok then, let’s go to the restaurant. 
---
I paid full price for my meal, but now they charge me extra to use their cutlery.
---
Got any more analogies for me to dissect?
---
Oh and I get that it costs them to host servers. But I didn’t force them to claim it will be „playable forever“. If they can only keep their promises through scummy cash grab maneuvers, it’s their own damn fault to promise such things.
---
I could’ve just run this bitch as a singleplayer game, maybe put some locally hosted co-op in there, but Bethesda just had to have their fucking MMO and now I‘m supposed to feed it for the server costs every single month or they kill it? Yeah, miss me with that shit.
---
No, that’s the level up challenge. We are referring to the repeatable challenge where you gain 10,000 xp to receive 100 score. You can do this as many times as you’d like.
---
I should really stay up to date with roadmaps and ITVs from now on, I guess. Sorry.
---
R1
---
Thank you. Ahh that sucks, would of been great to have a scorchbeast at your camp.
---
No, people don't want it done NOW, they want it to be attainable without having to resort to being forced to play every day or purchase levels just to keep up. Daily challenges are easy, sure, but it's also a shit system. 
---
Would rather have a free-form way of obtaining SCORE (the 100 SCORE for 10,000 EXP is an insult) so that people who want to grind and get the reward early, they can while the people who have a schedule that limits their playtime and miss out on dailies. 
---
RDR2 has done its season passes right. I'm sure a ton of other games did theirs right as well.
---
Its absolutely crazy I have to right down when I sell stuff so I know when the timer reset.  This needs to be somewhere in the pipboy.  You are running around with a computer on your arm why is it not tracking this
---
CAMPs can be placed anywhere on the map that isn't near key locations.
---
u do realize if they did this then certain mobs would be unkillable as everyone would server hope for them. How is your idea any better than the 10k? Its not even hard to get 10k xp, u can get it 20 times plus easy playing for like 4 hours
---
They definitely get done quicker over here, but ESO really shines for story quests. Once you're done here you're just kinda done, with no ending.
---
This post just made me suddenly remember the dream I had last night that was basically an orangey metal version of the contemporary porches and how I was freaking out and putting in wood walls to make a scrapper home
---
Rate was much higher, and the type of scrap you got was the already usable kind for everything instead of the kind you have to craft into usable material.  
---
They went from being fairly popular to almost completely unused in a single patch heh.
---
Lol. Yup. Unlimited junk storage and the tent are so worth it IMO.
---
Slocum joes also has a train car prefab. Yet again it depends on aesthetic.
---
How much power does the water wheel provide?
---
It’s only happened to me once. And it happened to me when I wasn’t even on the game until after reset. 
---
I’ve actually been on the game during reset and had no issue with challenges resetting. I’ve read all kinds of different experiences with this bug over the past week. 
---
It just seems to be one of those bugs that’s going to be a pain in the ass to 100% protect yourself from. I’m not worried about it affecting my progress though.  I’m already at rank 30 as of last night so I feel like I’m keeping a decent pace even with missing two days of playing.
---
 Did they fix adrenaline
---
👍🏼I swear I didn’t see an indication that this was possible but at that point I did have a few 🍸
---
Probably not.
---
I mean, you're all standing on the roof of the bunker so I'm sure she's fine.
---
Events appear on the map as yellow hexagons. Clicking on them gives you the option to join which will teleport you to the event. This is an easy way to get fast travel locations. Keep an eye open for the event "Leader of the Pack" which is about killing 3 legendary wolves, easy way to get low level legendaries
---
I dunno, it wasn’t as bad as I thought but having to pay a monthly fee to have fun left a bad taste in my mouth. Fuck these people
---
If you wanted to be on par to reach 100 you need to have been level 20 before the start of yesterday and lvl 33 by the start of next Tuesday
---
Or y'know, a fucking text chat.
---
You’re truly right mate. We have indeed become milk cows at this point.. All of the priority updates are mostly sales related. After 2 years even the bugged out gamecard hasn’t been changed. 
---
Bugs in quests just stay. It’s pathetic. 
---
Most likely I’ll call it quits this month.
---
And presumably both if them are helping with that TV show. Must be. How else can I account for all my game crashes yesterday?
---
The game already blueprints 99% everything when you move your camp including the vendors/display with everything saved inside, if the vendors/display are on the ground than each one will have it's own blueprint.
---
You and I both I’m guessing 😭
---
That would make sense, but no I had full AP. As I tried to activate VATS I watched as the AP meter emptied, it started at full.
---
I’m assuming its a furious with faster fire rate gatling gun.  But the scorched slayer part is throwing me off because the zealots and furious effect can’t be on the same gun as far as im aware. You sure you didn’t miss read the effects? Or accidentally put it in your box thinking it was something else?
---
Sure can! We're actively working on an "I'm Sorry" emote and it's going to be one of our free items once it's available.
---
You gotta bring down those radaways bro. I sell mine for 3 each
---
But usually if I move my camp, I can't re-place it because the foundations won't sit. So I end up having to scrap it and restarting :(
---
I mean I’m going to make a village camp
---
Nice! Don't take it off just in case.
---
No they don't care if you kill 10 mole miners or not. The ideal play session from Bethesda's point of view is log in, buy atoms, log out
---

 Which is nice. There's a normal version and a version in the generators section.

Beckwith Farm is a bit far but lots of flat land! There’s also a large pond area to the right, just above the cabin area that I forget the name of and above radiation rumble.

Legendary Perk Updates in this PTS
---
With our latest round of updates for Legendary Perks, we’re adding 15 new Perk Cards, removing a few that didn’t receive positive feedback, and making an adjustment to Perk Card scrapping:
---
**Perk Card Scrapping**
---
* In the last PTS, some players felt forced into scrapping their golden Perk Cards because they offered more Perk Coins than other cards. We don’t want you to have to scrap your collection of golden cards, and so they will now award the same amount of Perk Coins as normal Perk Cards when scrapped. 
---
**New Legendary Perks**
---
We’re planning to add 15 new Legendary Perk Cards to the game. Here are a few that we wanted to highlight, but be sure to head into the PTS to try out the rest.
---
* **Legendary S.P.E.C.I.A.L. Perks:** We’ve added a new Legendary Perk Card for each S.P.E.C.I.A.L. attribute that will increase your stat in the chosen category, allowing you to equip additional normal Perk Cards. These cards can be upgraded to increase the stat bonuses they offer. While each attribute still caps at 15 points, these new perks can help you round out your character build.
---
* **Master Infiltrator:** A frequent request from the community, this Legendary Perk Card will allow you to automatically pick locks and hack terminals. It can be upgraded to auto-unlock higher-level locks and terminals.
---
* **Ammo Factory:** When equipped, you will produce bonus rounds when crafting ammunition. The bonus amount increases as you upgrade Ammo Factory, and it stacks with other Perk Cards, like Ammosmith and Super Duper.
---
**Legendary Perk Removals**
---
* Following community feedback from the last PTS, we are removing Botany Buddy, Thin Skinned, Suited Up, and Heavy Duty from the Legendary Perk Card lineup.
---
Last time Legendary Perks were available, we implemented design changes that allowed players to pay 1 Perk Coin to swap a Legendary Perk selection without needing to wait until they unlocked a new Legendary Perk Slot. We also added the ability to save Legendary Perk selections even if the player hadn’t filled all available Slots. These changes are still available in addition to everything mentioned above.   
---
### Legendary Perks System Refresher
---
If you weren’t familiar with Legendary Perks from the last PTS, or just want a refresher, here are some details on how this system works:
---
* Legendary Perks are new high-level Perk Cards you can access via the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. Menu, and you can equip them to add even more power to your character builds.
---
* You will be able to unlock your first Legendary Perk slot at level 50, and new ones at certain level milestones after that: 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, and 300.
---
   * Your characters who are already high-level will immediately have access to one Legendary Perk Slot for each of the above leveling milestones they've reached.
---
      * For example, a level 250 character will have access to 5 Legendary Perk slots, with the ability to open a sixth slot at level 300.
---
* Each Legendary Perk has 4 Ranks, and you can use new “Perk Coins” to rank them up.
---
   * Earn Perk Coins by scrapping your unused normal Perk Cards.
---
* Legendary Perk slots are account-wide, so create new characters, assign Perks to those available slots, and share your feedback on how the early game now feels for experienced players experimenting with new alts.
---
I was so sure it was next week so I did the same :(
---
Yes please u/valseek PLEASE honestly so much PLEASE. 
---
The lack of customisation options on the Chinese Stealth Suit is heartbreaking for how much I love using it.
---
Fair. From my experience though people just want the rewards and once they got them they never play again. Though no idea how you can tell their age xD
---
Either way  though I feel just something simple like say giving you 100xp per kill would do wonders in stopping the issue. Or even better, add a solo mode rather than queueing solo into a teamed match.
---
Yes, the option resets.  It should default to off.
---
Good to know - I'll try that next time
---
Why not more camp structures **in the fucking game to earn**?
---
He means a camp, but made as if it's a small community
---
Ah, ok.
---
In that case the issue is way worse than I thought (because we as users can't work around it), and we need some kind of action, or at least some acknowledgement from the devs or CMs that they are taking this serious.
---
Settle down son, it's a game. Fuckin weirdo
---
I wont, if I join into a team to AFK that means 3 people less to kill me, also means one less people to kill you, also means I might actually win. Change my mind.
---
cranberry cobbler is worth mentioning. while it's 5% vs relish's 10%, it only takes one cranberry and one wood to make.
---
also, canned meat stew. you get these from the Feed the People event. they give +5% xp for an hour and don't expire. you get 5 from each run. affected by carnivore.
---
the well rested bonus gives you +5% xp for an hour. just sleep in a real bed.
---
the event "Path to Enlightenment" gives you +5% xp for an hour at the end.
---
lunchboxes are obtainable on the seasons ladder and give you and those around you +25% XP for an hour.
---
leader bobblehead gives you +5% xp for an hour.
---
They already did it's just cashgrab garbage.
---
Given the wording that appears on screen when you approach a workshop, and the updates to my challenge list, capture = take an un-owned workshop.  IIRC, is shows as “Quest: tke/capture xxx workshop“
---
Although I have not done so, I would assume take a currently owned workshop also counts.
---
When the Defend (or retake from NPCs) appears on screen, it is listed as “Event : Defend (or retake) xxx workshop”.
---
Sometimes yes. When you first join a world, your level is stated as lvl 1, until the game updates. Unfortunately, the server will use lvl 1 to calculate enemies on your FIRST load only. Its a bug i think.
---
Probably think they are about to get destroyed by a high level in pvp.
---
Not going to lie, I've chased players around too many times to give them freebies.
---
Best way to fix being over the weight limit is to drop some goodies for a new player. Just sucks if you are encumbered and they keep running. Lol
---
Good idea, but may have to be more than 500 atoms. AFAIK Atoms can still be earnt in game with the challenges, by creating a new character.
---
I would part with atoms for that though. Would even maybe part with real money every so often, just not a monthly subscription like FO1st. 
---
How they would implement it though, I'm not sure.
---
You're thinking about this all wrong. There's more benefit in having all four slots filled, so what if someone isn't, can't, or has forgotten to share a card, you and the people on your team are still getting that 25% XP(or whatever boost) for them being on your team.
---
People are constantly leaving and rejoining teams, you'll be lucky if you get a full team of four. Best to take what you can get in this respect.
---
Alt+F4
---
True.
---
No idea why the armour bonus perks are going, literally the best ones?
---
Log Cabin if you are going for function. The Slocum Joe if you are going for pure asthetics.
---
Awesome! This may change some things. Seems better! But farming is still more difficult so I'll stick with my herbivore since scorchbeasts aren't as abundant as brain fungus for long xp run stretches.
---
The movie analogy works fine, you just don't get it.
---
If you went to the same movie 100x yes you'd have to pay 100x.  If you didn't wanna go, you wouldn't pay.
---
You've also been sitting at the same restaurant table for going on two years, nobody's that American.
---
So either pay or don't.  Either way you can whine, and either way I won't care.
---
Yes we NEED pets
---
I know! Unless its just me. But I havent been able to get it working for the last week.
---
Me too, why has Bethesda became so tame with this franchise ever since Fo4?
---
I wanted a Vampire’s FFR Fr, but got B FFR 50 DWA.  Wish I could trade it.
---
If it doesn't apply to modules..then w/e.
---
Sophia stopped giving me dailies after patch 20.
---
what do you mean, "they didn't reset?"
---
Brain bombs...I learned this existed today. This actually keeps herbivore in the #1 spot. Must add and a mention for you good sir! Will dig info/ingredients and put my farm locations in shortly.
---
Log lady is a NW Bush wookie after dark.
---
We are going to get a pet system soon. The Ally system was the pre-cursor. I'm sure it would us the same code.
---
&gt;The problem of course is that a lot of people only play NW when they game tempts them there for some standard server reward.
---
After I hit rank 100, this certainly became true. Limited-time events are usually the only reason why I still play NW.
---
&gt;If you suck at or just don't like pvp, why would you ever try to do anything when odds are you will survive much longer hiding?
---
There really isn’t a lot I can say if you’re not that skilled at PvP...try harder? Git gud? Not very helpful advice but if you are young enough and possess any kind of ability to adapt and learn, it feel like maybe potentially becoming a decent player over time and dedication might be a possibility—and that goes for anything in general, not just an FPS video game. You don’t have to become Jesus at the game or anything, but learning how to take a shot, react, and identify a target to shoot back at without frantically panicking and shitting the bed would be a great start for many players in NW. I feel like I’m always playing against disabled people.
---
Ok I see where your coming from with the make up events that would be a cool feature. But I easy finish all the daily's in less than an hr and all the weekly in less than 2 (excluding nw stuff I avoid like the plague. I've never played the games your talking about so I cant argue to much but it's seems like it's to easy to be fun for me.
---
Did you shout "Praise be to Todd" 3 times out your front door?
---
Better do it my friend, they reset soon :-)
---
If you want my personal opinion I'd say Slocum's Joe. However, if you want a more general opinion I'd go with what everyone else is saying which is it depends on the kind of camp you want.
---
Why do people call it ATX when there is no x in atom shop
---
this would explain why my weekly NW challenge completed yesterday after one match.
---
Happened to me yesterday while I was completly off the system for the entire day 
---
Got on today to see I'm now out like 4 levels worth of score 
---
I don't get to play very often. That kind of hit hurts really bad
---
How will you win if your AFK in the first place lol
---
I just want some sort of subscription for the scrapbox, that's all I want.
---
Aye. I bought fallout 1st while i am furloughed. Once i go back i'll cancel it. Plan is to just fill it with as much junk as possible and so far i've probably added enough junk to last me a year. 
---
If it was say £4.99 a month JUST for the scrapbox i would pay that gladly. I am sure many others would.
---
I saw those! I was hoping to see the other 13 new cards they mentioned they’re adding
---
Still toxic mate, you can rationalize the way you want, screwing people for your own benefits is toxic behaviour.
---
Did you forget to buy your daily copy of Skyrim yesterday?
---
If you get the gold star complete 5 challenges weekly as you play NW it counts towards it for some reason
---
My playstation wasn't even on at all yesterday 
---
Got on today, went strait to adventure, and nearly every single challenge is already completed 
---
It's for sure worse than you thought
---
It's not that bad. I never touched it before the Legendary Run. I don't mind dipping in for a little bit each day for those sweet SCORE points.
---
We’re you on before or during reset yesterday? I don’t play until 11:15-11:30 and I haven’t lost any daily’s or weeklies so far.
---
Edit I’m in Midwest time zone
---
Would love an almost totally destroyed business suit, actually. That would put me into raider roleplaying territory, it's so loaded with social commentary built in.
---
imagine going through the process to launch and someone’s dinky little missile turret shoots down all your work
---
All the clean, gaudy stuff seems to be an attempt to appeal to a Fortnite demographic, along with the now largely unsupported Nuclear Winter. In short, I don’t think long-time Fallout fans will ever be the target audience here. Sure, we’ll get thrown a bone every now and then, but we’re not a priority.
---
THAT made me snort out loud.  Thank you.
---
Thank you so so much!!! I can’t wait for the community to have it. Love you guys
---
I know, I was answering about the lvl up challenge and that the lvl 1 to 2 method doesn't work. 
---
Line in the sand shooting every single mob (tesla or zero ap weapon recommended). 200 score. Loop. I've been server hopping just to do this.
---
Damn... that sucks man.
---
Well I don't cheat and I never will cheat. It takes the fun right out of the game for me. If I fall short of the level 100 season I will definitely buy my way to the end but I play every day so I don't think I will fall short.
---
 Doesn't bother me one bit that other people cheat, if that's fun for them then so be it.
---
&gt;No company uses money that it earns from other products to keep a product afloat
---
Well, Take-Two certainly doesn't spend the billions it makes on Grand Theft Auto V developing Grand Theft Auto V...
---
They briefly had these monstrosities at the train stations that were verging on that.. but I suppose you’re referring to something like we have in red dead where you can try stuff on
---
The Sugar Bombs are the most difficult thing to get (can only be the dirty box, not the clean one), but if you use [Mappalachia](https://m.imgur.com/a/4Js8sCY), you can find them and the other ingredients pretty easily.
---
Does it apply to modules? If not I've been saving for a week for no good reason 🤦‍♂️
---
Ha! I bet you sit in a bush without even bothering to loot a basic weapon to ambush passer-bys with, you fucking no-skill loser. Go play Animal Crossing or some shit dumb ass.
---
I agree with the brain fungus, easier. Just surprised by how much INT a bat brain gives XDDDD
---
I second this^ especially the plane stuff theres tonnes of crashed planes/biplanes everywhere on the map its unbelievable that people wouldn’t use the wreckages for structures (like how you can find at the airports)
---
I just want my camp back I moved it and can't place down my camp anywhere
---
I would definetly pay like $5 per month for having the scrapbox only. No Private Servers no free Atoms no whatever Else they give you with first subscription needed. Just. That. GODDAMN. Scrapbox.
---
Maybe they should have made it the final reward for completing the legendary race. Would definitely get Lots of peoples money out of their pockets, so exactly what they want.
---
But $15 per month is too much for me. Not that i couldnt afford it but i just dont want to. It Breaks the magic $9.99/month/game rule thats present in my head.
---
ATX is the internal tag affixed to objects that will be in the atom shop.
---
Remove NW Score challenges, and the problem is solved.
---
All that means is it doesn't count as an animal under the Animal Friend perk card. Which tells me it could count as a creature under the Wasteland Whisperer perk card.
---
That’s exactly why I made this post lol
---
If you cannot play every day then that's fine. Just means you don't get as much score as others who can play more. Which is the way it is designed. Most battle/season pass type things (if not all) are like this. You get what you earn. 
---
 ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
They don't look like they're dancing. It looks like generic animation you'd see if they were conversing. Raising an arm 5 degrees is not any kind of dance I've ever seen. This doesn't even look like they're doing The Robot.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
I just checked, I never picked that one so I must have just gotten it in a card pack and put that one on instead of the one I meant to equip. Very strange that you can "hack" the vendors. It *completely* prevented me from interacting with then normally. I tried from different distances, angles, etc.
---
Lesson learned -- if you wanna trade, you better not be capable of hacking because apparently hacking supersedes the more fundamental aspect of trade in this game lol
---
Edit: it's still very weird &amp; buggy though because the hack prompt wasn't visible. It still said trade but any time I hit that, it internally read it as hack since they are the same button.
---
I wish we'd get some in game camp unlocks outside of the limited ones in events instead of everything being on the atom store.
---
Wait what's that? What doe sit give?
---
I still have nightmares about the bright pink camp with unicorns all over it. You could see it for miles in any direction!
---
I got it with my BETA character as well, I just had to make a new one for the Leaving-the-Vault trophy. It might get bugged out, but my BETA character on PS4 was fine when I hit 100. Good luck!
---
I tried to hop on NW for the first time last night to get the SCORE reward.  It put me on a team automatically.  I tried to find a way to enter solo and was not sure where to toggle this option.
---
Stuck it out till my demise tho, even got a kill... Sorry to REG1 for the level 0 player on your team.
---
I don’t have this problem on pc, but I use wasd.  I’m guessing it’s somehow tied to the controller.
---
You missed one? It happens.
---
Build small buildings , 1 or 2 foundations , multiple separate buildings if necessary.  When moving I set up a vender storage shack just for the move if they are not already separated
---
Yea like read dead or other games. My post is in reference to the lumberjack outfit. Looked cool in the store, bought it and put it on. I looked more like a failed hipster in skinny jeans 😅😭
---
me, today
---
From what I've gathered from many posts regarding the dailies/weeklies is that players seem to have forgotten that these are classified as "Challenges."  These are not intended to be "gimme's."  A good example is the Level Up challenge: a Lvl 5 player can level up much quicker than a Lvl 385 player, but the Lvl 385 can take out a Legendary creature much easier than a Lvl 5 can.  Not everything is intended to be quick and easy across the board.
---
If all you are doing is logging on to do the dailies/weeklies, then start a deep-dive into the game during the downtime.  Mod your camp.  Specialize your vending machines.  Seek out hard to find items/outfits.  Heck, just wander around and get lost in the lore and story scattered around that the devs put so much time and effort in. There is always plenty to do if you really look for it.
---
Yeah it’s just for controller on pc, I’ve tried looking for a fix absolutely everywhere but I can’t find one :(
---
I’m hoping someone knows a fix on here, my last resort
---
4% upvoted, lol. This may be the most downvoted thread I've ever seen on here.
---
Keep trying, I have rolled about 15 times trying for a Bloodied 3\* and have gotten a 3\* Vampire I use for the SBQ and a 3\* Troubleshooters for the Encrypted event.  I also have the Gauss Shotgun and with five rolls in concession I got two Bloodied 3\*, I kept one and turned in the other for more script.
---
YES! Finally someone else feels the same way I do about that outfit!
---
Possibly third party software that adjusts the sensitivity of your controller?
---
Atom shop item.  Sitting at it gives you a 2 hour well rested buff (5% xp +)
---
canned meat is mentioned but is low. while cobbler is 5% and easy to make, the relish is easy enough to warrant not mention for my post.
---
path to enlightment is not productive for time invested/xp boost gained, but I'll add it because it is public, and therefore treasure notes given. Also you can cheese join at end to leech the event making it worth it at that point.
---
Lunch boxes I have already. Same for mentions to bobble heads.
---
I think you can do this using a lot of the unmarked buildings and other structures scattered around the map.  Like the treehouses in the mire, camp grounds in the savage divide, and dilapidated houses in the forest.  I even found a cave in the far north west that i would have built in if it hadn't been full of picnic tables and skeletons.  Very apocalypse shic.
---
Good attention, bad attention, its all the same
---
Never said it made sense, it could very well be unintended, but I use them for dailies and when I did the cryptid life time challenge
---
Well I only have issues in 3rd person while crouching so I have no idea, as soon as I stand up my aiming sensitivity is normal again
---
Welcome back! Yep, there is a new boss called “Wendigo Colossus“ who has a 10% chance to randomly show up after a nuke drops. However, in about 4 weeks it will have its very own event called  “ A colossal problem “. 👍👍
---
,
---
How do you like the jetpack for the SS armor (non-PA)?  I'm hesitant to buy it...
---
Faster fire rate has the DPS edge at the end of the day. Plus the SBQ (and all SBs for that matter) has high explosive resistance, so if it's going to be your Queen killer I recommend not using explosive weapons when you have another option.
---
Dreadful right 😅 can't bear to wear it
---
I have it already, but I'm Canadian eh.   Jk sorry.
---
I have always had the impression the BGS doesn't want us to play long. We might find the game-breaking bugs! It was the same with the atom challenges. Y9u log in, do your dailies, maybe do a weekly or two, maybe a couple of events, and log out.
---
I was spamming follow me and help when I was getting my ass whupped last night. Not a soul showed up. Punks. lol.
---
They have. They're investigating it. 
---
Use this to follow bethesda official comments. https://nukacrypt.com/devtracker
---
They didnt load in the new daily's, I had this issue on monday
---
anything that gives xp is mentionable though. not everyone has plans for cranberry relish. I only had the cobbler for a long time. also, not everyone wants to hoard sugar or grow gourds.
---
and sorry for the repeats. i skimmed your post a couple times to try to avoid those.
---
They could revamp the fridge too. Make it so that no food spoils in it, can stack more, and give the effect that if something like nuka cola is put into it then it becomes iced.
---
Rhe vending machine could then just have the ability to keep things fresh forever...and sell them.
---
Just spitballing.
---
Lmaooo so true
---
Hm. Then I guess the not making sense part falls on Bethesda. Though I don't understand why the 76 community seems to so desperately abbreviate everything in the game
---
Interesting as I never had that before or knew of this bug, but I have definitely noticed issues with favorite.  I have 2 shotguns favorite in bottom half of circle.  I have a third shotgun in my bag and it has taken my third one out even though it isn’t a favorite or in my fly wheel.  It has also changed the graphic to the one in my bag, but I am carry one that looks different.  It even displays the name wrong with what I am carrying now occasionally.  Net is, it is very buggy and I spend extra time to be sure I have weapons ready that I want if something close ranks and I want to switch out a plasma or exploding so I don’t blow myself up.  Definitely new for me
---

---
You must have really bad BO ......whiffy.... :-)
---
I even put it in my camp ally for a bit but I got mad every time I looked at them so I changed it lol.
---
If I’m wrong I’ll totally admit I’m an idiot. I keep checking each one.
---
No, dammit! I didn't go to Wawa yesterday.
---
Can someone stream the new leg perks ? thanks a lot.
---
Hey I'm on ps4.  I dont use mic but i would be more than happy to give you plenty of covering fire from my large assortment of heavy guns.  Tmo1983.  Event bonus is nice but think.about joining the building teams a full building team give you 4 intelligence  which is 8percent xp boost.  Add me if you want.
---
Yes I agree!  Empty liquor bottles, cigarette butts, screw drivers, trash, whatever.  A realistic decor would be awesome!
---
newp.
---
Its steep, but well worth it
---
Provides unmatched mobility, the most enjoyable perk of the SS armor. It's kinda hard to explain the utility it brings, because you just dont realize what you can do without it.
---
Yeah, I was on.  I didn't even think of that, but it makes sense. Thanks!
---
Whay about those of us who do play NW and want to feel acknowledged? The XP repeatable weekly challenge does not accept the adventure mode xp reward from nuclear winter, so without these challenges, if I wanted to earn score, I'd be penalized for playing Nuclear Winter.
---
Frankly, there are more types of people playing the game than just diehard adventure mode players. You're just gonna have to accept that: there's more than just you the devs have to keep in mind.
---
The one on the far left is there btw.
---
I only put in the one that spawns at the terminal. The rest I took and repaired and replaced.
---
I play MORPG games because i enjoy some grinding with my story.
---
People want lots of story content and quests but we eat up that stuff within of a few days of release when it takes them months (if not years in the case of wastelanders) to create this content.  Stuff like seasons is designed to keep us engaged while they work on more story content.
---
To be quite frank, we all play this game probably a bit too much and it would take an army of developers to satisfy our hunger for new story content which they dont have.
---
Yeah I know I would. It won't happen. Why would they let us when they know they got so many hooked on the crack box and the higher price point. 
---
Scrapbox should be base game free honestly. Its FO1st only redeeming quality since they didn't give the other features they promised
---
There are a few about, I always kill them, better safe than sorry... they can't be trusted.
---
This seems to be one area that has been abandoned.
---
Holy hell Batmanus
---
It's a carrot flower or sunflower or whatever after a nuke
---
Question. Were you playing nuclear winter before or after the reset? It happened to me yesterday for the first time and the only thing I did different was that I played nuclear winter after the reset.
---
I’ve seen a lot of oddity’s.
---
Flatwoods someone in our team started bitching on mic about the lack of cows To kill a couple of days ago. Last night too many people spawned on the edge of the map and slapped down camps Then aparently quit. Seriously it’s going to be weird untill they stop making Nuclear winter Manditory for everything.
---
Shit man, I forgot that, the newspaper... I'm just not with it this week.
---
It’s the time gates that are the issue, not the challenges. People have other stuff to do, and then the inability of the challenges to be flexible will prevent people from doing them.
---
If the idea for Bethesda is to drive engagement, then making challenges more accessible (note: not changing what the challenges are, or how many you do, but when you can do them) is a good thing. If people know right now that they can’t do dailies (but could do them in a weekend), they check out of the system, and that’s bad.
---
I was confused too.  It's under "Floor Decor" since it is a free-standing sign, not under Wall Decor
---
So THIS is why the Overseer didn’t want the Nukes to land in the wrong hands lol
---
hahaha bethesda is so out of touch
---
"To be quite frank, we all play this game probably a bit too much..."
---
I seriously can't argue with that logic....
---
I mean, I finished yesterday's and lask week, no new ones for either after the reset.
---
how long should you wait before logging back in?
---
Correct. I’ve tamed Deathclaws and Megasloths in the past two weeks and currently have a Mirelurk King in my camp.
---
im pretty new, is there a link someone has for the teams thing? i get the notifications all the time as i explore but have close to no clue the benefit or lack thereof of joining, lvl9 if that matters
---
That's why I went to Gauss shotty. 9k has lasted me about a month so far.... :-)
---
This is true *generally.* But there is no getting around that fusion cores were reconned for Fallout 4/76. They're supposed to basically be indefinite but now run out during gameplay requiring you to get more. We all know why but afaik there's no in universe reason to explain this.
---
For 4, they *could* habe had some BoS terminal showing that while all tests indicate the cores would remain functional for practically ever, some weird surge from the sun (Or something SCIENCE!-y) that occurred sometime between New Vegas &amp; 4 has suddenly rendered the cores unstable.
---
That way, it's not just a retcon for the sake of gameplay but is even explained with additional lore. However, even that would no longer make sense for 76 given how much earlier it is than all the rest of the games.
---
That all said, it doesn't bug me as much as some. And at least there is *some* reason for the change beyond just ransomot forgetting or ignoring the lore for no reason.
---
Absolute degenerate!
---
I am level 326 now and have leveled up 8 times since last Saturday playing a few hours a day.  I am allys with both raiders and settlers so I just do my three daily grind events for gold and jump from one event to the other on a team.  I really don't care too much about leveling up anymore and still have 6 SPECIAL cards to pick.
---
the only comments im seeing is about looking into a "fix."
---
that's fine and dandy, but what are they going to do about the people who have lost time? fixing it prevents others from being affected, but if it already happened to us, too bad, sucks to suck, you have to grind harder than everyone else? this is something that deserves an official statement and some kind of rectification/compensation/extention/additional SCORE opportunity. literally anything to make up for almost an entire day and the majority of my weeklies.
---
thanks so much for that link btw. great tool and i wish i knew about it sooner.
---
I have around 50k stored of regular 2MM 
---
I keep only 3k on me 
---
I use the gauss minigun only on certain occasions. SBQ and Colossus 
---
I use the gauss shotgun for everyday grinding, as it uses the same STR perk slots for DMG buffs
---
Yes. I hate seeing player camps that stick out like a sore thumb in  the wasteland.
---
I'm seriously tempted by the Slocum Joe bundle, which annoys me because I was trying to save my atoms. Here is why I want it, and I'd like anyone to talk me out of buying it.
---
1) robot vendors, to help make a camp look like there are more people "living" there.
---
2) train carriage, so I can build around it to make a ramshackle blood eagle type camp.
---
3) scraggly tiles to make a bathroom to put my new sink in.
---
I suppose I could also make a cafe if I get bored.
---
On PS4, can mic or not.  Stealth Rifle build if you are interested. PSN the same as tag. Play most evenings.
---
Take a workshop.
---
I've never seen the increased building budget for fallout 1st ever promised. I've had it since it launched.  I saw what the said about building more on private, but you wouldn't be able to transfer that to a public server. It has limitations, so the servers are as stable as they get.
---
I only use it on bigger enemies. I have a bloodied gatling gun I use for weak mobs.
---
Why don't you just wear the helmet with clothing, it accomplishes the same cosmetic. Clothing over the stealth suit wouldn't be very stealthy now, would it?
---
Account for a bit of slippage, and assume your clock is off by a few minutes. I'd say at least 10 to 15 minutes after reset.
---
**Make sure you are logged out completely!**  
---
I've read a few out of the hundreds of damn posts about this with people saying the error occurred when they were on the title screen and not fully logged out, or they logged in like 2 minutes after the reset
---
just a few more years to go...
---
Thats terrifying lol
---
Is it too much to ask that I have a throne made from the bones of my enemies?
---
Kidding. But I would take one if they added the option.
---
I agree. More apocalyptic styles would be really fun.
---
So Beth DID listen us. Nice to know it generates power now. And it is spinning again.
---
But the shorty cannot do SBQ when she is not on ground. This is the only thing I dislike
---
Not being funny but I don't play for anyone else but myself call me selfish or whatever I don't care I'll do whatever it takes to survive if that means sitting in a bush for some of the match then so be it
---
🤞🏽🤞🏽🤞🏽
---
There are certain caps, i believe their is a cap at 25 int to the amount of scrap you get from weapons, in the same vein there is a cap at 25 charisma to the prices items can be from vendor bots.
---
alright man, thanks.
---
I didn't even have power running through my playstation yesterday at the reset. Or at all yesterday for even 1 minute 
---
I wasn't even home 
---
And I havn't played NW for a couple weeks 
---
Its something else for sure. All of the challenges I have done previously were completed with no reward this morning when I turned it on to play for a few minutes
---
Ya blew it
---
I kown what you mean and trust me I build a lot at weird places, in and over trees, cliffs, electricity pylons underwater ect ect. This is just a little fun project for an awesome Residence.
---
Even with mappalachia, the sugar bombs seems like 2 FT locations can net 3 crafts...that hurts seeing as how its for 2.5INT on much high time investment. Its going to be labeled as craft as you go and not farm, but man i wish i knew to save the sugar bombs instead of selling to vendors...
---
You would have to get Bethesda to unlink accounts then link to the different one.
---
I’m amazed when I see 6 or so people running around killing everything but only 2-3 are actually turning in the fluid.
---
why would they? are you or bethesda going to do anything about it? exactly.
---
Can’t stress this enough! They should absolutely be account-wide. Nobody should be expected to grind 5 different characters for SS / t-65 plans, it would literally take forever.
---
It's always best to let her land anyway, people shooting her in the sky trigger the stagger and she lands less, so no loss really, if you're Bloodied then once she lands you can polish her off there and then...by yourself.
---
Gotcha. Good luck bud.
---
Sounds  interesting I will give it a try thanks!
---
Mate, bethesda doesnt give a fuck about their player base and it's been like this since BETA, the only people who they care about is the consumers that pay on regular basis, they have been silent this whole time, they won't respond to you until perhaps they fix the problem bc I dont think they themselves know what to do about it quickly, so its basically  good night guys
---
You can’t really use guns like that and the 50 cal etc all the time as the ammo eating is insane. Also rarely see people selling it like other ammo as it’s kinda rare and not worth crafting merely to sell. 
---
I use a bloodied explosive lever action for everyday and then swap in the gauss mini of ultracite Gatling laser for bigger stuff to give me time to restock. The Gatling primed with power user means I can easily run 40k ammo every craft and just use the mini when I feel like whipping it out or fancy a change.
---
I also primed the gauss mini but it still doesn’t help much.
---
U sound salty
---
I think a Children of Atom decoration camp pack would be great.  I would include the glowing jar lights, clean radiation barrels, banners, and wallpapers,
---
I am sorry but WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU SAYING
---
I was logged into the game staring at the daily screen update in realtime and none of the quests auto-completed.
---
How dare you try to teach a man to fish.....
---
Oh man I’m getting Spray&amp; Pray flashbacks from Fallout 4 that gun was a beast
---
agree with OP. Should be like borderlands where you pay to respec. I like both the PvE and Nuclear Winter in this game. However, as a melee build (200+) I can't use the perks I want in Nuclear Winter. Would be nice to quickly swap out for the game mode without have to grind a second character
---
I'd love to see a Megaton-esque pack with various patchwork metal walls, decor, floors, etc. My working idea is that I want my camp to look like it was built on top of an existing diner or something. The diner is pre-war, rest was built by me. A nuke in the ground floor decor would be cool too.
---
Honestly though, i have no idea why I bothered. Literally counting the seconds until the first damn post appears..
---
So you can... CRUSH YOUR ENEMIES, SEE THEM DRIVEN BEFORE YOU, AND HEAR THE LAMENTATIONS OF THE SETTLERS!  
---

---
Put in a report, they'll want pics.
---
There was people that got atoms awarded in lieu of the score reward.
---
She talks about wanting to play with another kid. I’d love a protect from behind the scenes and fix things quest like a babysitting play date for the two. Having the two playing around the cabins surrounding Top of the World while you have to tend to mobs and deactivate traps would be fun. Random pick from a few different locations to spice it up and I’d replay the shit out of that.
---
Mhh a pond next to the residence I'm going to build sounds like a good deal! Will check this place!
---
if there going to make NW score mandatory to finishing a mostly PVE game grind then they need to purge the silly achievements and put in ones that actualy make sense, like Time in match, or number of player kills. Making people want to kill non existant Cows(Seriously there Brahmin, not cows and even then don’t exist in NW mode) or throw down C. A. M. P.s is annoying.
---
I’m curious how much ammo is needed for using it on every enemy I face daily
---
This is what I was hoping for. Thanks, I'll give it a try &amp; if it works, I'll come back here to confirm. This time, I'll avoid taming a Scorched. My ideal pet would be a Radtoad, I somehow find them rather cute!
---
Found a nuka cola protectron in the middle of nowhere in the top of the mire. Red with a gold and silver nuka cola written on its chest.
---
Why does it matter? Others exploiting the system doesn't hurt you, or any other players. The ones who exploit just get the cosmetics faster.
---
So how do u explain backpacks going invisible?
---
Probably close to a couple thousand rounds
---
I've been grinding flux so when I run out of 2mm I'll switch to ultracite 2mm which is crafted in higher amounts
---
I’m arguing in favor of op that the scrapbox should be free because of the huge impact it has on the primary gameplay loop, up to the point where the game becomes tedious without it.
---
And you go „lmao stop whining“
---
I don’t want the tent, or the atoms, or the monthly(?) shitty outfits. I want the scrapbox and that’s it.
---
So we either pay up every month or we’re not entitled to enjoy the fucking game we bought (!) with our money? Yeah gtfo buddy.
---
Yeah it isn't a guaranteed occurrence, but rather it is a risk that people are taking and then complaining when the coin flip doesn't go their way. If all these people submitted bug reports rather than whining on Reddit, who knows.. maybe a lot more bugs would be getting fixed 🤷‍♂️
---
I was enjoying my auto complete glitch for the settler rep and for some reason one day everytime I logged in I was able to turn in the quest.  I did it 4 times in one day before it stopped.
---
Not a glitch, RW only applies to the base gun, not the mods.
---
Weapon weight reduction on armors applies to both the mods and the base gun.
---
I'm with you!
---
The real borderline
---
Darn, I wish there was a way to figure out what triggers the bug.
---
Yup just store the machine. I learned that the hard way.
---
I tried and I didn’t deal much damage to SBQ even she is landed. Btw I’m junkies
---
Huh. Alrighty then.
---
I'm not Bloodied/Junkies and I've solo'd it several times.
---
Logic-wise would be mass production. Different receiver and barrel, same attachments.
---
Re-used assets jokes apart.
---
If they can't fix the goddamn bug they could at least have a warning siren go off at 5 to.
---
I agree. Not only camp items but outfits as well.  
---
Also really really sick of everything being ATX. Add new content to the game that we can find and unlock via quests or events (Not legendary run).
---
Definitely no atoms gained.
---
I put in a report yesterday but didn't include screenshots.. I didn't see the point as there is nothing in the picture that could indicate that I didn't do the challenges myself.
---
will that delete the progress with my character though? i dont want to unlink it and lose all my stuff i bought from the atom shop and my weapons
---
I learned that selling ammo for 0caps does not count...so 1 cap it is
---
I'm not Bloodied/Junkies and I've solo'd it several times. ;)
---
The drop rate seemed fair and balanced to me the last couple times they had Meat Week.
---
or does it save to the account n not the certain ps4 user?
---
This card doesnt work right now no idea why no  saying it.
---
This, this, this \*points above.\* Staying logged in at reset is NOT the only cause of the autocomplete bug though so many people are quick to downvote, say its your fault for being logged in at that time (when you aren't,) claim you're whining, etc, etc, etc. We need more people to realize that there are multiple things causing this and it is an issue. They wouldn't be quick to poke fun at people and tell them to stop whining once it finally happens to them too. Sooner or later it probably will. The sad part is its happening to some people far more often to some people I have talked to than others, however their reward for possibly helping find out another cause of the bug? Being much less likely to complete the season.
---
I have bought the gauss shotgun, minigun, Plasma Castor, T-65 and all pieces of the SS armor.  The problem is I still collect gold script and have saved 2000, what do you do now?  Just buy everything else for the hell of it?  Maybe Tod will add some more weapons or armor?
---
Not a glitch, just really shitty design.
---
Try joining an event team, go collect workshops and defend them
---
I admit I don't always check recent posts for things before I ask a question, but you are right about this one, and the 3/5 rewards SCORE thing.... so many posts.
---
Btw - does any feel that VATS is acting up with gauss weapons...?
---
how long has this bug been a thing its crazy
---
At least with that glitch you get to reap the benefits.
---
I guess that explains why that was patched and this one isnt
---
I feel like the Slocum's Joe is the more versatile option of the two.
---
The log cabin is very basic and doesn't look that great (compared to things like the Seedy Seed or the caboose in the Slocum bundle).  The water wheel looks weird at any CAMP that isn't situated around water (and there isn't much water in some regions of the world anyway).  The stone bench looks cool, but where are you going to find a nice, flat surface to put it on?
---
The Slocum's Joe stuff, particularly the floors and wallpapers, would be useful for anyone looking to build around a 1950s diner aesthetic, or a nice kitchen.  It makes for a snazzy looking storefront too.
---
How much time do you spend fighting the SBQ, in reality? For me less than 1% of my playtime, so even if it was pants at SBQ (which I dont agree it is)...so what, its great for the vast majority of everything else :-)
---
I’m remembering in Fallout 4 where you didn’t find clean anything until the Vault building materials DLC. Up until that, everything was ratty and disgusting. 
---
If we’re building livable bases or stores, I’d like to go home to a nice clean bed, and not a tattered sleeping bag soaked in nuclear AIDS.
---
The same way you explain dropping SBQ in 20 seconds.
---
Honestly, they should just do a server reset every day and instead of running multiple consecutive 20-hour timers for every single character on every single account for daily resets they should just make everything reset at the same time. Soooo many problems solved, as well as increased server stability due to less background processes, and casual players will be more encouraged to play seeing as they might get two lots of daily rewards per week rather than just one!
---
It's +3 INT. That's just the base amount. Up to 7.5 with Herbivore and Strange in Numbers... Yesterday I got 57 Sugar Bombs from 2 servers using Mappalachia. Crafted 19 Brain Bombs, but got 26 using Super Duper. Took maybe an hour, all told.
---
I put 18 of them on an Alt so they wouldn't go bad... Since the bonus lasts 90 minutes, best not to carry too many on you at once, even using Good With Salt 3.
---
I doubt it. It should just change what accounts are linked and you should be able to just carry on where you left off. In theory anyway, I've not actually done it myself.
---
Yea silencer would make this my favorite gun...Running sneak commando just isn't that possible. If just silencer I'd be happy for recoil gains. Sights would be my number 2 though. That should make the recoil manageable i think, just don't nerf the range too much...
---
people always says prime it and it will help. No! How about the crimson flux if you need to farm? No way, you need to farm for an hour and shoot in 10 minutes? Not efficient at all
---
https://i.imgur.com/WQ0mU0m.png
---
This is the response people are getting once you press that it has nothing to do with the 3/5 bug. Where did you hear that people were given atoms?
---
no way they remove spoil since it would render soon so stuff obsolete
---
You can think of it being realistic. If you got a gun that was reduced weight, that means that the maker found a way to make it lighter. You then adding a huge metal barrel doesnt mean the barrel is reduced weight. 
---
In the same fashion weapon weight reduction in armor or in perks is more of a skill you learned to hold more. Or the armor makes you stronger or has more cushion to hold the weapons.
---
If you mean by making a chat, a mod then you don't have too since a mod on PC already adds a text chat I believe. But yes there should 100% be a in game text chat for all platforms
---
FYI not just events labeled with (!) Give you treasury notes. Non faction based give them.
---
No no... he’s got a point.
---
In game chat exists. At least on 
---
xbox
---
Just levelled up an alt and the advise I would suggest is to join an events group and just grind events. There is always something on and don't be afraid to go above your comfort zone. One Violent Night, Uranium Fever and Line in the Sand are fantastic events that you can throw yourself into, tag enemies and come out with alot or xp. Just make sure your weapons and armour are up to par for your level.
---
Edit: to add the smaller events in between are good too, I've got quite a bit of xp off Manhunt, which seems to be triggering really often recently.
---
They will no doubt expand on the bullion market. The BoS will probably have some goodies for gold
---
But the max amount of bullion you can have is 5000. So when you get close buy mods for the T65 or SS, or for your weapons, or just get whatever catches your eye
---
Since wastelanders, they are way more prevalent in drops from NPCs. Go kill Raiders and Blood Eagles. 
---
There's only 2 spawn locations I know of, a locked cage in The Burrows and Berkley Springs - maybe that's changed. I know since Wastelanders, the one that was on the Roof of the Hotel Salon in Berkley moved around a little, but it's still up there. 
---
[Here's more details.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/fl7bye/found_a_spawn_point_for_a_handmade_rifle_in_the/)
---
Same I quite enjoy it. Doing same thing with a bit of purpose and nice rewards.
---
What burning me out is lack of level normalisation, quite tired doing events where everyone 1shots everything
---
Or you can think of it like this: it's a great way to totally invalidate a legendary effect to make it useless.  Realism be damned.  This game is as unrealistic as it gets.
---
Yeah you got me! I’ll probably use shorty😂
---
thank you
---
I agree that sometimes the push for realism can get annoying.
---
If you like little guys like this, take a look at big Fred BBQ? I think that's what it's called in savage divine. I always have a half dozen of foxes spawning there. Always good for a nice picture
---
Well last time they re-ran meat week it had same rewards as the first run I believe, so who knows.
---
Too grindy for the flux🙈
---
I hope so. The drops were so mediocre last year. Would love a tenderizer plan
---
&gt;Bethesda needs a revenue stream of some kind to justify keeping the lights on for multiplayer. And what about new content like Wastelanders, and the upcoming Brotherhood of Steel stuff?
---
I'd be happy with having neither of these. Shut down the servers, make the game offline singleplayer only, and discontinue free content development. Sell expansions in the way previous singleplayer Bethesda games did or just open content creation to the community in the form of mods and move the development team onto another project.  The game would be significantly better for it.
---
Yeah, it would be pretty easy for Bethesda to block auto clicker software and stuff like that but it’s Bethesda lol, Mose easily access games have better anti cheat
---
Early access*
---
Off, someone must be really salty to have downvoted every post in here.
---
because they were more OP for non-power armor users and made PA even more useless
---
What what where?
---
Yep, that's a well-known place to find Foxes. I had to go there to get fox meat for a Possom badge.
---
You still get a vastly lighter gun out of the deal. Without it you'd have the normal weight of the gun plus the mods.
---
Nope.
---
Double S.C.O.R.E. is a joke because it’s only on dailies. It’s only going to give you like 3 extra days worth of points. Not a whole lot. By the time we get there people who have been grinding will be around lvl 50 on the board and by that time doing all the dailies will be required just to level up once on the score. We need double weeklies and dailies for a week
---
no and if you listen to the people on this sub its your fault for not logging out of a game to prevent the bug
---
I mean, my first three rolls were 1* (nocturnal, hunter, mutants) but then my fourth? 2* ghoul slayer faster reload. The fifth one though, that one was a 3* nocturnal. 
---
I did eventually get a couple decent rolls but I lost count...
---
If it’s like last year, there aren’t many truly rare drops and I think it was just a guaranteed 1 star armor piece. But it awards lots of scrip (based on how much prime meat you add), XP from Primal Cuts events (more valuable now with SCORE) and Treasury Notes from all the various new public events.
---
From others I have talked to, it has happened even when they aren't logged in at reset and even when they are not playing Nuclear Winter first thing after reset. They're aware of the main causes and trying to be careful yet they're still getting hit with it. There seems to be multiple issues causing the bug, but the problem is the lesser common reasons have been tougher to narrow down.
---
Hmm never saw that, but the red rocket ones are red and in the area just west for that daily. Interesting.
---
Paul
---
That was fantastic. Lamentations from everyone!
---
Oh no poor little guys haha
---
i figured since it was a online game that it would save account wise and not ps4 wise if that makes sense i just dont wanna unlink it and then lose my stuff cause ive spent like a good 60 to 100 in atoms over the time and that would suck to lose
---
Wait until the fox sits on its haunches and yawns. It hardly looks irradiated at all, almost like a normal fox just looking cute.
---
Those numbers seem good, but what was the time invested? Also the runs you took? mappalacia seemed light on those spawns. The most dense i could see was near whitesprings. Some of those dots much yield multiple, as I know many can spawn in flatwoods but there is only 2 dots? If you want to keep the route a secret that I'd understand because those spawns are abysmal.
---
It would be awesome if they would add the tenderizer to the legendary pool at the same time like they did with the Fixer and the Bear Arm.
---
Depends what your focus is. I know it helps me with ammosmith and super duper. It makes a massive difference even if you think it doesn’t. 
---
 Flux is an absolute cakewalk especially now XP is important. You go for a walk in a nuke zone, even one someone had launched so it cost you nothing, and you pick some flowers and kill some high level enemies and craft it. If you get in on the queen kill you get flux for free too. 
---
There is literally no way you lose out and I have not once run out of flux or primed ammo whilst always keeping a stock of tens of thousands. It’s much more beneficial than the alternative and less time consuming especially now the XP grind is a secondary consideration.  
---
I get the feeling a lot of people who bemoan the flux cost operate only heresay and don’t actually try it for themselves. It’s hugely beneficial and I noticed a real difference once I started using it on bigger faster firing guns especially.
---
Either way the crux of the point is you aren’t gonna be able to run that gun constantly whether you prime it or not, unless you wanna just endlessly farm mats and use that gun to farm the ammo and get even less return from it.
---
Shrug.
---
Cat steaks are better than starving.
---
Opposite for me.  Seeing that blue bar go up is what Im all about right now.  I think the rewards need some work next season... adding a permanent buff or stash space at the end would be much better than MOAR SKINS.
---
But at least exp serves a purpose again... and I am out to get it and get that blue bar running!
---
only real way to make up for the lost Score is to grind XP like crazy and fill up the repeatable, sadly.
---
Big RIP. Lolz.
---
i get the alert message that says this email address is already in our system so i think thats how id go about fixing it
---
the greenhouse parts from fallout 4 would be nice. All that glass!
---
Almost every group of randos I’ve been matched with gets murked before the second storm even starts, and I regularly get into the bottom five by just crouching in bushes. Most of us want the levels and rewards with as little grind as possible, so being a bush wookie is incentivized. Besides that, grabbing loot and sitting pretty while the other survivors off each other means you’re in a great spot to pop out and attack while the element of surprise is on your side once you get near the end of the match.
---
Ummm you're score rank 35 so I think you'll be ok
---
Re-balance with PA boosting perks then.....no too sensible, its nerf or nothing :-)
---
I know.  I really wanted to stick to using Heavy BOS armor on my main character and was like, wow I'm being rewarded for my effort to collect 5 pieces of 3\*.  Now poof, I'm not.  I don't think people were pissed at that concept, they just wanted more additional armor perks and other usable perks.
---
It’s all linked to your Bethesda login. [Support](https://help.bethesda.net)
---
I have all the outfits I want, I’m not interested by a random diner and its story, and I’ve modded my camp to the point where I’ve run out of budget. I was just bringing up the challenges as a sort of introduction to the problem. Events are there to present random content for players to do. But when the only pieces of content available besides farming nukes are level 5 events, then I have obvious problems with the system as a level 153. The daily quests are the only piece of content added to endgame, and there is only 3 of them. I’m not even including the ally dailies, because they do not work no many how many techniques I use to try and get the NPC to gift them to me.
---
must be amusing for bethesda to see their player count drop 90% fir ~30 minutes at a time everyday and wonder “why”
---
Could be a re

And this is exact the moment for the photo! I made one while I'm wearing my bear costume and croc backpack sitting next to the fox haha

I never met the guy of course.  
---
IMO, it says a lot about the time and kinds of people in America.  
---
I knew few 'Native Americans' so unless I'm talking to one of them I will use the referred term. To this day, not all tribes get alone just like they haven't in their history.
---
PA needs a rework in general
---
Also, people on console are already required to pay *another* subscription fee (PS+ &amp; XBL Gold) just to play the game at all. They have to pay double fees to get FO1st.
---
Absolutely agree on all of this. It would make life easier for everyone one, surely.
---
Couldn’t see what it was called because the other guy had it near death so I just hipfired 2 shots real quick. Upon inspection it had a clean nuka cola paint job. It looked very nice. Hopefully we get that model for our scavenger bots.
---
Yeah, Gauss weapons in VATS, even with 95% chance to hit, still go wooooosh... ;)
---
Give me a hamster on a hamster wheel that generates ONE unit of power.. Please... Just imagine the possibilities!
---
Really? I just used my level 2 toon and leveled him to level 3 and it gave me the score. Maybe they’ve added an age limit to the character so that it has to be x days old to begin qualifying for the score challenges?
---
Oh that would be great thank you! Will add you when I get home and I’ll put a message in the request so you know it’s me. What time zone are you in?
---
Had the same thing happen to me, went to join uranium fever and ended up at the motherlode for breach and clear
---
What about ceilings and the underside of upper floors. That doesn't seem like it would be much harder than applying wallpaper to the walls?
---
Here's the proof for anyone wondering. Too bad we can only tame and send the normally hostile creatures to our camp. I want a possum so bad.

Wonderful thanks, will drop you an add when I get home. What time zone are you in?
---
Plus side, it gives you someone you can keep killing and healing for any quests or challenges that require that :)
---
Nah I wouldn't complain. I've already have it happen to me once when I was changing servers and/or on a loading screen around the time the reset happened. It has never happened while I've been idling in game. So I'll continue with this method until it fails me.
---
That is a change ive been waiting for
---
You are also a monster.
---
Someone mentioned there is a cap on MS for sneaking and speed demon pushes you to that cap by itself iirc the conversation. 
---
Basically it’s buttressed or maybe the falling damage one if you don’t want to use bird brains but use the jet pack
---
So, way too hard. Got it. Lol
---
How did you submit it through support? I couldn't figure it out and I submitted feedback that said it won't provide a response
---
I tried transitioning to a different build and balls up my main character. Now I'm in the process of starting a new character, and whilst tedious, I have fallen in love with Fallout again. Not all bad I suppose.
---
But there needs to be a more efficient means to do this :)
---
Yeah. That's fair, actually. I can't deny that. All the same, the amount of people who vigorously defend this game and outright ignore the flaws it has to offer and yell anyone down who might do so on this subreddit is incredibly high. Which is why I say? It's not bad to criticize something you love. You're a consumer. That's how you get a better experience. 'snowflake' is a little more inanely fucking stupid then 'bootlicker' -- one implies I believe I'm unique and delicate and sensitive and the other just tells you your bias precedes all preconceptions and fuels fanboyism to an unhealthy obsessive degrees. not that i expect you to read this since TLDR lol
---
thanks for the confirmation to both of you i was so worried ps4s trying to say i owed them 150$ which no way i spent that much on ps plus lol so i had to make a new user cause that one got suspended n was worried about my fallout account mainly
---
Doe sit stack with sleep or it already sleeping bonus.
---
About an hour.... But I have been farming them for a long time now, so I know most places to go and exactly where they are located. Might take considerably longer for someone just following the map. But what I do is dedicate a good portion of time now to farming for these, Cranberry Relishes and Berry Mentats and then just store excess amounts on an Alt to use later. Since food doesn't spoil on a character you're not using, it's best to make big batches that you can work with for a while.
---
Also some of those locations, like Flatwoods Church and West Gorge River Bridge usually have multiple boxes. And Mappalachia only has locations that are not inside buildings. There are some locations that can have them inside, like RobCo and Fort Defiance.
---
Another trick is using another character to farm locations you have already farmed on your main. Sure it will add more time, but the respawn period is character bound, so you can get a larger yield this way.
---
What about the Canned Meat Stew from Mama Dolce's? Does the +5% for one hour multiply with Carnivore?
---
Note: I realise Tasty Squirrel Stew is +10%, just noting it as an alternative.
---
imo they have built this game as if its single player and tried to taxk on repeatable content.
---
they spent a year making wastelanders and the only repeating content is 3 fetch quests - just pure idiocy
---
If only you had said this to someone who is actually on your team instead of a bunch of random people who have no idea who you are.
---
They take into account what you have completed vs what you have been awarded for score.
---
They need your client side data to compare to their server side data.
---
If it doesnt add up they were awarding atoms to top you up to where you should have been had you score, when they allow to  buy via atoms.
---
Classic, no pic no proof
---
Literally just enable under armor and backpacks with XL straps while in PA and I’d be happy
---
Second roll...one star furious! I'll take it for now lol
---
oh yeah its my fault for a stupid bug that todd wont patch
---
100% this. Also we need way, way more military themed camp options. It's currently impossible to build something akin to the BoS firebases in the bog as they look in the game, and it's kind of a shame.
---
Case in point.
---
not like its the Beth's fault at all for having the same bug for a very long time
---
yes i know but its still frustrating
---
plus i want the appalachian thunder pipe or whatever its called fast :P
---
All your stuff is attached to your bethesda account. When you first installed and loaded 76 it sets it all up for you. I'd advise you speak to them via their website to sort anything and they be able to better solve the situation.
---
Just google locked containers in NW and a list and map should pop up.  Then make sure to load in close when the game begins, rinse and repeat.
---
Don’t forget to join an event or building team if you take this approach!  Free bonus xp!
---
Mountain...colorado...I play mainly late evenings I work until 11 eastern.
---
:(
---
i am sad
---
I’m looking at you, comic book wallpaper CAMPs with winter icicle lights.
---
There are locked containers all over the place. Go in any building, you’re sure to find one.
---
Speed demon caps out movement speed, so any movement speed increased through mods, or perks is wasted.
---
It's like telling people the stove is hot every day but they come back and complain that they burned themselves again and again...
---
You can use buttressed and the fall damage together. I believe the fall damage one stacks.
---
i think ive done that repeatable more times than i can count and i think im losing my mind
---
Yesterday I seen a couple comments about people getting 150 atoms for auto completed dailies.
---
Even if they just made a week or two long event twice a year or such so the system could be used for trying some different builds during it to see what they like before locking it in for the next six months (or heck, at this point I think we'd take even a year since its better than nothing.)
---
...should clarify that while there are plenty of little lakes around Beckwith Farm’s northern strip, I meant to the right of Whitespring itself. There is also a wood extractor between the BBQ joint and the Unstoppables billboard that has a TON of flat glorious land 😂
---
approximat rough math, but for ffr to be worst, your explosive damage would have to be greater than your single shot damage/4, it generally wont be.
---
When I'm in game and not in an xbox chat party, I talk to whoever is near me. 
---
In settings--&gt; audio, top is voice chat mode. Options are area, team, and none and auto which I assume means if you're on a team it'll be team and when you're not it'll be area.
---
You’re level 35. You’ll live.
---
They are super easy to complete, though.
---
In fact, my only reservation about them is that I kind of feel like I'm cheating the real NW players by joining in just to spend about 30 seconds taking pictures or placing my CAMP.  Or 30 minutes of essentially not playing the game.
---
Priming it does help tons. Getting the materials for stable flux is easy and doesn’t take much time, and the amount of ammo you make that’s ultracite is way more than the regular ammo. Pair that with ammosmith and super duper, and the difference you’re looking at could literally be a few days versus a few weeks worth of ammo.
---
Same this yesterday. I was lvl 100 and dude was in his 50's. He got swarmed by some blood bugs as the SBQ fight ended. In my infinite wisdom I proceeded to light the bugs up, as well as the player. I flashed the heart emote as an I'm sorry. It was a complete accident. I was only trying to help. It would be really nice if there was a few minute cool down after events where you can't attack other players, especially the SBQ fight where there are still adds spawning in.
---
Still happening as of July 8.
---
If you get Morgantown there is a locked tool box behind big ALs and in Momma Dolces at the hole in the eastern wall.  There is also a safe next to the bridge down the road from the bank underneath the monorail terminal in south Morgantown.  It's one of the easiest challenges you will ever do.
---
On a STRICTLY lore argument these dwellers are 25 years from the nukes. They ALL lived with gaudy stuff. They'd want this to remind them of "home".
---
I don’t think the president of the company is making buy prioritization decisions.
---
Grinding is boring.    
---
My main leveled up 3x in one evening through hopping from Events, easily Dailies, grouping with taking as many of the XP bonus effects I can.
---
Correct.  If, per shot, i get 5-1 damage explosions, then its the same.  Less, then ffr is better,  morr than explosive is better.
---
Nope I agree, although sometimes the underside of floors gives it the BEAM look lol.
---
Praise the sun!
---
I'm in Massachusetts and I can see one from the front door of my work and there's another one maybe 100 feet down the road.
---
Eagerly awaiting a list lol.
---
I'm all for NW dailies but this one is kind of shitty for a new player. If you don't have the perk for lock picking you need to either hope you get it from ranking up or that you have enough points to buy it. This one is not very well thought out for a 24 hour period.
---
Resources I think?
---
yes but i still feel sad because they wont patch this stupid glitch
---
edit: actually no sorry thats formulating it bad
---
they "probably" will
---
It already exists?
---
You're in the wrong place for official in-game help.    
---
This isn't the official BGS Fallout 76 sub for it. It might take awhile but the official forums are the best place; not here.
---
It’s shite I wouldn’t worry to much lol
---
It’s under resources
---
Log out now, but also, DO complain because it needs to be fixed ASAP.  Make bug reports, complain here, complain on forums, tweet at them.  DO.  COMPLAIN.  Stop being complacent just because there is a workaround "solution".  Stop putting the blame on the user as an avoidable bug.  This bug has been in the game for over a year, it was just only ever triggered by NW.  It needs to be fixed and people need to be vocal.  I can't believe you would even use the words "brought it on yourself" about a game-breaking bug, that a whole feature revolves around, that has existed for a year in some form.  Just my opinion though.
---
Actually it was posted after the refresh, I just wanted to get some feelers out to find out what lebel I should be by now
---
my 2 shot, explosive utrasite legacy laser rifle. breaks every 3 mags. but obleriterate. i just only use it when i have the extra repaire kits
---
It's your call. You'll get the enjoyment out of what you buy not us. Sure, it's awesome and cool to see but it's not MY CAMP.
---
Fusioncores can give electricity for more then a 100 years, but I think using it as ammo or putting it inside Power armor will drain it much faster, correct me if I'm wrong.
---
That lock-pick hacking one is finally something worthy
---
Unfortunately the wait is longer than I anticipated myself, because the launcher is severely throttling my download speed for some reason so it's taking forever.
---
It's been stated many times by the CMs that this sub is an official outlet for feedback and reporting, as good as any.
---
I captured about 14 workshops on my private and in between capturing them back (easier and quicker to retake than defend) i ran the the athletics course at sunnytop ski lanes. You have to have started the tadpole quest.
---

---
it takes maybe 1 minute to run the course. No enemies (except at the end but you kill them and then you have a while until they respawn) but there are traps which you can either deactivate before running or do it while running the first time. If you fast travel when you finish back to the top there is a small chance some traps may reset.
---
With perks and aid and buffs you should get aboot 500xp every time.
---
Oh dang, is that true?  I just assumed the mods were 1:1 and never bought the falling damage mods for legs.  Now I am gonna have to check this out
---
Never met Mergle?
---
When i die this happened to me 75% of the time. If you pick a respawn location a bit further away from death point it will fix it and no server change needed. I think this is the worst bug in the game.
---
Ur the cancerous one
---
I would never be able to do the jump AFK because my game would eventually crash.
---
I do exactly the same! I'm still pretty terrible at NW, so I try to follow teammates that are higher level or seem to know what they're doing. If I get matched with others who group up and seem to have a plan, then I follow their lead and help any way I can (especially with revives when I can do so safely). Otherwise, I'll be over here in a bush listening to everyone shoot each other and doing my level best to avoid the fire.
---
Yeah. Buttressed is the material mod and cushioned is a misc mod.
---
Yeah man they got boycotted real quick. Don't bring them back lol
---
Whitespring isn't bad if you get a set run.
---
I start at the entrance across from Uranium Fever.
---
Hit the first set of cottages on the right (that's 8 or so ghouls).  But when you hit the road cut left to the maintenance area.
---
The parking lot has 5 ghouls, and there are another 7 in the building. Take the back exit, and cross the courtyard to the small set of cottages. 4 ghouls there.
---
Now you hit the clubhouse, upstairs first. There are around 10-12 ghouls upstairs. Then head downstairs for another 8 or so, plus a wendigo or glowing one. There are usually 2 more right outside of the back.
---
From there, run past the front beside the tennis courts.  There is a set of cottages that are actually shops. Another 8 or so ghouls.
---
Realistically, that can be done in 10 minutes or so with practice.
---
i am hopeing to place 4 end to end so i can make it take up just one wall if its long enough
---
The average is about 25 after the reset, I don’t think there physically enough to time for anyone to have gotten that much exp yet especially if they are skipping challenges
---
Man, this would be nice. I think the last new hairstyle for girls at least was added after the community scorched challenge.
---
At least I reminded people, informed others, and provided a link to do submit a bug report. What did you do? Villainised me for it 😂
---
That'll fix it!
---
"If you run with scissors, it's you're own fault if you hurt yourself!"  
---
"*omg how DARE you!*"
---
I have tried this aswell but it's a 50/50% chance of this working. If you are in Caution or Danger during an event, which let's be honest that is 99% of the time. It takes 15 seconds before the fast travel. If you get hit ones the timer resets. Basicly making it impossible to respawn anywhere else
---
Not run by BGS for clarification.
---
Why not do the nw daily’s? I don’t think they are too much of an ask, todays challenge could be completed in 10 seconds by just placing your camp 3 times
---
This challenge is literally easier and takes less time than “survive for 30 minutes” you know.
---
You got to stop pooping in them and setting them on fire. Haha
---
/s No it's your fault, you should have set an alarm or two on your phone, and stopped whatever you were doing, logged out 15 minutes before hand, maybe even shut down your PC or console just to be safe, and make sure you don't log in again or go to the atom shop or play nuclear winter, until AT LEAST :15 past the hour.  If you do all these things and the bug still occurs for you it's still probably your fault and I just don't know what else to tell you. Whatever you do though, make a bug report, but don't complain about it ok? Especially when you're Rank 35 already, why are you being so entitled??? /s
---
Taking role play too far
---
You had a negative balance on your psn account ? Did you add credit via PayPal and then cancel the transaction with your credit card or something ?
---
I need to know too lol
---
I didn’t ask. My point was that the way someone likes to play might not work that well against it.
---
There’s specific perk builds for PA users. I deal with the same but rarely use my PA
---
Brilliant!
---
I too noticed there has been some cunt or cunts downvoting everyone, so I upvoted everyone with a negative score. WTF people?
---
I never came across any locked containers tbh.
---
This is a great tip! The lag for crafting benches &amp; vending machines has gotten SO bad lately that I would have to have found the ultimate new location to even consider going through that mess all over again otherwise! It was bad enough restocking vending &amp; displays after they took them down to patch stuff recently.
---
But that bags got some Hot Shit in it 😁
---
Agreed. I never touched NW until the dailies started. Not fun.
---
I'm sure you're aware, but there's 2 ways to have a "PA Backpack". 
---
The excavator set bonus is +100 weight and better mining. 
---
There's also calibrated shocks for PA legs that give 50+ carry weight. I believe you can do this with the excavator for a total of 200+ carry weight.
---
That isn’t the reason for it. I could try to do the SBQ solo and she lands just as often (hardly at all) when I don’t shoot at her.
---
Tall junk walls from Fallout 4 that can snap would be great to have!  Including some more original walls using old vehicles would be cool too.
---
Fallout 4 also had some other barricades that were really nice, like sharp metal barricades and some that used Mirelurk carapaces.
---
More prefab-like structures would be nice, like trailers and shipping crates.  Even more scrappy thrown together shacks would be awesome to have.  Some nice little abodes.
---
We're not playing Fallout 4.
---
And a laughing one 🤣
---
That's no sun. It's an explosion.
---
That's too big to be an explosion.
---
I have a very bad feeling about this.
---
It was a promo for buying Atoms. Was never sold in the shop.
---
If you nuke over the burrows it transforms the ghouls to glowing ones. The great thing is there is no radiation. So bloodied builds can run it without losing their unyielding bonuses. If you choose to nuke the queen be sure to hit the train repair yard as well as the Grove. This gives high level enemies a better chance of spawning. Also, during things like one violent night make sure to tap things and let every6 get a piece of the XP.
---
There are like 15 or so wallpapers already, plus like four variations of wall type (door, two windows, etc). That is a mess load of scrolling if they were to make each option a variant. The wallpaper setup works fine for managing it and allows you to put wallpapers on different wall types. The problem is that they don't have interior walls which have wallpaper on both sides. If they would add those, then we wouldn't need to double-up interior walls to make our houses look nice.
---
I hated that outfit. The hat was the only worthwhile thing I got out of that outfit.
---
yes!! i’ll have such a nice camp until you look up and notice the ugly roof
---
I confirmed that myself.  The level up inside the vault doesn’t count but the next one (outside the vault) will.
---
I’m guessing you’re the type of person that’s too scared to explore 5 feet past the only bush you hide in until the storm reaches you? Because I hide too, but just moving around and you can find locked containers. Just like in adventure, they’re going to be in and around buildings, not random bushes.
---
I get that it might not be fun seeing the same topic over and over, but I just don't understand the sentiment of making this a user-end problem.
---
I made the Beckett's sign say Peckers
---
You didn't ask? Am I not free to comment no? You're on social media you silly billy.
---
Have you never explored a nuke zone before?   All the normal plants turn into special flux producing plants when nuked.  There would have been a nuke dropped on the area you found this but then the nuke zone cleared up.
---
We are 90% of the time. That 10% is multi-player.
---
Add daily quests, companion quests..
---
Both
---
I haven't run into one yet at all.
---
For the longest time I lived in tent under a tree by the river. I built a junkyard around me to give me the look of a hoarder. It looked like it belonged. Now I have an Enclave officers club and it's a little more functional.
---
Sorry no tried and true mechanics here, only time-wasting garbage allowed.
---
And what exactly does that have to do with the fact we still need this?
---
Scrap a gun for screws.
---
Problem is there doesn't seem to be any way to consistently reproduce it. From what I've seen pretty much every combination of possible actions around reset time has both had people unaffected by it and affected by it to varying degrees.  
---
Hopefully it gets completely fixed soon but at least for now some people have been having success contacting support and getting atoms equivalent to what they missed out on.
---
\*sigh\* should of known these neophytes wouldn't be able to perceive the nature of this comment. Just have to wonder with their tanks and their bombs, whats in their heads these days...
---
Amazing
---
It's a challenge that makes people think of PVP. Even though you don't have to fight. People avoid any form of pvp interactions like it's Covid19. 
---
They then promptly get into Reddit to complain about it. 
---
Load into Nw, place 3 camps then leave. 
---
Oh dear I'm so scarred from this experience.
---
thats exactly what happened and yeah with a credit card and there where also random purchases i didnt make so i canceled the card and they suspended my account till i pay it off which i dont know how the bill possibly got to 150 so i just made a new account
---
They're all a bunch of commies
---
Crit savy! 👍
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/fv0jyu/psa_on_how_luck_and_crit_meter_works/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Understood.
---
How does it make the game more fun? 900 hours here, no fo1st. You really dont need 20 000 steel. You dont need to craft anything at all.
---
This is cute as hell!
---
&gt;They said there’s no way they can credit SCORE
---
not only is this such fucking bullshit, but i would bet that they could track our in game interactions and see that our SCORE didn't change after the challenges updated. this is seriously bullshit that they are fucking people like this.
---
There's a door you can still enter. It's near the sign that reads, "arrivals" near the flag pole.
---
Oh my gosh, so you have let us down once again... Staying loyal to Fallout 76 feels like an abusive relationship sometimes. I want to leave but I can't give it up because one day you just might treat me better. But that day never comes! When I look at the total earnable score and the bugs with rewarding it, I can see its impossible to reach 100 on the board without paying to jump spaces forward. :( Please, please add the event SCORE, not next season but now... even if it was only 25 per event it will make such a huge difference overall and then the social side of public teams will make more sense too!?
---
But how will I know I'm on your team?
---
if they update it it will simply give treasury notes. meat week is about the xp bonus not legecy drops
---
i dont know how to get in direct contact with them to actually speak to them about it i just know the ticket system theres no live chat option or anything n i would think i wouldnt have nothing to worry about if like you guys are saying its connected to Bethesda account not ps4 account
---
get as much of the repeatable XP bonus as you can during a double XP weekend
---
Or if you mean the just logo one from the bundle its in misc structures
---
Yep, had no issues with hitting 100
---
Survive 30 mins was so dumb.  Grinding in that time was more SCORE efficient, so I ignored it.
---
Double daily score weekend should make up for 4 lost days.
---
there is none. this is unacknowledged beyond "we're looking into a fix"
---
Wow is this really the case?  I been saving hoping to load up on Modules.  Why would they have a sale and not include everything.  Strange
---
In my experience every new character I have ever started with in NW has lock pick as one of the default starting perk cards. They always start with the same cards in my experience, strong back, lock pick, the bonus hp end card, forget the cha one, hacker, forget the agility, and class freak for luck.
---
I varies by build but nuke zones are nothing special to me (pa main) and it really only takes a few minute to grab flux.  It's the rest of the materials that are harder to get, so every now and again I just farm those in mass.
---
I only use the gauss mini for queens and big lads, and showing off occasionally.  So in a week I'll maybe use 5000 rounds, which is easy enough to get back.  And that's the high end.  I use more 5mm in a gatling gun as my primary than anything else, and with the ammo maker and zero weight, it's basically free.
---
the UI is a bit slow BUT i was able to convert a tonne of ammo i do not need into ammo that I do need so I could shoot the guns I like to shoot...and it was free. So yes, please do some work on the UI so it is not as tedious as it currently is...but it works just fine and I was able to shoot guns and clear out room in my stash to store more 'stuff' that I 'need'.
---
It’s in the new bundle (slocum joes) but the ones shown here are from the red rocket bundle, which is currently unavailable.
---
That's brave.
---
I accidentally did this the other day and I felt so terrible
---
Or they could totally make it free for everyone, because it’s such a huge advantage.
---
Personally I love Nuclear Winter, despite the issues that it does have. Of all the times I have came in first (or heck top 3) I would say maybe 75% of those I was the only one left in my team. When you get a good team together, the game is great, and I think if people could play it that way and see how much more fun it is then they wouldn't be going AFK as much. However, even when the team does decide to spawn on me, most of the time people run off in different directions, people won't rez others who are literally right next to them because they think it'll use one of their prized stimpacks, or you get built to sprint faster and runs around taking everything good and all the ammo even if they don't need it from every chest possible leaving the others with nothing.
---
I remember once I got so pissed at only having a 10mm pistol and some frags after the other guy kept showing off switching between all his great weapons so when I came across a grafton monster I started going ape-s\*it crazy on it kiting it around while the other guy kept screaming in his mic that I was a moron and other obscenities. Then he had the gall to run up at the last moment and TRY to take all the loot from the grafton monster after I killed him. He said "Let me get that 50 cal and those nuka grenades." I got my mic out since it wasn't plugged in, got everything working, and finally was able to tell him off and say no way in hell was I giving him anything after he took everything and got the other two people killed since they had nothing to defend themselves with and he just ran off away from the battle. He claimed he was "joking" about wanting the stuff.. There are too many people like him and others who don't play the game properly that if someone plays for the first time they're likely going to be turned off to the mode. Nothing is going to happen sadly while this continues.
---
What I would really like to see to get rid of AFKing is changes to the xp formula for kills, a short tutorial mode so new players can learn whats going on without having to do so in the game itself since lets face it the  stuff scattered around in the lobby doesn't really work, and if we ever get guilds/clans then we could actually easily form a team with people we know who are more likely to actually play.
---
Me..?
---
around that time on my toons.. I mostly spent time in the ash heap and the top of the world area.. 
---
I would (and still do) do events anywhere.. especially ones that throw tons of mobs at ya.. but most of my time just gathering materials and generally roaming around killing mobs would be around the ash heap
---
once most of the missions dictate you go to the east.. discovering new locations, events/dailies is kinda my focus..
---
if I find myself getting a little low on basic crafting/building materials ill do the run from 76 into flatwoods and just grab/kill/scrap everything.. usually thats enough fuel to keep me going for a while..
---
also of course any and all XP buffs you can get to more quickly level through the hump is crucial..
---
The lockpicking perk is a default perk equipped to ever new character. It is impossible to not have this perk card.
---
Please be aware that unlinking your Bethesda.net account has several effects.
---
* You lose access to your in-game progress for certain games
---
* You lose access to the purchased content linked to that account
---
* You lose access to the currencies on that account
---
* You lose access to any mods or Creation Club content
---
* You lose access to any games purchased under that account
---
Linking your accounts/consoles to a different Bethesda.net account will not restore the items listed above. Thats what it says when i go to submit a ticket it is it just talking about i lose it on the account till i relink it in game?
---
Typing letters is hard.
---
no feature that reduces grind will go through
---
Team up in public teams as well to get the 4x xp
---
This wasn't in, nor near a nuke zone, or an area a nuke had been dropped recently.
---
For shot guns or any other scatter weapons, four leaf clover.
---
If they want to put a nuke somewhere else, they should blast through the silo and launch it themselves.  Nuke wherever you please.
---
lol @ "we dont have the tools"
---
Its a number in a database, its a fancy excel table, of course they can change it.
---
do what you can. Don't stress over it.
---
Ask them. Nobody here can give you a better answer. If you can't get a straight answer from a ticket you could always ask on their forums.
---
it's all intentional by design to increase the grind
---
Didn't work with my TSE combat rifle.

The new raider tree in the event looks like a step in the right direction.
---
Do you know when that is
---
Indeed! Now I'm keeping a shotgun in my stash just in case.
---
I can’t say I know the answer, but I’d give a shot trying to call them to explain the predicament.
---
Hope this all gets solved soon OP!
---
Take my upvote! This is something I never knew. Now to see if I have enough gold.
---
It is the sleeping bonus just a different name and duration.
---
I throw mines on them. That way, at least they can help contribute to my kill count when people try to loot them.
---
where do i find the forums cause i cant find a direct ticket for that
---
The S.C.O.R.E points aren't worth the hassle for me. I am averaging enough points each day without them to reach rank 100. Rank 32 +1150 points is what I need to reach this week to be on schedule.
---
their performance is based on daily logins, that's why
---
My only concern is that it doesn't look like a vending machine.   Which could hurt sales if people only check 3 machines and skip this one.
---
I put a staircase outside the back and put a second floor to act as a inner roof. I also put all wiring there.
---
Ya, me too. Totally forgot.
---
Some better slicked back hair would be nice.  The current ones look terrible and give you a terrible hairline lol.
---
I’d also like if they let you to select multiple hair styles at once to make new ones.  I used a mod on Fallout 4 that added new hairstyles but they were existing styles combined.  The one I liked combined the Slick ‘N Sleazy and either the Anchorage or Asphalt Jungle hairstyles.
---
Some tribal tattoos and face paint would be nice too.  And new facial hair styles, like some braided Viking-like beards.
---
Google.
---
You know, a little more transparency in-game would go a long way.  It would be nice to have put that bullion towards something else haha. Thanks!
---
Yeah, I use it to try and get other team members to join me if I rock up at an event and nobody else is there.
---
Did it yesterday at Line in the Sand. Next thing I know the whole server is there!
---
Can confirm. Also from WV.
---
Valseek, do you know about this [Hold up Vault Boy Meme](https://wompampsupport.azureedge.net/fetchimage?siteId=7575&amp;v=2&amp;jpgQuality=100&amp;width=700&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.kym-cdn.com%2Fentries%2Ficons%2Ffacebook%2F000%2F029%2F433%2Fholdup.jpg) any chance you guys could make it into an emote?
---
[July 23-27](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/55xUO5myjkzlgAewWjzCxl/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-july-updates)
---
That ones definitely gonna be a must for me!
---
This is the real answer... as a heavy guns user you want 1-2 guns (I like gatling gun and .50 cal) for everyday use and then I break out the Gauss and LMG for SBQ/Alpha creature/Colossus/Impostor
---
Time survived is fine as it is imho, but players killed/downed or even "monsters" killed being boosted so its just as valuable. I have no problem if my team\\partner hides in the bushes waiting for somebody to come by then pounces for the kill, grabs their gear, then runs and hides while they sort through the loot and heal up while their red icon from shooting has gone away and anybody coming to hunt us isn't going to ambush us. A mixture of stealth and combat has led to more of my top three finishes than anything else.
---
Or the pip boy?
---
Does this only appear in the bog or can it show up anywhere a nuke is dropped? What’s the chances of getting him to show if you nuke the wendingo cave
---
People do love them. I agree with you though, I loved wiping them out and taking over the prydwen
---
Anything for text chat? It’d really help, especially in Nuclear Winter
---
max Crit Savvy + max 4LC is a great combo 
---
for the cost in points GRS and Psycho dont compare IMO
---
Its like two different experiences. During an event and out of an event. Of course out of an event it takes so long to queue up sometimes..
---
Nearly Nothing in the game works as stated, its a pain, you gotta get 90% of info outside the game. Thank god for angry turtle and his testings.
---
After using explosives/nukes it's so hard to find the corpses.
---
Sleeping with a romantizide partner is the same but 3  hours duration.
---
What is that?  Also how can I find it?  Thanks in advance
---
Throw in four leaf clover to rapidly refill VATS with a shotgun, since each pellet rolls its chance on refilling your crit meter.
---
Any time im going to move camps i move my Vendors onto a single foundation piece then store the rest of the camp (cause a whole camp blueprint never works) leaving just that foundation with the vendors on it. Then i move the camp and that single foundation with the vendors is automatically blueprinted. I can then place it down and move the still stocked vendors where ever they need to be.
---
Dont have a solution to Changing vendor skins and keeping the stock and prices. I also am not looking forward to re-doing that when i buy the new vendor. Still debating on getting just the vendor or the bundle as i kinda want the traincar but 1500 atoms is a lot now we gain less of them.
---
Yesss. I was just about to make a post but found this. It's hit or miss but one thing I've noticed is whenever theres a group of enemies attacking vats becomes useless unless I'm not using the gauss rifle. And same thing, 95% chance and it just shoots right above their head over and over, even wasted criticals thinking it would be a gaurenteed hit, but it isnt and never is lol.
---
Unless you are new there is no way these daily challenges take you more than 15-20min.
---
This. I don’t see why so many people disagree with you. It’s almost like they’re conditioned to think that way.
---
I doubt you actually lost the score.  It’s a visual bug.  Next time record it happening and compare scores before and after. The fact that you’re level 35 leads me to believe that it’s a visual bug as indicated by many different threads.   You just grinded events while losing 3000 score?  I doubt it
---
"It can't be stopped. It's self-sustaining now."
---
Welcome to the club.
---
Need to follow the follow me emote with the finger guns emote. 
---
Otherwise just looks like you're messaging someone nearby.
---
The hunt emote would suffice too. (One with the Rabbit)
---
CST - usually on between 7-12
---
I had a glitch happen once that allowed me to keep a back pack on while in power armor. The back pack stuck out the back. I took screen shots of it lol.
---
FOMO stands for fear of missing out. To give you an example, everything on the atom shop screams FOMO because you're not sure if it'll be your last chance to buy an item. This also applies to the legendary run.
---
thanks for giving me all the tips and all
---
but im not being entitled, this is a bug and they need to patch it and im not entitled by complaining that this bug takes things away from me that it shouldnt
---
yes i know i am rank 35 but i want the thunder pipe skin for the gatling gun :P
---
&gt; but please take a moment to read!
---
you lost them all right there... lol
---
They have a number to call? i thought it was just online?
---
wait what?! are you serious im gonna go try this
---
Yeah, it never applied in the past.
---
There have been several incarnations of the BOS. In Fallout 3 they had some flawed attitudes, but were clearly a force for good. In New Vegas they were small and weak because despite their tech, they closed themselves off. In 4, they were somewhere between fascists and feudal lords—but because they had the coolest gear and many players don’t really pay close attention to the lore, they were still a favorite. 
---
The Appalachia BOS—the dead ones—didn’t seem to have espoused any of the later chapters’ bigotry and were mostly a good faction, just flawed in their military first thinking. Holotapes featuring Maxson indicate that he didn’t really want the BOS to be isolationists. He wanted them to help people while also securing technology. 
---
We don’t know what to expect from this new BOS. We know from prior lore that there was infighting in the early BOS, with some members (who eventually go their way) who wanted to isolate from the outside world. There are interesting things they could do here, so I’m looking forward to it.
---
Unlikely to be removed.
---
All ive been doing is googling lol n watching videos but none give a straight answer
---
It probably got stuck or something.   It happens often enough and when it happens in bulk with tons of plants, it's free flux without the rads.
---
It typically happens just as a nuke fades though.
---
We paid for and bought a copy of a game. We can complain if we want. It’s not being “entitled”
---
I'm a die hard bush wookie (well actually I die pretty easily in nothing but a ghillie suit) and I won't play teams because it screws the other players to be down a man. I tried playing correctly but I'm very bad at pvp and I'm always, always the first to die on my teams. Switched over to bush wookie and only play with full teams off. Even without the aid of 3 less people shooting at me I can make top 10 about 90% of the time and top five about 50% of that. Hell, I've got two wins so far. Although I suppose the storm and the scorched got the wins since most rounds I never fire a shot and half the time I don't even have weapons. 
---
It's actually a lot of fun to play extreme hide and seek as long as I'm not screwing anyone else.
---
I'll keep that in mind!
---
Just buy the serum from a player's vendor. Hoping for a random mutation isn't very effective.
---
I didnt think it was possible.. and they arent even here yet.. but I hate them even more than the raiders/settlers already..
---
I can only hope that the game allows many more of them to be shot in the face to death than it does for the other groups..
---
I’m not sure it’s completely fixed ... Forager glitched on me immediately after Patch 20. Scrapped and replaced his chair, still glitched. Replaced with Raider Punk, and two days he wouldn’t give a quest. Removed all allies from my camp. Waited a couple of days, then tried Wanderer. The next day, she gave me the quests. Under patch 19, this glitch hit me and I happened upon a weapons case in the wild, which completed an ally quest I didn’t know I had and this reset the clock. So my theory is that there is a bug where the allies skip the quest offering and go into a waiting pattern, but there is no way for the player to know where to go to complete the quest.
---
Player vendors.  Alternatively if you're on xbox i can make them for you.
---
Its my sun..        ( ﾉ ﾟｰﾟ)ﾉ    ☼
---
It is not boosted sadly, tested it. Cranberry cobbler is strictly better there, and not tied to an event.
---
I can confirm the broiled brain and tasty squirrel stew do give what you wrote and canned meat stew from feed the people can be a good alternative for us carnivores as it gives 12-13% more XP (not sure what number is correct as it says 13 in the aid section but says 12 when in look in the pip boy)
---
The grinding I have no issues with. The timegating I do.
---
Also, remember that Reddit has a search function. I don’t want to stay away from this sub for week again because every post for half an hour is exactly the same.
---
well if it happens again it's your fault and you can't say I didn't warn you not to run with scissors whilst the stove is hot. :)
---
Your head can be crippled just like in the other games, yes.
---
I found this post when I was struggling with the same issue, and now I’ve found the solution I’m coming back to let you know. That door isn’t a diner door, it’s a train carriage door for the train carriage you now have in your misc section! I didn’t even realise it was a part of the slocum bundle. But there you go!
---
And I offer the same for PC.
---
I sell muscle and marsupial. Ps4
---
People who cannot defend themselves and love to live under the boot of the brotherhood will welcome them.  The Free States will fight them to the death.
---
Okay so 50% limb damage effect stack with the regular headshot damage bonus?
---
Good tips, running a nuke is less XP/hr sadly, especially since the nuke zone is limited in spawns. I ran whitesprings in full SS armor UNY. I surivived on radaway and radx diluted but it was 16 rads/s which was rough. I ran rad spong 2 in my team shared which helped but still had to chug nearly 20 radaway for the run. Won't do that again. Burrows would have been better yea, but the respawn times I haven't gotten down yet for the internal areas. Outdoors seem to respawn faster.
---
I’m glad I’m not the only one who dislikes the BOS
---
Can you post a pic of that?
---
nope you get them in the same order and after you hit you get xp requirement.
---
I ignore all NW challenges. Based on what I hear with bugs and SCORE Auto complete bugs I'm not touching it. I never have and it's sad to see Bethesda trying to force me to play NW.
---
Preferably not a flake because he got stuff he needs doin.
---
Ah I forgot about that. Ty. Corrected the post now with sleepy math. Hopefully more accurate
---
As in they don’t show up as workshops on the map and you can’t see what resources are available, and fast travel to them appears take caps (but doesn’t actually, just a visual glitch)? Yes
---
I’m going Slocum Joe’s, but that’s me.
---
Yes okay just wanted to make sure it wasn't just me.
---
There seems to be a bug where if you dont get your gold from him between reset time (Late Saturday I believe) and the Tuesday refresh, you can't get any from him until the next refresh.
---
Don't talk to him for a week from now, that'll fix him.
---
100% agree on big batches. I do a run to get about 20 of each, and it lasts me nearly a week of play time on a guy with rank 3 good with salt. My cranberries from last week are just starting to spoil now. Thanks for the tips though, mostly wanted to make sure i missed nothing on the runs.
---
The display on the map is bugged, but I think they are working as normal :)  I've heard that the bug occurs when switching servers.
---
I remember last time after 3 days everyone was bored with it and no one showed up at events which made it tougher for 1-2 people to succesfully complete it. The fun part is the cookout everyone showed up for that I think probably we all like to listen to grahm sing the meat song. This time they should bring Gale to the cookout as his date lol
---
Cool thanks just wanted to make sure it wasn't just me lol
---
It’s only active as long as you don’t die on the next server. Once you die it goes back to normal. Seeing that we are running bloody it never lasts long.
---
Can’t say for certain but I encountered one daily that autocompleted during the loading screen.  I also saw my associated score up to in the loading screen.  It’s very possible that due to load times it doesn’t display or is overlooked.  Without really recording or writing down your score, it’s hard to say either way.   But I have read this on reddit and Steam that it is in fact a visual bug 
---
My point was, you’ve managed to grind to level 35.  That extra score I’m sure was part of it.  If it wasn’t, well, then you’ll be fine anyway
---
well known bug.
---
as a workaround, from what I've read around here, if you avoid going into the wayward until the next week, it should reset properly. I only go in on Sundays after dailies reset and have not had this problem yet.
---
Buy them from players. Pay no more than 300 caps per serum.
---
Yeah. They have a plethora of issues now for no reason other than the usual new patch breaking old systems that worked fine before
---
Where do you live? In “savage” divide?? *wink*
---
yea ill use your tips to avoid this until todd gets of his arse and patches it
---
thanks for the tips!
---
I did all my mutations at the mine just east of The Whitesprings, but that’s because it has a decontamination shower. Take off Starched Genes, run down, get mutated, put on Starched Genes, get rid of the rads, and be on my way. Central and easy to get to, quick irradiation, and the miners are pretty easy to sneak past. Took me a little while to get them, but I believe I have all of the mutations (except for Herbivore).
---
Shoot that crate.
---
Only way I could want to kill page more is dress him up in some t60.
---
my module rolls are so dismal that these days i only grab 2 modules and roll one 3\* weapon.  I figure the chances are just as good that the 3\* might net me something tradeable where as the modules only produce more daily scrip.  Been rolling daily for a month on SS armor without a single decent piece.  So many 1 and 2\* crap on top of shit 3\*.  With module rolls so bad they should guarntee it at least be 3\*.
---
&gt; they will break the dailies so you can do them but they reward you atoms instead of score.
---
That's all it would take to make me start playing the game again.
---
hate it.. Signed
---
please make it go away.. lol
---
I'm with you, my biggest issue with the Brotherhood was always their unreasonable hatred of Ghouls, Supermutants, Synths, anything not human even if they're friendly.
---
The Brotherhood in Appalachia completely wiped out a colony of non-feral friendly Ghouls trying to live peacefully in the Valley Galleria, purely because they existed
---
That mindset alone makes me hate them.
---
On top of that, they claim to be gathering technological intelligence in order to advance humanity. But they're really just hoarding it in an attempt to retain power for themselves. If they really wanted to advance humanity they would spread the technology far and wide.
---
They would want people to have it so that they could better their own homes and settlements, all of them eventually coming together to better the world
---
Throw away all your stashed notes and holotapes and anything else that doesn't have an actual use. Clearing up room in your stash box removes a lot of the lag and issues with inventory management.
---
So apparently 8 others decided to spawn at the same place as me to unlock a well known safe.. lol.. we all died because some else spawned next to us where there's a big loot box and killed us all..
---
me too. F
---
Hmm. Okay.
---
Ahhhhh good old Bethesda always there for me
---
It's mind-boggling that they haven't implemented this yet.
---
I hit lvl 25 last night, always teamed, herd mentality, well rested, cran relish or tasty squirrel stew, lunchboxes, well tuned, inspirational strange in numbers full unyielding armor etc etc
---
works with fleechette (don't know the spelling) harpoons
---
Awwww that's a bummer, really trying to complete a diner look between the Solcum Joe's and Red Rocket stuff and that would have been a perfect door to the kitchen area.
---
Like people are saying. Buy the serums. most people do them for under 400. 
---
I did it the old one on my alt which used to be my main and it's an absolute pain. Buying serums is the best and easiest way. And make sure you get herd mentality as it boosts your specials even if you're in a public team by yourself. And with class freak 3 there's no negative effects (usually)
---
I made the mistake last month, with the mothman stuff, of buying bits I wanted individually. Until I got to the bundle, and saw I bought everything but the smoke machine already and the smoke machine was the only thing I really wanted. And I was not going to pay 1600 atoms for one item.
---
So I learned my lesson and I blight the slocum's bundle. Still to think of how to put it all to use but i put the vendors in straight away!
---
I always find the same locked containers. Doesn't seem randomized at all.
---
i wanted the responder vendor bot but a man needed a hero..
---
No sorry. I too dumb for that. Not joking. But just make a seconds floor then you put roof parts on it like the second floor isnt there. In between the upper floor and roof theres some space for connectors. It does require a a permanent staircase somewhere to connect everything tho
---
oooo so that's why I finished that one so quickly... 
---
I could not figure out how I had 25 crits so fast.
---
Misogynistic?
---
The previous Paladin in Appalachia was a woman and the one leading the new expeditionary force is a woman.
---
So I have 14P in adventure and 130+ card packs in NW. Do I just have to open card packs until I get picklock?
---
The limb damage "isn't supposed to" actually increase the damage output of your weapon.  The 50% is supposed to just allow you to cripple the enemies limbs faster which helps immobilize or handicap them.
---
I'm saying "supposed to" because there are various bugged weapon effect combinations where it absolutely does increase damage output.
---
You can spend Overseer Tickets (obtained from opening duplicate perk packs in NW) to buy Picklock directly.
---
Thanks.
---
I blew 30 modules hoping to get one unyielding right arm, believe it or not, not a single one, it's quite underwhelming, and the saddest part is..I can easily see bloodied builds being nerfed, so I'm probably going to get shafted anyway.
---
Right, but the Cobbler is Herbivore not Carnivore. Did you test the Canned Meat Stew with Carnivore?
---
I appreciate the testing and data collection  you've done so far btw.
---
Yes but if you open a pack and already have the card it auto scraps into Overseer tickets which you can use in the perk card menu to purchase cards you don’t have.
---
Yep, annoying when you are still in battle. It’s like having your hood fly open while driving on the freeway
---
Google 'Bethesda forums'
---
I didn't think of that good idea
---
It's not a rush man, I'll actually be out of town for a few days. I'll add you though, my psn is MyLittleShadow
---
They’ve messed the perk up since the release of Update 20, hoping to get a hotfix for it soon 👍🏻
---
Monstrosities/boycott ...why, I don't get it?
---
That makes sense. Because I see a high increase in damage with this new weapon. But can’t compare it to another weapon without the effect really. At least I can’t figure it out atm. 
---
But thanks for this
---
yes its not considered meat apparently. Some are claiming it does boost to 10% (13% with strange in numbers) but that would have to have been added in the last patch 20 then. I have tested since that patch.
---
&gt; If you played for atoms, you were already grinding mindlessly,
---
Nope. I'm a super-casual player, but being able to earn 20-50 Atoms a day while doing the faction quests made me actually *want* to log in every day. Now Atoms are gated behind the season pass, and it makes me want to not play at all.
---
Drop in at Monogah Mine there is a safe in one of the trailers.
---
On my first launch on a private server, after killing the queen I always go to the forest to farm flux and I stumbled on him by accident. Managed to solo him in 3-5 min. He is easier than the Queen.
---
Actually, getting the prime receiver is the most efficient way to use the minigun. It's just not the type of weapon you bring out for everything. Tis why I have my B/FFR Gatling Gun as my main weapon and bring out the Gauss for the bullet sponges.
---
I appreciate the confirmation, canned meat stew is apparently a new addition to "meat" category as is used to receive no buffs from carno. I'll add the note on that
---
Nice. Been sitting on 1k scrip and just buying modules from time to time waiting for this sale lol
---
Yeah it's supposed to be a 50 percent increase to the "limb condition health bar".  I have a few heavies though where the effect makes the gun able to kill the scorchbeast queen in seconds.  If you currently have something similar going on enjoy it while it lasts, it's supposed to be fixed soon (though knowing Bethesda something else will end up broken by the fix most likely lol)
---
Ok, I think I will try that for just something different. I like the idea of putting wires in there also.
---
We asked for a atom shop before but Bethesda gave us a button and a cardboard vaultboy instead that went to the atom shop  when clicked on it
---
It was a bit pointless as all we had to do is go to the menu to click on the atom shop
---
lol why can’t you just farm your own junk?
---
Picklock is a card you start with in NW...
---
Orchard is a good spot for locks in flatwoods.  Ingram mansion, or the “bank” in Morgantown are also good, though roof is where you want to go in Morgantown.
---
Yeah, dont know why we'd get totally naked just to jump on PA...?
---
Well, for stretch armstrong, no... but vault dwellers, maybe
---
&gt;those last I don't care about
---
You cared enough to write a post about it.
---
Cus you have slow connection
---
I tried that, I remember trying it last night but nothing happens when I do it. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I'm having the same problem. Anyone found a fix or a workaround?
---
She's in the same studio as Mr. New Vegas.
---
https://youtu.be/7_UhUQcsYr4
---
Upstairs in Ingram mansion
---
That's not as fun and I did that a bunch. I was mostly jk. I didnt really put much thought into trap camps until I see they patched the punji board stack thing which I never got a chance to try. Jw if their is something that is effective and not a waste of time building it
---
Keep your distance while the bells ring...
---
I think I'll sit this one out. I only need to do 2 more NW things and I really can't be arsed with picking locks honestly. I never join NW and just idle or die instantly and fuck my team, I lways play it out, but I honestly don't fully grasp the card and perk system in NW or how you go about it.
---
I love this.. signed. Fookayoua
---
Yo the whole game is broken.
---
Keep your eyes peeled for Mr. Veterinarian.  He travels with a bunch of cats.
---
You don’t need to do that for your weekly three. Just place your camp like a 10 times and take 10 pictures. They satisfy the requirement if they are something you didn’t accomplish already.
---
If Flatwoods ever gets selected. Also The locked fertilizer bins at the Ag Center.
---
Pretty sure Gunsmith is fucked also, had to repair my Gauss shotgun twice in 2 days, went weeks without doing so previously...
---
Idk, the mod works pretty good for me. I's rather go through the minor trouble of installing it than waiting for bethesda to implement it in a year
---
Same here, sadly it was broken cause it helped a lot with my damage output.
---
Some quests don’t have exact markers for some reason, like when I select show on map, they don’t do anything at all, Id suggest trying to show on map for the dailies that have specific set locations
---
The atom one was trigged usually if you were in NW before coming to adventure at the reset. After identifying that and avoiding that situation I was good.  I figured it would be the same but now we have to figure out a new set of circumstances
---
Thanks I think I remember there’s one on the the gorge bridge for flatwoods
---
Thanks! ign? I'll swing by. I'm c4\_
---
Fallout 1st
---
Da crap
---
Morgentown airport have a few (like one at the airplane cockpit). Many player spawn there, so you have to be fast.
---
Cheers I didn't know of any there 👍
---
Exactly. Today’s is a double Perception test.
---
Thanks for additional claim to validate. I'll happily admit I'm wrong for the sake of science. Patch 20 is OP apparently.
---
ngl, I'd go for the free kills as well. That mode is haaarrrrrrd
---
Pretty sure and sad 😢
---
How about you play the game and collect your own stuff it's more fun that way,plus people won't sling negative shit your way!
---
Oh yeah it's viable. I've been running a Gauss shotgun for the last awhile and it's freaking amazing. I suggest a back up weapon for SB's though.... The shotgun is inconsistent with them.
---
But the real question is, do modules get discounted 0\_0
---
Danm, kinda sad
---
Can confirm, hoping its different come patch 20
---
Ah yea that's lame, whatever it is I was talking about an option to see the clothes on like a walk in warddrobe or something
---
Its simple, you just stop playing 76 and go back to ARK. Trap camps are the epitome of scumbag laziness.
---
Yeah it is I’ve also noticed, I did a test of shooting a certain amount of mags with my handmade with the card on then without and it was the same.
---
I agree
---
is that per character? or is it per account? ive done the picture thing already for card packs. camp i dont think ive done it.
---
"new players that they can put specials from any category into any category as long as they have enough points"
---
wait, what... so i could put a luck card in strength?
---
I level 60+ and never knew that - granetd 90% of that is hiding in bushes while making dinner, but still...
---
Im thinking since i got the quad explosive double barrel today and i just want to fuck shit up with it
---
Sure they *could*. The question is will they?
---
Damn sad luck. Too me about 50 rolls to get my full set. Just want to get Uny with INT on it now for leveling to the max.
---
NO WAY! I WILL NOT LET YOU BUILD SOME TRASHY CAMP DOWN THE ROAD FROM ME THAT WILL BRING DOWN MY PROPERTY VALUE! I WILL ABSOLUTELY FILE A COMPLAINT WITH THE VAULT TEC HOA!
---
to date it has not, hoping patch 20 changes this but we can only hope...with 3 characters saved to max scrip I'm crossing fingers here that 1000 worth modules and 2000 worth weapons nets me SOMETHING great
---
Hides them all very well.
---
Oh, phew, alright. I’ve not had a chance to build with it yet and thought they may have left the counters out of the bundle deal, because Bethesda be like that sometimes.
---
You are indeed blessed by Atom's glow.
---
We you blocked me because you knew you couldn’t scam me smh
---
gather as much steel as possible early, if you can get 100 or so by level 5 that is ok, more is better. The best way to do this is by grabbing every gun off every enemy and taking them to a work table to scrap.
---
As soon as you get to an armor workbench bulk craft as many level 1 light leather arms as possible to then immediately scrap. They cost 1 leather, 1 cloth, and two steel, and when scrapped you get back 1l/1c/1s (until you get a perk later), so it will drain steel is the reason it is a priority. 
---
When you scrap a piece of armor you have a chance to unlock a mod for that armor's set, so by scrapping all of these arms you can unlock leather armor mods quickly, and not just arm mods, but also torso and leg mods. The most important mods are studded on all three pieces (arm and leg mods don't differentiate between left or right), and padded torso to resist explosions (dense is better version of this, but I believe you can't get that one by scrapping)
---
After that one thing you will want to invest in buying is the plans for heavy leather, most vendor bots found around the world at train stations and such stock these plans, and they only cost a couple hundred caps.
---
A full suit of modded studded heavy leather armor, even only the level one version will cut the amount of damage you take, even from mobs much level higher than you by an enormous amount (50-70%), and can be easily gotten by level 4 if you can get a hold on the steel to do so.
---
As a side effect of scrapping weapons on mass you will also get a lot of plans for weapon mods.
---
To make money to buy plans and stuff it's really just a matter of picking up a whole lot of stuff to sell, weapons and armor from enemies works, and selling any materials you don't need will get you there steadily.
---
Thanks for the confirmation!
---
you’re better off asking a community that isn’t constantly bitching about camp traps
---
free scrapbox and tent with it though
---
Line in the sand is a great one now with the spawn glitch (if you know how to trigger it) I always go to this event with a tesla rifle now
---
It's under the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. tab in the featured category.
---
Yup, those are exclusive to fallout first. My advice, if you ever consider buying atoms, just buy one month of 1st instead. You still get the atoms, and you’ll also get the emotes, scrap box, survival tent, and some extras (armor skins and outfits). Then just cancel 1st and you still keep the emotes, outfits, skins. You get to keep the scrap box too but just can’t place any new junk inside it
---
The guy I waited on was there for probably 20 minutes- but it felt like forever. He eventually got on with his day lol it was one of those situations where you spent the caps to get there and you can't decide if it's worth it to move on or not. 
---
But it would be interesting to find out if someone who glitches out like that is still "using" the object.
---
honestly a really impressive look that my friend. Unique for sure from what I've seen and I'd definitely give you a thumbs up if you turned up rocking that.
---
Yet ANOTHER currency we have to manage to edit legendary perks.
---
Actually it does. Me and one other teammate won because i hid in a bush the entire time.
---
My judgement came from a friend who got the glowing skeleton costume, then the Xmas presents, then the Halloween combat rifle skin in that order in like 7 matches. Might be another bug on top maybe be it does seem people get the rewards out of order and randomly, even if most people get them in order.
---
Awesome lmao
---
They are great I remember running one I can probably make a nukesdragon build if you want an link it. You can change what you want.
---
This is why Bethesda should add more bloody content to FO1st
---
Yes, but I thought their official position is that women aren't capable of being Paladins, only scribes.  The Appalachian woman (Lieutenant Taggerdy?) was an inductee from outside the BoS.
---
Dude! Wow thanks a ton! I’m obsessive about fashion in this game (for some reason???) so that actually made my day!
---
I think most people just ASSUME that the people wanting changes to the season are wanting to get something for nothing, when in reality these players asking for changes probably put just as much time into the game as the person telling them to stop acting entitled. The only difference is instead of playing everyday for 30 minutes, they play for hours on end a few (if not most) days of the week. If it wasn't for the timegating, the person who plays almost everyday and quite possibly LONGER than the people who call them entitled and tell them to stop whining would easily get the rewards.  
---
\*That isn't even taking into account the many people getting screwed over by the autocomplete bug. SO many people still tell them its their own fault and to stop logging in at reset or to not play Nuclear Winter first thing. I have talked to people who know this and do this trying to avoid the bug, yet STILL somehow have had their dailies autocomplete somehow. There are other minor ways besides those major two that are causing this bug that we still don't fully understand. Why should their reward for discovering those minor ways the bug is happening be NOT getting the rewards they were grinding for?
---
\*\*So the solution I keep saying is to extend the season by a week, two weeks, a month, whatever. The people who aren't grinding to get the rewards are still not going to get the rewards, that doesn't change so people can stop claiming that changing things is going to be giving everybody something for free. An extra week or two though will make up for the fact that this autocomplete bug will likely not be fixed so the people who have been effected can make up for the missed days that they had taken away from them at no fault of their own. This would also allow the players I mentioned before who do play almost every day and likely spend even more time online than others to finish the event or at least get farther, so the arguing that we keep seeing will finally start to calm down a bit. Once again this does NOT give rewards to people who aren't even trying or aren't grinding most days. It helps those who are negatively impacted by a bug as well, as those who are getting burnt out like the OP by having to log in every single day, and helps those dedicated players who play maybe 5 or even 6 days a week because that is what their schedule allows.  
---
P.S.&gt; If you are against this idea just take a moment to consider what would happen if the autocomplete bug starts hitting you multiple days in a row when you think you are doing everything right? Take into consideration that for some reason it seems to be hitting some people more often than others too. It might not have happened to you yet, but it might later on. How would you feel to have grinded all that time every day and fall short at the end because of a bug? Is an extra week for the season really the end of the world?
---
Would like that link :)
---
May or may not steal this idea...
---
Seems crazy because the prefab eat 4x the budget of what it cost to make with walls an foundations.
---
Ok give me a second I’ll have to remake it shouldn’t take more than a minute.
---
works the same as a grenade, equip it in your weapons menu and then hold your melee button to throw one
---
lmfao i love it
---
Nice! I did a bunch of XXXXX's so it's just "Have a Day".
---
No rush man! Take your time
---
K
---
Thank you I'll have to look again.
---
Its free
---
Look at your weapons... they are considered as grenades.
---
That is certainly a fuck shit up gun.
---
I think I'm happier about ammo converter interface goaled to be fixed for patch 21 (stated in comments)
---
You have 7 slots.
---
The perk cards have costs.
---
You cant have the cost of (example) strength cards be more than your strength S.P
---
E.C.I.A.L
---
You cant have more than 7 cards.
---
So for example I run 2 x strength cards (walking arsenal, extra shotgun damage), 1x perception (extra auto rifle damage), 3 x intelligence cards (hacker, demo expert, first aid) 1x luck (bloody mess)
---
The “DLC” is really just an update to the base game, so it’s free for everyone who owns it.
---
Agree fully. Been running scout armor forever and its nice it got some attention even though its ugly. Hopefully with it being so prevalent in NW it gets more skins.
---
Hahah its good without any perks but i just want to kill everything before i equip my weapon
---
Nothing wrong with that, seems many people are and I kinda like seeking things out and changing my outfits but I go about it rather haphazardly which I guess reflects my personality :D 
---
No harm in taking pleasure in it and I like your work personally.
---
The Ag Center in Flatwoods in the greenhouses the fertilizer bins.
---
Alternatively, put something on the vending machine - frog jar, potted plant, lettering, etc - when you move the vending machine will blueprint to that if it isn't on a foundation.
---
&gt; despite their tech, they closed themselv
---
I came late to the franchise, so I mostly know them from Fallout 4.  Thanks for the history lesson!
---
Wow, i'm an idiot, i assumed it was one card per SPECIAL.
---
Guess it shows how little i actually PLAY this mode though :-/
---
Please don't tell me what to do! I paid for this shit and I'll play however I feel like playing
---
Monogah Mine has a safe and a computer in one of the trailers.
---
This is the weirdest job I’ve ever been employed for. Still waiting for a paycheck.
---
Nathan_TK
---
I too am Interested.
---
I'm using mods and i can't play NW
---
It's a game. How is one method "lazy" and the other isn't
---
Best Faction evaaaaaaar!
---
nice!!!!
---
Then what the hell is he there for? Do you get better rewards or more rewards if your infront of him, there's no way to keep up, my Zora is halfway through already.
---
I thought the Atomic skin was ugly at first because my favorite color is black, but it grew on me. Can’t wait to finally get the ghillie skin from seasons.
---
The reset I believe is noon eastern.  Due to work I'm never on until after 6pm eastern, and since beta, never on around the reset.  I  only had it happen to my atoms twice though.  Im shocked that with the previous atom bugs being in the game for so long, that the bug resurfaced after they changed the system from atoms to score and changed the challenges all together.
---
I did notice though that the ones that didn't reset, were the same type of challenge as one I completed last week, the ones that did not bug out were ones I did not have last week (which if I remember correctly was like the atom bugged ones).
---
I have a perception build which is primarily a stealth commando junkie, but swap out for rifleman and bows when I wanna switch it up. Nearly finished levelling up an alt that is pure strength so I can switch between shotgun, heavy guns and melee when I see fit. Been enjoying it so far and looking forward to Gauss shotgun, but built up a stash of junkies heavies to switch up for SBQ. Very fun so far!
---
Well leson learned don't unlock any score items when you have your mule selected. Because that's where they went. :(
---
Thank you! I was a bit woried after seing that he was 15 euro on google
---
I needed this as a Heavy Gun PA wastelander,  thank you!
---
Honestly, seventy was just an estimation. I’m not really sure how many I used tbh.
---
Thank you again! I guess so haha. I’m an artist in the real world so perhaps that’s bleeding into my fallout world. Oh well, we can just continue to enjoy our work even if it might be a little silly :P
---
K so it’s not the tankiest build but I remember being able to one shot most everything.
---
i really want to them add it but after seeing how they handled legendary perks im sure its gonna be this Big Confusing Convoluted way to change points and cards.   and then it will take 4 months for them to fix it if we are lucky
---
Thanks!I had doubt since i saw it 15 bucks on google (has said into my previous comment)
---
K thanks
---
I think I have 120 perk level-ups saved, but the hassle of going through and rearranging my special stats and having to pick out the missing perks that I don't have is worse than redoing your camp, setting up the vendors again, and inventory management.

---
Gave me the runs. The Brotherhood are fun but they are also arrogant, condescending, self-justifying assholes. Occasionally they live up to their own ideals.
---
I think they're a good organization that fell to the iron law of oligarchy.
---
u/LoneVaultWanderer
---
Ah you said to tag ya for suggestions right? What do you think of this one?
---
This!
---
You can take 5 minutes to make a post asking the same thing 30 people posted in the last hour or you can take 2 minutes to check the new post feed or use the search bar
---
ok i made new guy ran into NW, did the spam 10 photomode pictures and put camp down 10 times and it worked, thanks.. you save me wasting some time in NW
---
Thanks alot man!
---
Yeah but wouldn't the 150 be if I went from 1-100 paying for it?
---
I already have one shotgun build going but I def am gon a check this out.
---
Thats not uncommon at first glance - after all theres 7 cards, 7 S.P.E.C.I.A.L, and the default loadout is 1 of each type.
---
But yeah, if you can make some nice builds, or you can make some very specialised builds (rifleman + tank killer makes a powerful sniper)
---
Np man I hope it helps you like it did me. I had to go back through my screenshots to find it
---
added!
---
less chaffing in the groin, I assume
---
how bout u just pvp and not be that trap camp simp lmao
---
It sure will! I will peobably switch the sneak off since im allready a sneak build and want something different
---
Cool I hope you like the build like I did
---
Basically if your pve build has 7 luck and there was say 7 card that cost 1 luck each, you could place all of them at once cause you'd have enough luck and slots.
---
there's no S.P.E.C.I.A.L categories like in pve, only how much of each special you have and how much a card costs.
---
Wonder what they will think of the people in the enclave who launch nukes every day for shits and giggles.
---
Ah ok that’s cool
---
Yep. This is how you do it. I’m just lazy and hate muling. 
---
Also did not know this about the ally quest. Thanks!
---
Yeah I get 7.5 with strange in numbers helping my mutations be buffed
---
It has a strange name, something firework mine.
---
I got it.  RIP Delores.
---
Yea, forgot about those, cause the moment i made it to raider ammo machine i gave up on those... im still under ally in settlers cause of how tedious it all is...
---
Trap bases are toxic and no one likes them
---
Yeah thanks for the advice my next Question would have been if i can still get them by buying first, but ye this is obsolete now. I think i will buy one month then. Thanks guys.
---
Good for you. But it doesn’t matter if it works for you or not. I use QoL mods as well but the point is they don’t want to use mods.
---
Ahh that explains why I got through it so fast now. Haha, felt like I'd only pushed the crit button once or twice before it dinged.
---
Pair it with the Marsupial mutation and you're golden. If they ever nerf those two things, I'll quit the game. I can't go back to regular pleb jumping.
---
There are more ways for the autocomplete bug to take place than just what you mentioned.. Its been talked about before that its happening to others who are doing exactly what you just said. So to blame him still for it happening even if he is doing what you said is completely off base. For some reason its also happening to the same people more often too. Also, heck if I was rank 35 I'd still want my points too just so I could be done when I SHOULD be done so I could take a break that much sooner and not be as burnt out before the NEXT season arrives..
---
Agreed!
---
Wonder if it would work on fast firing weapons like that Gauss Minigun, LMG and the 50cal....
---
Not bad ;)
---
Yup. Can't wait to dump all my 40mm grenade rounds in there, I just had to ask him.
---
My friend has done 50+ nukes and havent got the Wendigo Collilusus to spawn.
---
the public team system would of worked well with vault 94.       Even if it was bugged to hell it cannot be any worse then what we deal with now.
---
Damn I never thought to add up the cost of all the SS armor with mods and underarmor, I can't believe I earned all of that. I'll get the last piece, the useless helmet, in a few days. Nothing else interests me but I wish the helmet gave you airborne and waterborne disease protection.
---
I noticed that. Also, I have to pay to fast travel there even if I own the workshop. Seems off. Not sure why.
---
Yeah it is it helped my heavy gunner hit for at times over 700.
---
Alrighty. I am on right now and will be for a while probably.
---
For running around and hiding lol yeah
---
Anything that requires actually playing NW the right way would be greatly frowned upon. I'm level 38 in NW and only have 6 kills in total all in the first week of playing it last year when it first came out. Let me bush wookie for 30 minutes, or place camps or pick locks, but please don't make me actually try.
---
Least popular answer but also quickest: Buy some atom.
---
To add to this: if you build your camp near water and find industrial purifier plan you can clear a vendor bots cap limit just by selling purified water. 
---
I use hard bargain so ymmv?
---
Marine Wetsuit prevents the waterborne, and that can go under this.
---
&gt;These are all things you might already do regularly during your normal play sessions,
---
The keyword there is MIGHT
---
Some people like it.  It is okay that you do not.  They can give both sides challenges.
---
How do you get the stuff from one character to another on the same account?
---
This! I got lucky and found a few for 0. 
---
I doubt they'll be rare unless they get removed from the loot pool next year.
---
I've seen a few who like them but yeah its scummy af,  though I love trolling trappers and getting to their vendors anyway
---
That seems pretty weird to me. Why would people not want to install mods which offer the only solution to their problem. You also won't get banned for them.
---
Rusty Pick icon has changed also...
---
They didn't patch Ward's auto-complete glitch. It stills works for me everyday even though it's only once. I've done it everyday since Wastelanders dropped and I've never actually done the quest. I got lucky and found an item before ever visiting Foundation.
---
Yeah boyhood is cool
---
Just pay for a month of fallout 1st and the moth man and robot dance emote are yours to keep
---
I know this is a joke post, but only in a game like Fallout 76 can I read the phrase "I targeted a nuclear warhead at my friend's house on accident" and NOT do a double take.
---
Unless your useing a guass shotgun they arnt viable and the gauss is only viable till they fix all of the damage bugs
---
I see you didn't notice my /s :P
---
You want the benefit without the look right?
---
They were horrible emersion breaking eyesores. There is a button on the map to go to the shop.
---
Is there a way to see progress toward that btw?
---
Quad explo does the job atleast for now
---
No problem.
---
It’s just artwork. The season is 10 weeks long regardless.
---
And, no one forced you to play it.
---
Devil’s advocate; what if I like NW? If there were no challenges for it, it would be like every minute spent playing it was a waste of time when it comes to SCORE. 
---
If you don’t like NW, nobody is forcing you to play it. If you do, you get some more SCORE. I know that in the 30 minutes it usually takes to get the NW challenge done I can easily knock out 3X the repeatable XP challenge, which would be worth more anyway. Do what you like, play what you want, nobody’s forcing anyone to do anything.
---
It is good against everything that isn't The sbq, oh and the terrible damage dropnoff
---
I never play it, not even for score. If I’m gonna play battle Royale it’ll be pubg or warzone.
---
anything that sells well returns.. they know a winner when they see one...
---
Wendigo Colossus! Next update (I think?) they're adding an event based around it but as for now there's a low chance that it'll spawn in nuke zones. I found him after the SBQ in Overgrown Sundew Grove. Happy hunting!
---
That's exactly what this post is about. There are challenges forcing me to play it.
---
I would join them even if it’s just for the XP and fast travel availability, you could even just set your own too, good ones are building that gives intelligence boost or exploration. Plus you get caps and XP for every team member that completes a quest too.
---
You look awesome! I have to say......I am jealous of the mask because I suck SO HARD at NW! Great look!
---
I get that, but that's not what Im asking for
---
Wait what do you need explaining? They tell you how perks work the first time you log in IIRC
---
Member when cosmetics like horse armor only costed a mere $2.50? Tegridy members..
---
I forget his name but the caravan guard with a mask during the riding shotgun event. There are several pairs but the gas mask guy is hilariously dark.
---
Wait theres a free sign?
---
Although the ATX is the more likely route... I would appreciate if they just gave them to us. Fallout 4's settlement content should have been included anyway
---
Maybe a Raiders vs Settlers season that brings back Fallout 4 settlement content. A concrete bundle, metal bundle, Nuka World &amp; Far Harbor bundles, CC items, etc.
---
Unfortunately not :/ it’s a bug so it’s a bit wonky. The best bet is using the rewards themselves as indicators. From my understanding, the Halloween rewards stack and the winter rewards do not.
---
Once you get to the jack o lantern combat armor you’re halfway there. Then after that, once you get the beanie you’re literally right there. Good luck!
---
Others are right: It's under Resources, same place resource collectors would appear (if your camp or workshop has resource nodes).
---
As far as the interface is concerned, remember you can use the "back" function (Tab if you're PC, but it should be prompted onscreen).  You don't have to circle all the way through the menu selections again.  Just hop back one screen if you want to repeat a transaction- your last selection will even still be highlighted and ready to select again(if it's still available).  
---
It's still a bit irksome to have to turn in your bullets a handful at a time, but tabbing back reduces that to two operations instead of six or seven per use.
---
I’m bias because the Brotherhood are jerks in other fallout games. Especially NV. It is interesting however to see how the factions like the Brotherhood and the Raiders originally started out decent. I am very interested to play the Brotherhood story line later this year.
---
Honestly, it brought me back to playing, but that's mostly because of Public Teams.
---
Like a lot of people have been saying, even before seasons, the focus should be on Weeklies and not Dailies, so it's a lot more lenient for players that can't play every single day, and will help to prevent burnout.
---
If you wanna grind out your weeklies in one big day? Awesome!
---
Wanna stretch it out all week? Totally cool!
---
True true, haven't tryed sbq yet with it. Ill buy the gauss shotgun for backup
---
best way is to get a pal to hold stuff for you. Safest way.
---
Drop in any building. Most have one
---
Because there’s still the risk of it messing up your game and since it’s a multiplayer, definitely more prone to not being able to have it run correctly. Given that the base game is already so poorly optimized, you can’t fault people for that.
---
And then there’s also the fact that some people just don’t want to have to use mods.
---
You need at least one friend, but they don't have to do anything.
---
If they are fallout first, put in world container and swap over to the guy that gets the scrip.
---
Otherwise on public server, I have a few low traffic spots I trust no one will find my doggy bag or loot. Join on your buddy with a different character, pick up/scrip it
---
Thank you so much! I unfortunately got somewhat decent at it during the grind. Definitely slap on something brown or camo and bush Wookiee it! You don’t necessarily need to get tons of kills! It’s all about how long you survive
---
I have done this with using all 5 character slots. It took a while to have 5 characters max lvl all with fixer plans but it was worth it. Another benefit is being able to caps cap on all of them. After a while tho it becomes really hard to keep up with having enough legendaires to scrip, I buy scrip from vendors to try to keep up as much as I can. I will say it gets tiring with all the loading screens so keep that in mind if you want to do this. If you are looking to do this its worth it to save up caps and buy serum recipes, this way you can craft serums and dish them out to your alts to caps cap, or at just sell 2 serums on each alt for 1k and call it a day.
---
I’d hand over all my Atom for a Collectron that collects Nukas.
---
Pretty sure everyone starts with that perk...
---
Nope! I'm tired as all heck and couldn't sleep lmao. Take my upvote and my sincerest apologies. \*bows\*
---
Upvote upvote upvote!! Stick it in a season idgaf but give us more structures &amp; sets to earn by playing. 
---
AND MATCHING ROOFS FOR FUCKS SAKE
---
The atom shop is cool &amp; all but it shouldn't be the immediate request...
---
This exactly! never gave the brotherhood a serious consideration previously. High hopes for Fractured Steel
---
all excuses aside from "it polite not to" to "3 less people to kill me" the reason I forget to turn off auto fill is because I have to toggle it each time I launch the game. My private world remembers its toggle, but NW I have to turn off auto fill each time i launch the game and forget.
---
That damn jack o lantern combat armor
---
My pleasure! I Wookied it once - and died because my literal ass was hanging out. I laughed so hard as I died.... *sigh*
---
Give me shipping containers,train set and vehicles set from fallout 4
---
No one FORCED you to play anything. YOU chose to do so.
---
 But that aside, you can still make it through without the NW dailies.
---
What sucks is I’m great at nuclear winter but I hate it I’ve played wayyyy better br games and nuclear winter isn’t even fun
---
This challenge kinda sucks. At first I was like pick locks. No problem.  Didn’t think about everyone else LOL.
---
Your idea would be cool with an npc but they got your atom either way so don't hold your breath lol
---
Agreed. Bring back the old walls and stuff from
---
Fallout 4
---
Would literally die happy if they added the Fallout 4 concrete building materials @,.,@

I just tried. I can't change anything in someone else's camp. Either teammates can open passworded things or the keypads are simply bugged.
---
This needs to be upvoted beyond belief so people see this. Thankfully I just reached max and decided to check here first before spending anything. Although I too wish they would discount modules and the rest.
---
k
---
*ding ding ding* an upvote for both of ya. Stop selling me digital crap and give me a reason to play by making these cool ideas EARNABLE .
---
Ok thanks I have heard of it just never seen a good photo of it.
---
Oh yeah!
---
I've been running around doing similar tests and noticed some possible interaction with the equipped animal friend perk regarding aggro. (Scorched tamable showing friendly until I unequipped the perk.) I've been meaning to try something but have only had the luck of finding one scorched tamable so far.
---
If you still have the problem pet would you mind giving something a shot? 
---
Re-equip animal friend rank three then server hop. Check on the status of the troublemaker. I'm hoping they'll show as friendly again if you enter the area fresh with the perk active. Just a theory from limited observation though, nothing real solid to go on, but you got nothing to lose ;)
---
:edit: 
---
You can also give wasteland whisperer a shot if you have it at rank 3. 
---
It doesn't affect taming, as far as I can tell, but does affect pacifying certain creatures it seems.
---
Never heard anything about women not being allowed above a certain station.
---
Anyone used one yet? What do they do that's special or worth them being a reward?
---
Yesterday's challenge was place your camp 3 times.  This takes like 7 seconds once you get into the game.   Complaining about challenges like this is absurd.  
---
You can do the global NW challenges for the weekly, many of which are quite simple.  Quit complaining and just do it.
---
Ah yeah. I figured that was the only way but wasn’t sure if there was another way to just do it by yourself without friends.
---
Tried but didn't work for me. I'm terrible at it though. Might just require multiple rugs.
---
Just let the backpack stay on in PA
---
Bet someone can work out like 5 different dupe glitches with that
---
It does not appear with the Nuka Girl suit, maybe some other skins allows to hide it
---
Well just a few years back there were giant lakes and rivers flowing through the state, the freakin Ohio River is still there in the game, follow it up to Lake Erie and out to the Atlantic Ocean.
---
Yeah that's what I thought while reading that...they were well received, it was a lack of the PA alternative that should have been there that was not well received. But I guess removing is easier than adding if they are going along that whole route of changes anyway
---
The challenge yesterday took less than 10 seconds to complete. Lol but you do you
---
Thank you for informing us.  The whole sub was on the edge of their seats wondering if user "Lastdayer" was going to do the NW challenge or not.  Finally some real closure.
---
Dunno why people are rushing thru the season. It's 3 months long. I'm rank 21 now doing nothing but logging in an doing the challenges.
---
100% agree.
---
Posts literally went from constantly complaining about the ammo converter, to the whole system is broken, and now its just nitpicking the stuff that works. 
---
Some people cant just enjoy the stuff that works without complaining about that too.
---
Also if your wondering why there is a guy up top next to a wishing well...it was a mistake when I tried to link it.
---
To clarify, I participate to the best of my ability when I play NW as I actually enjoy it despite being sub par at pvp, I was merely speaking of the many people who are only on NW to get adventure server rewards.    
---
If beth locks the rewards in NW, a mode they don't like and don't want to play, and then structure the mode in a way that the best method to earn xp is camping, can you really blame them?
---
just for fun
---
The two new perks are nice additions. I was especially hoping for something like the infiltrator one.
---
Some outfits hide the backpack when worn. I have put on the Brotherhood science scribe outfit and the Firebreather uniform, and the backpack does not show. But right now, I don't think there is a way to toggle visibility.
---
The one that lets Rocksy know she can depend on me and I ain't no flake.
---
Yup, taming a new pet will 'over-write' the one you have currently. I've done this a couple times myself in the last few weeks, so can confirm. Thankfully no patches problems regarding this lol
---
Morgantown train yard. One in the tower next to depot and one in guard shack next to trains below it.
---
Exactly! Is this radsammich?
---
It’s like everyone started out decent with good intentions in the beginning, but the wasteland does something to a person. Except the settlers start out like jerks. Do you think the guy hanging out in Fort Defiance has a part in Fractured Steel?
---
They are a daily. You take the cores back to the red rocket service station.
---
what’s the point of fireworks in real life
---
So I guess there’s no way to use the gauss minigun as a main weapon, right?
---
I wish they would just have an entirely different subset of challenges in NW. As it stands now, you can still hit the “Gold Star” challenge without touching NW, so you’re only missing out 250 SCORE a day, which sucks but it’s not impossible to overcome.
---
Where I think it really hurts, though, is most of the NW dailies encourage toxic play style in the mode for people to check off the challenges and be done with it. If they took out the one NW daily in the existing challenges, but then added another list of 3-4 NW-exclusive challenges that were maybe a little more challenging and focused on healthier aspects of the mode, it would benefit the players who do enjoy it without forcing others into it. 
---
Maybe to make up for this they could add a “stretch-daily” into adventure mode that’s worth significantly more SCORE, but would also be a bigger challenge and require more time that you would probably have if you weren’t having to play NW for an hour just to get those 250 points.
---
I hate nuclear winter as well I think the fix is add a team death match to make ur special actually have a point and so that way when u die u just respawn
---
This is actually a pretty neat idea
---
Just to look at. They could've at least made it a plan so you can make more. There's way too much filler in there.
---
My guess is it has something to do with "Claim a Workshop (5)" weekly has something to do with it. Everyone is claiming them and letting them get overrun. Otherwise, no clue.
---
No issues for me so far. Anyway, I don't think I'll ever understand people that think that way.
---
"Gaaaaaaaary"
---
I got it on XBOX with my Beta character.   it is possible.  I may have had a low level alt that checked off some of the early things.
---
As an avid NW player, don’t remove them just separate them. That way the people that loathe pvp don’t clog up the servers and everyone can enjoy the game how they want to play it.
---
If you don’t like NW your time is better spent grinding XP in adventure to get the repeatable XP bonus.
---
I'm honestly so sick of it at this point.  It seems like some people just want to be able to AFK at their fucking camp and get score.  The "grind" seems to be too much for people when it takes me a few minutes every day to do my challenges and i come on here and have to read people piss and moan about how hard it is and how they are FORCED!!! to play NW as if it is not their choice in the matter whether or not to complete the challenges.
---
I seriously doubt any of these people have played another MORPG game in their entire life.  Sometimes, we have to do content we don't necessarily enjoy if we want the rewards.  It takes a few minutes just man the fuck up and do it.
---
apoc stuff . nope i dont want any. i want ENCLAVE items. every other group gets love but them. how many raider packs, free states packs, vault tech and coming soon brotherhood of steel stuff. but the enclave who are part of the story. nope nothing. not evne a flag or stashbox.
---
Same goes for any pop up.  I don't want to see the crappy legendary I picked up, nor do I need to know that I can do dross toss while something is charging at me trying to kill me.
---
I did it late last night because I almost forgot about it. But yeah, 10 seconds into a game the challenge was done and I was derping around letting folks kill me. 
---
I literally do not get all the hate for NW challenges. No one complained about the daily's last week, but as soon as a weekly challenge pops up people lose their minds.
---
If only I had neon letter
---
Yeah, is that possible?
---
Yes that's why they litterally have had the same 3 bundles an nothing else cycling for over 2 months an not much else.
---
You going to actually present your argument or just a meme title and that's that?
---
Is that right? Could have sworn I got one from the dead dog at the Freak Show recently. That's the only regular spawn for it I know.
---
And then you’re forgetting the part of us console players man, you guys have “mods” while the problem mainly lies within console players no having the out
---
I don't need an explanation, the only peoplel I hear complain about how op they are is pve players, most PVP players I know can tank them for the most part
---
You won't have to worry about building and crafting too much for the first while of the game. Do the quests around Flatwoods to start, and read all the terminals and holotapes... They'll basically tell you what's going on. And of course all the Wastelander NPCs will give you plenty of exposition if you're willing to listen to them.
---
There’s not really a clear ‘goal’. There’s a lot of different things to focus on. For now just follow the main storyline because that does a good job of giving you the tour and showing you a lot of the mechanics.
---
I do this, only doesn’t work on modules or any no-drop items
---
Plus if you're set up for PVP (it's in the title) you'll already understand what I mean
---
if you’re on xbox i can give you those 30 you lost plus some. gathering materials to create stable flux can be tedious and having that happen would make me livid lol.
---
You don't have to build much of anything if you don't want to. If you played Fallout 4, then this should be pretty easy to figure out.
---
No it is designed to be that way.
---
are you on PC? I can invite you to a discord where you can at least ask questions and get help from my group as you play around.
---
Also the Fallout Network discord is a nice community and resource, there is a link to that in the side bar
---
Morgantown Trainyard or Airport, or alternatively Vault Tec Agricultural Center.
---
If they altered it to add in a banking system of some kind it would be MUCH better.  People shouldnt be punished for not having spare time to do chores in a video game every day.  Probably less an issue in these times of quarantine, but in general.  😋
---
Celebrating freedom, you commie.
---
Why does he have to date Gale? He can't bring someone else?
---
You could play the entire game without building barely a thing. A camp is just somewhere to go and chill and repair and sell your loot in a vendor.
---
I do love building though. Once you see some camps people have you might change your mind about it.
---
TBH the main storyline is kinda weak compared to some of the side quests. The order of mysteries side quest chain is one of my fave quest lines ever. SOOO good
---
Yes! I love outfits in the game. I love to see other’s outfit ideas too. It’s kinda dumb, but sometimes I change clothes each time I play. Plus I’m pretty excited I got to snag all the Halloween stuff I missed out on.
---
they should use one of the buildings by the Galleria and have that as the physical Atomic shop
---
I'm okay with doing the NW dailies. They don't take long except for the play for X amount of time, they can get rid of that one though because you just end up playing with a bunch of bush wookies trying to get the most time in, in one game.
---
Simple answer, it’s just plain fun! Plus I am able to get to places others can’t. Only downside-death from heights. Still trying to get the legs with reduced fall damage.
---
Wendingo colossus. Its locations are posted on the fallout wiki, cannot personally confirm any of them.
---
Free?
---
I could not find a way to do it without redoing the inventory for sale. I was able to store an existing vendor and then rebuild as the new version without using any resources, but it de-lists all the items previously available in that vendor and I had to re-list it all.
---
Not sure if anyone else found a way around that.
---
It’s a pain, but I was able to price all my items again in just a few minutes.
---
I'm not going out of my to not progress theres just too much other stuff to do
---
Ok, got onto PTS:
---
Each of these is the LV 1 - need lots of coins to rabk them up.
---
"Ammo factory" - produce 50% more rounds when crafting ammo
---
"Antivenom" - +50 poison resist when wearing matching armour
---
"Blood sacrafice" - When you die, teammates gain +25 DR and heal 40HP over 8 seconds
---
Brawling chemist - generate 1 combat enhancing chem every hour up to max 3
---
Cleave - 20% chance for melee VATS to do area damage
---
Collateral damage - enemies killed with melee have 10% chance to explode
---
Detonation contagion - enemies killed by thrown explosives have 20% chance to explode
---
Electric Absorbtion - 10% chance energy attacks recharge PA fusion core
---
Exploding palm - unarmed 5% chance of explosion on hit
---
Far flung fireworks - enemies killed with ranged weapon have 10% chance to explode
---
Fire Lining - +50 fire damage resist when wearing matching armour
---
Follow through - ranged sneak damage increases damage to target by 10% for 10 seconds
---
Legendary Ability - +1 to stat and +1 to available perk slots (theres one for each SPECIAL)
---
Master Infiltrator - auto unlock level 0 terminals and locks. +3 lockpick and hacking skills
---
Nuclear proliferator - generate 1 lightweight mininuke every hour. Up to a max of 3.
---
Power armour revoot - 15% chance to auto revive with full health if you're downed in PA
---
Power sprinter - while in PA, sprinting consumes 20% fewer AP
---
Retribution - blocking a melee attack restores 1 HP and 1AP for 15 seconds
---
Survival shortcut - generate 1 survival aiding chem every 30 mins. Max 5.
---
Taking one for the team - ebemies take 10% more damage when they attack you if you're on a team
---
What rads? - +50 rad resist, restore 1 rad per second
---
So you can let them and let people know you are currently stuck at home with way to much free time waiting for your job to start back up. At least that's my joy out of them. Unfortunately  my mule only sees the light of private servers, so no one I'll rejoice in my lone glory. It will be a pity party all by myself.
---
Yes, this - go there. And not to the place I go. Thanks.
---
They tell you to equip perks and you can have a maximum of 7, not that you can have as many (example) strength card as your points allow and none of a special category (like agility) if you choose to.
---
I just made a 1* furious and it melts and I don't have any heavy gun perks actually. Does 75 base damage was getting 10 damage to the queen and they weren't even head shots
---
Well yeah sucks for consoleros but that doesn't change anything about what I said. An implementation by Beth will always be better, I'm just pointing out that we have alternatives in the meantime.
---
Legacies are actually pretty far down on the laundry list of all the things that need to be re-balanced for PvP.  There are much bigger issues that need to be addressed with it.
---
I believe that if the Brotherhood seized control of the country’s nuclear arsenal, they would eventually want to do something similar. Lock a bunch of people in a bunker (or bunkers) with experimental tech and pent-up aggression and you will eventually see an abuse of power.
---
Without a non-impulsive (ie Lyons, Maxson I) leader to guide them, the Brotherhood is doomed to fall into the same rut that the Enclave once did. 
---
A techno-hoarding organization with the ability to drop forces anywhere at a whim-and led by an impulsive leader no less? It’ll only be a matter of time before the Brotherhood is as/more brutal than the Enclave. The difference is that the Brotherhood pretends that it does no wrong-the Enclave doesn’t.
---
Haha
---
Given how easy most of them are, refusing to do them on principle is a really dumb way to miss out on 1000's of scrip. But you do you, bro.
---
Nuka Orange is *not* rad removal. It’s rad resist. I use them in PvP against gamma gun boys. And it’s also pretty difficult to come by unless you buy them from a Duper or someone who bought them from a Duper themselves.
---
If you're referring to corpse of Rufus in the locked cage, that was the only location it spawned, it no longer spawns there, now you get a random bandana. It also used to drop from dog creatures, but that isn't the case anymore.
---
With Chinese made fireworks! USA USA USA!!
---
I was surprised they didn't include a "looking for PvP" group setting in the new group finder.
---
Thank you for making it free. I was just about to comment “and make it free” lol
---
I could live with it, i killed the guy 3 times after that just for the caps. But he must've used a scrap kit so i never found it.
---
Hardened mass is easy to get so i wasn't too pissed about it, what i'm really struggling to get is those high rad fluids and yeah i'm on Xbox
---
PM'd you the good one
---
Agreed, like godmode, I don't see why people acream nerf. I think it comes down to people not understanding mechanics if the game and how to deal and tank damage so when they get melted they just get angry and want things they don't have to be toned down
---
The real end goal of the story is to deal with The Scorched Plague.  You'll notice the gnarly looking dudes in most areas.  You don't NEED to do base building, but many people do have fun with it.  Just explore each area thoroughly, take your time, if you're interested in lore and stuff it's out there to be discovered.  If you just want to go full on MURDERHOBO and destroy everything in your path and go from objective to objective you can do that too.
---
If you're on PC and need help look me up, I use the same name as here.  Just let me know, so I know who the random friendo is.
---
That was the one. Good to know, cheers!
---
You said it perfectly. Honestly, I think you're right in assuming that the people complaining have never plaid an MMORPG. 
---
Elder Scrolls Online, GTA, Red Dead; all have challenges that take you out of the norm. Thats like the whole point of challenges. To introduce all aspects of the game with a fun grind that may give you fun rewards. If you dont want to do it, dont do it but dont expect a reward.
---
I'm gonna save mine for next year's fascnat parade when I get a rare mask or God roll from the event
---
Just what the heck is a john anyways?
---
Congrats! I still have to get most mods (buttrrssed for the armor and calibrated shocks for PA) but I'm so happy to have my full sets!
---
I’m not certain but I don’t think Gamepass is a PC thing. Last I checked only Xbox had it.
---
Before you move your camp to a new location, place your vendors on the ground by themselves. This will keep the machines stocked and each a separate stored blueprint. I also like to put a neon letter on each one so I can easily distinguish which machine is which.
---
Wait what?  Godmode is fucking stupid
---
True
---
I’m agreeing with that, just throwing in the 2 cents that console players are screwed worse, but I do hope we can respec in the future
---
Are people really that scared of getting killed by another player or something?  99% of the NW challenges take less than a few minutes to do besides survive 30 min.  P.S. fuck the revive three player one tho lol
---
For about an hour after the fallout zone has dissipated you'll find radioactive flowers. Can be nice if you're too low level for a nuke zone yet, as you can go flower picking and sell the flux for quite good caps :)
---
Please post an update l8r with what you got im absolutley curious to see what you get with that much script!
---
I’m a bloodied shotgunner I have a bloodied faster fire rate gauss shotgun and I do about 4000 damage per shot I can use one clip and kill the sbq
---
Or use the flux for ultracite ammo!
---
Thanks! I’m reallllly great at skipping through any commentary. I’ll be better at this now!
---
Wait, does it cap at 300? I’m almost at 300 and that would be awesome!
---
Thank you!
---
Awesome, thank you!
---
I think they're just gonna let it happen and let us spend our money on atoms to level up in the Legendary Run.
---
That's what I'm saying godmode needs to be addressed, I've heard if players going godmode, stacking bobbleheads and magazines then dying to rads and all the stacked effects remain for the duration so you could still initiate and PVP it's rediculous
---
I like it but don't play too often. Level 50 or so. I'm glad the score gives me an incentive to play. When the reward was just XP for the ghillie suit I did that almost entirely AFK. In the past couple weeks the challenges gave me a reason to get involved in the match.
---
Your story just makes me think they should add a teabag players challenge.
---
*fucked* be good sucka, *fucked* be good.
---
Thank you so much! I’m on Xbox. I seriously appreciate the invite, though!
---
Dude, you are the best! ...Hope I didn't put you over the cap limit buying that stuff from your vendor.
---
Oh sorry.  I misread your post like big dumb dumb.  I agree it needs to be fixed asap
---
Jesus
---
No worries, yeah there's even faster and easier methods than what Bethesda patched
---
I thought gauss rifle was the only one it didn’t effect unless you got the explosive legendary effect on them? But there’s a good chance I’m wrong and that’s just what I’ve read a few times.
---
Remember we are rebuilding America so as time goes by our camps should improve as well... but I totally agree. I try to keep my camp as close to the type of camps I had in Fallout 4. Old shack or improvised building style.
---
YES!!!  Im vibin with you hard right now!!
---
It would have made since, but from what I hear PvP isn’t their main concern but PvE is. So I’m not as surprised but still wish they had of added one.
---
With chems I can go up to 6000 my back up is the fancy pump which one shots everything except sbq and in 12 shells I kill the imposter
---
This is what works for me I only go Sunday and have never had an issue.
---
that'll be 500 atoms + tip please
---
I've never been online during the reset. I havent even had my x box turned on the entire day beforehand. I've been hit by the bug twice once completing dailys, and once both weekly and daily
---
It always happens if I crash on joining a world. Which   is 100% out of my control.
---
Enforcer
---
source: dude trust me
---
I think their still good with the right cards and chems they still hit really hard.
---
Better yet a middle finger emote
---
2 hours ago so it's not really going to help now but if you don't already know check YouTube to learn how to photomode glitch through doors and also how to use power armor to run through walls.  Shouldn't need to do it but it's easy if you ever end up in a situation like this again.
---
Also if you want to be really lazy you can use either of those to bypass replacing/repairing the cores entirely.
---
Did your game crash on joining a world or did you get a disconnect from the server as soon as your joined? 
---
I've been hit twice and currently that's the only common link for me.
---
If you've done them all you should be level 25.
---
If all you do is the dalies and weeklies which you aren't, you HAVE to do some grinding to get to 100 if you want all the items.
---
Well there's a couple better ones there. Legendary ability seems very nice
---
Edit, do you know if the matching armor cards work for pa as well?
---
is there in game text chat or only voice/emote?
---
i think you can get a fourth star by putting the scorch killer reciver on some weapons and the sacrifical blade on the machete
---
Okay so i have to try a shotgun build now
---
I'd like Survival Mode back. I never got to play it when it was around because I was too low level and had crap compared to the weapons and armor I have now.
---
Thank you for telling me
---
Even if that were the case, I’d prefer to have SOME option. Although it would feel unfair.
---
I played outer worlds on the pc version of gamepass  should still be a thing I hope
---
Is the t-65 worth it?
---
Buy them from players or if you're skint and on ps4 I have a shed with switchable rad emitters in it.
---
So we can have 6 total legendary perks?
---
50-300 right?
---
Looks like it will be all legendary special.. Maybe the master infiltrator.
---
only if the area auto flags you for pvp and removes passive mode. so i can kill all of you. wall flowers... if that happens i'm 100% cool with it. enjoy your apocalyptic walmart.
---
How would you fit that into the lore?  What kind of background and development would it have had, and by whom and for what purpose?
---
Yeah same here I only got to play it for literally 3days then it got taken out. So us PvPers had to take our fight to adventure which some people liked cause we don’t lose our chems and aid anymore. But if they could make survival a thing again the PvP community could come back again.
---
"We're looking into it!"
---
"We've passed it along to the dev team!"
---
"Thanks for reporting this, we are aware!"
---
Which of these worthless palliatives would help? Because nothing will change.
---
I've been hit twice by it losing out on 7250 score. 
---
Lost almost all my weekly this week. 
---
The only common denominator is my game crashed on joining a world, or I got instantly disconnected. 
---
I did nothing different than I did any other time I play the game.
---
Do bloodied shotgun I also have full unyielding secret service armor and adrenal reaction mutation u also have to have all shotgunner perks scattershot enforcer nerd rage and serendipity
---
Haha but surely even though you know you'll be fine, doesent falling from that height make your balls try to escape into your body somewhat?
---
Thank you! I can’t even figure out how to set up camp yet. So happy to hear that you love it, so much negativity floating around about this game. I’ve been super excited to play!
---
Indeed
---
Gauss shotgun is awesome. As well there a fancy pump action shotgun(always a legendary) you can get from pleasant valley ticket robot. Enforcer is a great perk I use. I recommend 3 master shotgunner 2 expert shotgunner 1 shotgunner. Skeet shooter perk. And there another perk that help your reload and reduced weight of shotgun which is located under strength. I tend to run either instigating gauss or my anti armor shotgun. I also recommend Vampire shotgun. Those are pretty viable especially in vats.
---
Thats capitalism for ya. Doesnt matter how the meat is made, as long as you get your burger.
---
What if I said.. Green Sunset?
---
huh, would explain how i got that one yesterday so fast with my GS
---
Still a great unarmed weapon. Look for an extra hooks mod to get even more damage.
---
Thanks man
---
Glad you could get some payback! An yea, the drop rate for high rad fluids is awful. I have no proof besides my experiences but i find that Super mutants give me best chances of getting HRF and glowing mass where as scorched and ghouls tend to give me more hardened mass along with glowing mass. Nuking Bog Town is one of my go to spots for Mutants because of the amount that spawn outside and not in a cell (like at west tek). Worth a try if nothing else!
---
Yeah , you can slot 6 max, each of which can be ranked up (makes the bonuses better - e.g ammo printer goes from +50% to +75%)
---
For me I followed all those guidelines and I've been hit twice. 
---
It happens when I get disconnected immediately upon entering the world or when I crash when joining the world. It's the only common denominator I've found from my limited experiences. 
---
And there flat out isn't anything I can do to prevent it. Sometimes this buggy game just decided to not work.
---
I feel the same! Lets keep putting positive vibes into the Wastes. Hopefully folks will calm down and we can get back to those days where everyone was chill. (Like Fasnacht)
---
Fo76marketplace is just scammers preying on kids. Market (no space) 76 is the one you're looking for.
---
For me it's happened completely independent of resets. Hours afterwards. 
---
It hit me twice both times I either crashed on joining a world or got immediately disconnected.
---
Can you elaborate how you tank legacies w/o popping hundreds if colas, chems, or magazines. I have 4/5 pieces of sentinel assassin armor, vanguard sentinel and still find it difficult to tank legacies with just my perk cards.
---
Just take them out of the slots in the terminal. They spawn them and theres a tinkers bench where you can just repair them.
---
its not that hard to get 10k exp especially if your a bloodied build an using the exp buffs  even made it to 43 today [https://i.imgur.com/Jtl43gp.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/Jtl43gp.jpg)
---
No problem also if ur always in public teams go ahead and pick up heard mentality so u get an extra plus 3 to all stats
---
Nice ty
---
&gt;OP is often quite overly-reactionary and dramatic, so this is not surprising.
---
Try harder I only go for bait that has been broiled.
---
If I had to guess, I'd say it let people manipulate the numbers to do ridiculous things when combined with other perks/effects.  Probably managed to make themselves invincible to end game enemies or something.
---
Just type "Bethesda Support" in Google and click the first link, then FO76 --&gt; Billing --&gt; Your platform --&gt; I need help with the Atomic Shop --&gt; I want a refund  
---
Here is a screenshot on steps exactly:

Cry about it people lol
---
It's very annoying after sbq and you're just scrambling to find a tent to stash those flux before a mirelurk spawn murders you with the poison.
---
You used to. Hasn’t been for awhile now.
---
Plasma caster is greatly ammo efficient too like the Gatling gun
---
Rolls with modules should be significantly better for the player that did the rep grind, bullion grind, collected the junk and spent time collecting scrip. The murmugh rolls are understandable because anyone does it, but module ones should be better odds.
---
You won't get banned for QOL mods, no need to be a dick about it.
---
2 secs, I'll go try it
---
wasted opportunity if he doesn’t get some resolution! id help the man out.
---
I didn't say it hurt me. The title says "Bethesda, Are YOU" - Unless you think I'm Bethesda? I'm flattered Derk.
---
There is a Double SCORE weekend coming up. Along with a Double XP weekend. And more ways to boost XP gain than before. 
---
Also, has anyone that has reached Phase 2 confirmed that the point increases continue on, or do they reset back to 1000 at the beginning of each phase?
---
Still lots of unanswered questions.
---
Lmao love it
---
Im mostly solo, expect in events i try to join to a team for the xp boost :)
---
Yes!!! Every time I come up to one of those guy and hit “search” nothing happens except they explode. Am I doing something wrong?
---
Thank you so much for the offer to help, I will 100% send a message if I’m lost or stuck. Much love.
---
Dude was a couple hundred meters from red rocket. Maybe spawn glitched. Thanks for the info.
---
You've been able to do this for months, if there were, surely they would've have found it by now.
---
This changed everything.  Went through and dumped so much stuff and things are so much better now, thanks for the tip!!
---
So why even make this post? You seem to be preaching to the choir saying that.
---
I never do pvp, but i dont think they should be nerfed! Since they are so Hard to get on ps4 atleast of course they should stand out from The rest. Rare items should be the best
---
They weigh 1.5 pounds each  for a total of 22.5 pounds.
---
Don't drop it, deploy it. On xbox deploy is A and drop is X.

Perk cards are only a fraction of a build dude, colas are necessary in PVP now days anyways, you don't need hundreds of magazines or bobbles either you can hit a route a few times a day and find a few of those to stock up on, and vanguard does nothing for PVP once you hit the 500 mark of resistance it's diminishing returns anyways bud. I don't even use class freak or starched genes anymore I make every serum take them all and take 8 food buffs before fights
---
Yes and no
---
The secret service set can reach the same DR/ER if you use Vanguard or bolstering 
---
But you wont have the inherent DMG and RAD reduction all PA have. I use the T65 only for nuke zones, or colossus fights. But it's cool and really bulky, so you look like a walking tank. It also has a unique jetpack model, and for some reason all mods for the helmet are unlocked. Dont need to spend bullion to get them
---
everyone liked that
---
Uh...not really.
---
Demo expert definitely changed the damage numbers in pip-boy of a  TS Gauss I got yesterday (so not an explosive). Sold it for 1500 caps after testing it so can't test it again.
---
Don't drop it lol. You can deploy it without dropping it, though I don't know which button on Xbox to use. It will tell you at the bottom of the screen when you have the PA frame selected.
---
That way we have to grind 100 spaces instead of 99.
---
Because pve players might learn something if PVP players discuss this topic
---
I belive there was a travel mat removed because people using it to troll people
---
Exactly, besides people forget they're going to be reintroduced to the loot pool eventually anyways, I'm glad you understand this as a pve player bro. It shows you respect that other people play differently
---
North of its train station next to the power pylon maybe?!
---
Yeah. They usually spawn a little to the right of red rocket
---
I like that there is nuance in the BoS lineage, since all the chapters we met were splinter groups. In the early Fallouts, they were isolationists focused on tech preservation. Fallout 3 explored the division between a BoS splinter group wanting to roll up their sleeves to actually help the wasteland and the resentful Outcasts wanting to hold to tradition and disavow Lyons as a heretic. New Vegas showed us what happens when a group like the Outcasts are humbled by defeat and driven into exile when they find out they don’t have all of mankind’s solutions. Fallout 4 gave us yet another flavor, a group trying to get back to its roots but leaning into xenophobia and fascism. In 76, we see why the group formed and the hopes it had for helping the world. Taken as a whole, BoS is to me a cautionary tale about what happens when people get too wrapped up in ideology and losing perspective. I am very interested in this next DLC.
---
I did one with my two friends, lots of screaming out of fear and then victory, the thing eats ammo though but great for screws.
---
Congrats! You described the Welcome mat, a placeable spawn point that Bethesda disabled for some reason, even though it worked.
---
Thanks man I was gonna but it but now I’m just saving bullion for fractured steel, I have everything I want lol
---
Ah
---
Yes it was patched... However if you've used an exploit to bypass your camp budget you can still be susceptible. Unless you've done that (and you will know if you have or not) you'll be fine.
---
Np!
---
Those are like fossilized scorched.  There are living ones running around that you'll fight, too.  You might confuse them with ghouls at a distance.
---
It's a pain to add new things to the vendors lately, with the lag and every item seems to generate some kind of server reset message when you try to add it to the vendors.
---
I started playing NW last night and went bush wookie, then killed the last players. It's pretty fun.
---
Gonna have to get master infiltrator, just for the convenience.
---
These are so specific that really, I see everyone taking legendary ability to get higher stat caps because why in the fuck would you take any of these when you could take more base perks.
---
I'm going to have 4 slots when this drops and 3 minimum are going to be stat perks.  At least leveling up has meaning again, beyond the score thing.
---
I’ll test it out, should be home in 2 hours. I’ll hop on and report back 👍🏼
---
Monognah! The town not the mine. If you spawn at the far east of the town, you should be close to a small gas station, theres a wall safe. A bit south of that there will be a shed(in the woods a bit not in the town itself) there will be a safe near the barrels inside :)
---
Of course, its your game! You do you and all that
---
PVP players test a lot of things and that knowledge isnt just handed out, my point here is that pve community shouldn't be screaming nerf when I bet most of them havent really tried and tested or invested in a PVP build
---
Well there's a 5000 limit you can hold, so if you get close to the limit, buy something
---
you spawn north of your camp module
---
Do what you need to with this info
---
Thank you so much I never knew that was a thing
---
You're a king
---
The idea is ok. The execution is bad. A week long buff for 1,500? 20% increase for 1,000 caps? And to get better legendaries?
---
Sorry way way way over powered.
---
Do you want to quit the game?
---
Ikr i miss that stuff!
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
Junk wall building set and junk wall fences when?
---
You may have been seeing the cosmetic pack, because every update is free for everyone
---
They were just trying tell you that you had toilet paper stuck on your shoe!
---
You can still build them at workshops... It's probably disabled for camps to avoid griefers and exploiters.
---
They responded to my post on Bethesda.net, we will see where it goes.
---
I definitely need that welcome mat spawn point back, would save a lot of grief haha
---
Damn, SCORE has me so burned out on the game that I forgot to stock up on scrip. Whatever, burned out on the game anyway.
---
I tried to make brain bombs but it seems like the Sugar Bombs you can make at the Sinshine Meadows (if I remember the workshop's name correctly) can not be used?
---
There I had a few camps including a round tower in the power pylon. They all got nuked and or I have to hop servers 5 times until my camp can be placed lol
---
I use Ultracite ammo and only use it for the queen. You can produce 100 rounds per batch with the ultracite. I am a heavy weapons build. There's really no point in using  Gaus minigun to take out mole miners,  mutants ghouls and robots. I've seen people using them at Uranium fever and thought wow what a waste of ammo.  For everyday use against common enemies I use the Gatling gun.  For the queen I use Gatling Laser and Gauss minigun.  Gauss minigun is a big gun for big enemies.
---
You can move your spawn point around by moving the camp module, just move it and fast travel to camp to see where it changed to, unfortunately it's all trial and error
---
But if pvp players know what you mean and don't say anything, how will pve learn anything.
---
They do bring them back. I bet things like the Thanksgiving Display will come back during Thanksgiving.
---
Seems not - I took antivenom. Got 50 poison resist when im in my SS armour, but not when I get into my PA
---
Before the season I got a hell of a lot more than "NOTHING" from casually playing. I'd get 20-50 Atoms per day from easy dailies while doing faction quests. That's anywhere from 600 to 1500 Atoms a month, which I could use to get ANYTHING I wanted in the Atom shop.
---
Now I'm forced to wade through all the other unwanted bullshit in the season pass to *possibly* earn 1500 Atoms in 10 weeks if I went from casually playing to grinding my ass off. No thank you.
---
flatwoods Agriculture building has 3 locked fertilizer bins.
---
because people keep asking for them to be brought back because they missed them.
---
I mean, I suppose you could, but there's really no point and keeping it fed would be a real pain.
---
I also have a question for those reading this. Is it safe to trade person to person? I usually decline a trade request, and have heard some things about unwillingly losing items this way?
---
Alright, thanks for the advice. I'll be sure to nuke Bog Town next time. Might do that now actually
---
By reading through comments on this post and asking questions instead of getting mad that they got killed in a workshop. There's dozens of YouTube videos that go in depth on PVP setups too
---
From my understanding, it has something like a 20% chance to spawn in a few specific areas if you nuke them. I only know of the Sundew Grove near the SBQ spawn, but have heard people report it spawning in a few other locations as well.
---
I got it missed up with nuka grape, they aren't that hard to get ahold of, you just need to server hop and buy them from the vendor in white springs on the 2nd floor.
---
Bummer. That poison resist would have been nice, tyvm for checking
---
"The lore" mothman bag.
---
You use the fireworks during the Scorched Beast Queen fight to lure out the Wendigo Collossus, and they fight each other as long as the fireworks keep going...
---
/s (i wish)
---
That must be the case!
---
Why wouldn't throw your first point into Intelligence?
---
EDIT: Nevermind. All the sprinting.
---
We need more free emotes or text chat. My mic is dying and people can barely hear me, and I'm too poor for a new one.
---
not enough? like you really need benches and water and shit, please
---
You're getting downvoted cause you're missing the point. You shouldn't HAVE to use mods, it should already be in the game
---
I like the idea of a matte-black scout skin...although that ship has sailed, now that I have SS Armor...which also would look great in Matte Black.
---
seasons need to be longer.. or easier to complete and shorter... in my unsolicited opinion..
---
I know, it was just an example.
---
I understand this, but I think it’s a dink move to shoot a low level in the back with a mini nuke when they’re completely unaware. Like, you can, but it’s not really pvp. I was more pissed that he was being gross and misogynistic on mic. I personally would enjoy pvp if it was balanced so that lower levels can still at least attempt to survive attacks from higher levels.
---
I'm saying exactly this, you need to level up from 2 to 3, doesn't work from 1 to 2.
---
The vanguards may not do anything but the sentinel still works. Just as i thought, stacking colas, chems and food and eventually stealthboys. It's all about who duped the most of them. I prefer pvp with just armor and perks cards, it becomes a PITA for me to keep track of everything and what order to pop what.
---
Add the relevant XP bonuses and keep running westek on different servers. XP comes quickly.
---
i'm up to 1100 hours of gameplay now. Loved it since day one. And most of the community is really nice. There are some bad people out there but they are few and far between. 
---
This guide tells you where to find junk in the game https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic
---
It was made before wastelanders so some info has changed. Early game scrap all weapons and armor you don't need. You get parts and mods (now and then). Use melee as much as possible because you will probably struggle for ammo early on. 
---
Either make or join a building team. You get a boost to INT and higher INT gives more XP. You can also fast travel to teammates and their camps for free.
---
Uh... what?
---
That would make the things you are buying cheaper than the scrap cost....
---
Someone seems bitter
---
Or guy . 😘
---
Ah I think that one already has a black skin that’s been data mined.
---
I don’t think I’ll get the SS armor, missing a bunch of mods from what I heard. Like my enclave armor better looks wise anyways.
---
They’re expensive af though. It’s costly for a new player, and most people don’t know about that vendor. I like to keep it that way.
---
I noticed this, it is very annoying to have to turn it back off, almost makes you think Bethesda is actively trying to cause a less fun experience for people
---
Older thread  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/d1bw1o/compiling\_a\_list\_of\_rarevaluable\_plans/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/d1bw1o/compiling_a_list_of_rarevaluable_plans/)  but most of it still counts
---
Two words
---
F L A R E · G U N
---
That was one my doubts, yes. 
---
But it is not relevant in this case. It will level 2&gt;3 the same, with 1 or 2 INT.
---
But I've observed that +1A and to have equiped 1 level of Action Boy makes the walk to the Wayward a little faster.
---
So then speak about your build, perk cards ect change a few minds. I like pvp and would rather they put survival mode back in. I think pvp players would all  be there after what was implemented with update 20.
---
well, you should have a good example so it matches the idea. because as it is, that's not a good idea.
---
Hahaha yea I'm there right now and see a lot of good potential. I have now 2 places where I try to build that monster lol. Thanks man!
---
And a tree with a tire swing... For a baby Megasloth of course!
---
A well set up PVP character does require a lot of inventory management to be most efficient, carry only what you need in a fight on you and you're stash, and you need every percentage based damage reduction to be tank as possible an extra 35 ER and Dr won't do much. You can pump a Tesla to 700 damage and only deal 70 per shot at a player and that's when they have a 90% reduction of damage that's why bloodied is meta right now because you really do need to hit em as high as possible
---
First time you do it, wall around and pick up the mainframe cores. Then take out the damaged ones. Replace with the one you found. You'll then carry on and leave with the damaged ones. Next time you can repair them at your camp before you go in. You then take out the damaged ones replace with the ones you've repaired. Rinse and repeat.
---
You're getting that message because you've probably got Atom shop paints on it, or you've built something from the bullion system, like the Strangler's Heart you mentioned. 
---
If you're really wanting to drop something like that, take those paints off. The bullion items however are not transferrable and you'll just lose those if you drop them.
---
Glad to hear it helped. It'll drive you crazy otherwise.
---
No.  Just do the challenges they are really easy and only take a few minutes per day.  It's not difficult.  It's not time-consuming.  The "FOMO" you mention is entirely within your free-will to control.
---
Nope 
---
Everything worked as expected up to looking at the challenge list
---
I should also note that today's challenges loaded in just fine
---
I have a couple of matching Scout Sets (Troubleshooter / Zealot) that I wore for ages, but they just can't compete with the increased DR / ER / RR of Secret Service.
---
Since I always were something over it, it really doesn't hurt either way.
---
Well the perks wont work with it =0
---
i rock a junkies gauss and it's wizard AF
---
A friend that joined the game a around the same time I did last year has been able to discover all locations and get credited for it gaining those Atoms. Yet I still am unable to discover them though can also fast travel there.
---
Its a shotgun, so you'd need a shotgun build to take full advantage, not rifleman.
---
I recommend you read my post again. I acknowledge all this and point out how there are still problems that could occur.
---
I do hope they reimplement survival I would live in survival. As far as perks and exact setups, why? Why would anyone throw out their build, there's stuff like supressor obviously all commando ranks bloody mess, lone wanderer, rejuvinated, lifegiver, cola nut, born survivor, field surgeon, first aid, nerd rage, ground pounder
---
Yup, that’s how I’ve been doing it as well. Was able to level up three times in around 20-25 minutes with three fresh toons for the weekly challenge yesterday
---
cuts off Rocksy mid sentence, just to hear here say, "Seriously?!?"
---
I wanted a rundown look. I spent hours searching the wasteland for the perfect spot. I ended up settling in an abandoned diner near the shooting range. I used the appliances and stash boxes to build up a junk wall.
---
Lol ive never said that but ok
---
Don't worry dude, were ask for a raider section in the back so you can gauge on meat sacks and dead corpses to feed your testosterone 👌
---
There's also things like the marine armor plans and the BoS underarmor plans which aren't common but do have a fixed spawn point. I sell them about 999-1200 caps
---
I think the Brotherhood justifies their wrongs as a higher purpose. They seem to admit to them but see it as the cost of preserving humanity, like it's up to them to decide. Lyons saw past that, but most of them fall to hubris and the belief that preserving the brotherhood is the same thing as preserving humanity.
---
I feel like Bethesda thinks if they add too much actual CHARACTER customization, then i will have less reason to buy headwear items, as if im not buying new shit all the time and swapping it out, cause i like not always dressing the same way in game, lol.
---
or at least let the turbo fert grenades work on those plants. ive tried them and i cant get them to work on non plantable flora
---
Also having issues with this. Did you find a solution?
---
You don't need a daily commitment.  You just need to make good use of the time you do play in proportion to how far you want to get.  I missed several days at the start and am over halfway done now from grinding xp.
---
It'll depend on how much Strength you have. If you can afford to put on the Shot Gunner perks than sure... If you're a Bloodied build however I honestly don't think getting the perks will matter, it's still fairly OP.
---
The idea is that you’d get special buffs by spending caps. That is a buff. So it does support the idea even if it’s not a “good” one.
---
Now that I think about it, this was before the update to team agroing, so my teamate who also got killed at the SBQ event might've agroed someone.
---
I agree that the 'clean' stuff is too clean, but as its only 25 years after the bombs i don't think  you can go to far down the apocalypse path. Junk stuff a la F4 for sure but i think there needs to be an appreciation of how much 'real' deterioration would actually occur in a short span of time - and also in context of what we see established 200 years later in the rest of the franchise
---
Still want that Elder Maxon coat.
---
I always wished they would add a damaged texture to accompany the completely destroyed texture of it disappearing. Don't know how difficult it would be but could lead to some pretty cool camps with a little imagination. And also reduced repair cost if it's only damaged and not destroyed.
---
A laughing emote or a way to express something was funny would be appreciated also
---
&gt; I did not sign an agreement that says I am required to put this game above all other games, so putting in a system that requires me to do so to complete it is off putting.
---
I read your post and it's full of gems like this.  No one asked you to sign an agreement requiring you do to anything.  If you don't feel the cosmetics are worth the time investment then just don't do it.  You want the rewards but don't want to put in the effort.
---
Furthermore there are youtube videos with actual correct math showing you can miss days and still complete.  They are also adding in double xp and double daily weekends to help out and the 1500 atoms from the pass can be saved for the final 10 ranks which will be the longest.  It requires barely any commitment to get it to 100 and people still manage to find a way to complain.  Its mindblowing
---
So just thinking out loud here.
---
How many coins would it take to max your 6 slots, if each had, say, 3 ranks? How many coins for a rank? 
---
At what level can you expect to max out these new perks?
---
I can confirm I’m bloodied stealth commando build and it does enough dmg too kill most enemies without perks. I have an instigating and a bloodied they both kill good.
---
It's totally possible that I underestimated how much of an impact the xp score source is. I don't have my build set up for maximized xp gains yet. However, as far as the impression that the system gives me, that I see several sources claiming that you have to do this EVERY day, true or not, is what I am bringing to question.
---
there is no proper trade dialogue so.. no it is not safe..
---
I wouldnt do it unless it is someone you know very well and trust or an official market sub courrier...
---
I got one that makes my health regenerate at 300%, like what? That's so great!
---
  F u
---
You have a lot to learn about selling an idea. 
---
Paying caps for a buff is a terrible idea, no matter what now.
---
I never said I didn't want to put in the effort. It's mind blowing that you took my post to mean I didn't want to put any sort of work into this, but hey, to each their own, I guess.
---
Read a post on here about a month back where someone else was dropping theirs every time they wanted to use it too.....right up until someone else at an event hopped into their armor and he never got it back lol.
---
Most fo the regards are Ehh anyways nobody is forcing you to take part
---
Thats the only one I wont do if it comes up. Only because I dont have a mic and conveying my goals to a team is impossible through emotes. 
---
Everything else though is easy as hell once you realize that dying in NW doesnt matter if you dont play it.
---
3 star legendary ranged weapon is 100 script and 75 with discount. Still sell for 40 script.
---
cause bethesda primary goal with NW is to make it as unenjoyable for people as possible
---
If the DR outside of power armor wasn’t so shit no one would use PA period. My sneak guy has like 540 DR and still goes down if he stubs his toe. It’s pathetic. My power armor guy can take probably close to a half minute long ass beating from wes tek mutants and he has like 36 hit points.
---
I guess just for shits and giggles, but they are underwhelming to say the least.
---
I can't remember what it is, but in the score track, I'm pretty sure there's like a sweet ass raider cage as one of the rewards. It's probably the item I'm most excited about for the season
---
If there's dumb easy challenged like claim a workshop scram armor or weps drink purified water I'll do em just because they're easy I dont go to nw to do any challenges because it's boring
---
Where did you find your first gourd?
---
I think a smaller version of that was datamined.
---
Schweet, thanks for confirming!
---
Alright then, that’s your opinion.
---
Yup. Fuck the legendary run and challenges (it was a good rework for challenges but that's what it was, it shouldnt have been some big part if a content update). I'll stay subscribed to first if you add game content. All the attention the atomshop gets drives me crazy and it's just so accepted now. Almost every suggestion on this subreddits for atom shop stuff.
---
For what its worth I was in the same boat. I paired down my *wants* for the heavy build so I could maintain dmg with rifles and found a great happy medium. Granted my heavy is BE .50 cal so doesnt really require a lot of dmg cards to be effective. There is a best of both worlds in my humble opinion.
---
I just picked them up last week I think, on sale for 400 atoms.
---
99% NW players have no mic lol I play music and no mic as I play because of it.
---
Yes, I would love that. Give us that and more functional clothing and armour instead of all the new looking furniture stuff. Living in an old wrecked boat would be cool!
---
Score is the endgame option lol don't like that? There will be another grind eventually
---
You've now managed to miss my point, about you missing the point.
---
I'd like to see mutant's weapons get buffed to stack like Junkies just to give people another viable build option.
---
Godzilla had a stroke trying to read that and he fucking died.
---
My character with the Gauss Shotgun is an unarmed melee build that uses a shotgun to cripple or tag. Since switching to a Gauss I find it does too much damage unspec , no VATS, to use as what I use it for.
---
So yeah it is pretty powerful even if you're not specd for it.
---
the problem I'm having is what we had before was more of an incentive for me to play longer and as the atoms started to accumulate during normal game play also made it an easier decision for me to put in 5-10 bucks at the end of the week for those extra few hundred atoms to buy something I found interesting in the atom store.
---
Now .. yeah I complete challenges just through normal game play as before .. but to me it's all garbage and the more I see these asinine popups of lunchboxes and power armor crap I feel LESS inclined to play now .. I've logged out at least 5 times now when I got stupid popups for crap I don't want .. would never buy and have no interest in .. in the MIDDLE of fucking combat .. irritated the shit out of me .. plus I DIDN'T WANT IT!
---
The atoms awarded, like we had previously was much more accommodating to my play style
---
I should mention .. I'm the type of player that I think in TOTAL have looked at the dailies/weekly challenges maybe 3-5 times in TOTAL since I bought at release .. 
---
But again earning atoms the way I used to incentivized me to pop into the atom shop every couple of play sessions cause they added up to a few hundred which encouraged me to spend a few bucks .. 
---
And again this is from my perspective .. I haven't put any money into the shop since this update and will not for the foreseeable future I am now a 100% mooch .. and again will logout when aggravating popups during combat tell me I got shit I don't want given to me for shit I'll never use
---
Got to get the dailies in haha
---
Literally forgot that hot piece of ass existed.
---
In game chat settings are in the audio tab under general settings
---
sure buddy
---
So you are saying he is close to a good idea! Let's help ThatOneGuy10 out.
---
How about 5k gives you 10% for 24 hours.
---
hahaha, great answer! The thing is I feel the same way than the OP, but yes, to come here to "anounce" it, it's just ridic.
---
But the cryolator can freeze the SBQ.
---
Why need to do all this? Just join a team. Apply XP perk cards, take perk edibles and join a builders team. Enjoy the game and you will level in no time.
---
I love my power armor but the lack of carrying capacity forces me to only use it to kill the queen or events where i basically stand in one place firing in a circle. 
---
Would love a power armor backpack or something.
---
Yesterday I opened my game 7 hours after reset and 5 of my dailies and 2 weeklies were autocomplete. Also I've only ever played NW once several days ago. For this reason I dont think being online in NW or during the reset causes it.
---
also the stabilizer perk for heavy guns is probably one of the main reasons to use PA, especially during boss events
---
Where would one find this info?
---
Right?! Isnt that one of the biggest complaints about PA is  lack of poison resist...
---
I dont even use PA and i feel for them.
---
I found one at my CAMP the other day and felt so blessed!! I wish I could have tamed it ... how do you tame animals?? Will it work on cats?
---
This is beautiful
---
I want to donate caps to the Mothman Cult. Let me have a friendly Mothman visit my cap every once in a while and give the 5% buff from the lighthouse.
---
I could get behind this because its basically a useless prefix right now.
---
Totally. I can't use the wallpaper because it looks so weirdly new next to all of the other broken stuff. Give us steel bars, peeling wallpaper and fissure pits please!
---
Either that or after level 50 you can have the option for a second SPECIAL tree you can choose to apply points to. Then swap between them
---
Did the damage appear yellow the second time
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but 250 SCORE points = 25,000 XP. 
---
25,000 XP represents hours of gameplay.
---
I went into NW yesterday for the deploy your camp challenge and cleared those 250 Score points in less than 10 minutes. 
---
I don't normally play NW, but just for the sake of it, I've been dabbling a bit. So, I'll probably go look for some locks to pick a bit later. It's your time, do what you want with it. But skipping those challenges is like leaving free money sitting on the table.
---
Good to hear positive stories like this! Upvoting for visibility.
---
i haven't been able to find these :(
---
You get 10 and then they're gone.  What a waste and they're not even good looking fireworks, it's just an X in the sky.
---
The keybinding in this game sucks. Your best bet is to use a 3rd party program to remap the keys of your keyboard. Or as I do my keyboard has a built in software  to have any key act like a different key.
---
Well don’t think Bethesda is going to see it as a good idea either.
---
I couldn't forget about this gun even if I wanted to, too many times trying to call the minutemen on fallout 4 and they never appeared.
---
With 25% off, you can fit in 33% more shit!
---
Hey its all good i think i love trains to much lol
---
Animal Friend allows you to tame only animals but Wasteland Whisperer allows you to tame only creatures. I believe this one is classed as a creature. I did unequip the perks after heading to my CAMP but it made no difference. The problem is that he's not actually hostile. He just behaves that way, but he doesn't damage anything &amp; his 'health' bar is always yellow. I just think it has something to do with him being Scorched? I also assume it's a he, can't quite tell yet, LOL.
---
Yeah, I'm the same way. And I even won two games as well last week through mostly bush strats and well thrown grenade at the end.
---
Yeah, it seems the farther away you are from the target the lower the damage. I noticed this yesterday when I turned on the option to see damage
---
No. Both were white numbers.
---
No. Paying caps for buffs is a terrible idea now that I’ve had a second to think about it. 
---
Even 5,000 caps for 10% for 24. A day long buff is just not practical. 
---
People bitch about paying 30-40 caps for fast travel. They aren’t going to pay 5,000 caps for a 10% buff when there’s already that in the game for free.
---
FO4 only had one star legendaries. They introduced the legendary system with 4. 
---
Before it was pretty much just named weapons that did anything special (if it did anything special at all, some of them were just uniquely named), like “That Gun” or “Lincoln’s Repeater.”
---
All guns have a range limitation. If you’re far enough away damage does start to drop off.
---
This link has all the rewards, scroll to the bottom for seasonal:

---
So you can see how much XP you need for each thing, if you want to keep track of it or just guesstimate.
---
I am still not really sure why they shut down survival, was it that resource-intensive to keep?
---
The point of this discussion post was not to be self-important, but to highlight that I think NW being tied to a core progression system is not something i'd like to see.  
---
What is the point of an online forum if not to discuss our positions?
---
tecnically the hunted/hunter radio is supposed to be that but I don't know if anyone ever uses it
---
Maybe it’s the bullet losing velocity so it doesn’t hit as hard because they are far away. Another user answered what I was going to put as I was typing it hahaha.
---
Where do you stand when doing it solo? She'll only stagger if people have the relative perks enabled.
---
Idk from what I know it’s cause of how laggy those servers were and survival was the way how most people duped
---
Wasn’t trying to pitch it to Bethesda buddy. They rarely use community made ideas anyway. Plus I just make these posts to read people’s reactions and thoughts.
---
Alright thanks
---
Unless I'm mis reading, this is falloff damage.  Your gun has a range at which it does full damage (effected by mods), the farther something is outside of this range the less damage you do until its 0.  A good test is on the scorch beast queen, where when she is flying I will do as little as 20 damage, but when she lands and I'm kind of close its 192 per shot.
---
Put the best mods you can on your gun that increase the range of it.  If your on xbox ill be on after 7pm Eastern and can mod it out for you if you want.
---
One time back in the 30s.  I just logged off and on.
---
That does answer my question thanks! I assume it’s based off the range stat of the gun? What is it based on like if I have 204 is that Meters? Feet? Units?
---
Yeah you don’t wanna just skip through things. Take your time to read terminals, notes, and talking to people and bots. Usually in Fallout, if you can’t figure out what to do it’s because you skipped through the details. I’ve done that myself quite a few times, and every time I go back it’s something awesome or useful I missed out on. 
---
My buddy claims he doesn’t read the terminals because they’re boring and I’m like “welp, that’s why you’re always asking me what the hell is going on in the game and how to do things lol.”
---
Only ever used it once. Haven’t really seen others using it.
---
I dont use PA but somekind of buff could be nice for people that uses PA
---
She'll only stagger if people have the relative perks enabled. She'll only land if the player she's aggro'd to is in a position that she can land on.
---
Thanks. I forgot about that trick.
---
I spent a while collecting the cores laying around, fast traveling to the entrance, and turning on and off the quest. Finally just quit.
---
That seems about right. Thanks for the answer! Do you know what the range is based on? Like Meters, Feet, units?
---
It's nothing personal.  Just poking a bit of fun.  
---
Although if you want to discuss let's discuss:  Not only is it not required to do the NW challenge at all or any challenge on the pass for that matter, you can get to 100 without completing any NW daily as they have repeatable challenges as substitutes as well as Double Xp and double daily events planned.  
---
Furthermore, the NW challenges are very easy such as "place your camp 3 times" which takes 7 seconds.   The only reason to not do this is laziness.
---
Lastly, there are people who love NW and they should get a small representation in the challenges.  How do you think people who only play NW feel?  They get totally shafted.
---
I agree. I wasn't worried about missing out on the daily 250,but I logged in today and noticed that there is a weekly NW challenge for 1000. While this isn't game-breaking, I think it's a little too much incentive for me to do something I don't want to do consistently.  
---
There's nothing wrong with the Nuclear Winter game-mode itself, that's just not the game i'm trying to play when I launch fallout.
---
On the ground east of the bunker where there’s enough room for 50 of her to land, on the bunker itself, on the fence, on my tent...I’ve personally tested everywhere that people say “forces her AI not to trigger landing,” and they all work. Well, rather, there’s no difference than a “paY TO WiNeR” being on their tent and being on flat open ground. She still hardly lands. At least from my own experience.
---
In retrospect this should have been obvious to me.
---
It'd also be nice if the crafting perks were in their own tree so you don't have to swap them in and out. Obviously we all want ammosmith and super duper on when we craft and something else when in combat. So let's streamline that.
---
Where is a spot with locks to pick. I defo need to finish that one.
---
Reddit is weird that way, I think if someone doesn't have the problem they see the question or complaint as a lie and a slight against the game so they downvote. I don't know  🤷‍♂️
---
Exactly. I've cussed out players of my own team and guilitly, theyll join the rest of us, then we'll come together and have a great team. I have very little patience for people who like to hide in bushes.
---
Not true at all. They often listen to players. 
---
If you aren’t pitching it with some hope of Bethesda noticing it, then your just chatting. Which is fine. But you seem only interested in other people’s ideas if they are flattering to you. 
---
I say good day to you and your poorly thought out idea. Please no need to respond. But you will.
---
There's nothing wrong with the Game-mode, I just don't think it should be attached to core progression to the degree it is. Having 1 daily challenge is fine, but now there's a weekly challenge for 1000.
---
👏
---
Dammit, I just spent all my scrip.
---
Yeah, it’s at level 50. I’m at 25 now, so in a week, maybe two I’ll have that. That and the firefly lamps. Beyond that though, there isn’t much Im interested in. That secret fireplace door is super nice too, but I’m using a pre-existing cabin for my camp, so I can’t use it. Maybe one day if I ever move...
---
&gt; It's actually a lot of fun to play extreme hide and seek
---
Have you ever played the horror game Outlast? You have absolutely no way to defend yourself and have to hide from everything trying to kill you. That's how I treat NW and I get a lot of enjoyment out of it.
---
Time for the surprise fake doors to make a return
---
I'll try Sunday next time, very odd design, if it is by design and not just spaghetti coding.
---
Whatever the range is on the weapon is most likely it's drop off distance. I assume it's in feet
---
I stand corrected, what exp perks are you using? Just inspirational  or are there others?
---
It’s probably supposed to be meters, but it seems to just be magical Fallout units.
---
Feel like it's going to be more of a buy respec kits at this point.
---
Eddit: Else why has it taken this long already for a game of this type?
---
&gt;There was a key word before forced, "feeling".
---
Don't give a shit what nonsense you got in your head.  I feel like I should be god of the universe.  Bow down to me!
---

---
You just need to memorize them in adventure mode. Then practice it in NW
---
Bethesda does have plans to roll out pet functionality, but they haven't done it as of yet.
---
Im not even saving, cause i know if i screw my self there is a chance to get a discount, if i save, its 100% chance that it wont apply to modules lol.
---
It's best to buy the plan, make them and then break those down.
---
Easy fix - server hop on Deathclaw Island or Abandoned Waste Dump. You’re a melee build so I reckon you can take 2 Deathclaws at once. Go for AWD for 2 higher level DCs or DI for the less difficult kill.
---
Near Monogah mine NE part of the map in a trailer has one, but lately it's been a hot spot for spawning so it would be unsafe to unlock that safe.
---
I’m pretty sure all cards that are supposed to keep your weapons and armor from breaking so quick are messed up atm I know weaponsmith is.
---
the safes are locked and randomly placed, there are no locked loot chests.
---
In Morgantown there is a house in the very bottom left corner of the map. Safe is in the basement.  In Flatwoods, there is a boat with a safe in it on the very bottom of the map. After picking that one I turned left and followed the cliff until you get to the bridge. There is a safe under the bridges. Those are the ones that I picked.
---
Sludge works and blood eagle lookout have a good amount of blood eagles who have a high chance of spawning with handmade
---
Im not exactly sure, I just count them as units.  I know they start with 123 range, and with a Long Barrel can go up to 207, and you loose some with a compressor or suppressor.
---
Flatwoods has 3 locked fertilizer containers in the greenhouses at Vault Tec Ag Center, plus another safe. Morgantown has 4 all around Morgantown trainyard, they’re the Responder supply caches. You can scout those in advance in Adventure mode to see where they are.
---
We need a setting to turn off those popups as well as the legendary item popups.
---
I have nothing against the game-mode. I just don't want to engage with it the way they are incentivizing us to do. I have no interest in making NW a daily part of my gameplay, I simply don't care about the mode and don't think it should be tied so closely to progression.   
---
That said, I don't mind doing extra grinding to avoid having to do it.
---
Scrapping a normal perk card gets you 1 coin. It costs 100 coins to go from lv1 -&gt; lv2, and another 150 to go from lv2 -&gt; lv3
---
you could always pay someone to make you loads
---
Why do folks assume that everyone has unlimited time to play the game?  Some of us gots things to do!  Or, rather, other games to play ;)
---
Cool
---
Thanks you sir I forgot about the waste dump!
---
Yeah it is sad. Just hope it gets fixed soon
---
There is a locked box just south of the Morgantown Train Yard, in the two story building next to the railroad tracks.
---
You can spawn right next to it, jump in, unlock the box - then probably immediately die because someone else had the same idea.
---
I'm not sure if having principles is dumb. It's certainly not advantageous to my rank.
---
In the riding shotgun caves one spawns sometimes by a firebreather corpse 
---
I believe it is after the half way be captain
---
woohoo, thanks
---
The thing is: what for?
---

---
Luckily it completed the weekly challenge yesterday when doing tha daily one of placing the camp back to back. Not a big fan nw but ive had some laughs both solo and in a team.
---
I spawned by the Morgantown train yard and ran up to the top of the tower there where you can always find a locked chest. Log out and do it again 2 more times. No one ever spawned there with me, either.
---
Upvote this into infinity, please
---
You don't need F1st; there are always a bunch of unclaimed workshops in public, too. I just grabbed 5 in less then 10 minutes last night.
---
The best NW challenge would be “Survive X minutes while teammates are nearby.” Basically, log in and stick together—you know, the thing that actually makes NW fun and increases your chances to win. 
---
If people don’t like NW that’s fine, go grind some XP in adventure mode, it’ll equal out.
---
Get the plan, make them level 15, scrap them with scrapper perk, repeat (usually get a mod every time)
---
Man that building has so much wasted potential content. But sadly its useless.
---
Mutants should work like junkies. It would make it a little more vaired with builds.
---
Did you have a wallpaper in place before switching? From my experience, it only removes items if its a fresh wall with no wallpaper.
---
I am a fan of NW, and placing the camp three times just to place it is not my idea of fun. And it's not really playing the mode as intended, IMO
---
It's funny, I've seen a lot about this on Reddit, but nothing on Bethesda's website. Secret sale? Not in "Inside the Vault" or atom shop update for this week. In fact, haven't seen a damn thing about this from Bethesda. Out of curiosity, what is your source?
---
and the weekly is just "do the daily three times".
---
like, you put in the same amount of effort last week.
---
I'm open
---
They never have in the past.
---
Uhm, Fallout is WAY off the mark there - always has been. What we see in Fallout 4 is what things would look like after 25 years.  After 200 with no humans maintaining things NOTHING would be left.
---
Take a look of pictures of the cities near Chernobyl.  They haven't had human habitation in 34 years since the meltdown.
---
You are starting to sound alot like president Eden.... Is it truly the brotherhood you serve or the enclave?
---
[https://youtu.be/WbW-SMRfxlw](https://youtu.be/WbW-SMRfxlw)
---
Appreciate you. I should be able to do that and still play the round on my own.
---
Same, with +33% it's a one hit kill on almost anything
---
Actually. This is a debate that goes back 2 decades now in EQ, WoW, FFXI, and many MMOs.  
---
WoW would actually go back and fourth each expansion over how to handle stuff like this.  
---
Essentially it can be a design choice to prevent players from going overly nuts in a single session, being forced to cpread it out over multiple sessions.  
---
BUT and I say this with love.  
---
I doubt this is on purpose. This game has so many problems it is probably yet another oversight.
---
How ever do you get into the saddle of that horse you rode in on?
---
I believe todd already said something:
---
*It just works*
---
I think it would be cool if you can get 5 star but you have to do something really challenging to get it, maybe like a dungeon hosted by Richard Dunn with a ton of lvl 100+ creatures in it
---
I use a very tall ladder. Doesn’t your mom get tired of helping you type even simple messages?
---
Seriously!?
---
Yep it's good for those without the time, I can easily level up a couple times a day just playing normally
---
110
---
I really tried to make a house that could have been in the game but It just doesnt look completely satisfying.. 
---
A list of items I wish could be a thing:
---
-A outdoor floor that blends in well in the environment.. could be stone or wood.
---
-A nice looking fence to have on a balcony
---
-Ordinary wallpapers with some sign of damage in many dusty shades. 
---
- wooden floors with no shine in a dark shade 
---
-a working chimney with a chimney top and smoke
---
-More authentic 1950s items 
---
-1930s items
---
-Spiral stairs
---
-Electric lights with a warm tone
---
-Picture frames where you could show images you have taken in the game. (I dont know if it would work though) 
---
Would be great if you could choose between a damaged or new look on wallpapers.
---
You don’t, but it prevents any unwanted PvP
---
Pics of what? Completed challenges? Anyone can do that and ask for refunds even if they got it done. They should be able to detect it inside the company.
---
imagine those "raider camps" having custom spawn point, not a chance, one of few things bethesda did right
---
Mother died in 2011 asshole.
---
I agree, which is why I only make this post after seeing that there is also a weekly challenge now.   
---
1 daily challenge is very easily offset by exp farming, but if we start introducing weekly or multiple daily NW challenges, It may become very hard for someone to reach rank 100 without interacting with NW.   
---
As a principle, I think the normal game-mode should be the vector for most, if not all, progression. I understand that many people really like the mode, and I do think they should be rewarded and incentivized, but optimally that would manifest within NW in my opinion.
---
&gt;The best NW challenge would be “Survive X minutes while teammates are nearby.” Basically, log in and stick together—you know, the thing that actually makes NW fun and increases your chances to win.
---
I agree 100 percent. The current NW challenges don't do any of the stuff that you mentioned and that is my real complaint.    Again, I am not speaking as a NW hater. I am someone who likes NW and enjoys playing it.  But the current SCORE challenges are not fun and make the mode less fun overall.
---
I would like it to be handled more realistically as well. The log cabin in the atom shop is spot on as far as appearance for something I, the player, freshly built (The roof of said cabin shouldn't have immaculate steel available though).  People aren't going to build things in a dirty ruined state - but they will use what items they can scavenge if they can be cleaned up.
---
Only if you hang around :P
---
It doesn’t say that it’s part of the atomic shop though
---
I thought it was pretty obvious seeing how in adventure mode you aren’t limited to 1 perk card per special. You get 7 cards, use how you want.
---
How many times do you reckon you've done each of the bullion quests to grind this? I just can't stand doing the same fetch quests over and over.
---
Very nice. I've got the PA, mini, shotgun and plasma caster. Working on SS armor now. Lemme tell ya, the scrip grind is waaaaaaaaay more disheartening to me than the gold grind. You can work ahead and skip days with bullion, just log in to trade in notes. There's no skipping in scrip, and that 150 daily limit gets mighty insulting weeks into grinding legendary rolls.
---
Hmmmm..... Maybe im wrong ill check after work. But double check the 4th special cause i thought i saw it there
---
Guess I'm the odd one I want them all to come to me for an ass woopin
---
Yeah, it's called "Start new character". You can have up to 5 / account y'know.
---
I totally knew you’d say that. Sorry I used to do that to people when I was 12.
---
double SCORE weekend is barely going to mean shit for the people that have been locked out of challenges.
---
I got the snowflake armor recently so I guess I can use that as a type of baseline. No idea how much xp I earned since then.
---
I agree.
---
i love the BoS as a faction because of their story, and in other games (the exception being 4 because Arthur Maxson is a little turd who craps on his great-grandfather's legacy) I usually side with them willingly. the main issue with them is after Roger Maxson died they sort of lost the point of what he was doing 
---
that said the main reason i "joined" them in 76 is cuz they were all dead. i was basically just getting free shit to do what i wanted with. since they're gonna return, time will tell if i'm a gung-ho paladin like in 3, or if im gonna bomb them out of the sky with mortars lile in 4. or just let them do their own thing like in NV.
---
I guess people can complain about everything. The fact is, after a certain point in your leveling, you can pretty much do just about everything in the game with only decent-level gear. I say that based on experience with a fairly casual approach to the game (but I do play alot), i.e. full health build with a mix of decent weapons and ok armor. Nothing meta or OP. I added a mule account just to have someplace to put all my caps. So I have 6 characters hauling 150K+ caps around while I look for something to spend it on. Trust me. just play the game and you will eventually go from zero to hero. The game is well designed in that respect.
---
Usually it has the atom logo thingy but it doesn’t have it next to it in the camp building menu
---
The 3 dailies from wastelanders? Done them everyday
---
There's nothing particularly wrong w/quality structures from an "immersion" standpoint. Basic construction, particularly using wood and stone, were mastered by humanity LONG before the modern era. You don't need advanced tools and infrastructure to make a not crappy house. If anything, the idea the you could only build ramshackle structures in Fallout 4, over two CENTURIES after the war is what is immersion breaking. 
---
Considering that Fallout 76 takes place 25 (26, now) years after the bombs and a considerable amount of survivors predate the apocalypse, there should be a mix of styles in Appalachia. All of the folks whose original jobs/skill-set were completely unrelated would have to scavenge and makeshift as best as they can. But people w/carpentry and construction knowledge (as well as all of the residents of Vault 76, who have been trained for rebuilding) would be perfectly capable of building a quality, if potentially primitive, structure.
---
No worries man, happy wandering
---
WAT? i've been saving up my scrip ):
---
 I've played outlast a little, pretty sure we got it on ps+ a while back. Didn't play very much because it's not Fallout or Monster Hunter so all it was doing was stopping me from playing those. 😁 I may have to give it another go. 
---
I like the fact that you can all but ignore NW as well. My wife is after the ghillie suit she missed the first time around so while she is at work I have her system on running her through NW while I gather cranberries and wood for the inevitable Score grind when she gets home.
---
Money lost all its value after the bombs. Now if you acquire any sensor modules, I suggest you turn them into the nearest Scribe Quartermaster.
---
Sheepsquatch shards do a lot of damage and have no level
---
Ok thanks! So
---
If you used 6, 3 rank cards (worst case)
---
Level 1 - 600 coins
---
Level - 900 coins
---
1500 coins total?
---
Didn't they say they changed it so there isn't a value difference between gold or normal cards?
---
And if we get 5 cards every 5 levels... At 300 we should have about 300 cards or coins (not including the recent cards from SCORE).
---
So is this accurate and maxing out the new perks would be a long road? Or did I miss cards quantities we should have. I must be wrong, I would think you would be able to have more legendary perks by level 300.
---
Yeah. Well thanks for the answer. I just thought maybe range is how far the projectile would go like in some games the projectile is “deleted” if it goes past it’s range.
---
Thanks! It's definitely a head scratcher.
---
Yep. Straight salt. And it’s confusing because people praise the shit out of this community, but the second you say something opposing or even just different than what the majority is you get downvoted to hell. It doesn’t even have to be negative just something different than what they want. Pretty toxic if you ask me. Anytime I see harmless comments with downvotes I always give that person an updoot. No reason someone should receive negative karma for just adding  their neutral input to a conversation.
---
There are some new perks, some removed ones, but essentially it's the same uninspired sh\*t.
---
The worst part is that they kept their stupid perk scrapping/perk point system, which is so badly thought. It's very disappointing.
---
Morgantown there’s a farm north of Bolton greens, and in the big barn is always a locked box.
---
Ingram mansion second floor is a safe on the wall in the bedroom, always locked.
---
Flatwoods along the bridge, top run, is a locked toolbox along with a bobble head and a cooler.  It’s better to start on central side to get this one.
---
I will have to remember this
---
Yeah, they're basically like those challenges they got for atoms of brewing 76 teas or gather 7600 wood. The entering ones were short and the dull were extended to the point of it not being worth the time lost. More like doing chores than challenges.
---
becareful when scraping junk, the cores can get scrapped
---
True, if only modules are what you want, then this doesn't apply, but idk about you, I could use some good non-character restricted weapons...BE90 .50cal please RNGesus please!
---
in 3 they found a robot that threw nukes like footballs and turned it towards their enemies. twice if you side with them in 4.
---
the BoS without Roger Maxson will DEFINITELY use the nukes.
---
4's BoS is basically Enclave 2.0, change my mind
---
If that happens, I will pour out a concrete mixer in your memory and enjoy the building set for you.
---
Honestly in a lunch pail somewhere. Its kinda rare. Find a camp to borrow from to start yours or jump around in flatwoods to grab all food spawn stuff.
---
I think they would have to be raider items. We are pre-war dwellers. We are rebuilding the world. Year one, we made Appalachian life adaptable to the scorched. This year, we are rebuilding the economy, and populations are emerging. 5 years down the line (before nuclear winter destroys everything) it will look very pre-war.
---
It was kind of a mess yesterday. Someone started Scorched Earth in my game while I had her in NW. Very difficult to do both at the same time. 😂
---
Correct, needs to be found in world with rads on it
---
Whining works.  Western civilization is currently being shredded by cry-bullies.  It makes you immune to covid and don't get arrested marching in tight groups screaming your head off, but try to get a haircut and you're in jail.  It lets you tear down abolitionist statues that you have no idea what they even are that almost no one wants ripped down and get no punishment, but paint over a terror group's graffiti and you get thrown in jail for a hate crime.  You can take over a section of a city get people killed and the mayor will call it a summer of love... until you march on her house.  It even lets you burn down huge chunks of towns, get over 20 people murdered including children and somehow you're still the good guy.  It even lets you run news networks that do nothing but pump out fake news 24/7 that get proven wrong day after day and it's still allowed to persist because you hurt my feelings!
---
Ah that’s why he is so annoying
---
I agree. I’ve really come around on NW. I used to hate it because I wasn’t good at it and always just hid in bushes. Once I started actually trying and sticking with my team I found that I got better—I’m still not good, but not embarrassing anymore—I started having fun with it and actually play it voluntarily now a lot. 
---
Challenges that encourage people to just go in and cheese the game won’t convert any new players. You’re absolutely right, they should encourage proper gameplay, not taking turns jumping off air traffic control towers.
---
Not a problem, never though to do that as it seemed kinda braggy. Also would I post all the junk too or just # of rolls and here's the good stuff? Lots of screenshots for PS4 to handle lol
---
the alarm breaks stealth.. thats what alarms are for
---
mistake #1 was not shooting them all in the face to death from stealth..
---
you dont get XP leaving mobs alive..
---
better luck next time
---
Agreed! Hope they bring back the raider assets from f04 at the very least. The hanging bone chimes you get for free only go so far in getting that scavver ambiance.
---
Ahh i see you understand my concern
---
Instantly excited for "Ammo Factory" and "What Rads?". The exact perks I was hoping for!
---
No one is saying it shouldn’t already be in the game. The dude is just saying he’s fortunate to be on PC and able to use mods in the meantime until bethesda implements perk loadouts.
---
If the existing perimeter wall frames would snap to a foundation, that would go a long way. Trying to build them on bare ground is pointless, but you can't build them on flat foundation surfaces.
---
Sadly yea. Otherwise, if you are solo, you need FO1st membership to jump to your own server quickly. SO there IS a paid way...
---
I want to be done now so I can whine about having nothing to do for the next 8 weeks.
---
Imagine having a respec system haaaahhhhh
---
I'm glad there are at least a few reasonable people here
---
Nice man. I'll get there sometime. Grinding SCORE atm is killing my 4th and 5th character progressions
---
I already have all serum plans, mods etc from enclave. I don't know what caps are for now...except 6k for weekly gold bullion and fast traveling..what a joke
---
It can spawn at any "Assault Random Encounter" point. There are around 20 of them on the map.
---
How could they have possibly known that I took the key? I looted the container earlier, so its illogical to think the chest itself was rigged or what have you. It’s a design shortcut.
---
This is the most pro of all pro tips. Throwing knives hit like a freight train at a time in your character development where it takes full clips from pathetic pipe weapons to kill enemies. I have used them well into my level 20s on multiple characters.
---
Legendary Ability... Nice
---
I think that the "complete 3 NW challenges" weekly challenge is new this week. So assuming they fix it soon,  an extra 9000 score should help offset most of the lost score
---
Ah ok, yes I did. My bad 😩
---
What bethesda needs to do is hop over to Nexus mods and browse the top downloaded cosmetic mods for Fallout 4. That's what people want to see in the Atom shop.
---
Homemaker Extended... Ponytail Hairstyles by Azar... Settlement Supplies Expanded... Commonwealth Cuts... OCDecorator... Snappable Junk Fences... Lots More Hairstyles... etc...
---
One thing you don't see in the top mods on Nexus is the cutesy tween girl style decor they've been stuffing into the ATX. That stuff exists but it's not even half as popular as the stuff that's realistic for the game type.
---
I am having the same type of issue.    
---
I was about to buy those dang robot vendors because they are hilarious so, to prepare, I was rearranging my camp and built "scaffolds" (just plain wooden floors of all sizes) to access backs of walls for wiring and such, and now I can't delete them! My camp hangs off of a cliff, by the waterfall, and uses the natural walls quite well.  It's DAYS of rearranging to get it right if I have to rebuild the entire camp, because I have found it impossible to blueprint.  
---
 I ALWAYS build using scaffolds, and I have never had this issue before.  I know what I am doing ... lol.   
---
Long story short ... no camp  budget left and it looks like utter crap now with the plain wooden floors and metal stairs everywhere that I can't get rid of.  
---
I guess I will save my money until it is fixed (don't really have a choice).  These first world problems, I know ... but still ... I pay for Fallout First, and I do expect the game to function in the most basic sense.  Camp building is what separates this game from all the rest, and if IT won't work ... I might as well play something else.
---
I can never place my camp when moving. Always get the "needs support" glitch/error. Even though I'm using items as intended, such as hanging pictures on walls or putting vases or lights etc on tables, it somehow renders the game unable to place the camp when moving. It sucks but just rebuild and carry on.
---
You will get the bulk of the points for a week playing 1 day as the weeklies + 1 day are more than the other 6 days of points.
---
If you have a busy job, pay $10 for some atoms and just buy off whatever final ranks have the crap you want.
---
Seriously, if you barely play the game, you should barely care about some cosmetics which, being cosmetic, you should barely care about in the first place.  How pretty your virtual Barbie is isn't even the draw of a post-apocalyptic murder simulator.
---
fully agree
---
This list is from a differnt game right.  No way the same people thought of these.  This makes me super excited.
---
Salty people who can’t handle losing their junk. Use flamer traps, radiation emitter, trip wires, pressure plates. Basically try to make an inescapable room with a powered door. You can put flame traps behind walls and they will bust down the wall when activated and burn up your poor victim.
---
I think you can buy it with Scout Badges from one of the wee machines at the Scout Camps.
---
There's a reason Americans learn little about Canada that's fairly obvious, but I'm not going to be rude enough to point it out.
---
oooooh
---
Mine seems to work fine.
---
There was an update a while back, I forget which one, but it litteraly made my armor unbreakable. I saw other people comment too that it was happening for them.
---
Congrats! I am on my way too. I’ve got the SS under armor, chest and helmet. Just bought the gauss shotgun + mods and now working on gauss mini gun. Then I’ll finish my SS armor. 
---
Grindy grind grind
---
There’s no cap but it doesn’t make sense to get more than 300 DR because of the amount of damage enemies deal
---
Who downvotes facts? Lol
---
Cool. So, how is it that some people have tamed Deathclaws and Mirelurk kings to hang out at their CAMPS?
---
Does this mean I can use let’s say, ghillie paints on a new character after the event is over?
---
Without spoiling the storyline....isn't there someone who could...TEACH you? You could go to that npc and give them caps....say 3k? It's not like a facility doesn't exist with all the needed equipment to strength your various areas of knowledge. Its sorta like changing your major in school right?
---
well that comes down to shitty design because it isnt a quest item until after you talk to becket..
---
the alarm sounds when you take the key (as a quest item) out of the trunk..
---
the key should not appear in the chest prior to talking to him.. 
---
all the rest of it I am ok with..
---
Respec is coming with One Wasteland
---
I don't have that and it still one shots almost anything. And if the first hit doesn't kill it they're usually on the brink or crippled. Or both.
---
Thanks for these. I was going to check myself but the launcher is throttling the crap out of my connection and downloading at a snails pace. 
---
Instantly I'm on for Ammo Factory AntiVenom and the Legendary ability. Even without the rest I'd be delighted with those personally.
---
You're right, but, I have been doing that to remove items, I've done it in the past, too ... and right now this isn't working either.  It's just creating more crap you don't want.  There is something really off right now with building.
---
Yeah, most of these are super easy, although the NW ones have been a real mixed bag.  For the NW ones you do also get some bonus cosmetics though if you haven't gotten the Christmas/Halloween already.
---
I love it to death and now with the public teams + strange in numbers, having birdbones also adds to how much mobility you stack with the jet pack
---
Apparently you haven't tried it lately, because most of the prefabs have a reduced cost now
---
Most big prefabs consume around 10% of your camp budget.  So for my camp it consumes about 35% to construct the 4 units that I placed.  The rest of my budget, a whopping 65% can be utilized for decorations, workbenches, etc. which don't consume a lot.  Turrets, Purifiers, Mothman signs, neon signs, etc. are the big budget eaters. 2 turrets take as much budget as an entire prefab.
---
Pretty much. Things like the legendary run seasons has perk packs as some of the rewards, so there may be more cards available
---
Because my Team mates won. Or because I caught the last opponent of guard and killed him. Happened allot actually
---
I was doing that but now I have to farm screws haha
---
what rads, and infiltrator hell yeah.
---
so glad they kept what rads, gonna have such high synergy with my solar set
---
imma have to sit down and look through the rest to see what will work for me
---
Just start out with "for info purposes only" so people don't think your bragging and just post everything even the junk(then people really won't think your bragging because whos jealous of junk items anyways) maybe take screenshots of only the best items tho but it would be awesome to see what 3k script gets ya
---
Lightweight mininuke? What is that?
---
that has never been a thing. ever.
---
In one of the bunkers near the Galleria place
---
It’s fantastic. An AAE flamer with that perk.. magnifico
---
Yeah that'd be great too
---
How do you guys get the radscorpions to spawn in so that I can kill them?  I can't beat the mission bc of the scorpions. No matter what level I have been, they always are higher level and kill me fast, I cant even run bc they dig and spawn next to you again. I was just watching someone beat the mission, and all of THEIR radscorpians were level 15s and he was level 30. I am level 40+ and they still kill me.  What gives? Someone said they are broken, but IDK. Any ideas? I'm getting really disheartened that I will ever beat this. I read about someone being level 105 and STILL having issues with it... Also, if I manage to hide and kill the crawler (which is level 51 and legendary compared to my lvl41) earlier in the level, it never drops any loot. And my follower is useless.
---
No, it's just the first time I bothered to look at the thread, and I was surprised that anyone replied.  I know you're keen to believe I was "triggered", or some kind of nonsense, but really, I'm more amused than anything else.
---
Also, I never said that I don't believe that reinforcing monetization won't cause Bethesda to introduce more.  My main point is that you really have no right to be upset with someone's money-spending choices.  That's not for you to judge, especially when such monetization you're ranting about is not obligatory.  
---
You don't have to be a Todd Howard/Bethesda shill/fanboy to understand common sense, like you seem to believe.  But hey, I know nothing's going to open your mind beyond the pinhole-sized space it's already in, so...whatever.  Take care.
---
You’re getting there, just keep at the grind! A fair warning though, there’s a decent XP gap between getting the skeleton suit and the final Christmas reward.
---
legendary gear @ max level
---
perks that back up your choice of legendary gear..
---
post your build into [nukes&amp;dragons](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks) so we can see what youre working with as a build..
---
uh.... they both kinda died without needing to fight each other lol
---
I read the blood eagles drop them but the few camps I went to I didn't get any. Hopefully I can find some at those locations, thanks!
---
Thank you for you response
---
Its True, they are, but I can lvl up as much as I want in one Day, not Here. Dont give me the repeatble bullshit. 100 SCORE is nothing and you know it.
---
Ps4?
---
Its litterally the worst. Rolling for SS as well. Bought first left leg, actually got lucky and got what i wanted in the first day. Then I started saving up on modules. Farmed bullion some days, got the plasma caster and two mods to it, then the chemist backpack. All of this while hoarding modules.
---
Then when I finally proceeded on the SS and got the right leg. Lets just say I am purchasing torso today, and so far I've settled on a 1\* vanguards cause the rest of the rolls are utter garbage. I swear Slow regeneration, hunters and nocturnal are the only ones I get.
---
Underrated comment.
---
Didn't know that lol it doesn't even say on the roadmap
---
True, I use one for that, sometimes. I guess it's helpful when the people there aren't going to be able to kill the queen helps keep her down.
---
Or they could just get a job and pay for Fallout first like I did.
---
Hey man if you're having difficulties join a team before jumping in and make sure you all have communication. Thats is pretty much what wins NW and keeps everyone alive. Start a LFG or you can add me on xbox and ill help you tonight. PipboyGaming
---
It was from the Inside the Vault on July 2nd.

---
Ghillie paints are account wide - once earned for one character they are earned by all. This is true of all atom shop purchases as well except the scrap boxes and repair kits.
---
That’s the clean U.S flag that you hang on walls. The one I’m talking about is on a flag pole like the mini flags on a presidents car but bigger
---

---
When have raiders not been murderous, thieving, slaver, a-holes?  Big part of 76's plot was how they murdered the town or doomed everyones SB attempts.
---
Should be a perk card
---
I love those because I get more ammo back than I use.
---
Think that when the legendary cards come out that some perk packs will mysteriously appear in the atom shop?
---
I don't know why they don't just put us into Vault 51 as a "lobby" while we wait for a match. That way we could adjust builds, open packs, and *read the $#@$ing lore scattered randomly around the vault*.
---
The whole "sitting at the loading screen for several minutes completely unable to do anything else and then load into a lobby with a random range of 30 seconds to 3 minutes' wait time" is the absolutely **worst** option they could have gone with.
---
It was on the most recent community calendar
---
Maybe someone else can answer this if you dont know, but for that last perk "What Rads?" If I was in a nuke zone and it says  6 rads, then would I only be really taking 5 rads with rank one of this perk? Or is that not how it works?
---
Edit: Also thanks so much for posting this!
---
Roger Maxson, the founder, was a genuinely good person who wanted to do what he felt was right to help people. he even went AWOL and turned against the US government when he found they were doing inhuman experiments (but the bombs dropping right after meant nobody in charge really cared). when he died, the organization got progressively worse to the point in 4, Arthur Maxson is a disgrace to his ancestor's memory.
---
76's dead BoS is the closest we've gotten to seeing Roger's version of the Brotherhood. no idea if the new living members coming later this year will be the same, or if they'll be more like 4's.
---
They seem to be more balanced with the armor instead of becoming op when wearing light medium or heavy armor its now gain +50 poison resistance when wearing a full set of matching armor and gain +50 flame resistance when wearing a full set of matching armor. Also there's legendary card for each special stat +1 to strength and intelligence +1 to charisma and agility ect
---
..... a lightweight mini nuke? 
---
What is the question here?
---
Someone else listed them btw
---
Bruh I said in the post instead of having to grind on a new character did you read it fully mate
---
Sweet thanks a bunch for taking a peek! 
---
Wasteland whisperer seems to be another one of those myths for taming. All you need to tame is animal friend rank 3, some things won't give you the option to pacify though and that's where wasteland whisperer kicks in. There's a list for which perk effects which creatures/animals, but for some reason animal friend 3 is all you need to tame anything.
---
What other system could they possibly implement? Doesnt it make sense to have to level up multiple times for a single legendary perk?
---
I got all the PA paints in like 70 turn ins, and it’s just bad RNG.
---
As a note, I think the NW weekly was an “extra” weekly. We had 8 this week vs 7 last week. Unless I’m just an idiot and remembering wrong.
---
Knowing Bethesda
---
Buttressed is a mod slot 1.
---
Custom fit is a misc mod slot. You can do both.
---
Yeah definitely
---
From what I can tell, its rad resist (like PA etc) with a rad away over time ability. So yeah Id imagine a nuke zone would be +6 then -1 rads. Out of a nuke zone it would be -1 rad
---
Can you share those locked áreas?
---
TBH that's kinda every faction of any decent size.  Nice groups tended to be plot footnotes that were overtaken by NCR, Brotherhood, Raiders, or Legion.in the games.
---
Yeah thanks for the heads up I saw the new thread repost. Dunno why my connection is being weird with the launcher, I still haven't managed to get the PTS downloaded yet. I had a short break to do the dailies but meh.
---
No, the clean US flag plan is both the wall flag and that one. The only ATX plan is the super tall outside flagpole.
---
Something that doesn't require me to be level like 1000
---
Just gotta get lucky with your squad. I joined one NW match for that challenge and one of my teammates immediately built a huge staircase and we took turns jumping off of it until we both got it done. Neither of us had mics.
---
Happy cake day btw
---
I wish but if wishes were fishes we'd all drown in riches. I'm still angry at the 6500 score I lost from the reset this week. Still sending in tickets to Beth hoping they decide it's an issue worth fixing. But they wont
---
That sucks.  I ended up learning those tricks for almost the same reason.  For me it was the part right before this where you pull/destroy cores to lower the laser grid.  Pulled every last one and the grid stayed up.  Same as you I messed around for 20 minutes double checking and then triple checking that I must have missed something somewhere.  Finally just turned the game off completely and was done for the day.
---
Sucks spending your time and resources just to hit a total roadblock.
---
Follow through sounds kind of op imo
---
Oh so the flag pole comes with the clean U.S plans that you get at the pioneer camp
---
Ok awesome thanks
---
I recognize their username, I'm like 75% sure that's an og veteran. You will probably see them again!
---
Yes.
---
Yeah true, but isnt that a problem with the costs of the perk cards? Not a fundamental  problem with the system?
---
Time to get some people to help me with the challenges....
---
Hahaha!  Someone had to say it.  
---
Just shoot the one right in front of you, pick it up and move to the next one. :)
---
“The road to hell is paved with good intentions”. I mean more towards Meg. How she doesn’t really want to do all that unless necessary and was taking in anyone who needed a place. Plus some of the leaders like Maggie, didn’t want that life.
---
Same thing happens for me. I go up to initiate the daily and Ward just launches right into the "I see you have our missing property.." I don't even know what the missing property is supposed to be lol I'm just glad that's one less chore to do.
---
Yeah mayby let it cost 5 upgrades + 5000 caps so people will not swich constantly but its still better than what we have now.
---
Well dat sux. I just got a bunch of 3 star furious flare gun, stalkers spatula, executioner's toilet roll.
---
the real question is how may legendary modules did it take!?
---
Internal code tags don't need to make sense to end users. They need to make sense to the developers. In this case, TX is a common shorthand for "transaction," so it's probably supposed to be something like "Atomic shop Transaction."
---
TIL there are white springs jumpsuit plans.
---
I've been playing since FO76 originally released and I only just got the first of the BOS Paintjobs from handing in Technical Data two weeks ago.
---
I didn't read it fully. And, in that case, I don't see why they should grant your request.
---
Looks like it's you...i got in no problem
---
Follow Through is my jam.
---
Tybber42 just wants you to know this is a terrible idea and you should be ashamed of yourself for coming up with it and posting it here.
---
same
---
Yeah, in for they rolled in to deal with the institute.  I assumed they only hung around in mass post game so player could still interact with them.
---
I feel your pain. I've never even thought of loading into NW, and I figured being logged in at reset would do it.. My reset always used to be at 11am my time, but now it's 12 noon, so when I logged in yesterday at 11:55, noticed the challenges- immediately logged out, closed the app, and turned my xbox off. Came back after the reset.. 6500 score lost.
---
I have the same issue. I use the raider chem backpack and keep myself under 300 carry weight but I get in my PA and suddenly I'm at like 1k because of all the chems and meds I have on me. No big deal since I don't use the armor much but it would be nice if I could use it when I wanted to lol.
---
You are definitely the only one. I search all reddit and did not found anyone with the same problem.
---
Could do fall damage for jet packing.
---
The most difficult NW challenge so far has been playing the mode for thirty minutes.  Compare that to some of the original challenges like winning a game or launching three nukes.
---
You're giving me hope! Just 48 more levels to go! :/
---
You think they will not add new currency for new dlc?
---
I got the GMG and plasma caster, gave up on settlers rep, and now working on t-65. Just need the helmet and arms. I've got 1950 bullion and 400 treasury notes, so this shouldn't take too much work. Just gotta log in every day for another 8 or 9 days.
---
I'm starting to believe. Thanks for the info.
---
Bet you don't have the SS Deep Pocket or Ultra Light mod for limbs
---
It’s on a loop.
---
It’s garbled due to distance.
---
It will clear up over time (updates).
---
Ty kind person for the info. I'm gonna try for it!
---
I shouldn't say this.. but that barely ever happens to me. But today 5/7 were completed when I logged in... pretty frustrating since that's the main reason to play right now...
---
The problem is that ideally we want to have all the legendary cards and change them out situationally. This is nigh impossible the way it is now. If 1% of players got 2 or more cards at max I'd be surprised. Thats not a very good way to make a system. This shit should be more accessible.
---
That was me for the first three months. It didn't even occur to me that there were two options. 😜
---
Odd. It wasn’t bait, it was my personal opinion based upon my observations of your conduct in the past. 
---
And, if it was bait... **you just took it**. Which means I didn’t have to ‘try harder’ at all. 
---
If you honestly thought it was bait, then you never should have replied. Now it just looks foolish on your part. 
---
Have a good day, ma’am.
---
I don’t see why they wouldn’t tbh but it just seems like the bullion has a already set in stone idk
---
I don't carry one around with me anymore but it does pretty solid damage even with zero shotgun perks. Mine was only a troubleshooters but did 440 something dmg in the pipboy with no perks.  That was at low health with adrenal reaction however.  
---
Mainly got sick of carrying the ammo for it and the weird bug where it won't reload was annoying too.
---
So, I ended up reading elsewhere that they won't snap to counters if you're building on a foundation.  I tried it out in the grass and sure enough, everything snapped together just fine.  I then just blueprinted the whole thing and moved it indoors.
---
I have the Buttressed on the chest, arms, and legs. The legs have the custom-fitted AP regen mod. Get the Underarmor and shielded Mod if you haven't yet. Hopefully, Beth will release deep-pocketed mods and others...
---
\+1 on "encouraging toxic playstyle," I actually like the concept of the mode. Execution however
---
Sadly they take up the same amount of budget :/
---
I only want PA if there will be Amish involved.
---
What does a backpack skin have to do with your Steampunk suggestion?
---
I think we are livid.. Or at least I am. I've sent in so many tickets to bethesda related to this. Lost 6500 score yesterday.
---
Banned.
---
Inspirational 
---
 well rested 
---
Canned meat stew (i have Carnivore so i get 10% exp)
---
 with the new lunchbox you can unlock on the score map you get very well rested
---
I've  gotten as high as +75% extra exp but you cant stack the exp buff your  self you need other people to open a lunchbox an it adds on to yours
---
(i  try to open one for big events like the queen an usually get at lest  one other person to open one) i don't think many people know the exp  buff stacks  yet??
---
Quest  
---
line in the sand  and  Guided Meditation  (radiation rumble is also good for this if you can get people to do it)
---
two  of the best exp events you can do with the amount of things to kill you  can easily do 2 maybe even 3 of the repeatable 10k weekly quest from  one completion of it
---
other then that chain events an kill max level super mutants
---
Thanks for posting the full list. 
---
Things look better this time around. Not perfect, but better. Gotta believe infiltrator will be popular for sheer convenience, but I feel like the stat boosting ones are gonna be everyone’s go-to. Being able to squeeze in a few more perks will be very hard to pass up. i hope they watch the numbers closely for % usage by the player base because a lot of other perks will probably get left in the dust. 
---
Also the lightweight mini nuke one is silly. I might take it just for shits and giggles on my launcher character. Wouldn’t mind seeing more goofy ones like that to be honest.
---
I Will not be able to look at him now without expecting him to say “I’m all fired up”
---
The reason for the budget it server stability. If they could increase it they would. We have seen some changes to the budget or the past years. They increased it one time by 40% and have made other adjustments to the value of items. Even Fallout 4 had a budget and it was offline.
---
I’m a little confused, at the milestone levels 50,75,100,150,200 and 300 do you get a free legendary perk and then you use perk coins to level that up or do you have to use the perk coins to buy the perks in the first place ?
---
&gt; **Legendary Ability - +1 to stat and +1 to available perk slots (theres one for each SPECIAL)**
---
Brain Implants!
---
I’m a bloodied shotgunner I use a bloodied gauss shotgun that does 4000 damage per shot once my nerd rage is going and my adrenal reaction and demolition expert I also use the 2mm ultra cite ammo
---
Yeah, so lower the cost of cards like I said. I'm kind of confused because the top commenter criticized the idea that you have to scrap perk cards to get legendary perks. I agree they should be more accessible, especially since they're not even that good atm.
---
Yes.  There have been a ton of posts about it since the updated.  No mention of when its going to be fixed.
---
I feel like Arthur was the only of his descendants that actually followed Roger.
---
Disregarding racism (keep in mind Roger never encountered synths so we don't know what his reaction would be to them).  Arthur and Roger both believe in (in order of priority)
---
1. Securing and studying tech
---
2. Helping people
---
Both of them were advocates that the BoS shouldn't shut itself off from the world, and should be an active part of it.  I think the key point they diverge is that Roger seems far more restrained.  Roger isn't willing to use nukes against the Scorch Beasts, while Arthur has no issue with them, as was seen with his desire to secure Fort Strong.
---
The other descendants just went about securing tech and shunning people, Lyons went about helping people, but somewhat neglecting job of helping people, but ironically, by helping people, the BoS was dragged into a war with the Enclave, which allowed them to appropriate their tech and gain more tech than the West Coast BoS ever has.
---
That’s a slow and ponderous process. I prefer to just farm them at Sugar Grove and Bog Town as needed. 
---
In a pinch when you’re a few screws short, this method is fine. But using it to stock up would be very boring, in my opinion.
---
I haven't run into this yet (knock on wood), but honestly for everyone that has had this happen, you all should create one main thread and post as much detail as possible to how you generated the issue.  
---
As a developer (business software, not games), I can tell you trying to debug an issue in my software is difficult when the user just sends me a one liner, or like the OP give me a lot, but nothing really to work with.
---
Some great basic data that should be included in reddit bug posts:
---
* Which system did this happen on?
---
   * If PC has the game been modified/with what?
---
   * If xbox/ps, which version?  
---
* Which game mode did this happen in?
---
   * Follow up: did you switch between game modes before this happened?
---
* Which Dailies/Weeklies auto completed without awarding Score?
---
I did a quick Google search and it doesn't seem like it is a frequent bug. I think it might have to do with the loading process/bootup of the game. I'm not sure but I wouldn't be surprised if it also has to do with being closer/over/higher carry capacity.
---
See other threads.

Morgantown Ingram mansion second floor by the bed

---
Uggggh I usually have fun beating down a queen in under 10 min on a private now it’s taking me 2x as long
---
Certaib outfits hide it. Scavenger, Bos scribe.... Not sure what else but outfits do hide it. Just certain ones
---
I dont think they will ever allow us to do that.   
---
That would mean less xp grinding to change ur build up.  
---
Less xp grinding means less time logging in.
---
I'm sure there will be additional tweaks &amp; some of these are still garbage, but to me, it's going in the right direction.
---
What are the cranberries for?
---
Yeah it sucks.
---
I hate how all the pve’ers complain. I’m like if u get good at pvp, have ur cards right, can take + dish damage you’ll be even better at the pve crap
---
Did they happen to be the same ones you didn't complete the first time around?
---
I think outrage at this time was so big because new update introduced a lot of awful bug and people were literally loosing their all gear and what Beth did ? They moved the fix and added this "atomic shop in gamę". It was like PR miss hit of the year.
---
Cranberry cobbler. 5% xp boost.
---
Look man, it is just an idea for skins if u dont like it put dislike I dont have to give you a explanation why lore is shit here and it doesnt matter.
---
Just dislike man.
---
Lol, you're so f lucky mate
---
Ok not a bad idea
---
To be sure, this is a much more important issue than the Ammo converter.  I want to know how Bethesda is going to compensate those who have lost SCORE because of this as well.
---
I logged in, hid in  a bush and then did stuff around my house.  Came back every 5 or 10 minutes to do it again until the 30 minutes was up. Free 250 score
---
Ohh yeah I remember that update wish they kept it in lol that ballistic fiber is quite rare
---
Yeah I feel your pain I also run a heavy pa build and it definitely hurts the damage output.
---
I found one person on FB with the same problem, but that was yesterday.
---
The commenters waved it off as something he did wrong, but I didn't so any of the things he did.
---
Excellent! This would go nicely next to my "Sheepsquatch ate my asshole" poster 🤣
---
its a huge drag.. hopefully it doesnt stay broken as long as stealth did..
---
lol as if...
---
Wait until they add ultra light to the limbs

If your melee, pneumatic is pretty helpful. My 2h melee character is an encryptid pylon tank, and I have that on my ss troubleshooters chest piece.
---
Quick question, If my strength is 15 and I take the strength legendary will I have 16 strength or is it still capped at 15?
---
Even at 10% they are rare.  I run many SBQs and always check.  They are massive bullet sponges but are fun and enjoy the high level offspring.
---
Don't look for it to say Secret Service at the beginning.  It will be something like Mutant Slayer Secret Service Chest piece.
---
Is there a cap to the amount of legendary perks?
---
I already have the jacket because it was able to be sold in vendors once upon a time. That beanie would be sweet though.
---
Who's your ISP?
---
It'd be a good area to go, and it'd be easy to link to the story
---
Some of the settlers mention that they traveled to Appalachia from "The Pitt" which I have to imagine means Pittsburgh, I wish I could remember more specifically what they said, something about it being really bad there
---
Yeah I know the ether magic appearing camp thingy.  But there must be a way to have 5% more.
---
I think there are seven slots available - you unlock one per 50 levels.
---
I was wandering around the nuke zone looking for some flux and i saw a follow me in the overgrown grove below Fiisure Prime.   Turns out 4 guys were fighting the Wendingo Colossus and needed backup. That fight was nutz. 
---
 Spend all my ammo was just down to my shotgun eventually the whole server came and we got him but GD that guy is tough.
---
there's also the fact that Roger wanted to collect dangerous technology to keep people safe, and roll it back out to society as they were ready. future BoS groups just hoarded it.
---
and while Arthur sees gunning down every mutant, ghoul, and synth as "helping people", i feel Roger would prefer to not go LOOKING for every single one to wipe them out, and just eliminate the ones who attacked innocent people. that said i can only speculate on the latter, since we only have his 76 broadcast recordings to go off of.
---
but yes, the main issue is Roger would never use nuclear weapons after seeing them destroy the world, while Arthur (and Lyons too, actually) were willing to use a robot that threw nukes like footballs. i genuinely thing Roger would be ashamed of Arthur, regardless of motive.
---
Good job man!
---
What's Rads was great with Solar in the last PTS
---
Sorry if this has been addressed in here but I noticed while on a public team, other experience boosting affects like the canned meat stew or well rested dont show up in your pip boy for your status like it typically would.  
---
Is it a bug and its just not showing but we're still getting the extra exp boost on top of the public team boost or are we not allowed to stack them?
---
Conduits and power radiator emitter. You can’t see a single wire in my fully powered camps.
---
So don’t do them? I’m not a fan of the mode, but many are. Seems selfish to want to take away SCORE opportunities for people who like NW.
---
XP in every game increases as your level increases. You kill harder things that give more XP...
---
Seems like the question is: *‘Does this mean a normal mini-nuke like the ammo we currently have, or does the mention of ‘lightweight’ mean it is that ammo but weighs less or does this mean something like a small radius tactical mule, perhaps one that creates a nuke zone that is much smaller than from a standard nuclear strike?’*
---
There’s sufficient ambiguity in that to make someone wonder. Why the inclusion of the word ‘lightweight’ if it just means a standard mini-nuke round for a Fat Man?
---
EDIT: I see a few people disagree with my assessment. I would love to be proven wrong, and I admit we only just finished the first week of the season, it admittedly it is way to early to pass judgment. I guess the context I should give is that I am currently playing several games that I like that all have battle passes, so while it's fine in and of itself, I guess I'm just feeling the pressure of all of these games and their grind at the same time. I really hope I'm just making a mountain out of a molehill on this one.
---
We should've got dirty/weathered versions of everything (or most things), not tacky doll house-style building sets and suits made from children's duvets
---
Thankx a lot
---
Does Antivenom works while in PA ?
---
I definitely do this because I don't like talking on a mic. I just did this to a lvl 5 person this morning.  He literally put his camp down 5 feet from a resource and didn't know it. I did the emote and jumped up and down til he got the hint.
---
Or the alternative would be a fast travel mat for the owner of the camp at least. O don't care where other people spawn in at, I just want to spawn in where I want!
---
I think it needs the red rocket connectors, or maybe have the wiring come from down your roof so it's at least a straight line.
---
Currently I have it hooked up to vault tec generators, which gives it clean-ish looks.
---
That's what I meant by part of a pack, technically still displayed in the atom shop under outfits if you bought it. I think that was the 2nd or 3rd of those packs they released along with the mechanistic and a few others. There is no saying they will never release those in the atom shop in the future, just not so far.
---
But you are right, I guess what I said may have been a bit misleading. Kinda rushed my message, was on break at work when I wrote it. Lol
---
I actually kinda liked the way it went..
---
clear the camp (sweet sweet XPs).. talk to becket and get the key.. then the alarm repopulates the area for another round of XPs....
---
I like it better than getting ol whats her name out of that bunker...
---
They put in a weekly NW challenge- I'm doing NW to reduce XP grind a bit
---
Shotguns:  Instigating or Junkies or any shotgun with the magic secondary effects.  
---
Secondary effects: +50 Limb Damage, +33VATS, Bashing damage.
---
Heavy guns:
---
Instigating or Junkies (some report Stalkers and Medics also) OR any of the secondary effects listed above with at least 180 fire rate.  If the gun happens to be explosive, that doubles the effective fire rate of the weapon in relation to triggering the damage overflow bug.
---
Master Infiltrator -  Hallelujah
---
&gt; extreme hide and seek
---
This makes me think of Portlandia.
---
MOB behavior in this game is pretty advanced.  If they can't see you, they will move to investigate in the direction of the sound.
---
You scalawag
---
Instructions unclear, now eating firework burger.
---
Does the secret service underarmour have mods?
---
Oh nice! I took a year long break from March 2019 to March 2020 so I missed out on the launch of Nuclear Winter and all these fun rewards! Hopefully they break the VTU rewards next ;) And yes I love the beanie and have to make myself one IRL haha
---
The Pitt was also visited in DLC for Fallout 3. Yes it's Pittsburgh, and yes, it's pretty much a shithole. Basically run by raiders and (not sure if they're present yet) infested by mutant "troglodytes."
---
IIRC there was plenty of raider bundles for people who want a more post-nuclear look.
---
They were being sarcastic instead of helpful. It is a widespread problem.
---
It would be cool to have a camp in the interior of a crashed 737 or something like that, great idea
---
Ok bud
---
I've never seen that. Maybe that's something they're testing on the test servers, which are accessible through the Bethesda.net version of 76?
---
Hopefully we get a load out with these perks because I will never use that card outside a nuke zone because bloodied but its a must inside a nuke zone to ALMOST make rads manageable enough to not be in PA
---
I believe so, yes - assuming you're referring to unlocking the legendary slots, anyway! Pretty sure they said there's only six legendary slots, so yeah, once you hit it, you'll have them all unlocked! :)
---
Your buddy can log out right before the nuke hits then rejoin you, their camp won’t be harmed!
---
Can you also make a crying one too?
---
Ammo factory + super duper  + ammo smith? 
---
Or its not possible?
---
Never watched the show but I've heard good things.
---
Thank you! I appreciate it...but rifles and melee weapons can't be magic?
---
At first I thought it could be from PTS, but I play on Xbox and I thought they only do PTS on PC? Maybe I need to ask other Xbox players how they tame animals.
---
Angry Turtle has a bunch of videos on this stuff. I would recommend checking him out for more comprehensive guides/details
---
Mods best be getting ready for an overhaul of flooding posts!
---
The forum  post says they stack/ work together
---
Fallout 4's budget was due to RAM limitations, it's a 32-bit game. Fallout 76 is a 64-bit game so that limitation is purely server-based. If it made the servers unstable then it needs to be fixed/improved. 
---
Or does it? I've seen many camps with exploited budget limit, no performance problems or server lags.
---
I'm so close because I use Secret Service with 1 rad resist piece and with a radshield I think it gets me down to 6 rads iirc. 4 ranks of the perk gets me down to 2 rads, which could work. But also I think you can switch the legendary perks out whenever you want so you should be good. I'm assuming you're not going into nuke zones often lol
---
That is a dream weapon for shotgunners. You want to add VATS to your build but otherwise it's a straight forward build (everything with shotgun or explosives in the description)
---
Lore has not yet been broken in this game.  So your statement is confusing. 
---
I asked a legitimate question. Not sure why you’re upset. 
---
I like the idea of Steampunk but would want to see how it fits into the setting.
---
Did you mean in the Public Worlds or in private worlds only, like if mods come out and are limited to that user only?
---
It apparently does not.
---
I just moved my camp after having it for over 3 months.  Moved to a beautiful spot, got everything set up then went to stock my vending as the very last thing.
---
20min later, after pricing everything I thought to myself "I'm never moving again". lol, it really felt like an irl move.  There's a room or closet somewhere with a box and in that box are like 200 DVDs that you want to unpack but...you just can't be bothered.
---
Thanks Midroad!! These are awesome!
---
I fully agree with this statement. I suck at FPS aiming, so I chose to adopt the bushwookie playstyle, with completing some lifetime NW challenges on the side. 
---
Sometimes it happens that the first match of the day, I forget to turn Fill OFF. In that case I try my best to work with the team, because it's my mistake so why should I punish 3 other people for it?
---
Thanks 76 :)
---
Capped at 15. So best off taking one for a lower stat.
---
I mean you can already use any levels gained past 50 to reassign your SPECIALs. I've gone from vanilla stealth sniper to PA Heavy to Bloodied Melee and now Bloodied non-PA Heavygun. Might even transition back to full health PA Heavygun if I can live with the loss of the +30% XP of +15 INT at &lt;20% HP. Maybe if I move a few points to Max INT.
---
I also use a mod called Perk Loadout Manager to switch between perk profiles, although as people have already mentioned, this feature will officially arrive for all platforms.
---
That sound so Wrong
---
Im not cynical enough to think they'll sell them, but I wouldnt be suprised to see them as rewards in season 2 etc
---
Crazy cat lady's house North of Bolton greens has a metal barn with a locked tool box in it.  Log in, unlock chest, logout and repeat.
---
The first two times no one else was there. The last time somebody else decided to go to same spot but I beat them to the tool chest and logged out right as they got to me.
---
Here he is folks, Mr Predictable :-)
---
 You know what might be a good fix for this... Not forcing players who's only interest in the game is pve to do random tasks in the pvp mode in order to unlock that thing they want to put up on their camp. Just saying get used to nw having a bunch of people sneaking around unlocking doors or hunting creatures who have no interests in actually playing this mode as intended.
---
The colossus is WAY harder than a SBQ, period! I've fought him twice, each time, literally after everyone left from the SBQ event. Luckily for me, a good lvl players hung around to help me out.
---
Because they'll probably release separate skins for the fixer itself. Double dipping and all.
---
I tag em for search and pick them up when doing other tasks..
---
also typically nets a bunch of other crafting mats too..
---
tagging a few key items really takes the work out of searching for shit all the time..
---
Ive got screws, ballistic fiber and lead tagged currently.. thats generally all I pick up
---
when I need steel and or wood (which is almost never) I kill mobs and scrap their weapons...
---
Thanks for the info, that sucks
---
But a lot of the new perks look great
---
I keep meaning to grab the game of the year edition or something lol I never did get to play the dlc for 3, glad to have that confirmed, thank you :)
---
What’s the bug though? It’s just still available to unlock?
---
Angry Turtle just put out a video where he quickly tested shadowed and it is working on all armor types now. He even tested it during the day and it seemed to be working fine.
---
Edit: "all armor types" meaning an armor type where shadowed is an option. For instance, secret service doesn't appear to have shadowed as an option.
---
This \^. Getting rid of the junk notes and holos fixed my lag and crashing issues.
---
Sure thing. Feel free to add me: Eldyrus3 (on bethesda) and Eldyrus (on steam). I will be logged on for the next hour or so if you want. You can also message me on reddit - I will be sure to check it regularly.
---
Exactly. I'm getting old, I have horrible eyesight to begin with, I'm colorblind and I make bad decisions. All that adds up to me being more of a liability than an asset.  If I forget to turn it off I'll do my damndest to be helpful in a fight but we're all better off if I'm running solo.
---
Then i’ll be fine, thank you
---
Idk mang. As far as I know, they haven't started rolling out pets yet.
---
There's two different perk card sets that work for this, though you only need one fully maxed out in order for it to work (animal friend? Or something like that). Then you have to go out and find a specific type of animal in a specific "random spawn" situation - from what I've seen on YouTube - it really seems overly complicated and tedious for something that will likely die within a few hours or days, if you're lucky. Im holding out for official pets.
---
Yeah i know.. I'm subscribed to him but i wanted a list so i can take a look whenever i need XD
---
I experience different types of crashes on my Xbox1X.
---
*freezes that causes the sound to loop
---
*still image freezs
---
*complete crash to the home screen without knowing what causes this.
---
I would imagine the opposite. I want more cloth between me and my giant pinching metal armor suit....
---
By a mile the best one
---
been around for a while. 
---
Sometimes the invincible enemy is paired with an invisible enemy
---
Thanks for the info.
---
I was a stealth rifleman, but I found that commando does much more dps and is just as sneaky with the right perks. You can still use instigating and get plenty of damage. Ultimately bloodied or junkies will be the tops in terms of damage output, but it is not necessary to be viable.
---
You mean the quad explosive?
---
I have the same but on PC. Happens randomly :/
---
Thanks for the reply, ive sent an invite using the menu in-game :)
---
a combination of both would be cool.
---
Alright thank you!
---
who pissed in your cornflakes?
---
Quad explosive double barrel out-damages all other shotguns do to rate of fire - 8 shots in a couple seconds while it takes about twice as long for the combat shotgun. Definitely a gun I've been after. Enjoy it!
---
Oh my god Master Infiltrator is about to save me 6 perk slots.
---
No, the scorched kill receiver used to add a 4th star but when they added the scrip machine they stopped that.
---
Ya but how big was it really?
---
Can’t wait to get all the stuff that ways 40 pounds each. She must hate me!
---
Sweet! Finally i got somethong that is worth more than scrip :) i tought it was common
---
I also keep Acid tagged as well. I think Adhesive and Ultracite too, maybe. 
---
I’m at about 800 Ballistic Fiber last time I checked, so that’s probably a good gauge of the stockpile I’ve got for the other stuff. 
---
But even so, Screws are still the one thing that I’ll always pick up, no matter what. Too many bad early game memories, lol.
---
Yep, it is.
---
So are the heavy sturdy and light armor perks still in???
---
Ok, good to know. Never had this until patch 20.
---
Update/new content = more bugs on top of the old bugs that haven't been fixed
---
Its specific but definitely worth a whole lol more than script
---
Hahah
---
And then the excavator heavy hauling loader backpack! Made exclusively for the excavator! 
---
Load another whooping 200 carry weight on top!
---

---
spoon feeding someone when everyone and his mother is literally asking the same question on this sub is not being "helpful".
---
I hope there'll gonna be enough negative feedback about overall usefullness of anti-venom and anti-fire perks and they'll decide to *at least* merge them together *and* make 'em work with all types of armor.
---
Thanks so much for the tip!
---
A whole commerce area would be great.  I still like Top of the World as the location. Spruce it up, hurl Rose into the sun, maybe have a few cooking dailies or something.
---
If you like spoilers on your game.  Check the summer/season trailer....
---
And go to Atlas in game right now :)
---
sneak has been working for me.. its VATS thats killing me lately..
---
and of course it goes without saying Adrenaline being borked is a huge downer also..
---
Whe does it go until?
---
Oh... didn’t read it that way. Heh, take it how you want to I guess.
---
(Don’t make an innuendo out of this one)
---
Appreciate it, I like going to the burrows and killing ghouls because I can one shot them and they are work good exp
---
Haha nice.
---
Lol I don't even bother with that. When I'm ready for a little smoke break I leave my world and join nw. After I click that button I'm gone. Sure I'll time out but that's 7 min or so of possible survival. I need to hit 30mins so I'll take a few smoke breaks or maybe double dip if I get distracted. If I sit there and wait for the loading screens then go through the menus to get out of team well that's just less smoking time and who needs that?
---
Hurts a lot of builds ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Recent mothman wallpaper with the red and black boards, and the few original wallpapers weren't bad for an aged looking camp. Stick to barn, warehouse and brick for that old look. The contemporary house set isnt bad either since the paint appears to be peeling, especially on the porch and railings. The fence set, the old fences at least, give a nice post apocalyptic feel. Then use parts from the raider sets, responder set and free states set for items to fill space. Dont forget about the seedy shack and the rail car(caboose) that is the bonus for this weeks bundle, those have a nice beat and old feel. Then mix all those with the vanilla camp items and you have gold. :D
---
Same reason that the Sledgehammer and Super Sledge don’t share skins. 
---
They aren’t the same weapon. 
---
Believe me, I’d love to have my Super Sledge use the Croquet Skin. 
---
Perhaps someday.
---
Every piece should be buttressed, jetpack on the chest of course and cushioned on the legs to help you not die while doing jetpack shenanigans.
---
There's six. They're unlocked at levels 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, and 300. Once you unlock a slot, it's unlocked for other characters; so if you have a character at level 300+, when you make a brand new character they'll start with all six slots.
---
Also, total slots are shared, but each character still has to upgrade their legendary perks separately.
---
No, rifles cannot.  And Melee is already OP so no magic needed.
---
You got me there!
---
Unless the blueprint won’t let you plant. 
---
Happened to me many times. You should just be able to blueprint the machine - especially if you can blue print it as a structure. 
---
There’s no reason to mass clear a vendor - unless you’re manually doing it.
---
Nope, they were cut.
---
So true :(
---
As long as I can drop a nuke on the linc fuck the Eagles.
---
What about using Bird Bones for that?
---
According to Bethesda's most recent Inside The Vault article, it's July 9-13. Hope you're able to make the sale!
---
This never happened to me or my husband before patch 20. I know it happened to people, but apparently not as frequently as it is now. Yesterday all of his daily challenges auto completed and half of his weekly challenges. Didn’t happen to me even though we were logged on to the same server. Today both of us had all new dailies auto complete except for the one NW challenge. I’ve gotten Xbox messages from friends over the past 48 hours asking if it happened to me...seen countless posts in this forum. This bug seems to be spreading as fast as covid.
---
I heard the lonevault wanderer talking about how the xp gains from intelligence reach a hard cap at 25 intelligence, is that true?
---
Thank you, I was hoping to finally maximize my melee build but I guess not
---
Thanks for explaining this. Yeah, I’m going to hold out too. The general consensus I’ve gotten from people who do have pets and post about it here is that they’re not worth the trouble. They’ll spend hours taming a pet only for it to glitch out of existence, someone kills it, or it otherwise walks off and disappears :/
---
Oh look - a downvote from a munchkin player. Sorry kid, but allowing a free re-arrangement of stats devalues the skill of making the right choices in the first place - skill you obviously don't have. So "git gud"
---
I would reccomend checking guns on fed76.info/weapons/ Automated sites should always be taken with a grain of salt, but thos one does a good job (2* quad explosive double barrel shows as 21-30k value on the site as an example)
---
Jesus thats a lot of caps but i don't think i will ever sell it
---
never knew it didnt work..
---
[Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/eo80ev/so_we_found_out_the_exact_cost_of_every_camp_item/) This should help you out with costs of CAMP items! Massive thanks to u/buddy-thunder for compiling it!
---
If it’s like ever other sale, Noon EST Thursday to 11:59am EST Monday.
---
I have a 2x max budget camp and don’t run into any issues. Have had it for over 2 months and seen it under so many conditions (lots of other players, other exploited budget camps in close range, etc) and it doesn’t run any worse in that area I’m in than anywhere else.  Maybe it would be different if everyone in the server had as much as I do at my camp, but we may never know if they don’t even try to improve everyone’s budget even a little.
---
Awesome thank you
---
So many outfits ruined by Skinny Jeans.
---
Haven't logged in today yet to see what the challenges are but by the sound of this I'm not going to.
---
Prior to patch 20, my sneak attacks would register over 2k worth of dmg. I'm not even getting close to that number.
---
VATS is an annoying bug. After a few shots not registering, I have to back out of VATs and reenter VATs to make it work. Then again, when VATs does work, I've been noticing that I can should through walls.
---
I just want update 21 to focus on all the bugs if possible w/o any new game content.
---
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Before the patch, I think it only worked on leather armor. Also, I think there were some issues with it working during the day. Maybe I have that wrong, though?
---
NW challenge:  kill someone and make them so salty they make a reddit post about it.
---
Upset? What? Just dropped an idea that's all.
---
I wouldn't. My train of thought is anything the site says "you should expect to trade items for this" (it says it in a couple ways based on how high that cap number is) I keep to use for fun - point of the game is to have fun with what ot gives you, right? :)
---
Arthur never issued any sort of orders to attack non-feral ghouls, even though his soldiers have dialogue saying various dickish things, they even specifically mention ferals instead of just ghouls when being racist.  Initiate Clarke was also friends with a non-feral and Cade mentions that officers get STDs from ghouls, so there was at least some interaction between non-ferals and BoS.
---
On the other hand, Lyon's had standing orders to shoot ghouls (feral or non) on sight (the people of Underworld).  He also decrees that mutants don't get access to the clean water distribution system from Project Purity.
---
Arthur takes on a different kind of "helper" role.  I see it like this:
---
Imagine if during the zombie apocalypse, you and your group got trapped somewhere, and your friends were injured badly.  They need medical attention and there are zombies trying to break down the door.  Suddenly a super macho soldier dude just starts gunning the zombies down, he doesn't give a shit if you are there or not, probably won't help your badly injured friends, but is solving the zombie problem at least.  Even though your friends are still bleeding out, now the zombies are gone at least.
---
I don't think it is exactly what Roger had in mind, but they also live in very different worlds.  In Roger's time, people are in the initial survival phases, there aren't hordes of super mutants and ghouls yet.  The state of the world is very much and unknown but they retain a lot of knowledge of the old world.  So he creates plans with that in mind.
---
By the time of Arthur, the state of the world is pretty much known (it is shit) but much of old world knowledge has been lost.  There are hordes of monsters everywhere that make living a simple life difficult.  That's why they are so much more aggressive.
---
I don't think it is fair to say that Roger would be ashamed of Arthur, it is like comparing someone from now to someone from 200 years ago.  The person 200 years ago would likely be super misogynistic and racist compared to the person now, but that doesn't make them a bad person, they just exist in the context of their time.  Roger's time was one of uncertainty and reorganizing after the end of the world, Arthur's time was an era filled with monsters and strife.
---
Monster Mash counts as PvP even if you’re the only player in the event.
---
You are correct, NW is an extra this week. Bethesda aren't forcing NW on us, not sure why the OP believes so.
---
If you get morgantown map go to the bank there is 4 safes that you can lockpick in the back and there's a safe in a tent in the front of the airport. For flatwoods in Sutton there's one on the 2nd floor of a clothing store and one roof facing the overseer house.
---
Oh thank lord.
---
Could put something in the Whitesprings and not have to change the game much. The Galleria has a few quests tied to it.
---
I saw, but thank you for the heads up! Great to know Shadowed works right now! Bit of a bummer it's not available for the Secret Service armor, but, ah well - I still haven't gotten that far, and think it looks ugly anyway. XD;
---
[I made this.](https://i.imgur.com/3FEUnoD.jpg)

The sneak attack works for me. Or at least in the damage numbers it shows it does.
---
There are only 2 situations for the Amish
---
1 they are leading the luddite revolution against America 
---
2 not even China dared to bomb the Amish who live in a pristine untouched prewar paradise
---
I tried like a million things with your comment in mind and in the end I settled on screaming loudly curses at Todd Howard.
---
However if you are in my very specific situation of naming items based on selling prices then listing them in your vendor, you can list them then remove their names without unlisting, that gives you one space back. Saying as I only have 13 custom names I really need them back 😒 
---
Thanks for the insight, this definitely feels accurate!
---
I'll send a bug report to Bethesda which I'm sure will be swiftly acted upon in a way that fixes the problem without creating new ones! /s
---
yeah id like some non gold bullion weapons as well, but untill i finish my SS armor and gauss/plasma caster ima roll for those. I have nothing since i really started in wastelanders.
---
Use the cranberry relish recipe with herbivore and stranger in numbers perk in a team and get 25% xp buff. Or similarly use tasty squirrel stew with carnivore the same way to get 25% xp gain.
---
That's fair. I just not as hardcore about the run tho. I'm trying to grind for gold since I still have some SS pieces I need and wanna start the SS PA as well.
---
I dont want to wait for patch 21.. it would be nice to have a perk central to not only mine.. but many many other peoples build fixed sooner than a month from now...
---
Power Sprinter is definitely something I'm looking forward to.
---
Damn I spent 400 scrip last night. I didn't even know Purveyor sales were a thing.
---
Literally died to the mirelurk hunter and lost my flux yesterday because I couldn’t see because of this
---
you may be right.. Its entirely possible I just never noticed
---
Aw, mysterious stranger got you
---
I’m camped by the wayward, so yeah, every single time I log in I have this issue. Just keep trying and it’ll eventually find a server
---
it would be the building that is outside of the galleria that has the little diner near the red rocket gas station. there is a good size building that is just blocked off and would be perfect to use
---
Lmaoo
---
I’ve found my luck to be worse during the sale :(
---
There will likely be a BoS set of items released next season considering BoS is coming in a near future update.
---
it could have insulation padding
---
dont know where you got this "only ferals" idea from regarding Arthur, but the 4 BoS outright act hostile towards Hancock if you bring him to them.
---

---
Or an easier to follow method:
---
1) Get the junk bot for your camp (500 atoms). He will reliably find a few an hour, plus other valuable crafting components.
---
2) If you get the plan for the junk extractor build your camp onto of a junk pile. There is a nice spot along the river between the mothman museum and the agricultural center.  That another chance for a few screws every hour (not as many as junk bot imo tho) (You can google junk pile sites for a complete list of sites)
---
3) like another commenter said, have the highlighted for searching, and pick up ever item you see with them.
---
4) Sell off excess purified water or whatever else your side hustle is and buy bulk screws from vendors.
---
With the junk bot and extractor running while I play I usually net about 10 screws every few hours in real life. As long as I pick up a few toys, fans, and typewriters a day I'm easily stashing away 20 plus screws a day.
---
That's awesome!  I have yet to even see one. let alone a nuke I've launched.  Congrats!
---
Bonus score if they use the word 'griefed'.
---
I feel you, my first piece where I *finally* got the main effect I wanted... ended up being only 1\*, ugg.
---
Where at. I'm also camped near the Wayward. across the road on up the hill.
---
So let me get this right, we will no longer need to have picklock cards and hacker cards enabled but can still pick and hack all terminals?  
---
Not only that, new characters will have this all unlocked, so would never again need to use those cards?
---
Already do ☺️
---
If you do a VATS shotgun build with high Intelligence (through aid, mutations, exc) you can get through the run without too many issues. The weekly "get crits" basically is a give-me be cause shotgun pellets each count as a separate bullet (hence amazing as explosive) so a crit with a shotgun actually counts as 8
---
I wish the Modules went on sale during these. After Wastelanders, all my gear is Gauss and Secret Service, so it's much easier to just craft those things than pray and roll for them.
---
I for one made sure to put in a support ticket. I know I’ll get the same response everyone has, but the more people report it, the more they will see how many are affected.
---
This. 
---
The NW daily is almost completely unworth it compared to grinding the XP repeatable and any other daily (for example). 
---
I just got 2.5 to 3 repeatable challenge xps in 30 mins just running a queen and then finishing up with westek/huntersville /harpers ferry farming runs
---
F**********kkkkkkkkk and here I was ready for the heavy perk
---
what's with all the explode crap .. should just be a % chance to instantly kill the enemy .. instead all the valuable junk in the area is gonna go flying and probably dead bodies too .. they really do like their explody stuff
---
Same this update messing with vats, adrenaline, white night, and weaponsmith from what I know are messed up and it messes with peoples builds who may need or use them.
---
Stat boosting look the best. Infiltrator looks convienient. Ammo looks useful if you make lots of ultracite ammo.
---
The rest seem like they need rather specific builds.
---
not saying you can't complain, what I'm saying is you're complaining for the wrong things, if that makes any sense.
---
Woohoo!
---
I did just get a Furious VATS Gauss. Should give it a shot. I like my heavy build but I miss one shotting everything.
---
Sorry that took so long - I forgot that I could kill myself using an explosive weapon....
---
Yes, that would be great.
---
Anyone know of a way to cover/merge glitch a faux ceiling?
---
I’m across the street from the trailer that’s next to the wayward. It’s just a prime spot for camps, both for low level players and high level helpful players. I usually anticipate having to re-log at least 2-4x
---
Ahh powered door. That's what I need for what I'm setting up rn. You gotta attach it to a trip wire for the door to shut on them? Making the camp real peaceful and inviting. Hopefully one of these giant cry babies will come through.
---
Nope. IRL tough guy here. What gives XP is placement points. Overseer is 525. That is a huge amount. If you are going to be a net 0 on my way to Overseer, I am going to take you off of my team. No harsh feelings. You had no harsh feelings leaving me as a person that won't kill you; I have no harsh feelings removing you myself. That's all friendo!
---
Thanks a million pal
---
Well ain't that fancy? Looks like I need to mutate some more.
---
yeah, it's somewhat bland, an unfortunate side effect of allowing people who look forward to making money but not the entertainment these days.
---
Knock the 20% down to something like 1% for a 1000 caps or more. Still could be overpowered for some individuals though. It would need to stop at around 10%. 
---
The math will need some working on but fundamentally a great idea.
---
No problem! Glad I could help:)
---
might make crafting 308 and flamer rounds finally economical
---
No problem :)
---
Sadly very true
---
gunsmith.. 
---
I havent noticed that broken.. but I always repair to 200% and use several weapons...
---
It recaptures really well the BoS overall story... Giving men and women a reason to live, main mission derailing from helping civilians to distrust them, the founder angry at how the BoS is involving away from his initial spirit. 
---
Many players like to see the world in black or white, but reality is that in the post-apocalyptic world, everything is in shades of grey and ultimately everybody hurts and loses a part of themselves in the way of survival.
---
Ahh yes, I just looked into that damage Resistance drop-off, I didn’t know it was that severe!
---
Yeah I tested it after hearing it may be broken and yeah it is.
---
Yeah but the fact that Hancock isn't swiss cheese already is a testament to how far they came from 3.  I already said that they were dicks, but then  again, go back to the soldier analogy, they aren't good, they are probably one of the greyest factions in fallout.
---
I've done them all daily except for most of the NW ones
---
Witch-hunting is not allowed.  You post will probably be pulled shortly.
---
no witch hunting..
---
as long as its not stacked punjis lol.. love a good trapped base
---
What counts as matching armour? Full SS set or full SS unyielding for example?
---
Look in your Misc tab. For me it's a Power Pack, there are a few different items that will complete the quest. Don't know all of them off the top of my head but I think another one is called Water Cooled Bone Saw.
---
 VATS as a legendary effect is glitched on shotguns - basically guarantees 1 shot of most enemies (Angry turtle on youtube explains well). I have a Vampire VATS combat shotgun that can 3 shot a scorchbeast
---
Can’t call out people like that. Traps are a part of the game. Just assume every camp is a trap camp and store your junk before you explore or vendor hop
---
Morgatown map- Crazy cat lady's house North of Bolton greens there's a metal barn with a locked tool chest in it every time.
---
 Load in near barn, unlock chest,  logout and repeat.
---
  Got all three in a row, it was very fast.
---
People still buy them. If they're still selling, they will stay in my machines.
---
Yeah I’m bummed at the changes made to workshops. 
---
Can’t fast travel for free to your own. 
---
Doesn’t tell you if it is claimed or unclaimed before you get there. 
---
Can’t see the resources from the map.
---
Well, if this were to happen, Bethesda needs to flesh out why the Settlers left PA. In Fallout 3, The Pitt is described as hell on earth due to a airborne virus mutated with the bad air quality. It didn't get better until the Scourge of BOS soldiers came through and killed many of those people who were infected. 
---
I think it would be awesome to experience a small section of The Pitt before it was settled by Asher. It could be like a hardcore survival area where the best loot is furthest from "spawn". If you die, you'll be transported back to the spawn without the loot you picked up. (Think Division's Dark Zone) Maybe there could be a large boss in a specific area that you need alot of people for. 
---
As for factions, maybe one would be a group that split from Paige's group. They're still settlers, but with more of selfish mindset. They want to reestablish The Pitt as their home, despite it being uninhabitable. Another could be Survivors that sought help from this splinter faction, but were turned away. It would be alot more Gray than Settlers VS Raider (In that, these groups are hardly gray at all) 
---
I would like for the world to be smaller, but more dense as it's a city. Maybe it should be the size of the Ash Heap, but allow us to explore sky scrapers and metro tunnels. 
---
It's a cool idea and with Bethesda implementing 'Expeditions' this winter, they have so much freedom.
---
I suggest repairing to 200% and alternating a few guns then.. youll hardly notice at all
---
Or glance at the book 'The World Without Us' - a few decades without upkeep really does a number on things.
---
Your experience will vary with your play style, and with your teammates play styles, but I've found a pretty happy place as a stealth commando with an instigating +33 that I use to nail headshots on all mobs up to lvl 68 supermutants. One and done, as long as I've got my A-game sneak on.
---
When I team up I use an AA and aim for crippling legs so others can get hits in.
---
For the SBQ I keep a primed zealots, and load up on psychobuff and ballistic Bach. I can't remember the last time I didn't get loot from her.
---
I've settled on this load-out to keep high health and use vanguard armor, and to avoid the hassle of withdrawals from Junkies and the rad balancing act of Bloodied.
---
The shotgun or perks really make it worth it expression the if you have a high luck skill
---
Try moving your C.A.M.P.   
---
You will spawn to the north of it, you have to figure out where you want it to spawn you in the (basic) right place.
---
Yeah weird. This one is like everything but the yellow UI goes black. I can still move an hear my guy move around but everything except the hud just goes from working to blackout randomly.
---
they dont shoot hancock on sight cuz he's with YOU, the uprising new recruit.
---
the same reason Fawkes is allowed to roam everywhere in 3 so long as he's by your side. they trust YOU, not him.
---
they have to explicitly say that your trust wont extend to Danse when they find out he's a synth because they feel betrayed, even though they'll let Valentine walk around with you. but bring Danse back and you become public enemy number one.
---
EXACTLY!!! I hate it
---
Seeing as they got removed....it probably means Light/Sturdy/Heavy Parts.
---
These seem worse than before except for a very select few...
---
Thanks for the list. So that Legendary Ability - +1 to stat and +1 to available perk slots (theres one for each SPECIAL). When that one is ranked up does it max out at +4 to that special and +4 perk slots? Or does only part of it get ranked up?
---
Same I get 2.5x and if I don’t swap my cards when I craft 2.0 I noticed last night.  I always keep an eye on it.  VATs is more missed now
---
I’ve had this happen and wanted to help, but couldn’t find my teammate on the map. So I just Oh Welled it.
---
Is there an easy way to locate them like “Show on Map” does for events/quests?
---
Glad to see not all people on 76's public servers are a**holes.
---
I dont mind seeing those plans if theyre priced accordingly. Some people may be missing specific ones so might as well sell them for very low amounts.
---
If anything... selling **super low level** non legendary armor and weapons **in high level areas** should be a bannable offense.
---
Edit: added bold text to clarify because karen didn't get it.
---
👉😎👉
---
I’d upvote you too but it’s at 76
---
I beleive its like SS, scout, leather, etc... but cant 100% confirm. Someone on PC will have to.
---
Step F: Ouch, my wrist!!!
---
Vault dwellers vs the wasteland
---
Have you tried restarting the video driver with:-
---
Win+Ctrl+Shift+B (Press all keys at once).
---
Just a thought.
---
As far as I understood it, the card will bypass the minigames completely. Haven't tested it yet though, the PTS is still downloading.
---
Mods, can we make an official r/fo76 drinking game where we all take a shot every time Rule 9 is broken?
---
**Public** Test Server currently.. there is no NDA
---
Yeah I just tested it, I normally don’t run it anyway for extra perks for my build.
---
It's much cheaper and easier to be with a large group in an event tag enemy and move on. You use less ammo and get more xp moving fast and tagging more.
---
I did the tool box behind the tattoo parlor. Spawned there, opened the toolbox, there was a small loot crate nearby and sometimes a red loot crate on the roof. Tried to survive long enough to find another one but I’m very bad at NW.
---
No witch hunting 😈
---
Exactly but i doubt they’d do something as massive as that since it could create problems (and take up a lot camp budget too)
---
Wait, so if I want to help out low level players, I **have** to be in that immediate area instead of having my camp that I spent a lot of time working on?
---
Yes shielded lining, 4str, 4 endurance and 2 perception iirc, or something like that.
---
I'll delete but how cool is a level 238 killing and stealing from a level 60&amp;48
---
I believe the challenge in question is NW only.  It's not tied to pvp, just the mode.
---
I think its pick 3 locks in NW mode today.
---
I sell them low too. People do buy them. Not everyone has them and some folks have alts that don’t have those plans
---
Special still maxes at 15 so it cannot be used to get extra special but helps for areas you lack in
---
It's not about you, it's about someone else. Someone will buy anything including mounted heads. I sell for 20 caps each. If you don't like the stock then check other vendors.
---
Sounds like bypasses the level 0 minigames, but also gives a +3 hacking/lockpicking so you can do all without Perk cards.  Unless that the level 1 is only the bypass for level 0 locks/hacks, and higher levels finally eliminate the need for cards.
---
Agreed. When I switch to an alt without jetpack armor it is very disappointing.
---
Nice! The gauss pistol is still technically an option, but that’s the worst of it done!
---
a normal wandering merchant yeah. But not the rare vendor or grahm.
---
It’s your fault for falling for it
---
Legacy Explosive Laser Rifles with Beam Splitter work just like the Shotguns. Explosive Submachine Guns kinda work, but not as good. I think Plasma Flamers work like the heavies but I'm still not 100% on that.
---
I hope they put a vendor in there. It’s so empty and weird
---
Yeah, counterpoint, I’m happy that NW challenge provides SCORE.
---
I feel like I’m in the majority (maybe?) of people who mostly play adventure but do enjoy NW from time to time. I’d say that the ratio of Adventure Mode challenges to NW challenges is about proportional to how much time I spend in each, which is cool. Mostly, I am happy about the change because in the past, NW challenges would give you a perk pack, which is just pretty dumb. You get a perk pack with every level, and I don’t really ever switch out my cards. So now I can get SCORE from playing NW? Awesome!
---
And if you don’t wanna play NW, that’s fine. It’s only 250 score a day that you’re missing, and whatever the weekly challenge is. That’s not hard to re-coup. As others have pointed out, it’s pretty easy to BS the NW challenges. Spawn in (as a solo player), move your camp three times, disconnect. The only thing that I would complain about is if they start making challenges like Kill 2 players. I suck at PVP so that would probably take me an entire day to accomplish.
---
By the way, we NW players are already being stiffed because it looks like the Adventure XP we earn from NW doesn’t count towards the 10000 XP repeatable. I haven’t confirmed this for myself, but other people have confirmed it. 
---
TLDR; I’m a casual NW player and am happy I can get score from it, and have an excuse to play it every day and hopefully get better at it.
---
This 100%.
---
The robot gun-vendor at white springs has the plan. It was about 2500 caps or so which can be a problem if you're a brand new character. If you're end game and regularly have 20000 caps it's not a big deal.
---
I had the luck to get dropped a god tier  2-shot, exploding, 90% less weight level 45 handmade and spent a frustrated week finding 1 or 2 handmade a day farming lucky hole mine for them.
---
It's much easier to just buy the plan. Make 20. Scrap them. Learn your necessary mods that way. 
---
Or if you have a friend with all of the handmade perks unlocked ask him to modify it it for you.
---
Yeah, I do see the 2.5x message but not all the time. When it does pop up, my dmg out for 2.5x is noticeably low.
---
when is it being implemented?
---
This is my first run through of the game and first time I've experienced anything like it
---
Most camps if they're all one piece can be blueprinted for easy pack up storage and placement, just the cost of caps and a few moments of time.
---
Almost guaranteed full ss, not factoring in legendary effect
---
Yes, I also find it immersion breaking, when I run across some pristine, elaborate mansion in the middle of post-apocalyptic Appalachia.  I mostly use the old, rustic wood floors and walls.  That seems more to me like someone living in a hostile post-apocalyptic Appalachia, especially when their primary focus is survival from nuclear storms and constant attacks from mutated creatures.  I also doubt too many of the vault dwellers were professional contractors or engineers, who would be able to build such elaborate mansions, even if they could find such elaborate materials.
---
I'd actually be up for a wasteland and contraptions workshop again. It's cool and all to get little things at a time but we need a big bundle. I think the C.A.M.P. system needs an overhaul anyways. Some of the mechanics just dont make sense. Though the interface is alot better than FO4
---
You still need snaptail (sugar) for the relish.
---
Hopefully patch 22. They said it will not be in 21
---
Edit

https://bethesda.net/community/topic/418411/legendary-perk-updates-feedback-and-discussion-part-2?language%255B%255D=en&amp;language%5B%5D=en
---
This is false. I have an instigating ffr LMG, and it’s a “magic” weapon. It’s certain effects while having your fire rate over 200. The LMG by default is only around 185 or something, but with FFR it goes to 205, and so the instigating effect lets it do the magic damage.
---
With a good build, mutations and uny armor, any bloody unarmed weapon is going to tear things up.  The meat hook is now one of the weaker options, but you’ll still be doing four figure damage.
---
How about the metal/wood building prefabs that snapped in  Fo4? They were so junky they were pretty beast.
---
Didn't realize this was a thing but now that you and 10 others have said something I do
---
Any idea what the survival chem does?
---
Yes, they can be. As long as the fire rate is above 200. An instigating FFR LMG will do the trick, since the fire rate with FFR on that gun is 205.
---
Can we do negative comments too? Everyone seem to like it, i think the helm skin doesnt go with that outfit, looks really weird and out of place.
---
I agree, I’ve just not been able to sell any for weeks, and they’re all priced 0-10 caps. I just figured might as well try to sell something people would actually buy. The overpriced plans are what gets me.
---
You said it you filthy moth lol
---
Man im buying all the serums, i need more caps not a sink lol.
---
My main weapon is the two ** lvl 45 Instigating rifle that I've been using over 200 hours that I can't stop using! lol
---
Not everyone has them. People can list whatever they want. New players join the game every day.
---
I have a hard time believing this was an accident lol
---
ah, thanks!
---
You mean press drink then spam collect right afterwards
---
I know there's one not \*too\* far away in Harper's Ferry (my camp is basically equidistant between Berkeley Springs and Harper's Ferry), but it's a pain to hoof it there and fight your way through super mutants and scorched just to offload your wares. Would DEFINITELY love a vendor bot there so it can be like every other train station on the map. C'mon Bethesda!
---
Right, but for many players, a more robust endgame, more quest and narrative content, less repetition and other issues would be a positive. I think it’s atrocious that Bethesda drip feed content as slowly as they do. If they want to do games as a service, there needs to be regular solid updates. It doesn’t happen.
---
We do but we won't get it. They're too far gone into the le random wacky xd mindset that they think Fallout's humor was about rather than what it actually was.
---
I think it means that you get a grenade (‘lightweight’) that deals far man levels of damage.
---
The penitentiary has a safe and a container or two. Got it done in one session.
---
That’s what it was before for the ranged % reduction perks.
---
Still various soldiers interacted with ghouls and none of them were reprimanded.  Again, if you read the response, you would see that I talked about soldiers such as Clarke, having ghoul friends back in DC and soldiers coming back with STDs from ghouls.
---
Also BoS can spawn near the Slog (ghoul settlement) and they won't purge the settlement in Fallout 4.  In Fallout 3, the BoS will shoot at ghouls if you spawn them in underworld.
---
The first rank increases your hacking/lockpicking so you don't need to equip any Hacker/Picklock perks, and lets you auto-unlock rank 0 locks without having to do the minigame. The next three ranks just increase the lock level you can auto-unlock, from 1-3.
---
Last time I did this I was reported... I guess the player didn't like me dressed up like Mr Fuzzy meowing into area voice chat 🤷.
---
Awesome, time to go get it. Thanks.
---
Seems like we shouldn't be seeing these types of bugs from a triple A company.
---
Oh well. This game got me just as addicted like world of Warcraft did back in 2004. lol
---
that should be fairly effective if your build is even halfway optimized..
---
Didn't consider that max is unchanged but doesnt change my opinion.  There's only a few on this list that are useful and not sure any are better than some of the unused cards/levels I have. Every build can find utility in using more perk cards imo, min/max or otherwise.
---
Came here for this. The longest challenge takes half an hour so far. Provided they don’t actually require a win, it’s all good.
---
OP writes it bypasses the level 0 mini game and gives you +3 in both categories with one single card
---
We've been wanting that since they first came out for meat week, maybe next year *or they could actually give us the firework camp mortar from 4*
---
Stack perks like commando, expert commando, etc, get buffs like bobble heads and chems and get good legendary effects. 
---
I run a non junky or bloodied heavy build and I do 15 damage per shot on the SBQ with a FE .50 which isn’t a ton but it’s a bit more than a lot of people. There are ways to make it work :)
---
Yeah i honestly can't see any benefits whatsoever to having enemies explode. Seems a really odd choice
---
I have all rifle perks maxed out. The only perk cars that I don't have maxed out is sneak. My current build is stealth. No, I don't have the stealth suit (whatever it's called)
---
I am in disbelief at the people who like these more than the other ones. Smh
---
There was a firefiiiight!
---
Theres a gaurnteed spawn in the basement of gregs mine supply on the morgantown map (bottom leftish of map) theres a gaurnteed spawn along with a terminal at the landview lighthouse on flatwoods. (Top of map)
---
I would like an auto-looter perk as a legendary. When killing an enemy you automatically loot their body instead of needing to find a piece of the exploded bits first. I would much rather deal with emptying my inventory over just not getting items because I can't find a piece.
---
When is the double score weekend
---
I built the character I’m using now started out as a rifle man with  1 point rifle perks sneak, stealth, mr sandman and random high level modded my lvl 10 hunting rifle to the max and I leveled up all my cards as I could i was doing like 120-300 dmg a shot or way more at night with sneak shots and silenced then I found a silenced gauss rifle (no legendary) and holy cow does it do some damage like thousands per shot under the right circumstances up to like level 50 now I’m lvl 112 bloodied with a bloodied gauss rifle, bloodied Tesla rifle, a god roll bloodied 25/25 the fixer and all required mutations and switched rifle to commando .. for the queen bloodied Ultracite Gatling laser and bloody mini gun .. it took me hundreds of hours to get this far and I still don’t do as much damage as some people ... I’d watch some angry turtle videos he does a lot of builds and explains why they work
---
I will try, thank you.
---
My hope is that they're leaving it open for another faction sets up camp there.
---
Definitely broken, repaired my shotgun twice in 2 days, I always repair to 200% and that usually lasts a month, also White Knight has same issue i.e no effect whatsoever on condition.
---
Couldn't find any other threads for it, but thanks!
---
Level up every day also not funny
---
Why not both? I run bird bones and still die occasionally. Its the only secondary mod slot thats useful right now i guess
---
Wouldn’t that be funny? Amish farms untouched?
---
what about bloody mess, Adrenaline(when its working), gunfu or other damage increasing perks?
---
I noticed how bad my rad resistance was in power armour when doing rad rumble and trying to actually collect the ore. I have the settler skin on, and it all makes sense now!
---
Time to remove the skins!
---
Does ammo factory stack with ammosmith? 
---
And does fire lining work if I have a full set of heavy combat armor with different legendary effects?
---
These look a lot better than the og legendary perks
---
Wishing fountain at whitespring, might give a bit of incentive to visit the long-dead location
---
I think you're asking for the wrong thing. Nuclear Winter needs updates and more game modes.  There are a lot of games that are BR centered but have other, very fun, game modes that would translate really well to NW. Adventure mode PvP is just flat out broken to hell and it's not worth it to them to fix it. Bethesda needs to dedicate their PvP resources to Nuclear Winter to make it better.
---
Would you rather smaller maps? Bigger maps? Smaller teams? Bigger teams? Objective based? PvPvE? Loadouts? Faster action? Unless you just want to stomp people with some crazy build--in which case you just backed the wrong horse on this game.
---
I can understand not liking the base game of Nuclear Winter. It's a mediocre beta BR with two maps. But the PvP action in it is better than adventure mode by a mile. You're way more likely to get Bethesda to make PvP the way you want it with Nuclear Winter than you are to convince them to expand PvP in Adventure.
---
As I have one character at 200 and one at 160 does that mean 5 slots across both or will they accumulate to 6 for both?
---
That would be amazing .. nice suggestion
---
How do you price legendaries?  Or anything for that matter?
---
Why wouldn’t it? It works with other automatic weapons
---
No clue but personally 25 gold Bulltion is insulting low amount. I mean I can get 20 gold worth killing firefly in path of enlightenment.
---
Wow, talk about completely missing my point. A lot of camps are at pre-existing locations. The tunnel in the cranberry glade. Carhenge. Various unmarked raider camps. An or deposit between Monongah and the mine. I have a cabin southwest of Whitespring on a cliff. Are you trying to tell me that there’s some hidden feature where I can move something that’s part of the actual world? Where the guy in the cave can just move his entire cave to 76? No. Actually, the *really* funny thing is trying to tell people what *they* can and can’t sell in *their* own vendors.
---
Yeah, this is why randomized and/or scaling content is something games of this type usually employ.  It's not a substitute for actual content updates, but it can extend the life of current content without feeling as tedious as time-gates do.
---
&gt;But the time it takes to come up with quests, items, voice recording, bug testing (haha) and more, it is literally impossible.
---
I wouldn't say it's impossible considering games like Warframe, Division 2 and FF14 exist (maybe including FF14 is cheating?  Still...).  But Bethesda clearly isn't throwing much weight behind this game.
---
Your reply was clearly antagonistic. 
---
I simply asked how you would fit it into the game.  You provided a flippant response. 
---
I asked for clarification.  You became dismissive. 
---
Why even post in a public discussion forum if you’re not prepared to have a discussion about your post?
---
Sometimes the computer or safe is "off" this is suppose to be like a crate not being in a spot.
---
This just sounds like fun also
---
Huh interesting I'll try this tonight
---
The lists of fourth and fifth legendary effects exist in the game files, but I doubt we’ll see them anytime soon.  Existing three star weapons can easily tear through the most difficult content, so adding even more power is just going to bloat player power even further.  It’ll just widen the chasm between casuals and min/maxers, when emphasis seems to be leaning towards team play and community.
---
Not to mention the absurdity of trying to roll five great effects, when getting a perfect three star feels like a once in a lifetime miracle.  They’d really have to create a system/grind to custom build a weapon with effects you want, rather than relying on random chance.
---
They don't add up, you'll just have the five slots.
---
Oooooo. I've heard of this but haven't really looked into it. Know a good place where I can look up a  VATs build? If it will work with PA or should go for SS armor? You primed yours as well?
---
Now we're talking.
---
what do now
---
Even so, that means I can move a point from a maxed out special and use this instead. 
---
Additional options for character design are always nice.
---
They can have it so it is partially intact. Just the nose maybe, have a wing pointing out and a bit of debris
---
Sheepsquatch ate my Ass
---
I think there are 4 in the airport that I know of. The med Bay in front of the terminal. The plane the red? Cargo container near the music stand and the robot shop hanger.
---
They would kill PA completely lmao
---
You’re really missing out on tons of gold and treasury notes by waiting. You can still grind rep afterwards. Hell, the rep grinds award you notes so you’re only missing out. I’d highly suggest doing the vault ASAP
---
&gt;  I then had to spend the next hour re-inputting everything from my stash into the store. 
---
1 hour??? I did same thing so many times and it takes no more than 15 minutes to put 120 items in ur vending machines. All u need is just to put everything for sale in ur inventory and than put it back in ur vending machines. Last time a did the whole rutine in 5 minutes.
---
If it's an unyielding set, tons of them
---
You still get the bullion. I just hit level 21 myself. Can’t spend it yet though since I haven’t finished the new quest line!
---
85 days... Beth really fucked the gold system.
---
Oh that's awesome! I think back at launch serums were only sold by NPC vendors and they were a few thousand caps each. But I'll just buy them from players now like everyone is suggesting. Thanks!
---
Small update: just booted up my game &amp; this Snally's level has dropped to 14. 🤔
---
Cool idea but short of like pitsberg or philly where the hell would this take place in pa?
---
They're level 2 PVP is enabled at Lvl 5
---
So if someone has a main character that’s level 76, and four others that are level 50, then they’ve got all six perk slots unlocked for each character.
---
Is that correct?
---
Also, are the unlocked/upgraded cards across the account or character specific?  I think I heard the latter.
---
Oh nice I will add you when I get off work later today. Pretty sure my ign is the same as here - rsrlawman
---
It also says the same thing if it's been hacked by another player already too
---
Well.
---
But also, I get that we are technically the best of the best of society so in theory we “could” build the elaborate mansions some players do out the brick and contemporary home sets.
---
But then you need to account for that our materials are coming from piles of firewood and scrapped pipe weapons and it’s not so believable.
---
So yeah, more post apocalyptic stuff would be nice but we aren’t that far post war yet that the knowledge of how to build nice structures would yet be lost...just the ability to manufacture the components needed.
---
I like my log cabin camp (three log cabins), a Watermill (for power), some crops (for adhesive), a grain silo, and some simple turrets plonked on top on the free states trucks.
---
Then I’ve also got some small power generators to power my vendors and some water purifiers...but those are out of necessity and not because I necessarily want them as they don’t fit the theme (no does the powered letters that guides players to my vendors).
---
So you can “sort of” build for the post apocalyptic world using the log cabins, or that other shed prefab that was in the atomic shop at one time...but it’d be great to have the shipping containers as seen at Morgantown airport, the junk fences, the metal building set from fallout 4 (and some of the dodgier wooden build sets too), and stuff.
---
Will have a check in a bit - gone to do my dailys on main server
---
WeLl TheY HaVE AiRpLAnE sEaTs, but seriously that would be pretty cool
---
That’s an agreeable percentage :)
---
Well with me there is a decent group of us pvpers and well we mainly just pick fights with each other. I don’t really fight people I don’t know unless they attack me first and want to keep seeking till the get the idea. 
---
Plus I get that the fighting is broken and I know it well fighting people who pop quantum’s, cherries, oranges, and if their a junkies build grapes. But me I’ve figured out a way to combat that. I just pvped even against people using broken items or cola spamming. 
---
I did it for the fun, me myself don’t really care for the BR and I’m not the only one I’ve lost a lot of PvP friends because of this last update because they say Bethesda doesn’t give us enough notice to care about what we say.
---
Man i just found an instigating +40% bashing damage assault shotgun the other day and was really wondering how it oneshots almost anything in vats and if it was a Kind of Bug or something.  Almost put it in the shredder til i found out about the magic. Wouldnt sell for 100k caps now. This shit is really crazy but i have to admit it takes out a lot of fun from the game as any other weapon i Hardly farmed and build my Character for is now doing so Low damage... Kinda obsolete. So even if im having my fun with it right now i hope they get this "magic" issue fixed soon. Btw: yesterday i found a i/ffr minigun with an effektive firerate of 225. I tested it on some bigger Mobs but tbh i did Not notice any magic on that Thing. I put it in my vendor for 9999 caps and it got bought like 30 mins later haha
---
I was wondering when the next sale would be! Thank you kind sir
---
I can't even find locks to pick before I am offed.
---
I wish I even knew how legendary modules work
---
If I put an outfit on will it cover the SS armor?
---
I send "hearts" just to everyone
---
I suppose one can only hope, I just want it so that It doesn't show up in the scrip machine lol.
---
Best recommendation of underarmor, power armor and guns in the game. thanks 👌
---
No have gotten to 53 intelligence and get way more xp. There is a cap on charisma for vendor price so ppl can confuse them
---
I had no idea there was a glow in the dark skeleton outfit!!! I've been wearing only the regular, non-glowing skeleton outfit like a noob. How much time did you put into playing to get this as a reward?
---
Thanks how many do I need?
---
I'm trying to get rid of the white water too, but its still there even after using all of your guys' changes.
---
AAE .50 cal:
---
AoE explosion per shot fired
---
AA/FFR .50 cal:
---
25% RoF
---
Your question at the end is not really relevant as the explosive effect for the AAE is a single AoE explosion per shot worth 20% of the base weapon damage. This can be buffed considerably with the demo Expert perk (I have it maxed out).
---
AAE example:
---
Let's say the .50 cal does 100 dmg per shot (hypothetically), the explosive effect adds a small AoE worth 20 dmg. With demo expert V, the explosive effect will do 32 dmg. So in those 4 hits I am doing 528 dmg whereas with the 25% FFR (doing 5 hits in the same time frame) i would be doing only 500 dmg.
---
Remember the explosive effect is AoE, so it will damage other targets in a small area as well. It will damage targets even if you don't hit them. The fireproof perk is essential as well to prevent you from killing yourself. PA and the Stabilized perk is also essential.
---
As for the AA/FFR .50 Cal it add a simple 25% boost to rate of fire, this is great, but only applies if you hit the target all 5 times continuously. FFR is nicer for gatling lasers and flamers (where the explosive effect is no longer available) or for semi-automatic weapons.
---
With the proper perks you can create a very versatile build with the AAE .50 cal or really any AAE. The gatling, minigun, and gauss minigun are quite awesome, especially with the stabilized perk for PA. AAE heavy weapons will win hands down everytime. As for the SBQ, in no build will any AAE weapon efficiently solo a queen. You need a bloody, or junkie weapon for that and the appropriate build.
---
Congrats man! Stupid question, but where do you buy the SS underarmor? I have a few pieces of the SS armor and I really want to compelte the look
---
The fireflies have got me. Beyond that, I can't really care given how grindy it'll be
---
They won’t fix it.
---
If I was a gambling man I’d say they’re going to allow score accumulation right to season end instead of 10 weeks.
---
We need waaaaaaay more raider themed items.
---
I can't hear other players, but if I could I would love this.
---
Y'know, I'll defer to Angry Turtle on this because he did the test, but in my experience, it doesn't seem like it provides any more stealth than it did prior the last patch.
---
I mean, it could just as easily be that Shadowed is a lousy effect to begin with, and that even having 5/5 Shadowed can't compare to the Sneak perk.  I can and will get caught, crouched in front of a Super Mutant, with 5/5 Unyielding Shadowed gear if I don't have Sneak.  Which is a shame because I'd really love to get rid of Sneak and free up more Agility.
---
Awesome, looks like some genuinely good stuff. I'll miss the armor buff ones since it goes well with antivenom (matching set), but some of these are more than a good compromise. Also, do we still have any news on what "once per hour, max 3" means? Is it another micromanagement game where every so often you need to empty out your inv or else the perk stops working?
---
Alright thank you. I want to keep trying. But, I don't know where to start increasing my chances to pick locks.
---
The buildings in Fallout 1 and 2 barely counted as such unless they had people living in them.
---
oh yes - by far the best method. I have all 5 characters on my account above level 100 (but 50 is fine to get the max level items from mumbles). My main gets modules to roll SS armor etc. while the alts all roll for weapons and I get way more this way. 4 alts all turning in 150 scrip a day means 6 rolls with her, far better rate of return and I've obtained the majority of my best weaponry in this fashion. Adding the scrip gear to an in game container then switching character works fine you'll need a friend to anchor the server, or better yet use your private one if you have fallout 1st (makes this much easier).
---
Thanks. Just seems like that is the one I am most likely going to aim for. But I guess I have plenty of time before it arrives that I'll get an answer eventually.
---
I'd love the ability to add more debris to the ground and broken objects as well.  Flickering lights, broken sinks that run water, warmer lighting (rater than 90% of the lights being blinding white).   Its the apocalypse... i want to live like it!
---
Because it's still in beta ^^/s ^^but ^^not ^^really ^^because ^^it's ^^true
---
Sorry, Troubleshooter's 25% faster fire rate 90% weight reduction .50 cal in my vendor, but no bloodied or explosive. Still, let me know if you want it.
---
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes
---
Set them at what you would pay for them if they fitted your build.
---
Anything that is a god roll or close to it (like a combat rifle FFR as opposed to a fixer FFR) either price highly (and have little to nothing else for sale and not many caps on you) OR use a trading sub to organise a sale/swap for something you need).
---
Otherwise I just adjust based on how long it’s say there or how heavy it is.
---
I sell useless legendaries for 250 caps a star (weapons), or 150 caps a star (armour).  Other legendaries that are useful but not god rolls I set to 1500 (one star unyielding or bloody...unless fixer) to 5000 (2-3 stars) unless I add dense to a chest piece then I sell for more).
---
Chems and the like I just randomly assign a price based on if they are a combination or not.  10 caps for basic ones (like buff out), 20 for combined ones (like buff tats), and 30 for actually useful ones (orange mentats).
---
Any ammunition sell for 1 cap, except for ultracite rounds, I set those to 2 caps.
---
Just go by feel and what prices things move at.
---
Better to keep stuff selling so you can spend your caps on stuff (plans and the like, or even cheap legendaries to scrip or sell yourself) than to have stuff sitting in your vendor forever taking up stash space.
---
I used to do that when I wasn't grinding like crazy for Score
---
I thought the character writing throughout 76, and the voice work, were consistently excellent, the Brotherhood is no exception. Belly of the Beast is the best and most memorable quest from the original campaign IMO. 
---
I do wish the Brotherhood hadn't been shoehorned into West Virginia 25 years after the bombs tho. That group could have simply remained The Thunder and it would have been cooler and more interesting.
---
Mine is simple- all the shotgunner cards in strength (12 points) VATS targeting (gives damage boost as well) in perception (3 points) fireproof in endurance (3 points) enforcer in Agility (3 points) than grim reaper's sprint in luck (3 points) rest are up to you. The 5 points for mutations in luck are good as well as Agility perks due to extra AP, but I like the build being loose so I can change if/as needed. Currently I have 15, 7, 3, 3, 10, 6, 11 SPECIAL
---
It's on Netflix currently, give it a shot if you like sketch comedy shows.
---
Thanks! Yeah as I rebuild, I'm doing more windows and less lights. Very expensive.
---
Blowing out your neighbor's window at 2 in the morning despite getting numerous warnings and having an overall negative reputation in the neighborhood for various smaller misdemeanors
---
Go back and read my comment and then tell me where I said what you can or cannot sell, I merely stated the fact the camps can be blueprinted for easy moving, but thank for reading between the lines that aren't there.
---
It was odd; I ended up scrapping him and I immediately failed a quest for him, like I had it the whole time, but it never became active? I'm so confused lol.
---
Wow that is really cool. My camera and I love seeing unique stuff like this.
---
How is shooting a person in the back of the head with a pipe rifle an accident?  I think you can rest easy with a clear conscious.
---
I'm good but thanks haha
---
I went broke for the herbivore serum recipe, I need to make a few more tonight for sale.
---
Thanks - I think lighting was my biggest issue. I am going to wait on the displaying in display cases for later.
---
thank god tbh, as handy as they would have been it would have destroyed both PA and my sanity trying to get armor pieces for every slot that match, meet my requirements AND are the same level
---
Jealous of your free time
---
It's 14,000 overseer xp so... alot
---
An average game of NW with a couple kills and maybe you survive till top 10 nets maybe a few hundred xp?  With each game lasting 20-30 min the time really adds up
---
The locked containers are random each match, so sometimes a container will be pickable or inaccessible depending on how it spawns in.
---
Pretty cool
---
I agree. I'm just looking at the utility perk (infiltrator I think its called) and I'm excited that I can lock pick again without playing the stupid perk card shuffle minigame first
---
Oddly specific, but the username checks out on this one
---
Could one of our wealthier brethren give this hero an award please? Lol
---
With demo expert V, AAE will win out
---
Same
---
I was really bummed with I discovered you couldn't tame a cat for your CAMP pet.
---
Social distancing means more time in the wasteland!
---
incorrect, with demo expert 5, AAE has more DPS
---
That is pretty amazing tbh
---
Think the idea is neet but while having grown up just out of pa and spent many a week end in antique shops and flee markets and yard sales there I have to say their resources and ability to cheaply manufactured goods along with mass plots of cheep land making everything spread out there and the large rolling hills would make the game loot rich, spars asf and aucwordly large for how few buildings you'd come across for the most part what I've seen all across the state all you see are little towns at the most no larger then helvetia other then stuff right around Pittsburg and philly so take that back to the like 40's and 50's how it looked what you have would be a map larger then the current one but with 1/3 the amount of loot to find and the in game lore about all of pa being unlivable terrifying conditions the the CPU's just wanna forget and never have to return to or even groups talking about just passing through pa to get to wv and losing large parts of their caravan, I could see them having it be somthing as a story continuation to like go in and kill things trying to clear it for the ability to settle there like what vault 76's purpose was but it would most likely need to be a higher level area then any area in 76 is already and be "more veteraned area for only the most experienced or foolish to explore" and propose great loot and xp but also be hard as fuck and then have a whole story ark built into that and then ofc of they were gonna do it as a story ark they would be required to give players an option as how to progress and how to move forward with it in different ways
---
I've had mine across two characters in four foundation structures for several months now, during that time I've probably moved maybe 20 times and haven't had any problems putting those structures down. Except for one of my houses I had to rebuild it once because something wound up floating inside of it.  I put my fusion generator inside with my vendors and run conduits through the wall, then when I move, I just wire all my structures together. Boom, I'm moved.
---
see, my reply for the math, at demo expert 5, AAE does more dps
---
I'll buy one of them there serums from you. Provided you're on ps4 and sell them for less than 4k.
---
It’s worth mentioning that after you have placed your camp, you can pick it up and move it around in build mode, anywhere within the zone!
---
Someone bought the 10k 5mm I had in my store and I was able to buy it the other night after I saw the Angry Turtle video about it.
---
I do have it coming down from directly overhead. That does help a bit.
---
This stuff had a fairly interesting encryption methods and the PTS Dataminer community for Patch 20 had an interesting time deciphering all 5 Broadcast Messages
---
It’s a step in the right direction.  And it’s something this community asked for, and apparently Bethesda listened.
---
Ohh, alrighty thanks
---
This is what I meant but now that you say it I realized mine totally sounds like move the circle over and over until it works right lmao
---
What perks will make her stagger and not land?
---
Me and my buddy got one plan to drop last night on our 2nd try together. RNG may vary?
---
You tell Flatwoods to add a pond that I can aquaboy around in then. There is only like 2 spots where the water is deep enough there and even then I am nearly fully visible from land.
---
Seems like my dream will never come true if they’re not making 2mm core
---
That's actually pretty simple. I'll give it a shot. Time to play with something new.
---
*scrip.
---
You’re not doing any damage to her?
---
It should be. It said all powerarmour types
---
I just realised that my dream will never come true until they make a 2mm core
---
I wish I could take credit for it, but I'm just passing along what I've learned:)
---
Well this is what they thought of after trying to implement the god-awful perks they originally thought of (half of which are still there) but were shot down and criticised by almost everybody in the PTS
---
FYI, You can explore the drop chances if you want:
---

---
Canucksplaining eh
---
Legendary modules are used to craft certain items you get the plans for from the bouillon vendors. Because it’s a legendary module the item you craft will always be a legendary.
---
So with that about 500xp on super mutants I'll let you know when I boost it more tonight
---
Amen
---
At 50/75/100 etc you get a slot available. All the perks are available to choose.
---
Once you choose, it "locks in", and costs a coin to change it (presumably to stop people swapping to the ammo one, crafting, and swapping back).
---
You can rank them up using coins.
---
You earn coins by sacking in normal perk cards - each one is worth 1 coin.
---
Ranking up is expensive - its 100 coins to go from lv1 to lv2. So you'll end up with a few lv1 perks, maybe a lv2 and only the no lifers will have multiple lv 3-4 (unless theres suddenly more ways of earning perk cards or coins)
---
Those percentages are actually better than Fasnacht it looks.
---
I think so as well, because it does what it says, but with the conversion rate, and the interface, it seems like it's designed to not be useful.  I'm not really interested in bashing Bethesda or anything, it just strikes me that it was designed with doing the job but not actually being useful in mind.
---
I could harp on how it needs to be fixed, and they already admitted as much, but that's not what this is about.
---
Any chance you were logged into Nuclear Winter the last time you played?   A friend told me it’s a good idea to log into Adventure mode after NW, then log out for the night.  Don’t know if there’s anything to it or not.
---
That would make sense
---
No. They were level 2 and I was level 8. I started at the Steam Summer Sale.
---
Totally. One of my favorite tricks is to add a half height wall with a window on top of the regular walls. Lets in light through the top but doesn't affect your walls/furniture placement/wall decor placement. Roofs snap to them pretty easily, and it helps with the often claustrophobic-feeling default roof height.
---
The contemporary (light blue exterior siding) set has a nice looking half height window, and my second favorite is the barn set (red vertical siding for the exterior).
---
DRINK NUKASHINE IT MAKES YOU INDESTRUCTIBLE
---
No man is not like that, I just posted an idea I obtained a typical answer from someone who want to have the entire reason, I just dont want, i dont like to discuss and I'm not into, now u asked me how does it fit in lore I ask u back how a mothman bag fits in lore or meatweek or alien theme, they just dont not in this game and yet exist so why not to add a steam punk semi futuristic style when fallout is about exactly that broken massive utopia where energy can fit in a cell, why not to transport that to a steampunk jetpack or a cool looking face and weapon skins for the new gauss things? 
---
I abandon this post now u will have something to say to defend this companie or lore or whatever and I'm not into having a discussion with u.
---
And if you ever happen to start a new character never pick keys or keycards twice...those add up fast and cause lag AND you can’t drop them...because reasons (well Bethesda hasn’t even acknowledged this long standing request yet).
---
I’ll check this when I get on tonight. I’ve been fine so far but last night I’m pretty sure the last thing I did was NW so if mine are completed I’ll come back here
---
Here is one.  I placed a red circle around the area. In this cluster of houses, there is a house with a basement.  There is a safe in the basement.  Pretty sure it's there in adventure mode too if you want to scope the place out before trying it in NW.    
---
[https://imgur.com/tWpEDaB](https://imgur.com/tWpEDaB)
---
This is in Flatwoods. There is a boat with a safe on it in this area I circled.
---
 https://imgur.com/utdbwEF
---
got mine yesterday! way to go dude hah
---
Wow....
---
I'm all ears. Big fuzzy ears!
---
Thanks, got it accomplished!  I recalled two safes in the scout camp, so I went and got those in two attempts!
---
Okay cool I waS worried we’ed have to buy the perks which would really suck
---
I agree, but so far I haven't found anyone AFK.  I guess I have terrible luck.  Since I've been playing NW, just for the S.C.O.R.E., I've set mine to No Fill.  I don't see a reason to hurt my team members, just so I could go out and accomplish the challenges.  If you find me hiding in a bush, broken elevator, or porta-john I'm definitely not AFK.  I do move with the storm and try to avoid running into people.  I'm just trying to survive as long as possible in the fewest games possible.
---
i haven't been able to invite anybody in over a week. it either straight up says 'no you're not coming in' or it lets people in and then kicks them instantly
---
Cargo straps, just throw a crate on your back with bungie cords for "PA Storage/Backpack"
---
Did that challenge without even seeing it thanks to shotgun crits.  (VATS shotgun build on my new character...thank you four leaf clover and grim reapers spring).
---
The last thing I did was the NW challenge
---
Agreed, especially since I have this weird bug that after each time killing my first mob after I log in I get the pop-up from rank 1 all up to my current (it takes a while already at rank 29, imagine closer to 100...). It gets a but tiresome and it's really in the way while playing.
---
That is the bug where you've changed servers.
---
If you junk servers or get told your camo can't be placed and find a new server... They bug out
---
That's lame. I haven't had any issues yet *knock on wood*
---
I agree completely. I would love more roof options, for instance, that have things like holes and rust. Maybe even odd materials. 
---
My latest camp has two buildings. One is a Slocum’s Joe that I tried my best to “dirty up.” Right beside it I put a wooden shack (might change that material in the future). I tried to make it reflect the build you might find at Megaton or Diamond City. The Slocum’s Joe has a nuclear generator and I kept power connection clean and hidden. For the shack, it’s wires hanging every which way and hooked up to the generator. Like the 76er chose that spot in order to use the power from the restaurant. 
---
I think it’d be great if I had more options to make the shack look more thrown together with material that had to be scavenged. 
---
I feel the same regarding outfits.
---
The problem with flatwoods is that its well.... flat, for lack of a better word. I think a lot of people enjoy hicking buildings with frog legs, and running between the tight corners. Flatwoods on the other hand depends more on the flora and hills, so there isnt a lot of place you can take cover, so you depend more on stealth. Thats why I think a lot more people vote for morgantown than anything else.
---
...I feel attacked.
---
Yeah man! No problem. In the picture it may appear that way but I think it blends much better in the actual game. It’s just black, and the majority of the silver shroud outfit is pitch black. You might be right though I’ll have to have another look!
---
i like the idea, like the hunter/hunted but with teams agreeing to hunt each other. i think that would be super fun.
---
There are 4 potential locks in the Bank in the middle of Morgatown - there's a locked box inside that building as well if you go in a hole in the wall - if you go all the way to the roof there's a locked box up there as well. There's also a locked tool box in the robot repair shop down the street- as well as one up on the monorail just down the street as well. You can familiarize yourself by going in adventure mode - finding locked boxes - then going to those places in NW
---
Well footage of exploding enemies was already in the Summer Gameplay trailer so so guess they can't take those perks out, now matter how stupid they are.
---
I’m glad you can wear your ignorance on your sleeve, keep up the good fight.
---
Imo there should be like a 3-5 second grace period where the bosses just can't die. Long enough for other people to get a shot in, short enough that they'll still die pretty quickly anyway.
---
Agreed, my camp is asymmetrical and looks lived in and I have plenty of strategically placed concrete barriers. Some more realistic stuff would be rad. Like  a bucket reservoir sink/bathroom system or a parachute hammock. Some awnings would be rad for porches and roof tops also made out of repurposed parachutes or tarps. Also, some used targets would be good wall coverings.
---
No it isn't and it's another example of how you can do it easily by cheesing.  I have four characters, but my fifth slot is empty.  So  for leveling up, I start a new character.  For a character fresh out of the vault it's very easy to level up.  Getting to level 2 doesn't complete the challenge, for some reason, but getting to level three does. I can usually get to level three by exiting the vault, killing a few creatures, discovering some new locations and then going to wayward and talking to Duchess. That usually completes the level Up challenge. Then I just delete the character.  Same thing with level up challenge for NW.
---
I wish I could do it on my PS4 though (former apac nerd who now has a family to look after and no room for an office / man cave in my house).
---
I’d also be slightly worried that Bethesda would randomly say its cheating and mass ban people who use unofficial mods...not that they show any sign of doing that given the hacked weapons and rampant nuclear winter cheating on PC.
---
Not sure if the bloody mess dmg is working but the exploding animation works. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
It's such an improvement I'm not sure I believe it.
---
Yep what this fella said. I usually averaged about 500xp per game, surviving till about 9 left or less. I started trying to be more aggressive, getting 4 kills, but not surviving as long and I didn’t get nearly as much XP. It pays to Wookiee. Good luck man! I GROUND most of it out last night, but for a fair amount of time (around 8:30pm to 5:00am 😭) and then finished it off later on
---
Maybe not clear after getting shot in the head

I'm simultaneously terrified and morbidly curious to get a look at Bethesda's database structure. Some of the issues they have make me suspect that thing is architected in some weird ways. I've seen some made by professional, big name companies that are the stuff of nightmares. Literally, since I had to maintain one for a while. -\_-
---
Ah, okay. Should just take about 10 minutes give or take as all you have to do is kill every mob on your way from the vault to Duchess’s place and then take the contract to kill Crane. Once you do that and head into Flatwoods for the first time, you’ll be level 3 or 4 pretty easily as that location and mob xp stacks up big time.
---
That's really cool!
---
Yeah those were awesome and would be great additions to this game!  Most of the ones in the world had stilt foundations so they could use that instead of the concrete ones like most of the prefab structures do in this game.  Or have 2 versions like the greenhouse.
---
They are selling the French bourgeoise?
---
Le revolution
---
I agree. It was just so... anticlimactic. My sister and I were giddy when he showed up and then bam he flew into the air two feet from the door. I don't get why some people find so much glee in the disappointment of others. But wish there were controls in place to prevent that outcome.
---
Exactly it would make things fun for the small PvP community. And I wonder if they could make it so more than just 2 teams can agree.( I know that’s asking for a lot but just throwing it out there) But to be able to have team fights again would be great.
---
You’re awesome for doing this✊
---
Thank you back to the grind!
---
I was stoked for my first win.  I was hiding in bushes the whole time, then near the end I happened across a yellow crate with a minigun and marine armor for a 1 on 1 vs another bush wookiee.
---
I’d say the bank in Morgantown
---
If you ever did the event “activate steelheart” (I think that’s what it is called) it’s the last place he unlocks. Just for better understanding and finding. If you have never done the event then it’s close by Biv’s place.
---
Can’t hate on a good old t-bag m8 🤙🏻
---
The sounds it makes give me anxiety
---
Same here, I did the Set you Camp challenge and logged out for the night.  Hope I didn’t screw up.  I’ll find out in a couple hours.
---
aw, give the poor little guy a break. it's clearly not fair how Bethesda daily sends their hired goons to their residence, putting a gun to their head and forcing them to play a game they so loudly hate!
---
Go to the trading sub, enter item name in search and see what people are getting in trade.
---
Yes... I have yet to roll a great SS armor.
---
I love the abandoned ship idea!!!!
---
   I would absolutely live on an abandoned yacht  or houseboat in the apocalypse for real
---
Fixer has her own paint already?
---
If I was there I’d let your sister or your sister shoot it.
---
Yet to find a locked one so far today.

---
By default 76 only has voice chat, but there is a [mod that adds a Text Chat](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/151).  Though everyone in your team would have to be using it to communicate with it, of course.
---
Ah. I have had legendary modules in my inventory for months and had no idea what to use them for
---
It’s ironic to me how Lyons chapter of the BOS is the most similar to the original ideals of it, yet were called traitors by the other chapters
---
When the vendor robot dude starts up?
---
One of the most awsome things ive seen in a camp well done bud
---
Once you claim it in the shop, just go to an armor workbench and choose “Craft”, then go to “Outfits” and it should be there. The headpiece will be in a different subcategory called “Headgear” I think? Not 100% sure.
---
It sounds like you want one of them Shrek houses?
---
Your teammates have a larger "dot" on the map and the Team Leader gets a fancy blue and black star icon.
---
YES. That or the Fastnacht bot...that voice...ugh
---
The armor is good he had to of been cheating cause when I played for the winter jacket and jeans a few months back I used the pa and handmades didn’t one shot me. So I say yes most likely he was cheating
---
Woah....this is MUCH better looking!
---
Plus they were so uncreative.
---
Someone said yesterday the outfit in the picture is a different outfit, some kinda harness
---
Just FYI the trading sub set prices much higher than the average player.
---
"Anti-venom and fur lining do not appear to apply to PA" UGH...
---
So PA is officially dead then right? Why does Bethesda hate PA so much?
---
\*Edit: I didn't realize they killed the armor perks...interesting.
---
Bethesda sucks ass. Still enjoy the game tho.
---
But my god, this company seems to be getting worse by the day. More bugs, premium pay models, hardly any or slow fixes. It's like what happened to them? Greed. Greed never changes
---
Few hundred, got lucky overall
---
Insigating 50LD 25VC gauss shotgun

AA FFR FR gauss minigun (may re roll later) 
---
Vanguard cavalier +STR SS set, why CAV? I mainly use a ISS +STR super sledge and I sprint alot. But I can switch perks around easily to be 1 handed, 2 handed, unarmed, shotgun, or heavy weapons
---
Thank you!!
---
Much better ones, but the power armor ones are still completely shit.
---
The challenge means VATs criticals not just headshots etc
---
Idk, I like the new cards and the entire system as a veteran player!
---
It really should apply to PA. Only way to change it is tonket beth know.
---
Honetsly I have some op guns but I NEVER use them in a fight against weak opponents unless I’m the only one doing the event or only one around
---
I don't, only got the cushioned mods for the legs. Might get an arm mod tomorrow, didn't think any were that good though
---
Yes! Have an immersive upvote
---
Yup
---
Been a lot of that lately with the handmade... not sure how, but someone 1shot my entire team the other night with one
---
Looks like replaced with "Matching Set".  Seems good to me!
---
Right when I came out of the vault, my bf and one of his friends gave me a bow and some spare ammo. I've missed the skyrim style bow mechanics! Might take me a little longer, but nothing beats that sweet feeling of nailing a lvl68 feral ghoul dude from up on a cliff lol
---
I think they should implement something like how they have with the sheepsquatch in encrypted and any final wave boss should not take damage for a few seconds but what hits you get count incase if someone one shots it when it comes out of that protection.
---
I waited a month because I couldn’t complete the new story and I didn’t get squat for it.  Doubt they have atoms to these people
---
You actually don’t have better odds in the lottery tbh
---
It’s funny... when I see flatwoods get selected I know we got some Bush Wookies in the game.
---
I'm gonna finish the mods fir the guass minigun and shotgun, then probably the plas caster and gauss pistol
---
Please read our wiki page on this subject

---
You didn’t ask me how a Mothman backpack fits into the lore. You just said:
---
&gt; ‘the lore’ Mothman bag
---
Is that supposed to be some kind of shorthand everyone is supposed to understand?
---
I never said it was a bad idea. I asked for details so that I could understand your idea better.  How it would fit into the universe. 
---
But that’s not what you wanted. You just wanted to say *’check this radikewl idea, lulz!’*
---
And again, nothing has broken lore in Fallout 76. So you’re arguing/debating from a false premise in the first place.  Nothing about a Mothman-themed backpack breaks lore in Fallout. But it’s amusing (*and quite revealing*) to learn that you think so. 
---
Have a good day, kid. I’ll be sure to ignore your ‘one word suggestions’ in the future.
---
*Million dollar idea, lol* 😂
---
Edit: And look; your reply got removed. 
---
Watch the foul language. 
---
And funny, I thought you were don’t with this discussion. But you couldn’t resist coming back to throw out an offensive slur, now could you?
---
Thank you all for the wonderful suggestions, I have completed the challenge, thanks to all your help.
---
Never Forget
---
Yeah. I think I've heard people call it a lazy build because it's not strict on a particular special build or foods
---
Get the rest of the mods/items from bullion
---
And I'm grinding SCORE now, around tier 30 now
---
Ahhhhh ok it looks just like the one we can craft ...but minus the sweater under it ...thought I was missing somthing
---
I’m loving the new changes
---
No, you need to have one character who is level 300 to unlock all 6 slots. Levels are not cumulative between toons.
---
It will be an honour to visit. Its gonna be my favourite  wasteland cafe =)
---
Isnt there still a day until it comes out on gamepass?
---
The first encrypted event I did I got the staff plan and I didn’t even have a build so I was barley doing enough compared to others
---
Oh ok I see, thank you. I was hoping there was some ini I might have missed to change this but well I think I’ll make use of my macrokeys for the first time ever
---
Can't you already do something like that with the cycling light bulb? You can change it to the purplish light similar to a black light.
---
I think they should cut prices, or up the daily limit. As well as add treasury notes to more event loot pools
---
It looks like the raider harness underarmor
---
Yea that I know I was saying that the one I crafted didnt look like the one in the atomic shop...thought there was a way to mod it. But it appears the pic they used in the atomic shop was a different outfit
---
I bought the Log Cabin bundle thinking it was a new wall texture as opposed to just one log cabin. The only things I use from the bundle now are the waterwheel and the fire pit.
---
Definitely getting that on my commando character
---
I think i have that...will have to check tonight thanx
---
Its sold for 250 gold by Regs at Vault 79, the shielded plan (best lining upgrade) is sold there too for 200 bullion
---
No, not yet. The combat rifles got a beautiful black skin in the new board game this season, as well as a jack o' lantern skin from NW. The fixers got 0.
---
No problem
---
Thank you for this. I didnt even realize demo helped with the explosive part of weapons.  
---
Knowing it just does 20% more is super helpful. So without demo ffr is clearly better for single targets. 
---
Killing the scorched hordes as well makes the explosive nice. 
---
Thank you for your response.
---
What staff?
---
I dont even get that close. I'm rocking full SS buttressed and with rad sheild I have over 600 rad resist and still take 16 rads per second. Adding that extra 300 resistance takes me from 19 to the 16. So another 300 will probably only take me down to 12-13 at most. At max rank with -6 rads per second thats still atleast 6 rads per second
---
Quick bit of advice if you have the beam splitter mod on your laser it only adds one beam cause it adds from the default amount of shots. If you knew well hope it teaches someone who looks at this and didn’t know.
---
It's +1 stat and +1 slot for each level. (So level 2 is +2/+2 etc).
---
Probably worth mentioning - you can only take each legendary perk once. So you cant use 2 of your legendary slots to take strength twice.
---
Yes it will (apart from the jet pack mod)
---
Okay, that makes more sense. It’s only your highest level character that counts for ‘slot unlocking’. 
---
So, the first slot is unlocked for the account once any character on that account reaches 50. The second account slot needs a character to reach 75.  And so on. 
---
That’s more balanced.
---
With the SS Armor I just surrendered trying to get al unyielding full set. With the thorn armor It was waaaay easier. Don't ask me why
---
Community: "Power armor needs some love, since it can't benefit from legendary effects and a lot of the mods are both expensive and useless."
---
Bethesda: "We gave regular armor even MORE things PA can't do! But hey, an uncommon damage type might kinda sorta recharge your core, once in a blue moon. And you have a small chance to just revive when you inevitably die."
---
I swear by all the gods above and below, we are just screaming into a f@#$%ing void w/these people. They are so divorced from reality that they should become politicians.
---
I'm really upset I missed the secret nuka door because my raider camp really needs a "fuck you" door
---
Wait, there's supposed to be a legendary wendigo at the end of this?
---
Every time I play it, ghouls try to storm the building for 5 minutes, and then the event just ...ends.
---
Happened to me with the banjo, I had to fast travel to my camp and play the banjo then get up in order to clear the glitch. 
---
It's stupid.
---
Damn, that's cheap. Maybe i already bought it and just forgot to craft it
---
Wallpaper doesn't take up budget?
---
Yes, but unlike Fasnacht, spinners and afk-ers can make the event fail as far as I see (i.e., not sure if going on the drums or spits while afk won't kick them anyway).
---
Thanks pal
---
I would never use a camp budget glitch to build what I want in this game .... ever. 😂
---
I love the idea! For every 50,000 caps deposited in-game, Bethesda could donate one dollar towards the make a wish foundation or another solid charity! Good PR for Bethesda, incentive for the players!
---
I like this idea
---
if i saw that i would nuke the place i think
---
Oh shit it was probably 16, not 6 then lol. Well that ruins my plans for the What Rads? perk RIP
---
Additive
---
It's possible, it's in the under armor section on the armor workbench
---
Which is weird since there us a whole section just for the secret service armor. And it has the helmet in the category too, which is only cosmetic
---
Man I couldn't agree with you more. Hear hear !
---
Thank you fellow Enclave supporter.
---
What part of the others were good?
---
**Here's how to save your vending machines contents!**
---
1. Disconnect the machine from power
---
2. Move it outside of your CAMP, away from all other CAMP items
---
3. Move your CAMP to the new location
---
4. Place the stored vending machines
---
This will retain the inventory in each of your vending machines.
---
I move/rebuild my CAMP about once a week, and this saves me A LOT of headaches. (Note: It also works when you max out your caps at 30k and have to pull your vending machines down.)
---
I love that glitch. Turns the whole thing into a quick XP grind, especially if you get lucky on a lunchbox and/or have XP% boosts stacked up.
---
Ah, that's probably it. I don't think I've checked the underarmor section in a while
---
I've seen a camp in that diner, so I've either seen yours, or you're not the only one to do this.
---
Ah ok, I'll have try that when I get home.  Thanks.
---
Ok so just for science, my char on PTS is level 193. If I scrap EVERYTHING that isnt in my active perk list I get 281 coins.
---
Now obviously on the live server I'm NOT going to scrap all my spares, because I want things like super duper, and ammo smith etc, so realistically I'll have far less to scrap.
---
Even less because I like to swap between heavy/melee and shotgun builds, so between that and the crafting ones, Im not going to have that many to get rid of.
---
I've had this happen as well. Thought I just messed it up the first few time but recently I was going to the top left and it sent me to the bottom right.
---
Doesn't happen often, I've noticed it about three times in the past few weeks.
---
AFK players didn’t seem to cause any issues last year when the event would run so I’m not worried. The only way to make it fail would be if players collected all the items and never turned them into the cooler. But usually there’s enough people there collecting and turning in it’s not an issue.
---
Me, starting this game: wow I sure can't wait to meet all the nice people everybody talks about
---
*gets incinerated by three bloodied build players with tesla guns and legacies*
---
Hemlock holes workshop at the top of the map dude
---
Yea, supposed to stack.
---
Assuming legendary effects doesnt matter. Should be by armor type. Not sure if its matching means light,sturdy,heavy or like leather, SS, combat etc though.
---
Helmlock Holes Maintenance for Acid Workshop as for Plastic got to Taylor County Fair Grounds, Wavy Willard's Water Park or Camden Park and start picking up all the plastic cups and food trays on the floor and stalls.
---
I've given up trying to get this. Seems impossible, and I'm doing pretty well with the weapons I already have anyways.
---
Mama Dolces has at least 1.
---
Yeah, I'm sure you could figure out a decent flavor for mixing them together too, like a "homemade hazmat" sort of thing since it's sorta like modifying your existing armor, with it being dependent on matching equipment.
---
Today I was saying follow me both on emote and voice chat for the wendigo colossus , nobody come
---
I don’t think it has to do with damage it’s just rng. I got the fixer plan and the sheepsquatch outfit(not mascot) when I tanked the pylons and ran around in circles while everyone else killed it. Also the last two times I tried doing most of the damage because I want the sheepsquatch helmet and I got the fedora both times
---
Yes it still rewards you if you haven’t completed wastelanders yet so feel free to claim it.
---
The deliverer would be awesome. 
---
My bloodied ffr 10mm auto handgun appreciates the ease of ammo availability!
---
Whoa dude, stay away from the acid man.
---
But if you really need some reliably, Hemlock Holes maintenance, on the very top center West of the map, has three acid node locations. Pretty decent amount and relatively easy to defend.
---
Plastic is a different beast I don't think there's really a workshop that specializes in it, but you can always check out the Charleston junkyard, with its three junk piles. But to my knowledge plastic is easier to find out in the world, for example Candem Park has several plastic, and the schools / hospitals have dining areas that I know have quite a bit of plastic.
---
And please don't lock it behind a challenge grind or atom shop, just let us get the plans from a quest
---
I know I'm not the only one to build there. I'm on xbox, I've had a lot of people come through the area and stop at my camp.
---
Honestly I don’t have a taste for stuff like this but I can see why some think it’s funny. I don’t care enough to downvote though.
---
Seasons and the time gated grind killed Division 2 for me.  I'm trying to keep 76 alive in my heart, but when I finish an entire set of dailies and don't even get a level it's discouraging.
---
Yeah, I’ll search [price check] then the item and try to get some kind of calculation like that. It’s imperfect but the best you can do.
---
I mean, if you look at her, she's olive colored compared to a regular combat rifle.
---
Don’t use workshops for plastic. Best spot I found was AVR med center in the cafeteria(near Charleston fire dept) There’s at least 25 trays. As for acid hemlock hole workshop has 2 or 3 acid locations for the resource extractors
---
It is a lv30 lengendary
---
Honestly it sucks, it just happened to me just now as I logged in. Hoping this won’t happened tomorrow
---
See, I’ve accidentally done this. I’ll be one-shotting ghouls and not even notice that what I just shot was, in fact, NOT a ghoul. My bad, to everyone I’ve done this to.
---
Praise be to Todd! .45 and 2mm users rejoice
---
I liked the concepts, simple and add power. These  don't seem exciting or usable in any way - with the exception being the legendary effect. Infiltrator is worthless and solved a problem that should have just been changed or will be solved with loadouts... a legendary perk should do more than save a player a couple clicks. Oh well, it's all just extra stuff so it's not like we lose anything
---
...and use a shotgun if you have one (craft one if you don't).
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hnhr7e/psa_each_shotgun_pellet_counts_towards_deal_a/
---
Thorn armour pieces are always 3 star, that’s why.
---
Meat week is super relaxed. I've never been in one where it failed. The drops are much better rare wise too. As a FOMO player this one I can truly enjoy without fear.
---
LMG is a heavy gun mate, not a rifle
---
I agree to much shit going on 🤣🤣
---
Why the hell doesn’t antivenom work in PA? FFS Bethesda regular armor doesn’t need poison res there’s a legendary mod for that. These still suck for the most part.
---
lol, I was hoping it would say "more junk for the trunk" when someone buys something at the vendor.
---
So good to see they’ve improved them. Very excited for this
---
Wow. They managed to remove the only legendary park from the previous implementation that I was interested in.
---
Smiley refreshes on Saturday at 8pm EST.
---
I actually love the default color, the problem is that when you go into the scrip machine, anything without a skin shows. I'd absolutely hate accidentally scripping one of my fixers. Plus it would be nice to have a bit of modification since the handmades have like 6 or more skins now.
---
And I want an Asaltron or Deathclaw. And I am ready to spend all my 4000 atoms.
---
I don't think there will be, and honestly I'm kind of okay with it. If they gave us an account based storage system so I could easily ferry items to a different character I'd be happy. I built a PA-Heavy Gunner because I got a level 30 2-shot Vampires Flammer on one character, and  now I've gotten a sweet Radium and Handmade rifle and think im going to build a rifleman/commando build,
---
Here's a image showing safe and toobox locations that you can picklock.  Not all toolboxes are locked.
---
https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Mappalachia#/media/File:F76_Mappalachia_Tool_Chests_and_Safes.jpeg
---
I specifically do the xp% items when o see the event start
---
Flatwoods suck that is why it has no real verticallity and the fights are super linear , morgantown has roofs back alleys, deep rivers and mountain cliffs
---
Thanks. That sounds pretty decent since I took a middle of the road build that didn't go over 12 in any special so I can add specialization that way.
---
This, don't put it off, there is no benefit to waiting.
---
It was probably just Benny and his goons after your platinum chip.
---
Yeah but fuck Bethesda don't forget about that
---
One option is to repeatedly go pick it up again on the top floor of Hornewright industrial in charleston. 
---
That didnt work for me. 
---
How I got it to work was fabricating one using Penny's computer on the top floor of the building you want into.  
---
Terminal in a room. You search that floor for clues as to the password and use the printer to make one. I assume if the quest wasnt bugged, you could do this without even having the I'd card from HW originally.
---
Antivenom (poison resist) works with my SS. Legendaries are all different.
---
Doesnt work with PA
---
Not enough lag
---
Fun. It's for fun.
---
Got the same problem today.
---
Eww, enclave scum
---
Thank you moose
---
Which means he should of refreshed last saturday, but didn't.
---
I love looking at a building now and wondering: "can I get to the top of that?"
---
Infiltrator was part of the old ones though so pointing that one out to make your point that the old ones were better is useless.  It was called follow through, before.
---
Arnt you the same guy posting this every hour?
---
You'll get your reckoning when our people return, just you wait
---
A 5.56 pistol would be awesone too
---
Until there's more powerful enemies (or just any end game content really) there isn't really a what for, but I could totally see them making is grind some new currency for a 4* weapon or armor that they'll see as being content
---
If u get any cosmetic outfits as a reward from an event, dont scrap it
---
Should have been WAY more specific with my comment. 
---
Selling low level gear in high level areas makes zero sense. Sure, you're still in the forest... I'm assuming close to the border of the ash heap. Sure... still lowbie zone, sell your low level stuff. However if someone is in high level areas like the bog or mire, and the only weapons he/she has for sale are 30 level 5 machetes and pipe pistols..., they're clearly luring people into trap camps, simply trolling, an idiot and not helping anyone in the way you would be being camped in the forest.
---
Sorry I wasn't more specific, but I still believe low level gear should be sold in low level areas.
---
No it must be happening to a lot of people
---
I tested it with SS. My SS has all random as fuck legendaries (normally a PA heavy)
---
These are a lot better. These very much feel like they are indeed legendary and change up your build in significant ways. If I could I would call up the dev team and say thank you for listening and tell em to keep doing what they are doing. Good work!
---
Any chance you can craft up a mixed matched set of say heavy leather/metal and see if that works? 
---
That would be conclusive 👍
---
I prefer to play the way it should be played, solo. There can only be ONE Overseer, not a team of them.
---
In game only a handful of players look at what's in your vendor each session. On the trading sub, an item is seen by hundreds of people in just a few minutes. This drives the price up because a) there's more competition to buy a good item, and b) when a seller prices too low there's an impromptu auction that occurs. 
---
The cheaper prices in game are because of serious faults in the trading system.
---
Dang that sucks
---
No problem...
---
Yeah it’s been 10 days for me since I last bought it, can’t right now.
---
Awesome!
---
The conversion rate I don't think are a issue myself. I mean if its to turn ammo you don't use into ammo you do then it doesn't matter really. Its solely the interface with it. Everything else wrong with it big or small just adds to it. I hate the colours for it example and with such a horrific interface, it just make it worse xD
---
Try the town by monongah it has like 7 in town
---
Its bugged. Sometimes it works, sometimes not on the map. If you own it it will ask for caps when fast travelling but wont charge any when on a bugged world.
---
LMG is classed as a heavy weapon, not a rifle.
---
You also don’t have to claim them in order.
---
Ammo Factory and Legendary Ability honestly look like the only decent ones for me. Nice to have more perks and those are only rank one? would love to see what the other ranks are like.
---
So I have seen a few posts that talk about if you don't buy it Saturday, Sunday or Monday then he locks out until next week.  I don't know if that is true but I have seen it said a few times on here.
---
All good until the server crashes and you can't log back into the 1st server.
---
Damn! Looks amazing!
---
Ok these are much better
---
That's because it's an MMO...does elder scrolls have credits? Or WOW? The main quest is nice but its not that kind of game
---
And if your girlfriend says her parents are away for the weekend, don’t say you’re too busy to come over.
---
He's so damn condescending and i'm just not in the mood to listen to that shit
---
And what then? You wanna release more scorchbeasts or just chill all day long in your ugly-a$$ bunker and drink some coffee???
---
They only say that legendary perk SLOTS are account-wide. Someone on PTS would have to confirm, but I'm betting your newbie would still have to pay the coins for the card.
---
Am... Am I reading Master Infiltrator correctly? If it really works as it says then that is a must have! It's annoying as hell switching cards around just to pick locks or hack stuff
---
^this. Exactly this. And paying for 1st doesnt count. You're paying for perks not content
---
And scrapper.
---
I would assume the explosion would cause some form of AOE damage to surrounding enemies. So if you are in a mob area, the explosion would give residual damage around you.
---
How many can we have equipped at once?
---
silenced SMG's would help a lot.  or even better allow the Fixer to be mod'd to 10mm ...
---
SMG with a silencer.
---
Very common issue. Nothing you can do but keep posting about it until it gets fixed. Dont use the tesla rifle or whatever is causing it as it is mostly caused by guns that can hit multiple enemies
---
I just broke down and purchased the pack and can confirm that you can not display the flyboy helmet or the military berets.
---
I will take your word for it - although I did call out that pretty specifically my overall point is that i like the simple power that the old perks offered. I remember being very excited about more damage from a sneak archer build that I run. I already blow things up with bloody mess and exploding arrows so these just aren't for me. One of the only perks I could see myself using is the one that seems like just a second version of tenderizer... idk if you're happy about them be happy about them i guess i just dont understand it
---
They already sell ballistic fiber at the vendor. This just seems like extra steps
---
I like the idea of a old plane converted into a camp. Add the Jet engine turned wind turbine from F04 and you have a cool wasteland build.
---
They are very very stuck when it comes to balancing the game. Any content to challenge the bloody meta will be so bullet spongy that it can be beaten without that busted build and any content balanced for the masses will be a breeze for bloodied. 
---
They can’t nerf bloodied or they will lose a majority of their hardcore players (who are the most likely to have 1st). Anytime anyone talks about a much needed bloodied nerf the post is obliterated by downvotes.
---
Basically they can’t make challenging content (like raids or dungeons etc) without balancing and if they balance people who spent hundreds of hours grinding unyielding suits and busted bloodied weapons will howl like their blankets been taken away. Never gonna happen. Asides - Bethesda has never made a balanced game in their history. No chance the D team that maintains 76 will be up to the challenge.
---
6 if youre level 300. Click the link in the OP and it explains
---
beautiful
---
The forager just says to call him pops, I believe. I haven't found the wander yet
---
I am simultaneously happy and annoyed at this. They are taking what was a shitty design decision from the outset and blatantly making you burn extra effort (and a legendary slot) to fix it. Making your system not suck is not content, and certainly not something players should have to work for.
---
Armor piercing perk destroys PA
---
Thank you for your work on the list. Did you ever do testing on the atom shop pre-fab structures?
---
Bloodied gauss minigun with stabilized, adrenal reaction, and energy gun bobble (if you need an edge, which you won't). Problem solved. I came across 5 ppl fighting it, they had gotten maybe 5% of it's health down. I accidentally killed it before it could even regen. Lots of frowny face emotes.
---
There may be faults, I just like using the in game economy. Paying 4 characters worth of caps for a weapon is a bit absurd to me.
---
Yeah but Maggie was Meg's previous leader and they hated each other.  Meg can preach all she wants about "necessity" and taking in anyone, meanwhile they still decorate their camp with bodies of traders, explorers and settlers.  Even if she herself says she ain't about that, she lets people like that exist around her, she's culpable.
---
yes they said buy atoms
---
Yeah it is such a huge improvement!
---
And like, on their own the original perks aren't bad. But they're not fun, they don't change up your build or gameplay. They're the kinda perk you put in your last slot cuz you only really wanted a couple others and you gotta fill your slot with something. Might as well be the AOE damage one that is useful. They're slot fillers.
---
Contractor perk cards only makes building cost in WORKSHOPS less. It has nothing to do with budget or building costs in your CAMP.
---
EDIT: After testing Contractor does reduce the cost of camp items now.
---
I personally if it's useless and depends on space in my stash it's 100 caps per star, but of course unyielding and bloodied will be higher. But what does it mean sale 25%? is it 25% off or 25% of the original price?.
---
Yesssss.
---
Feed The Last Word.  
---
Maybe now 90% of my game time won't be farming lead and steel.
---
They did have them in game?  I vaguely recalled them like a fever dream.
---
Contractor perk has no impact on build limit, just mat cost to build items.
---
So do they just absolutely hate power armor or something?
---
20% fewer AP on sprinting?  A slim chance on a revive?
---
If antivenom would work in a matching set of PA I'd honestly be happy enough.
---
Master Infiltrator, Ammo Factory and Follow Through and I'll feel exactly like the sneaky scavenger my Treasure Hunter outfit &amp; Hunting Rifle make me look like :)
---
They were killed by plasma weapons most likely. It’s been an ongoing bug in one form or another.
---
Until someone decides to change it.
---
they arent really there ya know..
---
When I build a wooden foundation in my camp without contractor, it costs 6 wood.
---
With contractor on, it costs 3.
---
Works on my end  at least.
---
the big clue is.. naked.. and with no head...
---
I need this on a T-shirt.
---
 I agree the flair gun needs a purpose. Like maybe if u shoot up a friendly vertibot arrives to provide suppressing fire.
---
Well, I can't even get into the elevator to go up to the floor where Penelopes terminal is. That's the problem. 
---
I've been up there before, found the clues, printed the safe room access ID, went down, talked to Penelope, was given the quest to get the experimental Pip Boy stuff, got it, and now the ground floor door of the elevator just inside the tower entrance says I don't have the correct ID card and won't open. So I can't go down to the safe room OR up to where Penelopes terminal is.
---
Less mat cost equals more build space. Test it out for yourself if you'd like.
---
There seems to always be one at the Monongah mine location, in the trailer home (not the little capsule ones, the one broken in half) on the Morgantown map, but there seems to be some pretty fierce competition for it. I've only managed 2/3 so far without someone else getting to it in around 6 tries.
---
We don't want a shitty br mode. we want the open world pvp that was advertised.
---
Public groups can help this, I dont generally group either, but since public groups are drop in, drop out, with no strings attached you might as well get the bonuses.
---
If you start a public team you still get 25% of the max bonus, even if nobody joins. For instance events groups give 25% bonus experience after an event completion, building gives +1 to intelligence. Also some buffs are affected by being on a public team even though you are solo such as the herd mentality mutation. Tested this last night and it works.
---
What I really think they should do is just change it over to the vendor interface.  They could make Ammo points a new currency, so you could sell all your unwanted ammo at once, then buy the ammo you want.  The advantages being it'd be quick for players to do, and they wouldn't need any new interface.
---
Can confirm, pops.
---
that's bad ass props on the detail.
---
The most effective way of using heavy guns is using PA, maxing out the Stabilized, Demo Expert, and Fireproof perks.
---
With AAE and Stabilized, in power armor you reduce a hypothetical DR of 100 down to about 23, the anti-armor effect stacks but its not additive. The perk build for heavy guns AAE and PA is actually less intensive than bloodied and far more versatile.
---
The final thing about AAE is that it is far more efficient with ammo. You do more damage with 4 bullets than you do with 5. That's a big difference, especially with UC ammo, which you should absolutely use when able.
---
Thanks guys
---
Yes, but cycling lights also need to be connected to power and/or a terminal to work.  I didn't wires all over my workshop.
---
The legendary abilities look the best.
---
E.g. my main character has charisma 4. If I take the legendary charisma card and level it up once, I'll have  +2 to charisma stat (better prices/dialogue). Now this isnt huge, eapecially if you use unyielding.
---
It also however gives me +2 charisma "slots" so I can run 2 x 3 charisma cards, share a 2* card instead of a 1* etc
---
I honestly thought that was how it was going to be and would love it if they did that.
---
It is talking about camp items, not crafting items.
---
Yeah it’s annoying also heads up it can happen with super mutants as well.
---
Every child at a very young age learns its not about you. nothing is about you.
---
Don't stick forks in lightsockets
---
I might fool with it in future, but I get interrupted constantly during the time I'm playing(dishes, dog etc), so I spend 10 min every so often as an AFK bush wookie.  I hate doing that to a team.
---
That's odd. I'll test it in a few minutes. This is new if it's the case. It even says workshops in the description. Still wouldn't effect budget though.
---
the wanderer doesn't give a name, so i just call her sally.
---
Where do you get that building plan? I've seen similar buildings like it all over but can't ever find the plan for it. Is it an atom shop thing?
---
Im starting to think it was the new duplication glitched earlier.  People probably duplicated explosive laser guns and what not so a whole team can have it to almost instant kill the queen.
---
honestly, thats a pretty fitting name
---
Hey I just noticed your title asked for Nuclear Winter.  I missed that so the answer I gave may be wrong.  I never play NW.
---
All the perks listed are rank 1. Not sure their.max level values. Let bwth know your thoughts if you want it to work on PA.
---
Does anyone know how many of these legendary perks are we allowed to equip?
---
I've never run an actual test on it, from personal experience it's always seemed like I've had more budget space when utilizing contractor.
---
You've got six slots, so here are the perks you should run with:
---
* Follow Through  
---
* Ammo Factory  
---
* Cleave  
---
* Legendary Ability: [Your Choice of Stat]  
---
* Master Infiltrator  
---
* IF POWER ARMOR BUILD: Power Armor Reboot  
---
* ELSE IF NOT BLOODIED: What rads?  
---
* ELSE: Antivenom  
---
Other perks seem dubious.
---
I've had my share of photos with frozen/unkillable radscorpions, floaters, hounds, ghouls, etc. The game engine just keeps on giving with its hillarious bugs.
---
The Enclave being held responsible for the Scorchbeasts is a conspiracy theory made up by the Brotherhood of Steel. We only aim to reinstitute real America. Embrace it, we are your only Overseers. Comply or be exterminated, "Fire Breather".

---
&gt; Antivenom- +50 poison resist when wearing matching armour
---
:OOOOO
---
&gt; Anti-venom and fur lining do not appear to apply to PA
---
:((((((((((
---
I really hope that's a bug. Poison can be hard to deal with in PA.
---
Sheep squash staff
---
I have not had this problem, but I have seen a lot of posts from people with this problem.  The prevailing theory seems to be that it mostly happens when people have their account logged on during reset.  That is noon Eastern Time.  Did your account happened to be logged in at that time?  The main recommendation I keep reading is to be sure you log completely out of FO76 at least a few minutes before reset, then don't log back in until at least a few minutes after reset.
---
Again, I have not had that problem, but I am not on at that time, because of my work schedule.  I can't guarantee that works, but a lot of people keep posting that problem and people keep posting that solution.
---
It's been known to happen to some players.  I'm not sure what causes this.
---
yeah.  i dunno why, but she actually reminds me a bit of sally fields.
---
Now these definitely seem much more legendary than the original list they gave us. That ammo one is gonna be a mighty need.
---
Hmm, from what I've heard they can flip from 'regular' and 'scorched' values seemingly randomly when they load in. Not sure if there's any rhyme or reason to that one yet lol.
---
Thank you! I'm dumb and didn't even think to click the link and just read out the perk descriptions instead. I really appreciate it!
---
[https://imgur.com/a/fcc0WIj](https://imgur.com/a/fcc0WIj) Can you figure out how I did this?
---
I put that perk on to see what happens.  Its listed as 1 lightweight mininuke an hour.
---
It doesn't proc straight away, and I'll be honest Im not sitting waiting in the PTS for an hour to see what happens
---
I'm not sure how you could get that wrong, other than leaving out the fact that level 0 ones open instantly.
---
When did you buy from him last?
---
Not workshop related but I believe there’s a house with a barn near Bolton greens that has lots of cat bowls that’s good for plastic the school in watoga or any school for that matter, or try westek/crevasse dam or anywhere with super mutants if you can take them, with scrapper perk the laser guns they can drop give more plastic then you’ll know what to do with, as for acid I just hop toxic Larry’s 3 snallygasters always spawn there 5-8 acid each
---
I had FO1st for 2 months. I unsubscribed, and not having it prevents me from opening the game anymore. Part of me wants to play, but I know how unbearable it will be without it a scrapbox and a tent. That just sucks.
---
Mat cost has nothing to do with build space. 
---
Each build-able/craft-able item itself has a static value of build cost, a reduction of mats to craft said item does not reduce that static value of build cost.
---
Adrenaline is broken and not working at all. Are you possibly seeing the effects of that?
---
You used to but I think its broken
---
Me too but I got a Fixer so I can’t complain.
---
could be a Biv quest at Halloween
---
july 9 - 13
---
Which one is going to replace Scrapper?
---
Holy shit. There's actually not that many new perks, but the ones they've added go a *long* way to make our options look far more solid.
---
Hope they take in the feedback and make some similar considerations when developing Season 2 of the Challenges! (I know... but one can hope.)
---
So like running to Best Buy to find out what to order on Amazon? Why not.
---
I'm just there for lockpicking 🥳
---
I used this one.... took 5 tries with multiple players spawning and immediately running to it
---
do you have a link for the trading sub? im an idiot and cant find any..=\[
---
Why with the direction the game is heading nothing surprises me anymore. BTW does anyone have any money I can borrow I ran out of atoms and need to fast travel.(Says 6 months from now.)
---
I had assumed it was a negligent discharge, since they seemed so new. If it wasn't, then get fucked little baby nerds, wish I had taken your lead scraps too!
---
My bad, I meant so people can equip scrapper. Usually it's a swap out until you scrap your hoarding collection, valuable slot for other things.
---
Immersive additions are nice, but if a majority of players aren’t going to use it, no sense in adding them in.
---
I’d rather they use than manpower for new content like quests or legendary effects
---
Thx!
---
I get more xp when I play morgantown so hard pass
---
Thanks, will try. I find lots of things that say "inaccessible" but none locked I can pick so far.
---
I'm far from that level of gameplay... I can't even make it past "Cheating Death" because the radscorpians are always spawning in glitched or are much higher level and I can never make it past to Lou, even running running running... And it ain't because higher level players are around I play on a private server. Oh well. maybe some day they will be fixxed and I can complete the quest.  
---
Edit: Also, the fogcrawler never drops loot when I kill it and the follower with the bomb necklace is useless
---
Go to vault Tec agriculture center...pick the fertilizer boxes
---
Yeah but at least its mostly stuff that's tradable instead of grinding for bullion you just have to scrap for pennies on the dollar.
---
We already have the vertibot smoke grenades not that they really work or that vertibots are any use at all either
---
The plasma and laser are not working as intended, they don't split the damage from the beam splitter instead magnify it and they might do 100% explosive damage instead of 20%. Yes, it is possible to take on the punishment of legacy guns but it is unfair that it has been removed from the loot pool, on top of that bethesda were supposed to alter them over a year ago but they didn't.
---
Even tesla guns are broken, they ignore all damage reduction perks and only energy resistance seems to counter them. Not aiming right with it rewards with more damage than aiming right
---
Yep, it’s the Seedy Shed. It dropped in late April/early May, I believe.
---
Maybe even no daily limits. What you wanna grind your grind! 
---
Being on a 20 limit when you can get 40-80 a day is kinda BS. It gives the “Sign in, Get gold sign out” feel.
---
I'm all about that Ammo Factory and Collateral Damage!
---
This is the first time I'm seeing this. How are legendary perks cards going to work?
---
I do this.  For the weekly challenges that involved going up three levels, I simply created a new  character, to gain the levels really quickly, to knock out my weeklies the first day, so I don't have to worry about them.  After my new character gained three levels, I then switched over to my main character, to claim the reward.
---
Ah completely forgot they even existed
---
Because you might not have to log in for one day.
---
Screw the Brotherhood and screw your ugly President who LITERALLY SAID TO RELEASE THE BEASTS. 
---
Y'all are scum. FOR AMERICA
---
If you are on pc, once the meter is filled, hold space down and left mouse to attack 👍
---
Put your phone away when you cross a road.
---
For acid, you can go to a cricket horde and farm acid from them or you can go to campfire tales and farm acid from the bloodbugs
---
The previous Tuesday
---
We started no such rumors.
---
Click the link at the bottom of the Op
---
I personally am off to bed now - got an early start tomorrow. If no one has tested this by tomorrow though, sure will check it out.
---
Is it 25% off purchase but we still get the same amount when we turn stuff into the legendary vendor thing?
---
I stand corrected, it does lower costs of camp items. I have a feeling this is a bug. I remember getting excited for learning contractor for the first time only to quickly realize it didn't work in your CAMP. I wonder if Wrecking Ball applies to CAMPs now too.
---
pretty sure the statement is still correct... what you are describing is the exact scenario required for ffr to be the worse of the two options.
---
also worth pointing out that it costs 5 perk points to achieve that, and we are also totally ignoring the whole 'higher damage numbers makes armor less effective' angle. 
---
theres nothing wrong with either approach, i struggle to even see a noticeable difference, other than every gun i have is explosive so it makes sense to go that route.
---
Thanks man! Im on PS4 of cant do it unfortunately.
---
This system heavily punishes those who have ever opened perk packs and/or used level ups to change special after level 50. Also having to scrap perk cards is absurd when they are going to introduce perk loadouts later in the year.
---
You know int doesn't determine xp right?
---
Yup. Naked, un-killable, non responsive super mutants. Long time glitch.
---
Grahm sometimes has them, too. That's where I bought mine
---
Yea, that has crossed my mind, more than once :)
---
HAve more rep with foundation than raiders, so I decide to go that route.  It’s on my list for tonight if I get enough time out from IRL to play.
---
Thx for the nudge :)
---
He's still standing, so you need a kid puppet.
---
Yeah!
---
Than tell them. Reapond on the PTS. Only way jt changes is through feedback. They proven they can somewhat listen with this new list.
---
By the way, there seems to be a whole different set of bugs for Fallout1st players lol
---
Interesting you think there is any chance of getting in trouble for using them ?
---
Yeah I took a min/max build, so these perks can pull up my dump stats
---
I have also been using a new character to knock out the weekly three level challenge really quickly.  Once I have done that, I switch over to my main character, before claiming any rewards.
---
Nice. This is good.
---
For a lot of us, we’re at the point where there’s not much else to use them on. I buy ammo from players and my 300 gold a week from Smiley. Sometimes plans if they’re uncommon and I want to give them to my friends.
---
I bought a Bobby Pin from my wife’s mule the other day for 20k just so I’d have some space for earning caps. 
---
We need something to sink caps into. Even if it was just some character nameplate icons/emblems. 20k to unlock a medallion that shows how many SBQs you’ve killed, for example. Another one for 25k that shows how many Wendigo Collosi you’ve killed, or workshops you e claimed, or something. 
---
I have a feeling some players would drop caps on pure vanity displays.
---
This hits really different today as I have lost 5 daily score challenges to a bug they've known about for a year but probably won't change because they want to see how many people buy the ranks they miss with atoms...
---
Legendary Ability has now given me a real reason to grind XP hardcore. Lets go baby, we’re back!!!!
---
Always this, I run a tesla rifle to tag but it does next to no damage even though its bloodied. Once I'm happy everyone has a hit on the boss, then I go in swinging with my DCG
---
I still can’t figure it out, I launch the Beth launcher and i can’t seem the find the pts
---
No one wants Flatwoods.  Majority rules.
---
That's fair. They don't really work anyway
---
For some reason, Bethesda thought we wanted access points to the atom shop. They put them at the train station and they were both an eyesore and unnecessary since getting to the atom shop is not that difficult
---
I added the lock picking perk card which gives you the ability to pick any locks and got three done right away.   There is one at the top of the tower in the train station near Morgan Town which is a relatively safe place to turn your back and pick the lock.
---
funny, Ive had weirdness with them today at Whitespings(PS4).
---
Frozen, killable, get the XP, but targeting hud still shows them as Red/alive,  And the loot Is nowhere near the body.
---
Oh, I havent seen that glitch before.  I'd try to pick it up again via HW in charleston. Maybe server hop and try it a couple times.
---
Remeber special cap is still 15.  So say you have 15 luck, its not going to let you buml it up anymore. Still very helpful though.
---
Nah...it’s been around for a while, you didn’t cause it, and it’s certainly not game-breaking.
---
Its an atomic shop item. Its great for locking things up like the armco ammo machine or as a vendor shop/storage space.
---
maybe things like stimpaks and disease cures?
---
THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU! To all who replied and gave support and suggestions. I just completed my NW daily. Thanks for helping me with the almost impossible.
---
You are incorrect because you provided a blanket statement without providing examples or context that the OP could use to make a decision. It doesn't matter that you need a perk card, what matters is that the information is delivered accurately and concisely.
---
Appreciate it regardless. Haven’t had time to check the link yet
---
I suck at NW even when I just crouch in the bushes so it would take me ages to get that much XP! Good job man. Worth it.
---
Considering some of the NPCs say “ I know a guy that can fix that”
---
Your wish may be planned for a future update....
---
There is one at the top of the tower next to the train yards in Morgantown.   Spawned there and run up to do it right away, there are also weapons there so you can kill two birds with one stone.
---
Good job, I'm impressed.
---
Commenting cause I want to check out some of these locations when I get home. Lol.  I'm looking for flat greenery with water myself.
---
INCREDIBLE
---
You get the staff plan from free range not encypted
---
PC and 350.
---
some actually legendary perks now. cool.
---
Legendary ability is going to create a TON on new builds.
---
angry turtle is going to have field day with this shit lmao.
---
Why are they the wrong things? I don’t understand.
---
As an example, I’m saying that I like the run. I like the challenges. But out of game stuff means I don’t have time to do them in the week.
---
Would making the current “daily” challenges available all week, or for the duration of the season, negatively affect you, the person running them as dailies now? Or does it just positively affect me, the person who wants to be more engaged with the game, but is time-gated out?
---
They’re still the same challenges you did. They’ll still take me the same time in game to complete. I’m cool with that, I like the game! But having the opportunity to complete them would be nice (and better for Bethesda, as I’ll play longer, and be more engaged)
---
Yesss
---
That sounds really annoying.
---
That's so fucking ridiculous I wouldn't even be surprised if it turned out to be true.
---
 When you rank up you should go to your wee side menu when you're on map, should be a tab that says legendary run. Click on it and claim any rewards you have
---
Nah, I’d rather keep it as it is now. Perhaps instead let the atom shop have a mannequin that has the clothes on that you can spin around to look at. Have 3D models that you can look at in the atom shop, not a physical one.
---
At low health, the bloody Gauss shotgun needs no other damage boosting cards.  Geez, is it ever powerful.
---
Possibly, but based on the brawling chemist one (fury with a strength bonus and damage resist), I’m going to assume it’s probably enhanced med-x with poison, normal, fire and energy damage resist. Or maybe a flat percent down.
---
Of course, I know nothing since I don’t want to download the pts, but that’s my theory.
---
If the 10 mm SMG had a silencer it would be solid, as is it is fun as heck.
---
You can place your camp basically on any nuclear silo site. Alpha, bravo and Charlie
---
think of it as a selfie opportunity
---
Strangely it seems to have fixed itself. Thank you for reaching out 👍
---
Got the dollar store Xbox?
---
Wait. Normally you hit level 2 before you leave the vault. That doesn't count?
---
No I like to try on in person rather than send the stuff back to Amazon because the sizes weren't right
---
Glowing skeleton is the best headgear out here!
---
Ok, so assuming these each have 4 levels like they did in the previous version, you can use your 6 legendary slots to add 24 perk slots in total!? Sure, it'll probably take until level 1500 to afford to upgrade, but that's crazy.
---
If each "Legendary Ability" can add +1 to a SPECIAL +1 perk per level per slot... Your character could be 11s across the board, with 3 point left over. That could be Fallout 4 levels of God mode.
---
bethesda really seem to hate pa,  basically every update they make normal armour better, more or less rendering pa pointless, especially with things like uny or bolstering effects and now they've added  legendary perk cards to make normal armour even better
---
Enjoy your control while it lasts.
---
Ah my bad had no idea where it came from thanks for the info
---
If you have a terminal hooked up to it you can change it back without cycling through all the colors
---
youre not locked into one side or the other until you start one of the "Siding With.." missions.. there is also a warning
---
you should do both sides up to that point and then decide..
---
you can still max rep with both sides no matter how you play it.. its just more grinding to do it
---
It's recommended to do it that way :) you can do both factions right up to that point and it makes no difference, you can choose either one
---
Similarly, after the quests you'll be able to do daily quests for either side as well
---
: o
---
I can think of a lot of mother choices for Intelligence perks while adventuring, personally. 
---
Once perk load outs come, that’s a different story, lol.
---
Too late!!
---
It really does. Maybe a future NPC can set up shop there and turn one of the stores into a functional shopping stop.
---
Automatic 10mm pistol in VATs will rack up your crit meter, then swap for shotgun and get er done.
---
If the deliverer came to fallout 76 I'd be changing my build to pistol without a doubt. Favourite gun in fo4
---
So can you run 6 different Legendary Abilities at once?
---
Turned 21 yesterday, and putting in extremely low effort. So far, hitting all the Adventure Mode challenges, some by pure accident. Doing the usual dailies and events as I feel like. Usually up for SBQ fights, so not much of a game changer there. Not really grinding, just curious to see how far I make it on the game board.
---
I've heard the spawn rate is very low, even as low as 2%.
---
Yep and that exactly it. They want more money and this just shows how much they want FO76 to be a battle royale genre game and how little they intended to make it an RPG.
---
Monongah Mine seems to always spawn a locked safe in the trailer near the entrance. There's some pretty hot competition for it though, it took me around 8 or 9 tries to get mine without someone else getting to it first.
---
Outside of that, dunno.
---
Nice!
---
I hit the three safe route right behind the Monongah power plant. Start in the plant yard and grab a weapon or two then sprint to the red shack to the east and pick the safe inside (bobble head is usually on the barrel). Then sprint to Monongah. In the gas station at the far east is a wall safe. Then sprint west through the town to the trailer with the makeshift lookout on top (south of the church, north of the basement experiment house) and pick the safe in there with a magazine on the bed.
---
Might have to fight a few people, but most grab and get out of there quick due to the circle usually forcing them west.
---
&gt; but my damage output with two shot rifles pales
---
use instigating or furious
---
That notion was to release us from the confines of law. The President now acts on our behalf.
---
YESSS I LOVED
---
Actually its fewer steps
---
That's the only thing some of my friends like to play.
---
^this!  Use the shotgun for the VATS critical as you can get mutiple crits off the one attack. Makes completing the challenge much quciker.
---
Thats what Ive heard too. Hopefully this new event will remediate that.
---
So yes or no ?
---
thanks man
---
Not sure I would enjoy having to repeatedly stop to drop a bag of missile launchers.
---
I have a bloodied 10mm smg on my melee character as her ranged weapon and I love it, only thing missing is a silencer.
---
good stuff
---
I wouldn’t expect it to be fixed till maybe 21 or probably 22. So, maybe this year? Bethesda isn’t known for being responsive or effective in their bug fixes. Only if it’s game breaking or duping, but they aren’t gonna hot fix their adrenaline fuckup.
---
It does not go up level-by-level in Fallout 76, though. There are level groups where you just need same amount of EXP within that group to level up. I believe 1-49, 50-99, 100-999, and 1000+ are the 'groups'.
---
I mean if you were expecting bugs from Bugthesda this would make sense.

Anything obtained with S.C.O.R.E, gold bullion, or atoms cannot be shared.

How does one build this stuff at the camp budget is full. If I scrap stuff I'm only getting 50% of what I put in and once I rebuilt 10 things I'll have no budget anyway I guess.
---
Au contraire my friend, most people in public servers are pretty nice
---
Master Infiltrator will be the first card to take.
---
The roads have some stationary tanks and trucks that I have seen people make some cool camps around.
---
Don’t worry, you’ll have plenty of opportunities to get nocturnal pool cues from the Colossus after its event is added!
---
How???
---
People just constantly amaze me. How one can even organize and plan something like this. Kudos !
---
Take a break for a bit, if you are getting burnt out I'd wait until the winter update to come out so there's plenty of new quests, dungeons and activities. Sure you'll miss out on a couple power armor skins and like one camp item but it isn't all that big of a deal.
---
Why wouldn’t they use it?
---
Internet is fine..good speed and hardwired. Everytime I would get into a full group getting some events going.....disconnect. Wanna fight SBQ...nope...broad gets stuck in the grove...server does the stutter....then disconnects. Had her almost down too. Go to another....I am disconnected before I can get my rewards. Total disconnects for today?......12.
---
It wasn't fixed, they didn't work on the PTS so people expected a fix when the patch went live, but surprise surprise!
---
Not that I've seen. I looked real close and I don't see padding where there should be padding to protect my pinchable bits....
---
Edit: not saying you are wrong and I'm right, just I think about real life and I expirence some hesitation about jumping into that gorilla suit
---
Thanks for the tip. I’ll try to find one. A fixer ideally. Now that I’ve finally got my full secret service armor in decent shape I can spend script on weapons again instead.
---
The only decent furious rifle I had was a lever action I ran for a bit, but the two shot hunting vats crit plus a different two shot vats acc combat rifle felt like a better normal combo.
---
I’m actually solid during scorched earth because  I run a primed explosive zealots combat rifle with vats accuracy that absolutely shreds.Or, at least, I normally do. I haven’t had the willpower to farm the flux for ultracite ammo recently. I need to do that though so I’m not a detriment to others doing scorched earth.
---
My take on it was that the stat cards are the most useful - If I take a rank 2 charisma legendary, not only do I get better prices at vendors/better dialogue, but this will take me up to CHR 6, so I can share a 2*, and I can slot 2 x 3* which allows for much more varied builds.
---
Same with END for me - not only do I get more HP, but I dont have to decide between fireproof and limb damage; I can take both.
---
There's some QoL ones like the lockpicking and the rest are either poor/situational/build specific
---
there's a very dedicated and small playlist
---
Correct
---
I'm not sure but I saw a few hours ago today how SBQ was killed like in one minute so I guess it still works?
---
why does the thumb turn red when I upvote? Red usually means Bad or Caution. I thought upvoting would color green or blue or something.
---
Right
---
I mean, it makes sense to be fair. You start underpowered, having to use those slots and make those decisions, but then you're overpowered once high enough and no longer need to waste the space.
---
It's a natural progression, even if it did suck having to deal with no way around it for over a year. I get your point, but this is way better than having a perk loadout that you still would have to swap which is what people wanted before this.
---
Imma have to agree with the enclave scum here. What do you rockheads even want in Appalachia? WE(the vault dwellers) already made the nation safer. YOU taking our resources throws the balance that WE created out of the window.
---
Thank you! I'm glad someone understands! Especially the ashamed part! Also you should be ashamed too. I mean, just look at you.
---
I will try this! Thank you! Been in 10 games or so now and not even found 1.

Do you really care about the Asimo skin for Power Armor?

It is not an obligation to reach 100

GL!

You can find 4 inside the bank in Morgantown however it’s a random chance to be able to unlock one. There’s also a locked box inside that building up the stairs after you go into the hole in the wall. If you go all the way out the door past the laundry room and up the outside stairs to the roof there is another locked box. The robot shop down the street has a locked tool box just inside the door. Then further down the street on top of the monorail there is another locked tool box. There is also a locked tool box just inside the door at Mama Dolce’s back entrance by the pipe
---
If you’re at a public restroom and see a hole in the stall, don’t stick your dick in it expecting a hot girl to be on the other side.
---
Also, if it is destroyed its contents despawn and are protected from further harm, making it ideal for fusion generators.
---
I just picked one lock and the challenge complete. Wow. Convenient. I got the score and everything
---
Could be tomorrow already where OP lives and he's getting an early welcome in
---
Well imagine being lvl800 and then you finally get this perk card
---
"Life After People" did a great job at showing just how quickly things would vanish without anyone intervening - weather, bugs, fungus, etc. all do a pretty good job at breaking our shit down. 
---
The only thing we can argue is that radiation clearly doesn't work the same way in Fallout as it does in our world, so it perhaps killed off the organisms that would be responsible for decay. 
---
Or else it's those Old Gods we keep finding evidence of playing with the remnants of humanity, keeping power on and replacing supplies to prolong their amusement.
---
yeah that seems like a more a more likely idea, we will have to wait to know
---
Or 2mm

Or the high schools in Morgantown or watoga

accuracy is ass on 2shot..

I use instigating for longer range sniping and furious for closer in work.. typically on hunting/sniper rifles, levers or handmades.. fixers are good too if youre sneaky

If you get flatwoods spawn in Helvetia by the long house at the edge. Safe by the front desk there. Then move into town to the blue building near the church. The shack next to that building has a potential safe and two more inside the blue building. One in the store room and one behind the cash register
---
There’s a locked box inside the Sunny Meadows food factory in the office - there’s also a locked box inside one of the trailers in flatwoods
---
You're not really making hard decisions with lockpicking and hacking, at least not unless you want a Perception or Intelligence of less than 3. I mean, you have to get the cards, but that's true either way. Beyond that, the only "choice” is 'do I care enough about this terminal/door/container to bother swapping cards?' It's a choice of annoyance, not specialization.
---
'Can I be arsed to fight the shitty UI' is not an effective or fun limiter on character power.
---
It’s much easier to find them.  They used to be weightless, not anymore.   After three or four silo runs you’ll get used to the possible spawn points and just walk straight to them.  It’s not that big a deal.
---
Of course, if you have the steel and circuits, it’s even faster to repair the broken cores you pulled out.
---
A better way to look at this whole SCORE challenge thing is look at the items in it as atom shop items. The daily challenges, honestly are exactly the same as they were except they award SCORE instead of atoms. So if you used to do some of the atom challenges before, go for it. If you don't want to, don't bother. Then at the end of the season, look at the items that are left and how many atoms it will take to get to them and decide if you would pay that many atoms for those items.
---
For me, I would like to get to the gatling gun skin and the handprint gas mask. But I'm not prepared to pay more than 500 atoms for them. If I make it that far, great. If not, whatever, there will be other cool skins later in the game. As for the dailies, I've been doing them, because I've been playing and they're not really hard. But I'll be damned if I'm going to sit there and grind West Tek for hours on end so I can get the repeatable challenge. Also, the instant I get bored of these challenges, I'm stopping and taking a break just like I did with Ward's crappy daily fetch quest. I was in danger of hating the game after doing those settler and raider dailies for a month, so I just said fuck it and took a couple weeks off. I got my gauss shotgun two weeks later than I would have and it made no difference.
---
Great tip thanks
---
Just shift to the top corner or something, its nice to know what we have unlocked but yeah, its in the way
---
Wow, that's insane! What platform are you on? I'd looove to see that in person for myself! Bet it looks amazing. I'm in awe.
---
Thank you so much💛 I’m about to try this right now
---
Ill have you know I go in there every other day looking for broken radio vacuum tubes
---
Does matching armor mean same weight/tier (light, sturdy, heavy), same type (leather, metal, ect), or both?
---
Honestly, it's one of the main reasons why I got Fallout 1st. To use private servers &amp; stay away from players.
---
I've been playing since Beta. I've had 2 characters both over 200 from before and after wastelanders.
---
Again. I'm just glad the card exists and isn't something that could only be solved by perk loadouts, which we still have no idea when they're coming.
---
Ah, there goes the Serverstability...
---
Thank you, sorry for wasting your time
---
I wonder if ammo factory will stack with the other ammo perks
---
Take a cheap workshop...build 10 things...tada. 🙂 If ya want to avoid pvp...jump servers.
---
Been seeing a lot of new faces in Xbox. I am hoping some stick around. I started playing it to get the cosmetics a while back but I actually found I enjoy it
---
My opinion, if cash isn’t a problem and since you’ve already admitted that you don’t mind supporting the game with purchases, just put it in your head that you’ll buy your last X levels to get to the end. 
---
Me personally, I’m trying to work my way to somewhere in the 80s and then I will burn atoms the rest of the way. We’re only in week 2 out of 12. Lotta tine left on the clock.
---
Up to 7 more perk slots? Seems like an absolute must have
---
Yes. For some reason, whatever Bethesda did Patch 20 made the seasonal (non-VTU) rewards available again.
---
That grind for the rep takes forever. I gave up my gold for more rep and it still took forever
---
That's true. Though Nuclear Bunkers become ass easy with both of these cards which is the only time I use them. Other areas can have you completely bypass parts or help immensely with turrets and the like. 
---
Sure. That doesn't matter to a bloodied build that wipes everything out and has completed everything, but for a casual player the choices will matter.
---
[fed76.info](https://fed76.info) has a nifty pricing tool.  I'm sure there are others.
---
It already exists. The plan for it is on the second terminal outside fort defiance that people seemingly ignore or don’t notice a lot of the time when they go there.
---
You can also server hop at Tanagra town and kill the crickets for acid as well
---
What does it do?
---
Legendary Ability will give bloody builds much more survivability if you spec into endurance. Hell yeah THE META
---
A bit better, but still on the side of boring for the most part. I don't know what I was expecting, but oh well, seems it may be just me this time.
---
Would make sense if they didn't abandon the battle Royale mode
---
Don’t feel pressured, dude. Just look at what the rewards for this season are. Do you *actually* want all of them? The only one that I want really badly is the raider tree at level 50. And I’m at 25 right now. That’s 25% complete when the season is only 10% through. After that, yeah, sure, the firefly lights would be *neat*, but I don’t have to have them. Same thing with the fireplace. If none of the rewards do anything for you, then just don’t worry about them at all. For all completely free additions to the game, don’t let them make you not want to play ever again just because they’re an **optional** grind.
---
I couldn't play this game ever again without Marsupial.
---
Nah, it's a special variant of the hunting rifle. You can find the plans at one of the terminals just before Fort Defiance's entrance
---
There is a weapon in the game called the Brotherhood Recon Rifle. It's essentially just a pre modded hunting rifle. You just put the mods on the brotherhood one one your hunting rifle.
---
You will get an erection
---
I didn’t mod it yet
---
AMAZING!
---
Haha okay champ
---
That's the problem, no one is using mics. If they were I would just ask them to share a card.
---
The casual player has no more limitations than a hardcore one. Literally the only choice in terms of character development is "do I have this card?" Beyond that, the only choice is one of effort. "Do I care enough to take out the useful most of the time card I currently have slotted and put in this other perk for the time it takes to open this, and then put the original one back?"
---
There are multiple perk cards that are only useful contextually (in a craft screen, in a trade screen, when opening a door, when picking a plant, etc.). They do literally nothing at every other point in the game. Forcing players to waste time and effort manually swapping around cards they already have just to take advantage of them for a few moments is one of the sloppiest UX designs I can think of.
---
I guess I never checked the accuracy when I switched to two shot. That makes sense that there’s a spread even on the original shot though. Maybe I’ll play around with my old anti armor vats crit again and see how. 
---
And, hopefully  I’ll draw something better from Murmrgh soon now that I’m spending on weapons again.
---
Okay thanks
---
I can't really tell as the value is so... miniscule, but it seems Tenderizer might not be working either, or at very least I notice I hit the enemy, and then hit it again the number does not change.
---
That's so wrong it's not even funny...
---
Yea... Hasn't happened yet cross fingers
---
That's a good song by ice cube. Except he did not use his AK.
---
Eh, you're doing the lord's work. I've only been playing the game for 2 or so days and have embarrassingly few caps because I've buying plans left and right!
---
it will be a new slot for those? or the same that we already got?
---
If I'm selling for scrip its 10 caps per scrip. So Weapons are 50, 150 and 400 caps, armors 30, 90 and 240 caps. Those prices might sound low, but inventory doesn't move even at those rates.  No one's buying your crap \* legendary for 250 unless you misappraised it (i.e. sold a bloodied combat rifle for that).
---
EDIT: Also, many of the god roll items appraise on [fed76.info](https://fed76.info) for well over the 30,000 cap limit - your example of a bloodied ffr fixer clocks in around 47,500 or more.  At that point it's item for item trading as cap values become a bit meaningless.
---
It was for the first two not the last set of fucktards
---
It just needs to be the same (e.g. all SS) for it to work. Legendary abilities dont matter.
---
Also it needs to be a full set for it to work - I took off an arm and it stopped working.
---
Lol you on Xbox?
---
Come on Mr.Mod, really? The guy was just asking a question and you're removing the post? :(
---
Fair point
---
most of my plans are 1-25 caps. Then there's a couple i know are slightly less common and i sell those for more. Sometimes i put in lower level gear that a low level might need and when it sells it nearly always some level 605 or something. It's like.. why?
---
i always buy junk legendaries. I have 4 alts to feed. 
---
GT? If you don't mind. =0
---
Read it again. I said Instigating for heavy weapons OR any of the other secondary perks.  You have a magic weapon.
---
It's not so bad, a lot of players just need people in teams for the bonuses, personally I'm generally a social introvert so I tend to not talk when in a group, but I'm personally happy when someone jumps into my group since that means I'm going to get additional bonuses. Keep that in mind. =D
---
I killed my first one a couple of days ago. Got a Troubleshooters, limb damage minigun.
---
Good test! It does show that we get more than 1:1 coins regardless. Thank you!
---
what do you mean playlist?
---
Same as on here bumpynukkakilla
---
master infiltrator is excellent, no more swapping when i need to open a door or hack a terminal. i do wish there was at least one solo focused perk though instead of only team stuff.
---
Ohh well thank you for clarifying, I thought this meant we could finally exceed the 15 cap to 18.
---
Edit: typos
---
They need to fix it so that fire lining and antivenom apply to power armor as well
---
It still spawns on the roof of the spa on the north edge of Berkeley Springs.  I don't remember exactly where. But, it's still on the roof on a shelf in the kitchen/dinning area of the Blood Eagles new hideout.
---
Fought the queen arround 2 hours ago.
---
My Prime JFFR took arround a sixth of her health bar...  with 24 rounds. I think that's a yes.
---
Damn, ammo factory seems good
---
That's 256 bullion a DAY. How in the world did you manage that?!
---
Lol nice catch! Just fixed it.
---
On the northwest side of Morgantown (the town itself), there is a safe under a porch on one of the houses.  Directly north of the high school.
---
Aww did they get rid of the ones where you get extra DT for a full matching set of light medium and heavy armor? I was actually looking forward to that one because I finally got a full set of unyielding urban scout armor.
---
(Honestly I think that one was the only one I was looking forward to.)
---
I'm a level 18 and if I ran across you I'd praise you with the moth man dance and a heart.
---
This is more like it! Some actually interesting perks in here - stuff like Blood Sacrifice, Retribution, Taking One for the Team, and What Rads? seem like somebody took slightly longer than five minutes to design. Very pleased they listened and improved on this.
---
Bring back the Shoulder Mounted Machine Gun from Lonesome Road! An already existing heavy weapon that uses 10mm, and coincidentally cool as fuck.
---
So is this a problem on PC only?  If you go AFK on console, the storm will kill you if the players don't. The only way to get back in to a new match is to manually select the option, as far as I know.
---
I spent a lot of time as a  bush wookie when grinding for my outcast paint, but that gets boring as hell.    I am now level 72 and mostly play the game legit these days.
---
There are times, however where I don't fee like putting in  real effort so I turn off the  team fill option, turn on the aqua boy perk, and sit at the bottom of Grafton lake lol.    I make sure I am not on a team when I do that though.
---
I support where you're coming from, but because of the lore, I actually feel the clean look is immersive. Residents of vault 76, i.e. the players, are anywhere from the original pre-war residence to children of them. Mentally I would think they would want cleen stuff as they didn't live through the Apocalypse. Pre-war everything was clean, children of pre-war aren't going to know the difference because the vault is clean. That said though you're not going to have the resources in the intelligence to make everything such as the nuka cola machine. So those would have to be post apocalyptic as they did go through the Apocalypse. But if you want one you're kind of stuck with that option.
---
Plus it's not like there isn't a whole bunch of Abraxo just laying around.
---
Fire lining and Anti-Venom offer +50 resist per level?  That seems really underwhelming for what a pain it would be to assemble a matching set of anything but secret service armor with decent legendary effects.  Overall, though, these are more interesting.  I see several that I'd use and several that I'm all *tilts head* at but other people seem to like.
---
It wasn't even like that when it launched, they patched it in. 
---
People give DE a lot of shit, but they are pretty on top of working on their content and making it more player friendly. (Eventually, usually lol)
---
I love Nightwave.
---
They do
---
Should be under headgear while at the bench. You have to purchase the helmet separate from the outfit in the Atom shop first.
---
They seem to just be multiples - the ammo factory goes from 50% more ammo to 75% more ammo, to 100%.
---
Id love to tell you more, but you can only see the next level of upgrade, it costs 100 coins to go from lv1 &gt; lv2, and you dont get any coins to play with.
---
I scrapped all my perks to get 281 coins to use (costs 1 coin to swap the perks, and you cant see the next level until its locked in)
---
Nevermind, I found it.
---
New slot
---
It's under headgear at the armor bench. You need to unlock it in the atom shop first, then craft it at the bench.
---
I believe u can do it on Xbox and PS4 if u have a cronus max and a keyboard
---
I must of did my math wrong then
---
I'll go through it again, but I got the 1000 from the quest ending, and 200 a day, plus the 300 weekly
---
I think adventure mode pvp may be beyond saving at this point. Its lame, filled with chad weapons/exploits and the biggest problem is that theres no point to it, its literally just a big ass shitshow of a waste of time. Ive posted it before, but i think a few "tarkov esque" instanced areas would be a great happy medium. You basically run in, get unique loot, and leave before times up, choosing to pvp or not. Not sure how loadouts/weaps/armor/perks would work but itd be awesome if executed correctly.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
It come under headwear or headgear for the menu on the armor crafting station.
---
The building in the picture behind the trains has lock box in it as well.
---
oh Nice then is good I was ready to say it's all shit if I needed to change my actual perks lmao, why I become so negative...
---
Op just needs attention xD
---
Edit: jk of course, no one knows yet
---
\~I'm very Excited now. These perks look actually interesting and diversified; I'm going to have a difficult time deciding which one I want to go with.   
---
I'm a bit mixed on Master Infiltrator; For players who do not have access to the loadout manager mod I'm sure this comes as a great sigh of relief, on the other hand it seems like such a waste of a legendary perk slot to devote to something that I can easily do with basic muscle memory at this point.   
---
I feel like there are better solutions to the "combat vs utility" loadout thing and this feels like a step in the wrong direction, even if it is a welcome one.
---
Congrats on parenthood! Am in similar situation, but kinda eased up on *need* of virtual things. Been there on many online games before ( both "free to play" and "pay only once" ), and after some broken relationships, friends lost and life opportunities missed, came to conclusion it's just not worth it. F76 is sure fun on many aspects, and has it's moments, but I'm not giving a damn about crap they placed so difficult to get for casual play. Like you said, its season 1. I just don't justify doing it over and over again, especially when there are more important things to spend life on. Sure, there are players that have either all the time in the world to play this, or money to throw at it, but accepting I'm not one of those isn't end of it all. 
---
As bloodied or junkies as playstyle is concerned, it's unfortunate, but its a reality. Pick one, and make your grind easier, or play as you wish and find actual challenge. Maybe future patches with BOS return will bring variety, who knows.
---
When are they suppose to release for everyone else?
---
Make caps selling all the guns you pick up off the scorched to the vendorbots
---
Meanwhile after 40 modules I have all but one piece of an unyielding secret service set, all but one is 3\* (and it's a 2 star). The one piece that isn't unyielding is bolstering, so at least it's on theme.
---
Making it purely random numbers based without any trading isn't really fair or fun.
---
Hopefully patch 22. But not confirmed.  They did say it WONT be patch 21
---
Some arcade machines would go nicely with the wallpaper.
---
I have a cheap Scrip weapon vendor and my "Scrap Crap for 1 Cap" Vendor. Basically all known plans apart from Fixer and a few others go in at 1 cap.
---
I started playing with my son and it's fun. I like pvp and wish Bethesda would stop ruining adventure pvp and fix things like aid spam but I like the tension of NW in lieu of a game I'd like adventure to be.
---
Yeah. Put it over by where the earned atoms popup comes up.
---
well.. 1 for each stat anyway
---
Ill be using agility, luck and perception no doubt..
---
that extra point in agility could really be a boon to anyone who likes pistols
---
I kind of thought along those lines
---
In fallout 4 you literally see female paladins
---
I mean to be fair it still has the on death perks
---
That would be a great idea.
---
Those are WAAAY better than they were I'm happy with these. I know Ammo Factory and Master infiltrator will be up there for me.
---
Look. All I'm saying is most people don't, and won't, spend the time swapping cards after every encounter or every time they hit an interior with a locked door. It's time wasting, and exhausting.
---
The legendary card fixes that, the only reason the original is so dumb in the first place is because it's 3 separate cards, making it the tiniest bit more annoying. 
---
I'm not even sure what the argument is in this thread is anymore besides "oh it's dumb because it's 3 different cards" when the main reason it's 3 separate cards is so the game can differentiate what level they unlock at. As having it be one card that unlocks at different levels was probably more technologically taxing and caused more problems than just having 3 separate ones that unlocked at their respective levels.
---
It wasn't designed so that different ranks of a card unlock at different levels, no other card works like that. So getting duplicates of lockpicking would either have been ass easy or too high too bother if it was just one single card.
---
The main point is, I'm glad this legendary perk exists, so it's one less swap I have to stare at just to open a door.
---
And sure. We can Monday night quarterback about a passive perk system, but the game literally runs on shoe strings and gum as is, and we're just getting to a good place. Which has this perk in a legendary slot. Making it a passive perk. It's a complaint literally about what's being fixed.
---
Wow, mate that’s dope! The gauss shotgun is also broken in VATS?
---
Reminder to myself to stop by and buy all your scrip sometime. Hell I pay up to 800 for junk 3* weapons when I'm trying to stay below max caps every single day. The struggle is so real.
---
Yea but I didnt even blink with the last list.  This is good stuff.
---
Yeah, I posted about this the other day.  I'am farming events for the t-notes but the public events just seem to be few and far between.  I had some spare time today so I logged in and sat on one server for  over 3 hours and had 2 swam of suitors pop, 1 feed the people and 1 load baring and thats it.   My "conspiracy" theory is that bethesda lowered the spawn rate of public events to keep the collection of t-notes down to a minium :-).....
---
I mean, second glance here ... loving the utility of the fire one, the poison resist one, legendary ability, follow through (ranged sneak needs more help amiright?)
---
Very nice.
---
I wish to see if this makes sense...
---
Ah okay.  Yeah I also felt something really strong kicking in on damage. Sucks tho, my Lever action will be less useful for sure. I will enjoy it until then!
---
But let’s see what happens yeah lol.
---
Now ***these*** are legendary perks
---
I don't have that OP of a gun but I use a furious Tesla for any event that has a lot of people.

I don’t have an answer but if you’re on Xbox I got a vampires baseball bat with 40% more attack power an +agility if you want it.

Yep. That's the point of the event really, but it doesn't happen every time.
---
Well, there's only going to be six Legendary slots max it looks like. 
---
OTOH, +1 stat/+1 perk slot is for level 1 of that ability. So it could be a lot more total perk slots.
---
I would probably still run Master Infiltrator which could be seen as six slots. Not having to switch decks when Assaultrons are running around seems worth it.
---
I’d love to NOT see 300 mounted plans when I want rarer ones.
---
But anytime I see 5.56, snatch. (Certain legendaries if they fit my build and are properly priced of course)
---
They just need to pull the assets over from FO4, we're missing *all sorts* of incredible assets that already exist. MTX hell.
---
Well I play almost every day so I pretty much always have stuff in there for that cheap keep checking back.
---
Pretty sure that wasn't the case here, but yeah. I know that happens.
---
Anyone have a link to a page with more info on these "legendary perks"
---
I know nothing about them yet. I wanna know how to get them, what they do, etc...
---
HUGE improvement. Wow.
---
Yeah those got removed
---
Or .45
---
This game really has a bit of an ammo issue...
---
Yep
---
I understand what you’re saying and agree that more apocalyptic-themed structures would be cool, and I thought looking at the new diner set in the Atom Shop that dropped for example looked really clean, too, until I implemented it in my C.A.M.P. This might be my high standards for what clean-looking qualifies, and I can only really speak for this bundle, but I just wanted to point out that, to me, it looks pretty dirty/weathered. Like something that survived the bombs, but was by no means unscathed.
---
That’s a pretty good description for my new diner, actually. I’m not sure whether that makes me happy or disappointed.
---
I've stopped putting plans haha, they never sell. Just wasted inventory. I'll keep 5.56 in mind
---
&gt; The casual player
---
Hi! Yea, I don't even bother to swap anything from ammo/repair cards unless I run into a terminal I can't get into. It's a pretty looking system, but super annoying. I prefer the old version where you got the perk and it stayed with you.
---
Agh so there’s no benefit of having a matching full set of armor now? I just lost all interest in Legendary perks now.
---
Platform?
---
I'm a Sloth :)
---
Hahahahaha - you must be new here...
---
&gt;Legendary Ability - +1 to stat and +1 to available perk slots (theres one for each SPECIAL)
---
How does this work? Do you rank up the card for more regular perk slots? If so what is the max card level/extra perk slots?
---
It autocompleted for me while doing the lockpicks. I was still 1/3 but leveled a NW rank which triggered the weekly completion. And received the score aswell.
---
Seems like many challenges are glitched to payout before completion right now. Or... I’m seeing a lot of complaints about not receiving rewards countered with the thought that they’ve likely been paid out early.
---
Oh you scrap perks? that's great to hear I can get rid of unwanted ones, thanks for replying with this info.
---
It is, besides its hit chance being broken, I think in VATS every pellet/beam counts as full damage, or the limb damage part is broken
---
Not entirely sure, I just know it works amazingly
---
As a math update: level 93 to level 421 is what will be necessary if all you do is the 100/10000 xp bonus. Subtract the daily/weekly achievement from that and it’s the most accurate estimate possible.
---
It would be very hard to lose caps. Transactions are lossy to keep a sense of value and urgency, which is part of what makes a game fun (when properly applied).
---
Do they though?
---
Some fantastic info there, I've been tweaking my INT this week to maximise my XP gains and I use quite a few of  your suggestions. I've gone from 6 to 21 INT. I'm very happy with the increase!
---
Theres the poison resist and fire resist perks - they both need matching armour sets
---
Aww, congrats!! I love hearing these stories about bush wookies prevailing, haha. I've gotten to second place a good number of times, but never first!
---
Explosions. So many explosions. It's like Michael Bay has taken over development.
---
Is there a level requirement for legendary cards?
---
I'm still trying to clear out my inventory from Fasnacht legendaries.  :(
---
Yeah this bundle was great
---
Actual stores are like this. If you were to go in an antique shop and sell a Frank Sinatra vinyl, you’d only be given 10¢ for it. But when the shop is selling that same album, they’d sell it for $10. It’s how they make their money. Is it kinda shitty in a video game? Yeah. But is it also realistic? Yeah.
---
in 3 Sarah Lyons was a paladin.
---
she led her own squad.
---
THE SQUAD WAS NAMED AFTER HER.
---
the britherhood is a lot of things, but how could one assume the BoS is sexist?
---
Am I the only one who morally agrees with the brotherhood of steel, I don’t like that they don’t recruit ghouls and mutants. But regardless they definitely aren’t fascists they want to help the commonwealth and save them from the institute. Although fallout 3’s bos were kinda jerks they risked their lives to destroy the enclave who were true totalitarian fascists and to purify Washington D.C.’s water. I have no idea where you got the idea they were misogynistic they have plenty of women in their ranks in every level of power. Even 
---
The new bos coming to Appalachia is lead by a woman.
---
Basically, although you do get rewarded throughout the run
---
The normal int cards also expand the range for lock picking in theory they might make them still worth having. I would think they make hacking easier too so if they balanced that out it might be worth still using a card or two even maxed, in theory anyway.
---
I already run Fireproof though so fire attacks already don’t hurt me, plus I think certain ghouls are one of the only few enemies that use poison damage... 
---
I was really looking forward to that extra DT for a full set.
---
*Ooooor* maybe you could just hope for Bethesda doing more to reward people who go for the PvP route instead of penalizing the people who don't?
---
Maybe someone took it before I found it
---
first they have to fix godmode goddamned
---
Yeah I just don't even know how these things break like they added the SCORE system but then somehow adrenaline breaks i dont get it lol
---
I found it, thanks. If it were a snake it would have bitten me. lol
---
The argument is that it should never have been anything to swap to begin with. The new card is great, and it will make life much easier. But I'm not going to be especially grateful to Bethesda for making me earn slots and coins to fix a problem they deliberately created.
---
I guess we'll just agree to disagree.
---
I got unyielding on my first try with the chest piece. Todd must like me
---
Not if he wants little goblins.
---
It cures diseases, fully restores health, hunger, and thirst. The ultimate convenience perk.
---
Not that I have seen but doesn’t mean they don’t. Maybe someone else will answer.
---
I assume op is one of those fake feminists who thinks anyone who disagrees with them is a mysogonist
---
The Slocum Joe stuff was my favorite from the CC for Fallout 4. I'm the corner market for donuts in the Commonwealth and my shops look totes awesome.
---
Probably. The dmg output doesn't add up.
---
This is the first MMO I’ve played with player vendors that feel isn’t ruined or dominated by a group that spends more time buying up anything of value.
---
I sell lots of ammo. More since the ammo converter. I sell plans, not mounted heads. I sell a lot of chems. 
---
Dog food, fasnacht donuts, royal jelly taffy. Recently I’ve added White Russians, 25% less limb damage. Serums. 
---
And junk. Lots and lots of junk. The stuff people need a lot off. 
---
It’s great to be able to actually sell stuff. Not just rate items.
---
It might happen. I wouldn’t count on it though
---
You sure you're not talking about the neon blue letters?
---
Top left corner please
---
Although the slots for lv1 perks come "quite" easily (reach level 50, level 75, level 100 etc), the true grind will be ranking them up.
---
To put into context - my PTS character is lv193 and has 4 slots, so I can equip 4 of these legendary perks.
---
If I scrap literally every normal perk card that isnt in my active deck, I just have enough to get a single legendary perk up to lv3, or not quite enough to get 3 of them to level 2.
---
Now realistically, most people will have "spare" cards they wont scrap - super duper, ammo smith, weapon artisan etc etc, so Id expect a normal lv200 character to have 4x lv1 and 1x lv2
---
Unfortunately you can’t build Atom Shop stuff for other peeps. 🥺
---
Let’s not forget the vocal sac...
---
Unless it’s glitches then no one can put it down in your camp sadly. This was the only thing that fits with my theme and I’m loathe to part with the atoms for jt
---
I'm keeping myself from being spoiled for the sake of excitement, but I did read blood sacrifice and it's perfect for me as a melee build during SBQ.
---
Yeah I was hella confused when I saw that in a diner bundle, i highly doubt Bethesda would release it individually but I'm not 100% sure. Greedy Bethesda smh
---
Ammo sells all day long.  I price it all at 1 cap.  Plans don’t move much even at 99caps.  Legendary weapons and armour move when under 500 caps.  Fusion/plasma cores sell well around 99caps
---
Haven't logged into the PTS forums yet, but holy hell, WHAT AN IMPROVEMENT!
---
I guess it's subjective I guess. Personally, there's a large portion of the player base who liked this perk system BECAUSE it wasn't like Fallout 4's where you just got everything and were overpowered. 
---
The system is more in tune with previous games, where you have to decide what to pick and choose which I've enjoyed, especially as a player with friends who have different builds and are better suited for separate things and aren't all just the same version of one overpowered character that has everything.
---
Bigly
---
Congrats on the solo silo run! Next you'll be challenging yourself to beat your best time running it! Surprisingly there is still a good amount of XP to get from clearing a silo. That is from the initial robot spawns. The replacement ones suck A$$.
---
Yeah a cooldown period after that event, and others like it, would be very helpful too.
---
This happened to me twice I’m a lower level I’d fought off the three waves of enemies and only just got the extractors etc set up and I got slaughtered by a level 200. I wish they would lock the level PvP when you’ve claimed a workshop so that at least you could try and fight back!
---
Awesome I'll give that a shot now that I'm higher level (40). Thanks!
---
None once you have unlocked them on another character. Click the link for an explanation .
---
Mirelurk queens and stingwings. Of which sting wings are the most annoying.
---
Any launcher for that matter, as well as their ammo too ...
---
damn wish it was 50%
---
Happened for me too after i complete lock pick challenge. Happy about that, because NW challenges are pain for me because i suck at aim
---
ur joke made my day!!! thanks a lot
---
You could just buy the serum from another player, usually between 250-500 caps
---
No wonder the Overseer’s house makes my One X sounds like a jet engine when I go in there
---
Was quiet today on PS4 but some days events are popping off and overlapping.
---
Damn thats rough. I have a feeling the dude who shot me in my tent was hoping for the same payout of some free flux but joke was on him because I already stashed it. First thing I do when SBQ is dead is head for the nearest tent and offload the flux. I dont take chances on losing it.
---
I beleive you rank the card for +1 special/slot. Not sure if theres 3 or 4 ranks.
---
Special cap is still 15. So if you have 15 perception, you wont be able to increase it further.
---
I hope you continue to "train" yourself and get even better with Camp building! Sorry...
---
Ah good 2 know
---
Ah I thought bugs and queens did acid damage? Isn’t poison damage what the gangrene ferals do?
---
Now there's an idea. Time to go camp hopping I suppose. Thanks.
---
Roughly get a 1/3 of the atoms rewards now. That is **IF** you complete the Legendary Run all the way to 100.
---
Have a damn upvote then
---
1/4th of the atoms we got before. If you complete all the 100 ranks. If.
---
I got my chest piece after 2 rolls and I was like "What is everyone complaining about?"
---
30 or so leg rolls later and I still haven't gotten anything close to what I want.
---
I want wrecked cars and busses as camp objects.
---
I'm level 40 now and I just got a perk card that slows down the use of cores, but it may be a different one then the one your using. Thanks for the tip though :)
---
In Fallout everyone is evil.
---
You can get a card every 50 levels and scrapping perks you dont need like in nw
---
Hmm I’ve got a couple of weapons that fit the criteria but they don’t seem to shred that much 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
The lockpick and hacking one is exactly whats been needed since launch
---
You have several minutes, not 30 seconds.  You can change cards during map voting.
---
I would say that the Wasteland has really hardened up your girl there...lol. 😂😂😂 But seriously, Ive never had this happen before. Really weird. Probably like the “unlocking all the wallpaper bug” in the Atop shop. Idk 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
Hmmm good point. You may well be correct. Tomorrow I'll put on that perk and go punch some stingwings see what happens.
---
You don't need to buy the recipe/plan unless you are wanting to mass produce it. It can be bought from the Enclave bunker as a serum, or from many player vending machines as a serum
---
Personally I sell all serums for 300 caps each in my vending machine, but prices vary across platforms and from person to person depending on the market.
---
Sorry but I'm really unresearched when it comes to all this legendary perk stuff. New characters have all the legendary perks unlocked right off the bat? I was under the impression that they were really difficult to obtain.
---
If you think of it as investing in the long term profits you'll get then yes. If you know youre not really all that dedicated to grinding then probably not. You can always make some caps back by trying to sell the serums to other players.
---
I'll send a friends request and be a valued customer 🤣
---
I can’t figure it out, and I haven’t spent my billion yet. Do I need to buy the chest piece, and then the jet pack, or is the “SS Jet pack armor” all I need.
---
If i can build insane energy weapons,power armo with jet packs,i will definitely be building a nice house.not a shack.but i do like the stuff that looks worn and beat up.but definitely not a scrapyard house that would be pretty dumb.advanced wiring and conduit connections to house made of scrap wood...lmao
---
Which is horrendously stupid tying your adventure mode SPECIAL to your NW.
---
Ty !
---
Thanks for the info. Time to go server/camp hopping.
---
I think leveling a rank and getting a reward counts as a ‘daily’ to the game. Happened to me.
---
I'm currently out of scrap boxes so i couldn't store it using a quick way out. And who expects that people would shoot at you when helping them out
---
I just got fallout 1st, can you get fusion cores in your private server and bring it back to the public server with you? I've tried researching to no avail.
---
Keep in mind that this is a post apocalyptic fantasy adventure game.not real life and logic.
---
I'll check there. I mean I don't give a crap if I die, I just want my 3 picks. Yet to find a thing I can pick.
---
Buy the kangaroo serum recipe plan instead.
---
Anytime bud, happy hunting!
---
Thanks!  Yeah my heart was beating out of my chest, it was like my third kill ever in NW, and I grinded out all the rewards during the challenge.
---
I like your wording of mirelurk queen talents
---
It's a hassle to get a large sum of caps to begin with, especially for someone who's a low level, that plays solo, and can't grind an extensive amount of time on it, which doesn't make the game fun, just tedious and obnoxious.
---
Sometimes they’ll sell individual items from bundles, but not for a while until after the bundle is released, and it’s pretty rare for them to do it anyway. They put items people want in bundles with a bunch of crap to justify the atom price.
---
When you said "npc repairman" I thought you were going to suggest a CAMP NPC that will go around and slowly repair the health bars of CAMP items...  Cause I'd love something like that.
---
... my god. Does it have a name?
---
Did they all shoot you? Or just one?
---
It's odd though because I went to the Atomic shop for hahas and the 4 leaf clover tattoo that was on my character isnt unlocked. The wasteland roughes me up real bad I guess 🤣🤣 You should've seen my face when I took that surgical mask off lmfao!
---
I have marsupial already. Bird bones, healing factor, speed deamon and adrenal reaction (I know, along with healing factor, how silly).
---
Not really after the plan as much as two of the serums, one for me and one for my wife.
---
Just get secret service and you'll be fine!
---
Wouldnt a scrap kit reduce Hardened Mass to ultracite anyway or did they stop that? Thats another thing Im super paranoid about when harvesting materials. I have to remain conscious of not doing the "scrap all" thing and scrapping my Hardened Mass like Ive stupidly done in the past. Im not sure if that got included on the "non auto scrap" list or not
---
Snappable ***and*** conform to the terrain. Junk walls were bad enough horizontally but trying anything on a slope....blech. They need to have some foundation functionality added too
---
Cool perks but did they reduce the cost to upgrade or change it so it doesn't require lvl 240+ to max out 1 legendary perk ?
---
I recommend getting the brain bombs and cranberry relish recipes while you're at it, if you haven't already.
---
Well this looks a lot better.
---
Anymore, I end up making an attic so I can get a ceiling and hide my wiring at the same time. needlessly pads my already tiny budget, but it works.
---
Previous games had your perks locked. In this game, my build is only locked by my SPECIAL. I can get everything like in 4, I just can't use them all at once. Which is fine and better than 4, but extremely annoying for perks that are only useful for 5 seconds at a time.
---
I'm lucky to squeeze out a 3x3 shack with a roof, this is impressive!
---
Snap, I assumed 7 days hadn’t past since my last purchase.
---
Lv2 is +2/+2
---
Although I didnt have the coins to see lv3 or lv4, I see no reason why they wouldnt be +3/+3 and +4/+4
---
If your on ps4 I'll sell ya 2 for 500 caps.
---
I was hoping I wouldn't be the victim of this yet again after 2 weekly challenge sets and 8 daily challenge sets were marked as completed over the last year (with it happening 3 times in the two weeks before Update 20), but alas, my Atoms and my SCORE are doomed to be lost forever. [https://i.imgur.com/VIvWC69.png](https://i.imgur.com/VIvWC69.png)
---
Now I’m afraid to take the mask off my character and see what I find!! Lol 😂😂😂
---
huh?? I have 3 mounted flags,  Left is Settler, Middle is US, right is Raider.... soooo not sure what you are talking about.
---
I am all over that. Psn: Twiztidjuggalo73
---
You need the chest piece to put the jet pack on
---
So if you only want the jetpack, you only need the chest piece
---
Oh my gosh thank you so much
---
Don’t eat yellow snow
---
Wow I'm not happy about this at all. Just completely wipe out the gold cards if they dont provide extra anything. Pointless. The grind for coins to upgrade 1 perk card is ridiculously high. Maybe bump all the lvl 1 cards to another coin or 2. Something that makes sense, I dont want to grind another 800 hrs to max 3 cards
---
I agree completely. That store they created for the screenshots in the background of the store look really nice, and I would like to visit it or somewhere like it in game.
---
Got it! Thank you so much. I’ll be getting it tonight, I’m nearly at 4000 gold - I’ve been nervous to do it wrong.
---
I get you, 4000 is more than enough for both
---
People have been saying bloodied builds will get nerf for over a year now. It's not going to happen since the perfect time should have been when Wastelanders was released but nope.
---
This isn't anything new, has been happening for many many months now. Especially at Scorched Earth event. Tents attract the mobs for some reason into groups. Sometimes they spawn at the sonic generator, other times outside the fence.
---
At scorched earth, they all spawn under the queen or inside someones tent for easy mopping up.
---
What annoys me the most is, people are calling for players to be banned if they participate in events where this happens.
---
You can't control what others F1st members do with their tent placements, after all it's meant to be a convenience to place it near you for access to stash etc.
---
Seems like a huge improvement, glad they listened to the feedback. Can't wait to get my hands on master infiltrator.
---
Master Infiltrator looks like it would save me a ton of perk points so i'll go for it for sure!
---
I am sooooo down for this...
---
You can't hear people? Are you able to hear animals or machinery? hmm
---
I like that idea too. Maybe slow repair as long as camp is not “in combat” and it can’t rebuild destroyed items, only “regenerate” health for existing ones.
---
Mama dolces has one near the hole in the wall
---
Yeah... have been seeing a lot of this lately. 
---
When this happens I'll try to move just far enough away from the elevated ones and draw the queens attention onto myself when she does her skunk run. If she lands it's sometimes enough to get them off their perch for a while.
---
If it goes on for too long I'll holster my gun, sit back, and watch the parade of ammo being offered up to the sky for no good reason.
---
Dropping the queen right now. Got them on my alt. Come killer her if you want and I'll swap toons. Touch down in 2min
---
I'll look into it. Thank you.
---
All aboard the vanity train. Choo choo!
---
I would assume so that’s what there doing for destiny 2 with ps5 players being able to play with ps4 people
---
The greenhouse dome has been part of a bundle for the better part of a year and never pulled out so I’m thinking your chances to see this on its own is extremely small, bordering on 0.
---
What a bunch of rats
---
I'll join in a few. Wife just found a tameable snallygaster. Can't pass that up.
---
No thanks
---
Fast travel to the Whitespring. Go around the building to your right. The one story building in the parking lot has the laundry.
---
Fast travel to the Whitespring. Enter the building, go down the stairs, run through the shops corridor and exit the building. The one story building in the parking lot on your right has the laundry.
---
I've all my ammo at 1 cap. I'll do fusion cores a bit more often. Cheers
---
at the moment I only buy .38, .45 and 5.56 ammo on a 1:1 ratio and 3* junkie weapons with 90%WR as a third effect. 
---
I’m hunting rare plans and outfits but those usually are trade only since they cost more than 30k caps.
---
and for sale I put all other ammo types, excluding explosives and 2mm, and I charge each 1 cap. fusion cells, 10mm, shotty shells, plasma cartdriges and even  cryi cells, 1 cap each.
---
I always sell chems recipes and armor plans for cheap, light combat torso, marine torso, stimpak recipe, psycho recipe and so on for 50-100 caps each plan (my camp is in the forest and I have a lot of noob foot traffic, they always buy those cheap plans)
---
and some meta subpar armor and weapons, 1* or 2* bloodied, antiarmor, junkie, vanguard, bolstering and unyielding for relatively reasonable prices 500c - 2000c depending on the stats.
---
I also sell uncommon clothing for 200-500, green hoods, wrapped caps, engineer uniforms etc. 
---
and some semi rare plans BOS shielded, blueridge stuff, power armor limbs and so on.
---
We call our snallygaster steve
---
For real?! I've never seen them!
---
Yep that's what I was trying but she just didn't want to move
---
nothing would happen, the cap is still 15 it only increases if your not already at cap so you can put that point elsewhere
---
Good call on the ammo types. I'll get a larger stock of those in!
---
Thank you so much!
---
They tie the perk slots to your level, they could as well tie the level up of perk cards to your level and get rid of this horrible scrapping/point system.
---
Scrapping your perks is a bad idea because it essentially freeze your build in one state while you sell all unused card - at the moment - to get perk points. You will end up never changing your build, no wonder they didn’t develop the perk loadouts, it will serve nothing because you will have nothing to switch. Plus the cost of leveling up is so high that it will force you to sell every perk card absolutely not essential.
---
And it’s also quite tedious to micro manage the cards, and have yet another points/currency in the game. This is becoming the currency generator...
---
Think they're in the bundles
---
What is the flare gun purpose anyways
---
That really confused me
---
Junk is a good call, I'll start keeping a bit more of that in the camp. Thanks!
---
Mine will be called Khezu and I will hug him and pet him and squeeze him.
---
Hardened mass doesn't auto scrap. It just flies into your stash in one piece
---
Yeah I just can’t hear people through voice chat I have an earlier post about it but it’s an annoying problem
---
Yeah it wouldn’t be fair
---
Very nice! Personally I'm torn between cool cosmetics like this, and hoarding Atoms just in case I need them for the legendary run if things get tight towards the end
---
My biggest complaint is that you can't turn in or buy in bulk.
---
Well I had a travelling salesman in my camp yesterday and he had the herbivore serum for 4000 caps I usually get a couple come by when I’m there. I didn’t buy it because I have the carnivore but it was cheaper than MODUS
---
Aluminum, oil, gears, springs, screws, acid, and few others always do well.
---
As far as I'm aware lever actions shouldn't really be affected by it.  If it is though then you stumbled onto something interesting and it might keep being good no matter what. 
---
Lever action is just in general a really good gun though if you are going semi auto.  Best damage per shot you will find without being painfully slow like a black powder.
---
There are faster ways to get acid, depending on your level.
---
Whats the deal with exploding enemies? I would hope that it's not just some sort of visual eye candy and that maybe it will work like a grenade, affecting other nearby enemies.
---
To scare dogs.  My screen has like 8 million flashing lights.  Fireworks seem like about as good of an idea as using leeches to cure anemia.
---
Any suggesting on pricing? As in, what's the most you would spend on a bulk
---
I know how you feel. A few days ago I was the only one that showed up to the event, did the whole thing myself until a level 450 something showed up the same time as the night stalker did and one shots it before I could get a shot in. I could care less about the legendary item(probably a 1 star leather chest piece) but to show up at the very end to one shot the boss really irked me.
---
Yeah, it essentially gives you lv3 pick lock and lv3 hacker so you never need to swap them in. Additionally, you auto unlock any lv0 lock/terminals without needing to do the minigame.
---
Rank 2 is the same, but auto unlocks lv0 and lv1 locks/terminals.
---
Im torn about it, because on the 1 hand its a great QoL - no more messing around perk swapping to open a safe.
---
On the other hand, you only get 6 legendary slots (and need to be lv300 to get the 6th), so do I really want to waste a slot on an ability that saves me ~15 seconds on the odd occasion I want to pick something.
---
 **Master Infiltrator** \- Done. That's what i'm using!
---
I wont argue that at all.  
---
Just got the various arrow plans from Foundation last night.
---
Start investing in an index fund at an early age.
---
It helps that the community is a bunch of gaming pariahs guilty only of enjoying a game the internet says they're not allowed to like.
---
I used to only try and sell legendaries and rare plans etc.... what I personally have found... it doesnt' matter... now I sell all Plans regardless of rarity, I simply don't even look at them and rate them anymore.    WHY? you might ask, because I'm constantly hitting the 30k cap limit  and it simply doesn't matter.   I have nothing left to really spend my money on, the only thing I can buy now is the 6k:300bln  ... I Sell everything rock bottom, All ammo is 1 and plans are all 1/2 MSRP at least(many lower), Stimpacks for 5 and SuperStim for 10...  Legendary Weapons/Armour though, I actually rate those and some go for higher than MSRP.  I never have a problem unloading things.  I'm like Walmart. I don't even categorize anymore just put whatever and wherever it fits.
---
I like to run straight towards Flatwood and start the “thirst things thirst” quest right away (just go to the responder pc). I don’t know if it’s a longer process, but it works well. I thought that you could potentially get the fireman responder outfit, but it may have been removed from that mission reward pool.
---
Well naturally not more than what a bot vendor would sell. But generally I go up about 10-20 caps more than the suggested price. If I have to move a lot, about 10-20 caps lower.
---
The system didn’t change, it was horrible the first time, it’s still horrible. The perk cards didn’t change much either, to be honest, outside of 2 or3 new cards, and the removal of many, there’s nothing really new. They fail to really feel legendary.
---
You're welcome to come check my Camp but i'm on Xbox.
---
Damn well that's pretty shitty thing to do when you are on a team. I never go AFK, but there's times when I just don't feel like putting in serious effort so I turn off the team fill and sit at the bottom of Grafton lake with aqua boy turned on.   That's not my preferred play style but I do it occasionally.
---
Haha yeah, good thing we got that quest.
---
Almost every build should have high agility, so many great things in agility!
---
Probably a call center in India that Bethesda has hired and told them to never contact them.
---
totally agreed.
---
That's...  pretty dope!
---
The train car is nice.  It holds way more stuff than I expected.  I actually think that bundle is one of the best values of the year.  However, I feel your pain about it not being available standalone.  I doubt it will ever be.  
---
If you have enough atoms and are considering the bundle, I doubt you will be disappointed if you go for it.
---
So, this is a puzzle piece in the game that you are meant to deal with. I always found it fairly easy to sell a bunch of aid items to vendors. I usually run pharma farma and sell everything I don't need. Also I cook everything I kill for the xp alone and sell it. I try to parkour through the game modes because I don't like getting stuck too long in any of the game-loop components (targeting, positioning, menu, building). So, as a low level, I probably stopped in and sold stuff 4 or 5 times a session (in and out of conveniently places camp) at about 450 each time (glowing meat steaks, radaway, purified water). It's all about balance as you build, that is literally the game itself. Also, you can literally just grab all the random shit from the local area and sell it right to the vendors. The more each of your inputs is conscious of your wholistic scheme, the more efficient you become at solving the puzzle (provided your scheme/strat is alright).
---
The creativity this game brings out in people is what makes me see the game as good.
---
Yeah it's not about what you get off it necessarily, it's fun to have a boss to beat.
---
I wish my wife would play this game..
---
If you want to change your build you can just level up more. You get a new perk card every time you level up, so the way the current system works is basically what you said but only after ~level 60 because by then most people have their builds set up and aren't planning on changing them. I think that your system would work too, but they seem pretty similar and especially since the legendary perks aren't even that good I dont think that it's a big deal.
---
You can up agility and still pick a strength card. There is a filter button to look at other cards when picking.
---
I think its the thingy around the neck from the silver shroud that makes it not fit for me. I like those 2 pieces alone.
---
Guess I was too late for the queen.
---
That’s better thank you
---
♥️♥️ that is simply amazing!!!
---
Lol, we killed her in a min. And I logged back in
---
Cheers for the info. If you were buying with your 30k caps. Anything you would focus on? Bulk junk, meds, etc?
---
I wonder if they can be traded/sold in vendors, or if they're strictly "personal use"
---
What rads, master infiltrator, and ammo factory are really the only ones I’d be interested in with my build but still some of these have good potential. Some are questionable as to why we would need them.
---
1/4?  1/3?  People are being too generous.
---
We’ve lost about 80% of free atoms.
---
Currently we get about 1500 for the whole run as I understand it.  You got about 50 a day, plus about 250 for weeklies.  It varied, some days are 60 or even 70.  So saying 625 free atoms a week over 12 weeks is 7500 atoms, just to make the math a bit easier.  Even if you push that to 8000 over 12 weeks, or consider it really 13 weeks, it’s still a huge cut in free weekly atoms.  If you’re a veteran player, other sources of free atoms are likely few and far between.
---
Now I get why, there’s no way zenimax was going to let this free atom train go forever.  Atoms are how they make money on this game, and with the reduced atoms and the season they likely are aiming to pull in more money.
---
I’m personally more concerned about a fallout 1st nerf.  The anniversary for that is not long after the end of season 1.
---
Lol, I wouldn't have made it even without the snallygaster.
---
&gt; **What rads?** \- +50 rad resist, restore 1 rad per second 
---
I really wish they'd learn that not wanting to take extra rads and not wanting any rads are two separate things.  I love having extra rad resist for my bloodied build so my health stays at just the place I want it for as long as possible before I have to hit a radaway or decon arch even if I get too close to a glowing creature or other source of rads.  But that rad removal just kills this perk for me.
---
Incredible
---
What system are you in?  I can make the serum for you on Xbox no charge.
---
The PTS server is a test server, and as such it's likely everyone has access to everything.
---
Build in existing buildings!
---
I appreciate the offer. On ps4 though. Thank you anyway.
---
Can someone tell me if I have this right? With a Rank 1 Master Infiltrator does that mean all level 0 locks/terminals will be auto unlocked and I will be able to minigame any lock/terminal from lvl1 through to 3 without needing to equip/swap out the normal lockpick/hacking cards?
---
I have an anti armour Gauss minigun and use the stabilized perk so I don't go through that much ammo.
---
Not coming out with patch 21. Jesus, how sick of the game will we be by the time they do come out? 
---
I love 76, but c'mon now.
---

---

---
Survival shortcut chem: https://i.imgur.com/VRTA7xD.png
---
Currently waiting for the lightweight mininuke to regenerate so I can record a clip of it, but I can tell you that it's a grenade and not ammo.
---
The same way you do. If I can't fix it or make it perfect I hide it the best I can. Usually with hundreds of stash crates
---
Wife is jealous af. Wants to know where on the map to find one.
---
Oh good so they added that too. Good to know. Thanks for the info
---
45 and 556 are easy to sell. I guess I am the only one who buys .38. (I have a vampire 90RW fixer ser up for 38 that runs nicely for fun)
---
Grinding my way as well! Just got the beanie, not sure how far that puts me xp wise :)
---
I'm level 185 and 270. Played my 2nd NW match s few days ago and didn't turn off teams. I got 3 kills and was the 3rd person on my team to die. I was quite happy with myself.
---
Just buy another serum
---
Yes and its absolutely bullshit. 
---
Not only did we lose about 5000 atoms, weve also lost the choice to pick our own rewards for months worth of grinding. 
---
I used to look forward to saving up for a bundle. Or picking out a neat atom shop item. 
---
Now we are stuck getting armor skins, lunch boxes, caps, and whatever they decide to reqard us for the season, for hours and hours and hours of grinding. 
---
If theyd have put the equivalent atoms into the grind it woulsnt be so bad but why am i going to play 2x as much to rank up score, to get items i dont want or need and not even get the same atoms as before. 
---
Its just a cash grab now. And i dont begrudge them making money to keep the game afloat, but stop punishing players and taking things away.
---
Nooooo! Get for freee
---
I do. I'm on pc and the worlds feel empty. We need more people, more camps. The world needs to feel alive.
---
When you level up, you can put a point into a different stat than the perk you pick...hit L1 or R1 (on PS4) to switch which perk category you can choose from after you put the point into whatever you're choosing.
---
For example...you are maxed on Strength. Put the point into Perception, hit L1 (or your system's equivalent), and then you can choose a perk from Strength. They don't explain it well, but the perk and special point don't have to be from the same stat. Hope that is makes sense as I feel like I babbled.
---
Up to level 50 you get to choose one SPECIAL point and one perk card, but they do not need to be in the same category. So, you can choose an Agility point for SPECIAL and then choose a perk card from the Strength category.
---
After level 50 you get the option of choosing a new perk card from any category, or moving a SPECIAL point from one category to another.
---
You should be able to get both from the Whitespring but you might have to server hop a bit as they're not always there for some reason.
---
Yeah. I knew that. Still have to hunt for those dots though.
---
Plus I'm getting almost 1600 base damage with my junkies explosive harpoon gun.
---
I see two problems with this, the first is people may misinterpret it to be a “last hit” effect, making the player base really greedy with not letting others hit the enemy. The other is if, say, someone who is at the weight limit tags a Behemoth or something and decides it’s not worth the fight, and runs to safety then proceeds to fast travel to a mob filled place like West Tec far from their camp, and another player wanders into the poked Behemoth and bursts it down, suddenly the original player who poked the behemoth is overencumbered and surrounded by fat super mutants and would need to pop aid or go into the pip boy menu to drop stuff which could possibly get them killed. I too want a feature that makes looting more easy and consistent, but those are the arguments against this style of auto looting in 76.
---
Wife's dropping another nuke in 8 min
---
How many bullets did it take you?
---
I've already noticed a bit of a boost with the 15%! I was a die-hard proponent of tasty squirrel stew, but I've become a true convert of cranberry relish since mutating. :)
---
Buying for ME?  not to sound snotty, but I really don't need anything.  What having that much money helps with in a small way is that I no longer need to use Travel agent which frees up a point.   
---
If you are asking what I would sell the most to reach that 30k the fastest... I dunno.  There doenst' seem to be a pattern to who buys and what sells for me. Ammo is the most for sure though.   I can litereally have a machine stacked with 3\* that sit there for a week, then Sunday hits and the entire machine gets wiped out in a day.   
---
I simply stopped trying to understand "the Market".  What works for one, doesnt' work for another.
---
TIL, thanks my dude.
---
Take a darker screenshot why dont ya
---
This is really really clever. Very cool!
---
Yay I can now get a little bit off the already shit items I’m going to get👍👍👍👍
---
"Survival Syringe"
---
PC player here, and we have too many hacking issues, I wouldn't want to bring those issues to other platforms.
---
Which realistically means there's going to be a lot more XP exploits - people are already using it to get to 100 in season, now they'll be doing it to get to lv1500 so they can have maxed out stats.
---
Hmm my One X never completely shuts down however i get my fair shar of CTDs like anyone on console.
---
oh, ok.
---
Honestly I just join the teams for the xp bump, not at all interested in joining anyone at any location other than a SBQ event. If you're using the emojis I'm not even paying attention, doing my own thing. And if a player decides to come to me for whatever reason while I'm farming kills it bugs the hell out of me.
---
Where did you find the mirelurk king? She wants to look for one.
---
Ammo merchant here, there can be a lot of caps in it, in my experience 5.56 and .45 sells often, .50, 5mm and .308 less but when bought a lot is bought . Then everything else kinda stays there. Recommend 1C per round
---
That’s awesome!! Great job
---
One Gun Army is a culprit. Tormentor I think too. Not sure what else, it'll say on the Perk Cards though!
---
Thanksnman! Updated OP
---
Are they adding +6 locks lol?
---
Ah! I hadn’t seen today’s challenges at that point.
---
Nope, don't want the imbalance between platforms. There are 3rd party applications and crazy glitched items in the PC world that simply don't exist on consoles. I'm on PS4 and it has enough issues all on it's own without trying to blend in the madness that comes from the PC side.
---
All those that use cheats in NW, at least.
---
And here I thought this was going to be another Duchess reference ...
---
I'm with you bro.  That was my favorite bundle so far from the atom shop.  I felt like I got a lot for my atoms with it.
---
The game has crashed in the past, but it has never turned my Xbox off.
---
 Not really because each perk card is a needed point to level up your legendary perks, and each level cost 100 points. If you divert your cards, you’re essentially losing much time to level your perk cards. Keep in mind that even while I’m level 300, I have only enough cards to get, what, around 200 points and thus 2 levels of a legendary perk card. The cost is insane.
---
But I agree with you on the point the legendary perks are quite uninteresting anyway, thus no big deal, I doubt I will waste time with them.
---
You’re a little behind...you should be level 33 by next Tuesday.
---
How far behind am I?
---
Happened to me a couple of times 🤙🏻
---
Maybe 2 levels..not too bad.
---
I only got as far as testing it with a full set of SS (works), missing one piece but the rest matching (doesnt work), and being in matching PA (doesnt work).
---
Didnt get a chance to try mix and matching "light" armour etc. Will try tomorrow if noone else has tried it by then.
---
As long as it's not the hammer guys from foundation!
---
Yeah i completed it incredibly quickly and wondered why. I always run a shotgun.
---
So like 1 day’s worth of daily challenges. I’m still cheesed that my game took so long to update. That’s why I missed day 1.
---
I often dont have weapons either and I am garbage at PVP too. If i have my shit together I do alright playing extreme hide and seek too. Its a little embarrassing though if I get to the end circle without a weapon. I know eventually Im going to die so if need be I can bust the weapon out and make a half arsed attempt at looking like I died heroically. With no weapon I just look silly. I do chuckle though when I see them try and loot my corpse and find nothing there lol Im actually thinking i might try and get the card that has you explode on death for those moments
---
Can't be dropped or traded.
---
Cheers. Those seem to be common amongst the thread. I'll look to increasing my stock!
---
Basically...if you grind hard with the XP, you’ll be just fine.
---
oh it is not a good person. do u need legendaries for scrips? letme know if u play pc version.
---
It was removed when wastelanders came out. Not sure why. Probably as part of the system to advance the new quests without influencing other ayers quests
---
&gt;**Legendary Ability** \- +1/+2/+3/+5 to stat and +1/+2/+3/+5 to available perk slots (one for each SPECIAL)
---
Holy shit.  I was entirely expecting these to be single rank perks and would have been fine with them if they were... but with four ranks for each even if you think every other legendary perk is complete shit you could put all of your focus into these and just optimize the hell out of your build with normal perks.
---
I don’t understand “Legendary Ability” can I get a short explanation?
---
Thank you for all the awesome stuff.  I appreciate the help. 
---
I bailed on the team because it was full, no room for the wife.
---
Never happened to me yet. And i've swapped allies probably several dozen times. 
---
Most expensive thing i gave one of them was the pink asylum which is like 10-12k. Wouldn't have been a big loss if it did vanish.
---
Nah, I sell stuff for pennies.  100 per star if it isn't a really good prefix or god roll type weapon.
---
I've got a J3315 Combat Shotty, but underleveled at 40... I still might try to sell it for some decent caps, but everything else is going for cheap.
---
Yeah, you're right stores do, do that. But if you spend an x amount of money on a certain item, majority of the money doesn't end up disappearing into thin air, a good amount of that money goes directly straight into purchasing more products to buy that they can sell and in a lot of stores you can even do trades with items that have the same value.
---
did they reply i have same isue
---
This happened to me too it drove me nuts and it’s quite a long quest so it’s infuriating. What I did was clear my weapons of all grenades and as soon as she gave me the grenade I used it and that seemed to sort out the problem. Also I picked the toy after that I think and it check pointed
---
Wow
---
Doesn’t int xp boost cap at 25 int?
---
Most people I know would love it.  But not just cross play, cross saves.  I want take my character from Xbox to PC but simply not going to be possible, ever.
---
Nice. Thank you!
---
Man I know this pain.
---
It's only been 11 years and Appalachia never got nuked.  Well, at least until Vault 76 opened.
---
Np
---
Where did your mirelurk king spawn? Wife is very jealous and wants one.
---
Sounds good, thanks man!
---
The legendary perks have their own slots. Unlike normal perks, they cant be freely moved around - once selected they cost 1 coin to unequip.
---
This isnt too much of a hardship (scrap 1 normal spare perk card = 1 coin), but they're much more semi permanent choices rather than frequently changed
---
I made a raider boss for my main character, so my CAMP options are woefully dry. I've managed to squeeze out a decent enough raider camp by setting up in existing structures and using some of the Nuclear Winter furniture, but my bar/raid staging room is uncharacteristically clean and tidy. I want more clutter items, maybe even some pre-decorated shelves if we're never gonna get a mesh improvement over the existing ones.
---
90 per star will generally sell but it might take a while as most people are just trying to get rid of legendary trash and can't because of the 150 limit.  People that aren't full up on legendaries typically don't have caps.
---
Usually I just huck them on the ground where they belong.
---
Game needs a poop animation.
---
Well done, sir!
---
No problem! Enjoy your Atoms back :D
---
I just started grinding it a little a couple days ago. I think I get it once every 1-2 days.
---
Fixer
---
Combat
---
SMG
---
Pipe rifle
---
Are they changing the process too ?!? Or just the perk cards
---
I have more pictures of that ceiling than are normal for anyone.
---
Overseer robot says it's for reconnaissance. I think he just wants to be out of the basement cage he currently calls home.
---
I was happy mine worked halfway through the build 100 defensive structures. Still did the rest though. XD
---
lol this is so dumb but I love it
---
I saw a guy who had his ally wearing a fuzzy outfit. Somehow, some random dude was able to take it off of his ally and run off with it. This was on PS4. Seeing this scared me so my allies aren’t wearing anything valuable
---
Not the greatest improvements but nice to see they listened about the need to switch lock pick and hacker mods constantly but I think I’m gonna go with follow through still. Maybe ammo smith as well.
---
OHHHHH! I know where they are from now! Thank you!
---
These are so much better but why do some of them need to require a matching armor set, just make it so it doesn't work in power armor and bring back the damage reduction perks also for armor.
---
First thought was "holy shit you'd never have to carry food ever again" followed by "Oh, but they're removing mandatory eating and drinking".
---
OOOOOF!
---
Generally I don’t mind it for a quick round or two. There are some things that work really well and it’s far from the worst battle royale mode out there right now. But today is a great example of how the challenges can mess things up: everyone is just camping out at the static safe spawns, making it both nearly impossible to complete the challenge, and really aggravating in terms of gameplay.
---
Gonna try this route. Thanks.
---
I am impressed at what you've accomplished with only the stone knives and bear claws FO76 gives you for building. Now, if you just had a marker showing your own progress...
---
who am I kidding, if you have that much motivation you probably already cleared it
---
I don't think I ever saw a 1 star and very few 2s.  I dunno, maybe they've nerfed it or maybe LUCK or INT is playing a factor?  I have both fairly high.
---
Bows suck in VATS anyway and it's only VATS that is effected by the negative effects....
---
My BE+reload SMG is my baby and the best part is most people sell tons of 10mm ammo
---
I play on PC and since BETA, I see all these amazing CAMPs here and on youtube but I have never ran into a crazy cool CAMP out in the wild, typically small not thought out CAMPS or horrible floating ones. SO many cool builds out there why do I never see them?
---
Care to elaborate?
---
Oh shit, thanks for telling me about this
---
We appreciate people like you for your .38 :)  .38 will sit in machine for long time, then some will buy 1000's at once.   heh, I even sell Arrows and Crossbow bolts which are similar.  They don't sell often, but when they do, they take them all.
---
Just the one shot.
---
Make it into a clothing shop in game with a load screen
---
NW is terrible. By the time I spawn in someone already has a gun and is picking the lock. The round starting before everyone has the chance to spawn in is pretty shitty. I really dislike these challenges.
---
LoL their adding more perks when they cant even get the ones to work right that are already in the game!
---
As an xbox user I ty for this comment
---
Did the others shoot you after you tagged the first guy?
---
I second the motion, OP. Breaks can be very healthy. I tapped out toward the end of last year, completely missed the holiday events. But when I came back for Wastelanders, I was ready for it. Congrats on the new arrival to the fam. Enjoy being a new parent, and don’t feel pressured to make 76 a part time job.
---
Yep these are so much better now! Can't wait for them to be implemented into the game properly outside the PTS.
---
Bone club for you!  And bone club for you!  Everyone gets a bone club!
---
Can't remember who it was at bgs that was interviewed, but they said that they couldnt believe how unpopular pvp was
---
They expected players to just go around and kill each other
---
I think that to a degree, the pvp audience and the fallout audience are very different
---
You can see this by how much they messed with survival and made it more casual, rather than keeping it sweaty
---
23 is fine. I wouldn’t worry unless you are still near the start of the leaderboard.
---
I saw that glitch on where to place your survival tent.  But why do you go in with a Tesla rifle? I have an automatic Tesla that I never use but willing to try if it melts away the enemy.
---
:) 
---
proudly cleaning apalachia with every possible caliber!
---
No. Idk why ppl think that. I'll post proof Tonight
---
You saved me!!!! I played for four hours without finding one. Which was fine. But finished in 45 minutes with this one.
---
What is this "inaccessible" thing? I haven't played NW so far - only did some hiding in bushes to unlock rewards. I also noticed these "inaccessible" safes today, when I tried to do the challenge. Found multiple safes in "Orwell Orchards", but all were shown as "inaccessible". I completed then the daily challenge with the safe on the roof of "Portside Pub" over three short matches.
---
I'll be finished with the first board tomorrow : )  and since the seasons runs for 10 weeks, I don't think it'll be hard for me to complete within next weeks.  That being said MOST people aren't on every day like me, so yeah, to the normal player, it can seem long.  But here in a couple more weeks, I'll be back to having nothing to do, but help others.
---
2(or possibly more) glitches can make it happen. Sometimes enemies will spawn with Stealth Boys in their inventory and use them. Sometimes enemy respawns will get mixed and an enemy will spawn with Assaultron cloaking ability. I've encountered both, and the latter I encountered again just yesterday with a cloaked Colonel Gutsy. Yes, it killed me ;_;
---
Where are you?
---
True, but tbh I haven't worried about the penalties to low hunger/thirst to begin with. It's essentially a free ticket to Well Fed/Well Hydrated benefits every half hour, or every ten minutes if you get max rank. That's not so bad, especially with Rejuvenated. But if you're still carrying around food for its buffs, like Cranberry Relish or Pepperoni Rolls, it's less useful.
---
Ahh thanks 😊 and best of luck!
---
Yea issue fixed itself today... convenient
---
So the rank 1 legendary card (e.g. strength) is exactly like you had an extra S.P.E.C.I.A.L. pt to spend - capped at 15, ups your str stat by 1, lets you equip a normal str perk card.
---
Rank 2 is like having 2 S.P.E.C.I.A.L pts. 
---
Max is rank 4
---
Essentially these allow you to go beyond the normal 49 S.P.E.C.I.A.L pts allocation.
---
That's so bad. I wish Beth support could help you with that but their official response seems to be they can't "refund" score.
---
Oh shit they cost 100 each? I would say that is wayyyyy to high, but I feel like if they made it something like 20 or 50 the perk card scrapping system would still be feasible. Instead of getting 20 perks, get one legendary perk. I would say 20 given the current list, but if they get better then 50 might be appropriate. Definitely not 100
---
Level 30
---
I thought the same, or at least make it changeable with a player interaction/something you could hook up to a switch. I do like that it doesn’t require electricity, like the big sign.
---
I normally always greet people with “good morning” when I first see them, no matter what time of the day it is, so I chose this one sign to place at my diner as an inside joke of sorts. 
---
Oh, wait—
---
Absolutely, otherwise what exactly is the point of Power Armor?
---
I have enjoyed it as well. All I wanted was the star wallpaper and I got that so the rest is just fun. I really like the lunch boxes and would like more of those.
---
Are legendary perks their own category outside of SPECIAL? And can I max out 6 legendary perks? Or a max of 6 ranks equipped at once?
---
Legendary ability looks like the only good one to me🤷🏻‍♂️
---
How many times do you think you’ve done the repeatable?
---
Because there is way too much to fix about NV before it becomes a decent battle Royale. Right now its just super niche and that niche is strictly to fallout 76 players.  Even if it was free i doubt it would get any attention because of how much it does wrong.
---
Youre highly and mostly rewarded for simply staying alive. There is no incentive to fight. The longer you last the more exp you get.
---
This also doesn't give you incentive to stay with the team if theyre not hiding near the end of the circle until end game.
---
They need to fix the third person/first person pov inconsistency. When youre in third person you can heavily peek corners but its better to aim with first person sometimes. However while you can switch between the two sometimes it just doesn't work even when you spam the button.
---
Even though the map loads up sometimes it takes a couple seconds for items to load up in boxes/bags. 
---
Melee is practically useless.
---
did you do anything specific? Or do i also have to send a ticket
---
I can't count, it pops off several times a play session. My Weeklies are finished by day 2 :)  so all I get rest of week is daily and the repeatable 10k exp one.
---
I know and they’ve acknowledged this by saying they won’t touch bloodied and they’re not interested in nerfing. However, some weapons I have an niche builds I use require a huge buff such as berserker
---
Right. It was almost enough for me to not buy the game. When I heard about it before it came out, I was going to pass cuz I thought Id have to fight  players all the time. I want the adventure and the events.
---
Rebuilding yes, but still using existing materials. If were taking realistically (which is a big stretch for this game), things would definitely improve structural wise but not so much cosmetically.  There's not a Lowes or Home Depot nearby with new brand building materials. You could build better quality structures but they would still look like third world shanty towns because we're reusing the materials at hand. All the flashy new stuff in the atom shop really is out of place and unrealistic. 
---
Just sayin...
---
Even with max Ammo Factory, the Gauss Minigun is still impractical. You'd be getting... around 250 ammo per craft which the Gauss can eat up in about... 5 seconds? Sheesh. Maybe we need a whole new ammo type for that weapon.
---
Edit: This was before he made it clear he was talking about a section of the board.
---
Hes doing slightly above average and isn't near completing the pass/board.
---
Pretty much the same here. I get enough shots in to qualify for loot and let the perchers spend all their ammo shooting at the sky. When she does finally land it's time to give her the business.
---
No it just...worked. idk they said to power off PS4 but that's BS
---
I haven't got there yet, just about to jump back on for day 2.
---
It’s pretty easy to find out if you’re interested in knowing. Just add all the dailies and weeklies points that have been available so far. 
---
The rest is how much actual grinding you’ve done.
---
Select Join from the social menu on Fallout. You can do it from the main menu or from the game map
---
Both need to be logged in to fallout
---
These are such a massive improvement. They still need to figure out the perk coin thing, but the perks themselves are a huge improvement.
---
Meteor shield project.  Need to build and maintain Liberty Prime or falling meteors might blow you the hell up randomly.
---
Seriously though, the cap limit is really making caps worthless.
---
That's where I'm at. I've done everything, I just don't know how long I could grind the repeatable to get any higher
---
more recently; but, it goes in waves. the hard crash that makes you think your xb is about to explode... at least the first few times, t'ill you get it. lot's of hours. be well dweller!
---
in patch 21 PTS, there have been a bunch of junk fence and scrap barricade items datamined.
---
commie concrete bunker, a generator made from a plane on a tower, a rain collector, state police PA skin, "junkyard" PA skin, lots of stuff
---
Honestly, they didn’t really get a chance. I just turned around and started pumping 40mm into them, and they all went down in 2 hits at most
---
No problem man, you're welcome
---
This. I pick out the guts before it even hits the ground 😆
---
Yup, they have even made a Support page about it:
---
https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/51269
---
*Please be aware that Bethesda Customer Support is not able to adjust points.*
---
The actual rebalance patch will come this year though, I bet they are going to do it and end up angering 80% of the playerbase.
---
What rads was already shown before though.
---
Thankyou, we did try that :(
---
huh??? Godmode?? what??  Uhhh ok... each board is only like 30 SCORE levels, I'm currently sitting at level 27(1/2) SCORE and will without a doubt finish Blue board tomorrow.     I'm not that high of a level, 165 about.    
---
Don't be so bitter,  I play every day
---
That looks really good. Impressive.
---
Power Armor Reboot is still an absolutely joke. I don't think I'm going out on a limb in saying nobody would bother using it. I think something more practical (and legitimately useful) would be "100% chance to revive on a two minute cooldown" -- yeah I'd use that.
---
Turtle will research while Rifle fanboys out while Juice tries to convince me he actually plays this game. Then Kevduit will make me laugh while Rage makes me smh.
---
and here i am a big ole dummy who just spent most of my script last night making terrible secret service armor!
---
The level up 3 times is for 1000 points.....and it’s a weekly challenge. A level up 1 time is for 250 (a daily challenge). Maybe that’s what you were talking about.
---
First board okay thought you meant the whole pass. Lmao yea youre right that's more realistic but still a slight grind.
---
Never heard anyone call sections of the board a board.  The whole board is the pass.
---
Cranberry Cobbler is really good for low levels because you only need cranberries and wood plus the cranberries are near Vault 76.
---
No point in having a cap sink when the cap is 30k
---
6 perks total, 4 ranks each
---
Crazy good idea. That would be cool as all hell.
---
I bet you’re like me, in that you’re doing the regular challenges and turning off the game. I was like that, but I realized, joining an event or building team and getting well rested/kindred spirit/lovers embrace and doing a few events/just doing all the challenges allows it to go up really quick. You’ll probably get it every 1-2 days. Get those bonuses (I’m not even using any intelligence-boosting items, just the public team and sleeping) and it’ll go up quick. Just do a few quick events and kill some enemies (you’ll be doing those for challenges anyways). Trust me, it’s hard to start doing it, but super easy to get into.
---
There's one that spawns upstairs at the morgantown airport sometimes, so they exist
---
I literally did not know that the Cranberries did that song until it popped up on my Pandora. I was confused because I had only previously heard the cover.😂🌞🌞🌞
---
They mostly come out around Christmas :) EDIT: oh and Scorched Horde events!
---
paypiggies gonna pay pig, and shills will always defend them i guess.
---
Hmm not sure about this story. Team tagging doesn't exist anymore so how you greased four because of one... I dunno
---
So I can max out all 6? And they’re in their own category outside of SPECIAL?
---
Yeah I understand just some of us liked how it was cause we found ways to deal with it, me I use things that with my build can fight against the shit show known as adventure PvP. But I can understand why people got upset when people use a JE laser that can 1shot anyone and take the queen out in 1-2 clips depending on your build and chems. But adventure mode pvp was one of the main reasons why I still played fallout cause I made some cool friends through it but now that they’ve messed with it I’ve lost a lot of them.
---
Thank you so much! I was having luck with the red shack, but wouldn’t have found the others
---
Theyre in their own category.  You can max all 6 ,just in its current state takes a crazy amount of scrapped cards.
---
These are not horrible.
---
The people who play 76 are generally not the pvp crowd. Devs have to eventually learn that not every game is a fit for PvP. Many are also extremely tired of the battle royale shtick
---
They happen, but are rare to find. I imagine most people never see one because they tend to avoid areas with Scorched when farming because they drop crappy loot. If you keep going to places that spawn them, like the Civic Centre or the Glasses Cavern you'll eventually see one. Also if you notice a Scorched horde event it should have a legendary one as a boss.
---
Or 2 runs of riding shotgun will cap you out for the day
---
The above is correct. There is also a repeatable 10,000 xp challenge for 100 points that is a weekly. Helps to meet the end score limit, especially if you focus on increasing xp and int buffs.
---
Good to know. I know I have a ton to scrap haha. Thanks for the info
---
These appear in several places. Hornwright Estates has its own gym with several and then there’s the ones in the silos.
---
Idk, I've only played a half a dozen times and only ever voted once. I open perk screen every time and usually stay in that screen until drop location selection. I have never been forced to vote.
---
Even if that was an insult than at least you outright said it :)
---
Well they did the one where you got put into it by being killed by legacy energy weapons so that’s no longer a way. But people have already found another way of doing it cause they can’t fight without stacking chems.
---
Are you talking about the Uncle Sam solute? That is only supposed to be available to people who bought the tricentennial edition. There was a bug that let people use it but that was patched in patch 20. 
---
Did you actually buy the solute? If you bought it you should still have it..
---
It was part of paid content, which was only accidentally available for free for a short time. The salute was part of the Tricentennial DLC.
---
You’re welcome!
---
Looks fine to me, you probably got a bummy ass phone.
---
A lot better than before, PA could of used another perk but 50% less sprint ap is decent.
---
I’ve never completed that. Timer runs out because I’m cursed to be interrupted by real life every damned time
---
Where is this?
---
Got around 60k to 80k xp on Monday playing for about 3 to 4 hours. So that was 600 to 800 score. It's really not bad if you stack buffs.
---
Well, if you look at it, it's has folds into 3rds and even the squares are seperated and graphics disconnected, First is Blue, 2nd is Orange, 3rd is Green.  each with 33 spots.  So to my and my friends, we call them board 1, 2 &amp; 3 or by their color.
---
You can call it whatever you want, but anyone that isn't in rage mode would easily understand what we and many others refer to.
---
20 players is a mmo? 8 player private servers? It’s just a online fallout and it wants the grind of mmo without the functionality of mmo
---
Nope I spend the whole time doing events because I like them. I join a group as soon as I log in and always go to the high xp events and eat my canned stew.
---
I think this guy can probably stop being downvoted. It was just a lost in translation/weird term. He meant just the different board sections is all, not the whole season. It’s split into 3 visually.
---
Was pretty clear if you read all his comment, even if it took a little deducing and wasn’t the best wording. 
---
He’s going above average for what day we’re on but not by much 😊
---
Good stuff dude!! This is amazing
---
People are already at level 50. You don’t need to do every daily and weekly. Players will he don’t way before it’s over.
---
Also you only need to level up 1 time for 250 score. I don’t know what you are talking about. The 3 level ups is a weekly challenge.
---
I do it to only tag enemies - allows others to get the xp too. I use a TSFFR Automatic Tesla. When I'm expecting it and they aren't it can take a while for them to realize what is happening.
---
Are you SURE you didn’t miss any challenges? If I got 1000 more XP I’d be a level further.
---
Everything in my shop is 20 caps. Maybe the random 3 star for 999. I sell a lot of plans, outfits and med supplies. The only issue I have is I dont get enough traffic at my camp. I enjoy visitors and I like to see what other people build. I see so many 2x2x2 ir people with huge houses and work benches that line the walls leaving a huge open dance floor type space. I wish people were more into the building aspect.
---
I believe this is the trailer in front of Vault 51
---
I never figured that out until lvl 25 lol
---
I also didn’t realize you could pick a card you already have to get  a second one, smh!
---
Ive been saying this (to myself) since launch. Just make it one of the rooms in the Whitespring, or BETTER YET, an instanced interior in the WhiteSpring Shopping Mall Basement (now that we can), make it very unassuming and less in your face and annoying than those vault boy cut outs, and it can just be a place where you and your team could load in to try stuff on with each other.
---
This way we could bring clothing/Atom Shop items we already have, and try on Atom shop items we want to buy WITH our already purchased items, especially in the case where we want to see if theres any clipping.
---
I buy stuff, not all the time, but often enough to keep things fresh and enough at this point to have a weeks worth of outfits if i wanted, lol. I just would love being able to plan out a mismatched outfit BEFORE i buy things, in the case they dont actually look as good as ide imagined or worst case, clip (excessively) with items you already own.
---
The crashed plane on the airport runway also has a safe in the cockpit.
---
same method. u killed urself with explosive energy and someone revives u or u can use perk. I personaly wouldnt even try but saw on utube. actually that is how someones completed legendary run in the first day.
---
I have heard plenty of people have finished the board already. I did some asking around and supposedly there’s another god mode glitch that people are using to level up quick by stacking to finish the board in a day.
---
Why do you say it is “dead”? Matchmaking is instant.
---
I completely agree with Flux but Junk bags are the only penalty for death. It comes with two settings honestly. 
---
So little Junk that you truly shouldn't care about losing it
---
An amount of junk you were not willing to lose, once it reaches this it's on you if you decided to not stash it.
---
I must’ve had the bug, then. I’ve had it since I bought the game back in February, and I only bought the regular version.
---
Cranberry glade
---
If you're not leveling up playing the game and enjoying it, then seasons aren't going to be your thing. People will be saying getting to level 300 is such a grind when legendary perks come out. If you complete every level up challenge that gives you 100 levels, which puts a dent in that 300 that will be needed later. Along with granting numerous cards you'll need to level those perks up.
---
Aren't there already some stair skins?
---
Having ALL of the cards at max level and changing them at a whim would sort of take the “Legendary” out of Legendary Perk Systems.
---
I'm pretty sure the God mode and stacking glitch was supposed to have been fixed in patch 20, don't quote me on that though.
---
Theses are pretty amazing, but I feel like most of us are going to run three special perks with infiltration while equipping hacking/lockpick/ammo as needed or just four special perks. This is still a massive improvement over the old perks though. I would like to see every perk be useful though. I’d also like to see some perks that combine weight perks like the hacking and lock picking have been.
---
I always seem to be at 30k caps. For a few days, after my weekly gold bullion purchase, I am below 30k. So most of the time when I sell something it just goes into the void. Guess I should buy some serums or something.
---
Ammo is mostly what I buy. The odd weapon (LIKE 90% WR Teslas was my last hunt for a decent price). Sometimes see a plan I am missing. I would buy much more if there was an actual economy that allowed people to buy and sell within the game and not have a need to track 5 discords and 3 subreddits,
---
Damn I hoped they change the legendary perks lvl to unlock 
---
Lvl300 is too high of a grind especially since gear caps at lvl50 and lvl sync is being introduce
---
What platform? I would love to visit.
---
No joke, I'm level 150 and I've been using the same +50% limb damage level 15 double barrel since I found it at like level 10. I don't know how it's so good, but it still one shots almost everything and I've yet to find a better shotgun. Even a level 45 BE double barrel isn't as powerful. lmao
---
Try to get someone to invite both of you to the same team.  It might fix your issue.
---
Yeah I knew a person who said they wanted to do that I said don’t cause I think anyone who does do this will possibly get a ban for exploiting. Especially since it hadn’t gotten to the point where you can pay atoms to level up in the pass.
---
Nope not a single one. I've done every daily and I have two weeklies left I think, my nuclear winter completed today a day early. I still have the critical and claiming workshops left. Maybe I'm at 25... The next thing to claim is the ufo?
---
Weren’t they advertised as account wide? Did that change recently? They used to be account wide.
---
PC has mods.
---
It's also generally easier, like the favourite wheel on console is quick keys on PC.
---
So instead of press up&gt;select item&gt;press x they have 1 button press.
---
Doing good. On track.
---
Lmao
---
Great! Thank you!
---
I usually just have my allies naked and wearing prisoner collars. So, I have no idea.
---
For the record, none of the allies have tried removing the collars so far so I am am not too worried about that disappearing.
---
First thing that popped into my mind too lol
---
There are a few in the gym room of Vault-Tec University in Morgantown also. You can ride them but it doesn't have any effect.
---
Sweet, we'll check it out. Thanks again
---
I know the slots are account wide, but are the perks as well? If I set up a level 5 alt with What Rads will I have to swap it out before I log onto my Bloodied main?
---
ill post it later when i get back on but its at like the top right of the map there like a big circle and theres like an abandoned vault
---
I was hoping for a new unmarked vault... oh well
---
&gt;combine weight perks like the hacking and lock picking
---
Yep. Something like Walking Arsenal from Nuclear Winter.
---
yes i think its an unmarked one
---
Just walk around to the right, through the parking lot, through the door of the building. Around the shelves. Take a right.
---
They’re pretty fun to use, the only problem i have is if you’re in a tight space and they sometimes go into walls
---
Ahh olay I didnt think about that. I can however speak on the mods, outside of some QOL they dont change things. Also you cant use mods in nw. I didnt realize we were talking about pvp, nobody does that
---
It seems like you can slot more cards if your special isn't already at 15. Not 100% sure though.
---
I'd love to see Xbox and PS4 crossplay, but definitely not with PC.
---
Can't remember which game it was, but one of the (too many) rpgs that I have played allowed you to enchant items belonging to other players.  It was a pseudo-trade window that let them apply the effect to the item without having to trade it to them (there had been theft problems).  I would be behind either npc's or something like that for players with the materials and requisite perks.  Place caps and the item in the window, and once the repair is made, the caps transfer and the item comes back good as new.
---
So are you a bow build then? How are bows in this game
---
Top right? Yes please post screen shot
---
I like that.
---
Same here:(
---
It’s been posted snout before and there for awhile
---
Ummmmm this is amazing
---
Hopefully next update
---
It's a " magic" weapon the 50 limp with the right prefix is broken and does way more damage than it should I have a handmade that's broken too I mutate sbq in like 40 shots
---
The reason they aren't is the reason I haven't thought about seriously leveling an alt. I'm not doing it again. I haven't even finished getting everything I want on my main ffs.
---
Guess I’ll let the high level gods kill the big sheep boy in that event then
---
Basically zero. I don’t think any bundle exclusives have ever been debundled. Someone can correct me if I am wrong.
---
I believe it is, haven't been over that way myself since before Wastelanders
---
Sounds like a normal Bethesda thing
---
Alright, just haven't seen it in this thread before the plushie and mount look cool not a big fan of the rug, but I didnt like the death claw rug or the megasloth ether so...
---
Never heard of a train car diner?
---
Do they seriously still exist?  Used to see one every month or so but haven't seen a single one since the Xmas event ended.
---
I noticed people were spawning on top of lockpicks - had to race a few people through finishing the pick. The last one we had 4 stealthed from the start people lock picking a single lock
---
got some time on your hands?
---
Do you know where to get a plan for them? I’m guessing they’re sold at vendors
---
Fixer all the way!
---
Yeah I was looking last night in game, but everyone I came across was japanese! Haha.
---
Better QoL for one platform would lead to another platform not being able to keep up at events etc.
---
While there are OP and "Magic" weapons on console, there are also hacked items on PC.
---
I'm just not sure there's a need for cross play really.
---
The level up 3 times is a weekly worth 1500. The ins that happens as a daily is 500. 
---
If you’re going to bitch and moan at least get facts right. Or is it that you haven’t even looked at it?
---
I am rank 35. I haven’t done any mass grinding, nor all of the NW stuff, or I could be legitimately much further. I tend to hop on early afternoon and do my bullion/scrip/faction dailies. Then I’ll do a west tek run in a building team with all int buffs I can muster so I’m hitting nearly 500xp a super mutant. 
---
Then I’ll go to the bog and kill everything there for the XP as well as the brains from scorchbeasts for more int food later to replace what I use. Then I may do Capitol building run or Some events, depends what’s available. 
---
Then I’ll log off and come back after the daily reset, knock them out in like half hour, and do some more wandering and repeat the above then log off.
---
 I play for a few hours a day at most (which is still a lot compared to some, or what some people are actually able to do) but it’s not actually a grind really, or what I consider a grind constitutes, and I’m well ahead of the curve. 
---
You get ten levels worth of free atoms from the board itself you can use to skip the last ten levels theoretically so you’re only needing level 90 technically already.  
---
Add in the upcoming double xp weekend, as well as whatever else is planned or any saved atoms you may wanna splurge to skip, and it’s not gonna be that bad at all, considering it’s a grind marathon and those aren’t generally made for EVERYONE to possibly complete-it’s pretty doable and accessible overall. Better than others I’ve seen in different games.
---
I’d never give up regardless and just play as much as you usually would. If you’d be on anyway it’s really not  a Typical grind as long as you don’t see it as one.
---
Yes (though legendary run still gives 2000 atoms). 
---
However you now have a new source of cosmetics without having to buy them in the atomic shop.
---
It’s good until the glowing moles spot me and instantly kill me with one shotgun blast
---
5000 atoms? Show me the math that shows you would get 7000 atoms in 10 weeks.
---
