ARE YOU DOING SOMETHING EXCITING??
---
---
---
You're taking real world logic and applying it to a online game. Bethesda is not going to ban toxic people because you're upset that they are upset at nothing.  
---

---
You're an old man yelling at a cloud telling it to make rain when it's not gonna make rain because you want it to.
---
Nope. I am gonna use the same logic as those, "does anyone still play this game" morons. For the minority of people that can't seem to help themselves there are plenty that will sub to the game and enjoy things.
---
Honestly that sounds divine.
---
We have some cool songs I guess lol. 
---
"Christmas where the gum trees grow
---
 There is no frost and there is no snow
---
Christmas in Australia's hot 
---
Cold and frosty is what its not 
---
When the bloom of the Jackaranda tree is here Christmas time is near"
---
K I'm about to start a game. I'll post a link after I win this real quick.
---
You want developers to stop working on one DLC to reprogram the WHOLE game to be the same game across platform just because Sony said "Oh, nevermind, we'll sto being asses and let ONE game have cross-platform."
---
Not at all. 
---
Maybe this change in things would make people think twice about being toxic.
---
Can't tell if you're being sarcastic or if those are actual songs
---
No. I said I have a hearing date at the VCAT with a view to being refunded the atoms I purchased based on misleading conduct. That tribunal is on December 2nd, so I couldn't have argued that it was successful
---
It doesn't matter that I didn't play the game that logic should apply to everything. Don't sell me a broken game and promise you'll fix it later.
---
Nah. I am going to be like one of those, "are people still playing this game" morons. I am pretty sure that enough people would sub to counter act the loss.
---
Well stop spamming them then... one per bug is enough - you don't need to report every time it happens
---
I stand corrected yeah you're right lol üëçüèª
---
&gt;As far as I can tell the vocal minority just want to complain. Most people, when they encounter a broken item and move on after replacing it.
---
&gt;Bethesda should simply provide refunds for the product and ban those players that are so dissatisfied yet can't stop coming back to the game.
---
Won't work everytime there's a "controversy" people flock here who don't even play. That's why it's been dying down most of those people have now become bored and no longer troll this sub.
---
Just don't lure legendaries for miles before killing them. They only do this when they're pulled too far away.
---
You're basically saying we should remove people's right to play a game because they are going to use their right to free speech...
---
You seem entitled.
---
Try switching between private servers, since this has been a repeatable thing for my friends.
---
Whatever, blocking you.
---
If you‚Äôre going to server hop in a single location I would suggest Valley Galleria instead. I have faster load times there and you can farm the giant hermit crab if you want. You‚Äôll spawn in on the next to the bus stop, the random encounter spawn is outside of the Red Rocket garage. The hermit crab spawn is on the road toward Harpers Ferry.
---
They did narrow it down to how, apparently when on pc if u minamize ur gamng window then log out is when it happens atleast thats what i read not sure how true imnon ps4
---
Honestly, the only real problem i have with Fallout 1st is the Scrapbox. I complained back at the repair kit and scrap kit because i knew that they would keep pushing the boundary to make more and more usefull stuff locked behind a paywall. And the scrap box is one of the most convenient things in the game. This is exactly what i feared would happen and it did. 
---
Make that free for everyone. Or at the very least a very very very cheap Atom Store item, costing little enough Atoms that it's easily atainable through gameplay. 
---
That would at least make me tolerate Fallout 1st. I would suggest giving some other perks like a little higher XP gain or something, but that ALWAYS leads to the game beeing designed around it and in the end, the boosted way becomes the norm and everyone else just has a disadvantage and that's no fun either. 
---
Either way, the scrap box absolutely needs to get out of Fallout 1st.
---
I took a look at the Armoured Raider thing and damn it looks good but I am hesitant to buy it in case they patch it
---
Not at all. They do have the freedom of speech, but not to ruin things for everyone else. 
---
Not sure how I am entitled considering everyone thinks the game should be free.
---
Reach level 50 then at 51 you will be able to either pick a new card or move a point to another special.
---
Ok, how stupid are you? Thats a genuine question. They wouldn't have to re program the whole game, thinking that is purely asinine. 
---
And no they wouldn't have to stop working on the revival on the game. Thats also a pretty dumb claim, its not like one guy is working on the game. There is a team of many people working on the video game that goes by the name of Fallout 76 and in that team there are many people with a diverse skill set meaning that they are able to work together and split up and work seperatley.
---
Im willing to bet that when they fix a bug you think that everyone in the team is fixing that problem. Stop acting like you know shit, cuz you clearly dont.
---
They wouldn't have to reprogram the game, they literally had to turn off cross play near the end of development because Sony said no. You're either a troll or just really uniformed.
---
Its mostly server side. Consoles are literally just restricted PC's with a dedicated OS (operating system just incase you didnt know) so do you think that since every PC player has different parts in their PC they just cant join together?
---
I have 4 END and usually tank all 3 pylons. It means I can't really fight, but honestly nobody should have an excuse to not take a single pylon

OP said he's been after a refund for a year. The ACCC passed this law against Zenimax after a class action I believe. It just passed yesterday.
---
This suggests that Bethesda was any better before partnering with ZeniMax. No they weren't. This is just the first game that the community can't fix for them because it's online.
---
yes.. thats how it works.. first you assign a point.. then you pick a card..
---
you do not have to pick a card from the same stat you placed the point in
---
r/iamverysmart
---
Hey every other country... Be like the Aussies
---
sorry.. but this is poor advice
---
You can pick the other Special trait, but use the Bumpers on console (idk what it is on pc) to change what perks you are getting from different traits
---
Yes. Choose the strength special as the first step, then Z or C on PC (don't know on consoles, look at the bottom right/left) scroll to the perks you want to choose and pick it up.
---
You dont say dumpster fires 
---
You simply piss on them to put the fire out and let it die
---
I expect there to be changes to the map from the wasteland era video. There better be cities that grow over time ... would be nice
---
Legit have not seen a singple person claim that the game should be free.
---
And guess what, there'll always be people that ruin the fun of a game for everyone. Don't be a snowflake like them, and ignore them.
---
If even just 1 % of the reports are to be believed that's definitely not the only trigger. Various people on various plattforms have reported this problem under various circumstances.
---
Having unlimited crafting storage only if you're a subscriber, is paid game mechanics. 
---
Items in the Atomic can be unlocked with in game currency, so I see as just that, unlocking it. Last I checked you can farm about 500+ a week in game.
---
Having something like a robot that produces junk, or a refrigerator that let's you store perishables longer I don't really think of game breaking.
---
It is more of a fancy factor because this point in the games lifetime, you should know where to get the junk &amp; ingredients you need, these things are literally just fun toys to play with.
---
Putting these kind of things in the Atomic shop gives EVERYONE a chance rather than behind a paywall fire the few.
---
So thats you're only response? You misused an r/, how do you even do that? How dumb can you get?
---
I never claimed to be smart. You couldn't understand simple concepts and acted like you did. You are literally the very definition of that Subreddit and what its about, well besides for claiming to be smart. 
---
I genuinely dont understand how you exist. I thought i was stupid but apparently not. Thanks for the reassurance. 
---
If you are not a troll i have genuinely given up on humanity
---
I don't know how anyone can be supportive after the whole Fallout 76 fiasco. They fucked up and were really shitty about it the entire time they "fixed" things. It was a giant middle finger to the consumer.
---
Xboxers?
---
What platform? You (or whoever else is cool) should feel free to add xa0t1ca (middle o is a zero) if you're on PS4. =\]
---
So Bethesda sold an incomplete, buggy mess for $60? Good job cheating the system, but that's illegal in some places. Sucks to suck.
---
You dont have to hate this game to be toxic. Case in point all that jerks killing the sentry in 2 seconds and firsters being toxic with their superiority complex. You cant escape negativity and toxicity especially when people can hide behind a screen.
---
This is the most toxic community I‚Äôve ever been APART of
---
I'm sorry? I thought we were done? Are you trying to start this up again, because you're unhappy that I've pointed out the fact that you're wasting money and your time? That the more you respond the more it gratifies me. There is no argument here, there is merely my attack on your character which I do not deny because in my first comment I attacked all Fallout First users characters.
---
Exactly why the first point is debatable.  I think we can all agree there's a line *somewhere*, but I don't know exactly to put it.  What I do know is people arguing time spent inherently means people've gotten their value out of the game are missing something and the discussion probably has more to do with how the company's promised product compares to the actual product.  This is the comparison I use for failed/bad-faith live-service games:
---
&gt;The company promises "If you keep eating this burger long enough, it eventually gets delicious! And we'll give you a bunch of delicious sides as you eat!" But that never happens. So you've got people who've finished their buggy rancid burgers trying not to be sick wondering if they just wasted their money, time, and stomach space. And maybe the restaurant start charging for more ketchup when they promised earlier they wouldn't.
---
As is evident from my example, I *don't* think the most important factor is how much burger the customer has eaten but rather whether the company reasonably delivered on the advertised product.  You'll absolutely get people trying to abuse the system--that's people for you.  But I'd argue the current system is just exploitable in a way that favors the companies, who are increasingly expected to overpromise/mislead in order to maximize profits.
---
- I'm not talking about private servers just the simple act of locking content behind a monthly subscription fee. Why does the whole private instance thing matter? The subscription fee isn't solely for the private instances. 
---
- I'm also not talking about just sandbox games, again you're thinking way too small So I'll politely disregard your first paragraph since it's heavily off topic. 
---
- Again not talking at all about the private instances. 
---
- The private instances, atoms and silly emotes aren't the issue you're correct. Although they are all still very overpriced especially considering you only get a private instance not an actual server. 
---
- The only reason they never had unlimited scrap storage before was so it could be paid for. Every single thing the community has asked for has ended up behind a pay gate. 
---
- Bethesda has asked for more money since the game came out what??? Are you not aware the Atom shop exists? And that it's become far more than just cosmetics?? That whole statement is just blatantly false no offence. 
---
- Most people aren't getting the overpriced sub for the private instances (lets stop calling them servers) but the very very big connivence, almost game changing ability to have an infinite scrap storage. Plus the extra Atoms. 
---
- Honestly I am completely floored if you really have put that amount of time into the game. I'm not sure how that's possible but hey good for you then. 
---
- Again, for the last time, the private instances has nothing to do with it. If fallout 1st is a success other "AAA" games WILL add subscriptions. Hence why Fallout 1st is so dangerous and has the potential to ruin lots of video games for everyone.
---
Base cost for 500 Atoms:  ¬£3.99
---
¬£0.007980 per 1 Atom
---
Base cost for 1000 Atoms:  ¬£7.99
---
 ¬£0.007263 per Atom
---
Fallout First (1650 Atoms):  ¬£11.99 (not  ¬£13)
---
 ¬£0.007267 per 1 Atom
---
So, so compared to the 1000+100 bundle, it‚Äôs ‚Äòoverpriced‚Äô by one penny. 
---
Maybe you meant to compare the 4000+1000 bundle to the yearly membership?
---
Base cost for 4000+1000: ¬£31.99
---
 ¬£0.006398 per Atom
---
Fallout First (Full Year; 19,800 Atoms): ¬£99.99
---
¬£0.005050 per Atom. 
---
Looks like it‚Äôs fairly priced to me. 
---
Surely you weren‚Äôt just ignoring the Atoms in the membership and trying to claim that the membership only had the private servers and scrap box and emotes/icons/NCR Armor?
---
If that was all that was in it, yes, it would overpriced. 
---
But that‚Äôs like saying the Dave and Busters Eat &amp; Play combo for $18.99 is overpriced and ignoring completely the $10 game card that‚Äôs included. 
---
I‚Äôd you‚Äôre going to make claims about ‚Äòunfair pricing‚Äô, address the entire package, not just the parts you want to address. 
---
While I support the proposition that a lower priced membership without Atoms should be available, calling the entire package ‚Äòoverpriced‚Äô is ignorant.
---
What about the suicide bush?
---
The second kill in the clip. Only 403 damage because the range drop off. I was using all of the pistol perks with no other buffs. [https://xboxclips.com/ChiIy/cb3e9811-250b-41cd-a102-f93998248665](https://xboxclips.com/ChiIy/cb3e9811-250b-41cd-a102-f93998248665)
---
Start then triangle, thx me later. Quick photomode shortcut
---
WTF did I just Google?
---
- That's not an option. As long as enough people support fallout 1st that it becomes a success then everyone will be seeing it in other "AAA" games going forward. So "just dont buy it" isn't an option when there's enough poor fools who do. And unfortunately they then ruin it for everyone. 
---
I really wish it was as simple as just don't buy it lol but sadly it's really not. Fallout 1st is truly scary.
---
It's never the same, and I can't recreate on purpose. Sometimes it's events, sometimes it's quests, sometimes it's quest markers. I figure if they have enough information, they might figure out.
---
&gt; Consumers will always take advantage if systems available to them.
---
It's both weird and funny that you think that's a bad thing.  
---
  
---
&gt; If you make getting refunds easy online, then you're just  
---
If you make getting refunds impossible then you're just incentivizing shitty development.
---
Imagine how fucked gaming is, when so many gamers downvote comments about laws that protect them and their rights. How far up a gaming company's ass to you really need to be?
---
Light wood laminate
---
By the way just used this new updated x1 your so proud of and you will never guess, I crashed
---
 you and your insults. Im sure you calling me names wins this argument.  Go find someone else to attack who has made a complaint about this  broken game that just works. Im sure you can win that one to. See ya
---
You can clip dump it with an op handmade. FFR does damage faster than it can regenerate. On my plays, I‚Äôve just tried to get in two shots to tag it, but people are standing all around it because they know where it will spawn. It‚Äôs only a one star weapon... people need to chill and pay attention to all of the other bots that spawn at the same time.
---
 \&gt;  Shelling out for the Tricentennial Version and seeing the game half price in a month was a kick in the nuts.   
---
Amen to that.
---
Why are your feeling so hurt by what other people say? 
---
Why don't you just not read these forums if you are so easily triggered?
---
If the game was so great and successful, why are they now charging for a subscription, why not do that from the begining?
---
You keep saying things that are your opinion and have zero facts to back them up. Your opinions about things mean as much to others as their opinions mean to you-which looks to be not much
---
You mad that your last post got removed? Seems like you cought a case of the feels
---
Wow. When you say 900 with "all the buffs" what are they
---
Isn't it the "Pumpkin Rack"? since the others are named something with full or empty. Thats really the only one I want, since it can be used outside of Halloween. Figures !
---
Its actually coming from the small rotunda gazebo next to the bus, right next to the tennis courts. It's coming from the statue on top of the gazebo. Has nothing to do with the eyebot. 
---
It.also gives you a partial.message
---
Sure jan. I'm sure you just went and bought an Xbox One X JUST for Fallout 76 lmao. You're sad dude. Honestly.
---
It won't get any better. It seems enough people are buying this stuff. Good for everyone that's enjoying the game and giving them money that encourages them to continue down this road I guess.
---
There is a Pumpkin Rack plan available.
---
**World of Warcraft**
---
Base game has a cost. 
---
Expansions have a cost. 
---
Monthly play time has a cost.
---
If I play WoW for three months, and decide I don't like it anymore, and try to get a refund, should I receive a refund? 
---
People will use the system maliciously. This is why steam limits refunds to play time. Would it be reasonable for Fallot 76 to do the same?
---
Pretty sure they know how but just didn't
---
Yeah but it works and you get a lot more content than you do with this
---
It‚Äôs actually the lowest cost per Atom with the year membership and almost identical to the $10 package.
---
Thank you!
---
Never gonna happen unfortunately. The problems with Bethesda come from the top at Zenimax Media, and guess who's brother sits on the Zenimax board of directors representing their family's holdings?
---
Or maybe, just maybe because they weren't able to implement the instancing technology, which should have already be here since the Burrows update.
---
I take it that you‚Äôve never bought Atoms, is that correct?
---
On PC. BlackIceBear
---
&gt;Buyer's remorse should not be a valid reason for a refund.
---
What about fraud?
---
FO76 devs said all non-cosmetic content would be free. That's a promise of future product to be delivered to the player.
---
Then they come out with Fallout First which breaks that promise. Shouldn't they be forced to refund a product when they sold it by making fraudulent claims?
---
you would have to pay for that . if you play adventure mode the only way to get a server all by yourself is to wait out everyone else on the server you start on. takes a looong time and the server will most likely shut down before you get it empty.
---
I know, If I got 3000 atoms a month for a year for $100 I‚Äôd be onboard.
---
Part 2 and 3 can be completed just by trick or treating. Free candy and mines. ^_^
---
No play the game
---
Why do people feel the need to post this? Like this means anthing to anyone, not trying to be rude just saying ur in the minority.  But yeah lets see the video of u deleting ur account. We will wait
---
Cowboy Perk, Energy Bobblehead and guns and bullet 7. 
---
Crackshot gives you range. That shot might not have killed without it.
---
 Modern Renegade gives great hipfire accuracy. I'd say about 50% of my kills with pistols are close range hipfire shots.
---
Gun Runner for increased run and walking speed. This perk is crucial imo unless you can't play without frog legs. Goes well with Modern Renegade for close range fights.
---
The pricing of the individual Atomic Shop items is a separate point. 
---
Ten burgers for $45 is a better value than one burger for $5; that‚Äôs simple math. 
---
Whether or not the individual burger is actually worth $5 to you in the first place is a matter of opinion.
---
People do not hear your radio
---
I wish this was available in the US
---
fasnacht all over again
---
It kinda sucks in my opinion
---
Thank you very much. I appreciate it! Glad you are enjoying them!
---
True, I think it would have been nice if the subs at least got 2000 but yea they could just save up I suppose.
---
you insults belie your age. I have 2 xbox1s, an older one that is my main, and one that isnt quite a year old. Is it truly to hard to understand that someone may have more than one? I actually have access to 5 in this house.  Grow up, stop responding with insults and use your brain. You dont have to defend this game so bad that you have to insult folks.
---
I wonder how bad he feels that his nikes were probably made in a sweatshop by some poor kid? if he is that tore up over a video game I bet he doesnt even wear shoes!
---
Sniper rifles can one hit.
---
I know! It's really awesome how it's brought some positive tourism to the state. At the Mothman Museum, they had Appalachia Radio playing on the outside speakers on the street! It was really cool.

Thanks for the info thought it was only pc, i have played on private since the start and yet to lose any scrap, actually started taking pic of my scrap inventory before logging out so if i do lose it i have proof as to what i had to show bethesda and hope they can give it back to me or compensate me some other way. Last time i had an issue they gave me atoms.
---
Trying to use the excuse that a single player game in which you can literally hit the tilde key and give yourself god mode is 'pay 2 win' because of pre-order bonuses is fucking dumb. 
---
Fallout 76 is a multiplayer game in which pvp exists. 
---
Period. 
---
Get rekt.
---
Does bloody mess add damage in nw?
---
I'm not even trying to defend the game bud. I'm actually just saying that the old Xbox OS doesn't handle new games lmao.
---
Saw some Radstags, but sadly no Brahmin.
---
Yes 15% to all weapons.
---
Yep its pretty ridiculous and ppl wonder why we get mad they paying for the sub. It because the game has never worked properly and you're giving them more money anyway.
---
I may of gotten ebgames to refund me but I'll still make Bethesda do it too seems a fitting punishment for this ruining of fallout
---
o/
---
There is a lot of hacking on pc but what op is describing can happen without hacks.
---
First Hunters a goddamned superheroes.
---
Keep crying, keep dying.
---
Separate point. 
---
It‚Äôs an AAA game that has base cost, DLC cost (unless Wastelanders ends up having a fee, then that‚Äôs a point in FO76‚Äôs favor) and monthly fees (that are not optional in WoW). 
---
If you‚Äôre going to debate the value of the membership, that has to be done based upon the contents of the membership itself. 
---
Is WoW a better game than FO76?  Even as a 20+ year fan of Fallout, I say yes. 
---
But that‚Äôs not the point. 
---
How do the contents of the Fallout First membership stack up against the contents of the other Atom bundles?  They equal and exceed them. 
---
That‚Äôs not open for debate. It‚Äôs proven mathematically. You get more Atoms per dollar with the year membership than any other permanently available bundle. More than even the con bundles, actually.
---
Die in a hole shit head
---
Play outer worlds
---
Good for you Karen üëç
---
Even that can be debatable, though, and depends on context.  
---
* If they ate half the meal but were saving the best part (let's say the steak) for last...and realized the steak was truly god-awful, the salad and potatoes they consumed don't invalidate their complaints.
---
* If the gentleman had earlier asked the waiter if they were sure this was the right meal, that changes things.  And if they were too polite to speak up, that *might* change things.
---
* If there's something downright defective about of the meal (dangerous, inedible, unsanitary, allergies), then that definitely changes things regardless of how much they've eaten or if it's just the second half that's problematic.  Same if the waiter walks up and just dumps a bottle of hot sauce on that second half, changing the meal as the customer eats it.
---
* If they ordered a 12-course meal and the first 6 courses are right the second 6 are fucked/gone, that also changes things.
---
* If the company made promises about the meal (let's say refill policy) and changed their minds, what's important isn't how much of it he's eaten.  What's important is that the customer got screwed.
---
I appreciated the postü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Aside from zone one you literally just farm candy bowl candy.
---
Imagine being such a spineless sycophantic cuck, that you think its perfectly ok for a company to charge full price for a half baked mess of a game and treat paying customers like long term beta testers. Do you work for the Zenimax board of directors? If so, do you lick their assholes after you're done licking their boots? And do you get payed extra for licking their assholes, or is that just something you do for fun?
---
You know why you are getting downvoted? Because responsible adults don't use something, get hours and hours of enjoyment out of it, then try to steal their money back. If everyone did this, we would never have great games like this ever developed.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
People have no ethics anymore. Maybe you didn't play much due to some sort of technical issue, I don't know, because you don't say.  But everyone that upvotes you will only do so because of the COMPLETELY OPTIONAL subscription they've introduced, which makes no sense whatsoever.
---
So again, maybe this isn't you, but there are tons of shtheads trying to get refunds after playing the game for 100+ hours and those people can get fk'd, because they make the world a worse place all for what is a pathetic amount of money. They are leeches, and do not deserve share air with me.
---
It isn't just about this game, it's about all people who do this sort of thing, scheme, scam, etcc. It's all the same. Whether you like a game but jump on the opportunity to steal your money back or buy a PS4 from walmart then return it with rocks inside the box (actually happened), only scum do these things.
---
So mostly this is directed at the upvoters, who are just so mad over a completely optional sub that after hundreds of hours of enjoyment, bought at a fraction of what other games provide on a dollar/hour basis, that they are somehow owed something. I fking hate them all. You literally ruin everything and are why this world has gone to shit.
---
&gt;:^( just keep grinding you'll get it
---
you have worked awful hard in this thread to say that yet I juts crashed with new one, so really doesnt add up. lets agree to disagree and move on,
---
The problem here seems to be that you're using a different definition of "pay to win."  The definition r/Wark_Kweh seems to be using, and that I found on Wikipedia, is "[a game is considered pay-to-win when a player can gain any gameplay advantage over his non-paying peers.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-to-play#Pay-to-win)" For whatever reason, you seem to think it can only apply to games in which there's a direct competition between two players.
---
Would you also say that any of the mobile games that you can pay to skip timers aren't pay to win because not having to wait is just a "quality of life" service, and not pay to win?
---
Are XP boosters in Assassin's Creed or Call of Duty pay to win mechanics? 
---
What about the entire store in Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, where you can spend real money to get in game currency or even praxis kits (basically skill points)?  
---
Just because it's a single player or cooperative game doesn't mean there can't be pay to win mechanics.
---
Was it a One X, or a One S?
---
I‚Äôm still not understanding how you figure any other games outside of sandbox games will benefit from ‚Äúpayed instances‚Äù. Maybe that‚Äôs the core of the issue; I‚Äôm not understanding what the issue is. 
---
Regarding the Atom shop... I haven‚Äôt found a single item I‚Äôve needed to buy that has changed gameplay in any capacity. I have 5 characters, the lowest being level 98, and I‚Äôve never really used my refrigerator for anything but having a fridge in my kitchen for my bases where applicable. Sure 700 Atoms was steep, but I‚Äôve consistently been able to farm challenges to get the Atoms before most things have left the shop when I‚Äôve been interested. If you‚Äôre talking repair kits, I have yet to buy one directly, and same with scrap kits. I do enough pvp that I‚Äôm hemorrhaging repair kits, but I usually run SBQ a few times to replenish my stock. The scrap kits were never practical since stash space was always so limited, and even now I don‚Äôt think those send junk to the scrap box (not that I intend to buy any to find out). 
---
If they added a way to remove condition bars from weapons and armor behind a pay wall, I‚Äôd be calling for blood like the rest of the lot because that‚Äôs a real advantage in every aspect of the game. Maybe Bethesda will do it, and I‚Äôll end up pissed off I spent 1400 hours in a game no better than most of the garbage mobile games these days.
---
That was me. You're whalecum

Damn oof
---
well seeing how there's literally lawsuits against Bethesda due to them denying refunds it would probably be a good idea lol
---
Is that really a thing?? I shut off the radio long ago due to repeats. I just figured the music was unrelated to the actual gameplay.  Interesting if true.
---
With much power comes much responsibility
---
&gt; No details regarding why you wanted a refund
---
how much time do you have ?
---
Hate the posts of people announcing their leave, but yours I respect because you actually appear to be done. Can respect that. Sad to see you go, have a good one!
---
Generally these annoy me a lot- this one is funny so I can accept it with grace
---
They wouldn't release ANYTHING on the scale of fallout games because it would be impossible to do without f'ups like this on occasion. Yeah, thanks for helping bring about that kind of world.
---
No, troubleshooter's on weapons increases damage dealt to robots.
---
When that prefix is on armor, it reduces damage done by Robots by 15%.  So if you are wearing a full suit, that's a total of 75% reduced damage from robots.
---
Now, not sure if that 75% DR will apply to the pylon damage.
---
X 1 S
---
So annoying when you are spawned in to a Nuke Zone,that you never asked for.
---
Happened to me last night.
---
Launched a Nuke and headed to the SBQ Fight,carefully choosing to Spawn near by.
---
Instead i get spawned right in to the middle of my own Nuke.
---
Frantically trying to get in to power Armour,"DEAD".
---
Then i respawn in full powr Armour where i should have spawned to start with.
---
I love beth- I really do. They brought fallout back and to a whole new generation. But to say it‚Äôs going to be bug free- oh boy. You know it won‚Äôt be
---
He‚Äôs trying to make a point to Bethesda to fix their shitty game
---
I am guilty of intentionally sounding superior as a firster just to piss off an anti firster lol. I shouldn't I really shouldnt but some random nerd on the internet hating me because I spent 13 dollars on a product I like and enjoy brings out my toxic side. its like man go find a real cause to get behind like maybe starving kids or endangered buttfish or something.
---
I have. It's one of my favorite games. I didn't cling onto it for 400 hours until I became a deranged basement dweller ready to rage at a completely optional subscription though. Just a hundred or so hours.
---
If I were a game publisher, I'd stop selling in Austraila altogether.
---
nah they would lose about 10% of their player base.
---
That's closed minded and absolutely false. As someone who does not play Fallout 76, I am very happy for the 1st Hunters. Because yes, that IS an acceptable way to play the game. You're allowed to attack whoever you want, yet you're getting mad because people just happen to want to attack you? 
---
The thing is, you DO affect all the other people who did NOT buy the subscription. Even I who don't play the game is affected, and you likely would ask, how? It's simple. Because I just like many other want Bethesda to go back to making good QUALITY games. Bugs are no problem if every other area of the game is amazing, like they used to be. But why would Bethesda EVER go back to making QUALITY when they can sh\*t out the laziest nothing content like the Fallout 1st Subscription, and ignorant people will pay $100 a year happily? Why would they ever go back to actually doing work and using effort when their laziest scams generate a significant revenue? That's the thing, they WON'T go back to making quality. So you ARE affecting every single person who wants Bethesda to make QUALITY again. 
---
Thank you to the Fallout 1st Hunters!
---
 I up voted. they should re-brand as bethesduh.
---
He knows it was not acquired the right way.
---
Doubt again McSalty üòÇ
---
because he genuinely likes the game and says something sensible?
---
sdfsfdsad
---
sounds like good content to put behind fallout 3rd
---
This dude harassed me this morning. This sub has some weird people that will screw with anyone who doesn't think this game is the best. They want no complaints and everyone who does should leave here. Then the mods put me on a 10 minute between posts limit.
---
Lol
---
That made me lol
---
everyone who wanted a refund within the first 30 days of release, sure.  But if you stuck around after that, or bought it after that, you knew what you were getting/keeping, and probably got more playtime out of it than most AAA games.
---
"Just here to tell you I don't like the thing you like, everyone shower me with attention"
---
Thank you to your mom for never teaching you right!!
---
not true,..I pre-ordered a digital copy on amazon.... and Amzon gave me a refund when I called and complained about the game at launch. Granted, they only gave me the refund because I am a huge amazon customer with a long long history of large and small purchases.
---
Face payed 80 two weeks later 40 to 20!!! Some places were just giving it away with a sony Controller smack to the face imo opinion
---
LOL ha ha
---
ok down vote for anther copy paste trash post. you work for rockstar or EA ?
---
Cheat?
---
Thank you to your mom for teaching you wrong!
---
The one S is only a moderate upgrade. The X is the best
---
that is actually brilliant good idea mate.
---
Thank you to your mom for never teaching you right!
---
I would loveee to be able to display my sets of armor &amp; pa.
---
Im interested only if its covered in mold
---
Very little has been added or corrected as far as in-game bugs or inconsistencies are concerned. Most of the progress made has been to address server stability. Whenever they make progress, they add new content designed to push the envelope to see how the rig holds up. V94 has a ridiculous amount of flora and particle effects because they want to "break it early".
---
Most of this content is half baked because it is supposed to prep the game for serious content drops.
---
lol I felt the panic
---
My end game is to get a refund you can play the game as much as you want and throw more money at a company misleading customers.
---
As a normal person I'm not going to support micro transactions in any form. I have been effected by a company making the micro transactions more essential by causing faster weapon degradation.
---
Disagree all you want I don't care, it's my purchase and my money.
---
So can I refund my power armor edition
---
Probably Damn near impossible to delete an account in full with out having to deal with the nightmare support side of BGS. You people find strange pleasure of harassing someone who doesn't agree with everything you do. Nice gesture to give his stuff away, why can't you just leave it at that? Nope, you turn it into something for yourselves...
---
Oh ok, darn, least I can keep enjoying :D
---
Yeeaaaahhhh you definitely don‚Äôt get invited to parties
---
Oh God, I know. Even reading it back to myself after I posted it, it was a weird moment. XD.
---
"Someone mistakenly ate you. Get over it.. I. God, without context, that is possibly the strangest thing I have ever written."
---
It would be pretty cool, it's like adding a soundtrack to events or something lol
---
The court-enforced ruling wasn't anything about fraud. It was that the game was buggy and servers were unstable for a while around launch.
---
"problems with the servers, lagging, graphic and visual problems"
---
from the media release. Personally, I didn't encounter any game-breaking glitches when I played, but I know some people did. I could see how they would have a case for a refund if it was game-breaking, and not fixed after a period of time. (Australian consumer rights gives the company a period to repair the product as well.)
---
OH I came here to offer a suggestion that could help in the meantime in case you dont know. 
---
if you go into inventory and inspect a peice the option to rename it appears. you can use it to organize sets of armors and weapons. 
---
ie my spare power armor sets  are
---
 zzproto
---
zzultra
---
zz51b
---
zzt60
---
etc 
---
by having zz in front of the name they go to the bottom of my inventory and make selling and sorting other armor easier. yoou can easily adapt that to sorting regular armor into easily grouped sets. 
---
wwa1
---
wwa2
---
wwa3 
---
etc could be your west tech armor. 
---
its just a thought may help may not.
---
We both already used that empty, baseless claim, so how about some actual discussion? I mean no offense to you, I told you exactly how your purchase does affect others, and you don't seem to have any arguments on that so it must mean you agree with me. 
---
I have no problem with people spending money the way they want to, yet I also have no problem with people playing a game the way they want to if it's not cheating, and this is by no means cheating or breaking the game in any way. The problem is, you affected others by purchasing crap enabling Bethesda to sell more crap when some people actually wanted the stuff you paid for to be added in FREE, and that MIGHT have happened if no one bought the subscription. People like you are the reason no one will likely ever get free private worlds or unlimited scrap boxes. I still have no problem with you, again, you can do what you like, just as the angry Fallout 76 players can do what they like as long as it's not cheating or breaking the game. 
---
Have any actual arguments? Or just going to pretend you're on the moral high ground again even though you're not?
---
Thank you for your mom never teaching you right! Lol
---
Pretty sure it's a form of damage control

I crash if I die so I can't grind it, unfortunately
---
There is only 1 of those here, will try it
---
This is the best retex they've come up with. This game needs more Hazard Tape!
---
Farewell! But out of curiosity will you be coming back for wastelanders?
---
I wanna try this on PC now
---
Sometimes if you really love something you have to let it go.......wait what?
---
Lmfao yup, you're sure showing us what an idiot looks like
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt think Chronicle Collectibles is going to be allowed to make any future Fallout Merch for that very reason.. But there‚Äôs still PopInABox and TheWandCompany
---
Bare in mind its only scrap that has unlimited storage and the private server is capped at 8 people, not even half of a public servers cap. May or may not have something to do with it being possible in private servers.
---
True.
---
In France Steam lost a lawsuit because when someone buys a game, that person can't re-sell it later, which is apparently illegal.
---
Okay, so you agree with me xD At least you understand you have no arguments, so thank you for accepting Fallout 1st Hunters as Moral! Maybe you'll even become one too:) You can still be a Fallout 1st Hunter even if you are one of the ignorant people who paid for the subscription, don't let that stop you from moral actions;) 
---
PS. Thank you for your mom never teaching you right! lol
---
Why would you want the ranger outfit....it looks disgusting XD
---
That‚Äôs not how capitalism works. You make good products to start with or you don‚Äôt deserve to stay in business.
---
I like this, thank you
---
Dumb shit...
---
Cuddle her harder and she'll understand.
---
We need this in the US.
---
Fantastic game. Just upsetting it‚Äôs exactly like F3 ending wise ü•± Hopefully DLC‚Äôs will save it like they did F3
---
i might come back if these changes were put in.. honestly though  since I am a trapper, the unlimited stash kind of makes it pointless for me.
---
0
---
I'm just here to help, I didn't start the shit slinging haha
---
Thank you for your mom never teaching you right!lol
---
You're tripping over something that doesn't affect you. Bottom line is your just jealous you don't have one or you wouldn't have wasted your time posting about this any way. It's funny to me that this is what bothers you when there are so many other 'real' problems going on with the game at the moment, but hey whatever bucko
---
You're assuming. I was simply stating a fact.
---
I have a bridge to sell you
---
Run it solo on a private world.
---
Still waiting for the bloodied ss +1 str meat hook =(
---
What merit are you talking about?
---
What would be wrong with letting you pick the perks out of the deck but only giving you 50......ever. That way you can truly roleplay.  I'm at level 200 or so and I can do pretty much anything. Craft all guns, explosives, armor, food, chems, etc, etc. 
---
This opens up new avenues for players and a reason to level multiple characters if you want. The legendary perk system should give boosts to specialized characters.  
---
-armor craftsman- able to craft highest tier armor or add legendary effects for example. 
---
-weapon craftsman- able to craft highest tier weapons.
---
-master chef-createst the most complex and beneficial food items.
---
-master thief-access to the highest level hacking and lockpicking skills.
---
You could go on and on.  Basically this makes each character type viable in their own way.  It also changes the way we play FO76. 
---
Add some faction stuff into the game and give each faction role specific bonuses and attributes.
---
The most frustrating thing is this game has so much potential!!! Bethesda please listen to your players!!
---
they lost me
---
Pretty unlikely tbh. 100% not on ps4 as I‚Äôm not going to be paying for PlayStation plus anymore but I also have it on pc so if anything I‚Äôll give it a shot there.
---
I picked the cabin furthest from the one they spawn in, so they've not bothered me yet, and nah, I'm on pc lol
---
this fall
---
the story of a generation
---
comes to an end
---
Judging by the number of scrap boxes on show at camps, I‚Äôd say not.
---
Affected*
---
That was deep
---
Like my fall
---
This FO76 Sub has lost users. I can't stand seeing most of its feed now.
---
I know right? Isn't it awesome the community is actually doing something good for the Fallout franchise? And only Fallout F\*ck you 1st slaves seem to think it's a "bad" thing happening.
---
Meme would have been 10/10 if that was a functional link.
---
Then im out
---
Amazon gave you the refund tho. Not bathesda.
---
Do you still have a plan to sell?
---
Someone has the sads
---
you mean most people have the scrap boxes or most don't?    Because if most of the camps you see have the new boxes, that would indicate that they lost the people who didn't want to subscribe for a game play advantage.
---
ironically my adventure is just beginning lol
---
LOL  don't have time to make a page with 1000  Duh statements lol....feel free to collaborate with me and make the page yourself!
---
Its a business Duh. Business make money DUH
---
Lol I am most certainly not jealous. All I said is it is bold to walk around with stolen merchandise.
---
I'm gonna be busy playing outer worlds  I just read and post on this sub as therapy to the bitterness bethesduh has filled my soul with
---
Happy trails!!
---
There are several subs that serve this community.
---
/r/fo76FilthyCasuals is one of my favorites, but they are actively pruning that sub of any anti-Bethesda posts.
---
Zzzzz
---
I'm a bit late to the party here, but from a database viewpoint unlimited resource storage might be less strain than larger stash space. A larger stash would get filled with who knows what, all those items need their own database entry. The new scrap chest just needs one entry for each scrap item type and a quantity assigned to it.
---
Still might be a decent hit to the item storage database if a bunch of players suddenly have a few hundred lbs of extra storage in their stash though:P
---
Personally I would like to see them add the new scrap storage for everybody then make your storage limit 1000 lbs and make both of them shared by all characters on your account. 1k lbs can hold a nice amount of weapons and armor for your alts, and having access to your scrap on any character would be nice.
---
There are some straight up suspect accounts in this sub. Would not be shocked if they were workers for Bethesda. No one is this emotionally invested in positive press for this steaming pile that is what this game has turned into, unless they are making money from it.
---
Not once. I finished the main ‚Äúquest‚Äù or whatever that was and played some nuclear winter when that came out and haven‚Äôt really played since. But I will try Wastelanders lol
---
We downed a 3* and I went up to it and saw an unyielding marine armor part then it suddenly disappeared. Thanks Beth lol
---
but i like playing by muhself lol
---
Well bye then. Hope whatever game you move to.
---
The membership purchase numbers are actually higher than Bethesda predicted. I think you‚Äôd just be wasting your time. 
---
I get that you don‚Äôt like it. But many people do. 
---
Perhaps it‚Äôs best that we simply respect each other‚Äôs viewpoints and allow the others to form their own unbiased opinions.
---
They let doofuses start the event the moment it pops up, if there was a countdown timer after the event icon popped before you could start it would probably help a lot.
---
Again your opinion. Do you even play fallout 76?
---
I won the logical debate yet you persisted and started grasping for straws my dude.
---
Cool story bro
---
pretty sure they promised not to release anything but cosmetics in the atom shop. they definitely said there would be no p2w items. repair kits, stash kits, endless stash, all offer competitive advantage
---
who is fus ro and where should he go?
---
I m in whitespring killing the legendaries. How far can that be
---
Yep! The solution is do nothing. Every one should just stand still and do nothing.
---
The F1st membership numbers are actually higher than Bethesda predicted. That suggests that overall, the playerbase hasn‚Äôt significantly decreased. 
---
I‚Äôve seen an average of about 2-3 players per server either wearing the NCR Armor or using the icon/emotes.
---
Seriously the highlight of your day was review bombing a game. 
---
It's sad and pathetic that you feel the need to brag about this.
---
You can only get it from Rose after her quest Signal Strength but you need to be lvl 25+ or she will only drop light and sturdy Raider plans. So yes it‚Äôs kind of a pain to find
---
They're under floor decor
---
What did he say?
---
Wheres the P2W? We lived before they were out. They give no competitive adventage. Things change, they may if been pressured to release that shit from there parent company. We judge before we know what really go on
---
Do you have a source for this? I want to send it to a few people I know who thing Beth made a huge mistake.
---
I hated arena nets handling of wvw and quit the game a couple years back. I put up one quit post and why I was quitting so  the game company and comunity at least knew why the commander who had put in 7k hours just stopped logging in. I haven't been back to that forum since. what kind of loser hangs around on a games forum when they don't even play it any more? you dont have time to make a page with 1000 duh statements. you shouldnt have time to be here. unless your other games suck and you just miss fallout 76 so much you cant let go.
---
Put a bomb in their headquarters. That should do the trick
---
Hey that‚Äôs what I did, I‚Äôm really glad you can actually enjoy it but understand other people leaving too. I solo‚Äôed the entire way, explores every location on map, got a full bloodied build (handmade &amp; hunting rifle) and just have nothing left to do. But there‚Äôs enough to last you for a while
---
Omg thank you!!
---
Yes, i have. I dare say even skyrim had better outfit detail than the ranger outfit. Also its sad when modders who dont get paid can make better designed costumes than the actual company which was proven in skyrim, fallout3, fallout nv, and fallout 4. Hell, modders even fixed all the games i just listed when bethesda couldnt/wouldnt.....that moment a good company goes down the EA path cant wait to see them screw up Elder Scrolls 6 and starfield lol
---
The radio is synced so if other players have the radio on they will hear the same songs just they won‚Äôt hear your pip boy playing it
---
This is like an abusive relationship. They continue to beat you up and smack you around yet every night you‚Äôre up waiting for another beating. If they treat you so poorly, why do you stay?
---
Oooh ok, makes sense.
---
Oh yea, let me check what I am paying for my Destiny 2 and counter strike and team fortress 2 subscriptions. You fucking idiot.
---
It‚Äôs not related, I don‚Äôt know where he gets that.
---
I know of 20+ people who have bought the game because of Fallout 1st.
---
Fallout 76 is not an MMO, there are like 25 people on a server. MMO is massively multiplayer.
---
 
---
Are y‚Äôall serious Bethesda?!!!! I have been a longtime fan up until this Fallout 1st BS. 
---
Y‚Äôall want to make loyal fallout fans who are still playing the game hoping it will become great as we thought it would, and you want to CHARGE US MORE MONEY FOR CONTENT THAT SHOULD HAVE ALREADY BEEN A PART OF THE GAME?!!! 
---
In the old days games use to make their money at launch and by selling games... Nowadays y‚Äôall screw loyal fans with tons of Micro transactions that would require us to play more than what most ‚Äúworking‚Äù people can afford to, now y‚Äôall want to go and charge more money for things that should have already been a part of the game in this update? 
---
Your trying to destroy fallout huh? GREEDY BASTARDS, Seriously! And you don‚Äôt listen to half of the great ideas that would literally make this game greater than ever...? 
---
Y‚Äôall don‚Äôt deserve my hard earned money. IM DONE. 
---
Loyal Fans put tons of money in your pockets and this is how you repay us? A damn knife in the back...
---
See all that is your opinion. If I like the costume why would you care if I want it lol . It‚Äôs not your money.
---
Yeah i used google and it lead me to the reddit with the link.
---
Lol be that guy. Luckily for other players I don't have a headset yet. I plan on being careful with noise, I know no one likes it lol
---
he said minutemen captain was a moron.
---
Well have fun don‚Äôt let anyone tell you how to enjoy your game
---
Hahahha. US caring about a corporation fucking over it‚Äôs customers. I‚Äôm pretty sure we‚Äôre ruled by the corporations here. Hell, we have corporations doing far worse and government looks the other way.
---
Not only sex tents, most of the Camps I have visited while checking out vendors had sCrap Boxes in them, on Xbox.
---
I used to think a lot of people farmed daily Atoms for their Camp Stuff like I do, but now I guess people were actually spending lots of money.
---
There seems to be a smaller player base on Xbox left now so if makes sense that mostly whales remain, but nevertheless, that's a lot of Fallout First members.
---
I didn't say that. I still do the event. But I also don't crash like everyone else is so I don't mind. I can usually 2 man it anyway.
---
Ah darn there was only 22 of those better luck next time.
---
Yes and yes
---
HAHAHA. That's actually genius XD
---
"First is trash" but you have multiple scrap boxes... what???
---
My favorite comment to a post since this patch dropped, my feeling exactly
---
Get it cheap. It‚Äôs a bad game for $60 but a great one for $20
---
You not only bought it on ps4 but also on pc, so who is the dumb one. U just gave Bethesda money twice then cry the game sucks now ur leaving but wait might be back on pc, no real point was made here at all. Bethesda didn't even bother looking over their pile of cash at ur post they have ur money, way to hit them hard.
---
Are you stupid or just bad at sarcasm?
---
They don't get to keep the game you fucking mong.
---
Ffs. See ya there, sir.
---
I've always loved the radio stations in Fallout.  Check out Raider Radio from the Fallout 4 Amusement Park DLC, brilliant.
---
Lol I was thinking the same thing! I‚Äôm a little lost...
---
That‚Äôs freaking hilarious. Oscar worthy I would say!
---
Customers always right literally originated in America.
---
It's only a more recent thing where sheep like you are ready to suck that corporate dick.
---
If you played the game for more than 6 hours and still went through all this effort you are nothing but a petty, pathetic human being.
---
Minority? Lmao, that's wildly optimistic and out of touch
---
Lol same here. So much happening, I can't even tell if they're a troll.
---
Got it, Bethesda needs to add a wardrobe closet for fallout first members.
---
I don't know how many play it. I do know I always see plenty of activity when I log in.
---
Those aren't remotely the same type of game.
---
Cool moron logic.
---
I'll give you real logic. This game has bled the majority ie more than 50% of its playerbase. 
---
All of those ppl would gladly get a refund for a game they'll never play again.
---
Good god that's still bugged?
---
My money and time is well spent on my little private F76 world. &lt;3
---
I bought the year subscription, but i bought the game for 15.00 so in my mind i was 45.00 ahead of others. So really it cost me 55.00 for the year. Thats nothing and i get to play solo or invite friends. The biggest part is the serve is incredibly stable i have yet to get an error. Went on public server and it was server error one after another not to mention the lag. Its worth it.
---
Not really man.. I haven‚Äôt seen anyone ‚Äúhating‚Äù on any FO1st players. Just dancing around with our fun emotes ;)
---
How does that indicate that? Lol. It just means a lot of people bit the sub
---
As you should when servers only support 24 players.
---
You can spin it that way but you are grasping at straws.
---
Sacrifice her at the altar of the mothman all hail mothman. Lol just kidding maybe?
---
Imo same players but milking them for more.
---
Wastelanders is when ppl will come back not for ther money grab to finish wastelanders
---
Lol ok dude. I'm eager to see how you spin the next one.
---
My primary argument for a change in damage multipliers.
---
U try on a private server or public?
---
So many assaultrons
---
did you craft one?
---
I sent you a request
---
That's pretty cool. I posted before but it would be awesome to have a persistent world that you could keep build progress on. 
---
I paid 40 on black friday last year and have definitely gotten my money's worth. I don't hate the subscription service but I do hate non cosmetic stuff being tied to it. 
---
With all that said I'm glad you are enjoying it.
---
Ill trade it for something of equal or lesser value
---
Fuck that I love my blue stash box . its amazing. I no longer have to go to work bench scrap all exit work bench press R to drop then hold left arrow down to the approriate level 20 times in a row for managing inventory weight every couple hours. 
---
NOW I run up to my new awesome stash box and press e and t do I need 3000 glass. nope, do I need to avoid that fucking tedious inventory management bullshit. hell yes. Fallout first is worth every penny. get it . get it now! the survival camp is also amazing and worth it alone. 
---
Do I give a fuck if some whiney nerd on the internet disapproves of how I spend my money. no not one fuck is given. anti firsters are just stupid as hell.
---
Rename them
---
Same, only shorts so far. Every hour past 2 days and still don't have it. Seems like most who played 1st day got it as everytime I was on that next day someone was wearing one.
---
I don't think so. I have more or less 100 Fallout 76  friends. Usually, 5-15 are playing when I log in. Before mischief, half of them were either playing private or visiting private. The other half, regular adventure, and maybe one of them, Nuclear Winter.
---
Some people might have subscribed because of NCR, but... I think Beth knows best.
---
yup the guard stabbed him and he was like "ah fuck!! minuteman is such a moron"
---
Revenant is a super underrated perk imo, I‚Äôm using for a life saving/throwing knife build.
---
You're a fool. How is consumer protection, in any case, a bad thing? I'll bet that you just don't have the same rights and are butthurt about that.
---
I played more than 6 hours, TO GIVE IT A CHANCE, but not to the point of taking advantage of anything, see I played in the BETA and actually though that it WAS a BETA and not just the game being that bad. It made improvements, yes, but not anywhere near enough for me to consider it even out of the BETA, even at this point. I have the right to return the product for a refund in my country.
---
It's Bethetic.
---
It surprised me when they released the display cases without those
---
though by now it's clear they simply didn't think that feature through too
---
Preston Garvey was Judas
---
It's only happening months after **because** they didn't allow it to happen within days, it's not that hard to understand...
---
Think of it like this, you buy a shirt online, the shirt that is delivered looks like the shirt you bought but it's the wrong color and is full of holes. You already paid for it, but you don't want this crappy shirt full of holes that loosely resembles what you ordered but absolutely isn't it. You ask for a refund, the company who sold it to you refuses, you now have a shirt that you can wear but it's still full of holes and the wrong color on top of that, you may wear it or you may not but you feel like you're being wronged here so you sue the company. Years later a court of law decides that the company wronged you and since the company can't provide the actual product that you ordered, they make the company give you your money back. The only difference really is that you'd have to mail them the shirt back but that's pretty much what's going on here.
---
Sell good products, support them well and there's no issue.  Only places that have to fear a law that punishes bad products need to worry, obviously
---
You'll have to get in contact with Bethesda, if they refuse, talk to the ACCC.
---
 Thank you for your mom never teaching you right;)
---
Also, PsyckoSama, agreed. Fallout First Hunters are superheroes!
---
More people like 76 than like you, to be fair.
---
richard this line of convo is going to send us both straight to hell and its your fault.
---
Yup
---
Stopped playing? I got out of the vault, played for fifteen minutes, and never opened it again
---
What's your excuse? ^^^^/s
---
Yeah it‚Äôs ok. I once had two come up at once for some reason and it was just hectic.
---
Yup, all of those are also far more productive ways to use money than give it to Bethesda. And some of these idiots actually think it only affects those who pay for it. Misguided fools, sadly. Anyone who wants Bethesda to stop selling lazy crap is affected by ignorant people willing to buy lazy crap. But I know I'm preaching to the choir here, glad it seems most people understand this.

This isn't even a surprising amount of downvotes for a non controversial post, on pretty much any sub
---
I feel good now that I know you feel bad for me. Thank you for the pity.
---
I did not get hours of enjoyment out of this pile of shit. I played in through the BETA and actually thought it WAS in BETA. The game came out and I played it, was fucking hugely dissapointed and asked for a refund for this broken shit.
---
BETHESDA REFUSED, not because I had played it for too much, because they didn't want to. I had a right to a refund and got it so get over it. Having the right to get my money back is NOT a scam.
---
I asked for this refund a full YEAR ago and only JUST got it due to the law being on my side, it's strange to me that so many are on the side of the corperation and against the law, rather than with the law and against the corperation.
---
Bombs fell right before Halloween. So theres halloween scenes here and there
---
I'll have you know it's Ka'hreeen.
---
And you said I was dumb lol
---
It won't.
---
Bethesda isn't capable of doing it especially considering this is this studios first multiplayer game.
---
I don't, I played the BETA and then a bit of the "real" game, asked for a refund. Was refused and a year later the ACCC got enough complaints that Bethesda was forced to refund me.
---
If the drill doesn't work as intended it's the company's fault. Such as you using the drill and learning that it's made of chinesium and it breaks or wears down after a few uses.
---
If you buy a drill and then regret it for any reason, such as it not being the correct size, or you suddenly realizing you could've gotten it cheaper somewhere else, etc... that's buyers remorse and while you **can** get a refund for that in most places as long as you haven't used the product, it definitely is **your** fault if you made a bad decision.
---
The first example is the basis for the concept of refunds, the second example is a form of consumer protection that was adopted later because too many people made bad decisions.
---
I do agree that the fault lies with Zenimax in this case though.
---
Was never bashing Bethesda that was even my first sentence when I offered my stuff to other players which I appreciated. Hope you enjoy the game bud be safe out there.
---
say what?
---
You can rename clothing and stuff ?
---
I know right? I see all the comments supporting peoples rights getting downvoted and attacked too. Like, seriously? How is having your rights upheld AGAINST A COMPAY a bad thing?
---
nah jus goofin
---
In an online game like this the community is the meat of the game. Bethesda just provided the framework. By making external changes like this they‚Äôve messed with the games economy that you and others like you built your shops and businesses on. Now they‚Äôve put you out of business.
---
No, Infact they were entirely capable of doing it. It was literally planned to launch initially with it, until Sony said no. Then they could no longer keep cross play.
---
LOL yes also I need to have an ai in my power armor sort of like iron man. mr handy voice --- oh no the french female voice. fuck mr handy I want ms handy in my suit.

I was playing on ps4 yesterday or earlier today and saw this scenario. I thought about joining, and there were already a couple of people there, but I‚Äôm only lvl 83 and was low on ammo. 
---
I got the blue screen of death shortly after on a regular run though.
---
It did not work, but there was more than just that, there was the blatent lies (perhaps PR was unintentional about this and the publisher was like "yeah, we're not honering what you said", but still...) and there was the fact that, even if I don't like the product, in Australia I still have the right for a refund. Plus they did lie about refunds, they said "You purchased the game digitally and are not entitled to a refund." and that is 100% against Australian law.
---
It may well have, I honestly though some people might find this useful, some fellow Australians. Seeing as this sub is specifically for this game and not just Fallout in general, I did think this was the best place to spred the message.
---
Ah fair enough
---
Thank you
---
Preston would like to ask you for a favor
---
That very thing happened to me after my first win against the Encrypted! Since my corpse was deposited across the map, I had to pay over 60 caps to get back... And since I was technically away, the corpse had despawned for me!
---
It's also that Bethesda refused refunds saying "You can not request a refund if you own the game digitally" and that is 100% against the law here, I'm surprised more action wasn't taken against them TBH. But I'm just happy with my money back.
---
well fk my life, this helps alot 
---
Thank you!!!
---
Heh, that's the best possible outcome, well done! :)
---
Ur funny butt hurt over what i said now going through all my threads so funny. Yeah i bought the 1st subscription and didn't know this was normal or part of it, man u got me good. Good job wasting ur time
---
And giant spiders.
---
That‚Äôs unfortunate
---
I got the game for free and still think I should get one. XD
---
I shall go to my local authorities for refund help. This is lemon to me... a game with bugs
---
Not at all friend just that it was ironic. Have fun I still love fallout.
---
Remember to get your refund. Lol
---
I see you don't like people having rights. See, I played the BETA and was fooled into thinking it WAS a BETA and not just the shit game end product. The game came out and it was still shit, I requested a refund and Bethesda refused on grounds it was a "digital copy". That is an illegal stance in Australia, you are required by law to offer refunds.  
---
Now tell me, why is having your rights upheld in the face of a company breaking the law a bad thing?
---
No one fucking cares about you saving your allowance from mommy and daddy
---
I went to the bench and it looked like I could. Required a good number of materials to build so I held off. Was honestly hoping it was somekinda furniture plan cause of the replica part.
---
Its not ironic, dork there is a big difference which evades u but cool have a good one
---
I‚Äôm not worried about it I made it over level 100 so I got some value out of it. It wasn‚Äôt great but it took up plenty of time.
---
someone nuked ours, we all fled, the nuke landed we all went back in. it was a glorious battle in hell and I got so much high rad fluids and h mass. I dunno if it was a hater trying to troll or someone trying to up the farm game but no one even batted an eye lol pretty sure most of us were like " hmm and its nuked?? cool this will be fun"
---
Yes, i know. 
---
And they didn't write their netcode that way so it would require a full netcode rework.
---
Do you know any games that have done that?
---
Also, games are actually way more expensive in Australia. the "base game" was $100 over here and the more expensive versions could be $200+. Like, wtf?
---
Out of all of the events so far, this one's gotta be the biggest one yet by Bethesda. Faschnact Parade was long only because of the dragged out nature of the Protectron marchers, and Meat Week was just a little hang-out event with Grahm rather than a real event
---
Meanwhile, Mischief Night has you go through parts of the Whitespring, causing tons of mayhem as you go, possibly engage in a potential 3-way battle between yourself and other players, Ghouls and the Whitespring Security Robots, and at the end you engage in a pretty difficult fight against a Sentry Bot who can easily kick your ass. 
---
There are more camp drops available, more unique full outfits available (rather than specifically headwear for Fasnacht and just one unique outfit for Meat Week), and you can get some more loot on top of the event rewards by engaging in certain activities (Trick-or-Treating)
---
Wonder what they'll do for the Christmas event. Maybe deck the map in snow? Change NW up so it's a raging Blizzard that's consuming the map instead of a firestorm?
---
I like seeing news and developments. MAYBE I held out hope that this game could be better, rather than staying as shit as it was in BETA.
---
Sounds like a bunch of Bethesda fan boys not happy their favorite company got called out for being assholes
---
Totally real! Our carols down here are pretty great:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDb8tlb-2y8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDb8tlb-2y8)

"The Earth King has invited you to Lake Laogai"
---
Careful. I doubt they‚Äôre shopping for Atom Shop stuff at the moment- if anything we‚Äôll end up with a bunch of Fallout 1st exclusive Enclave stuff.
---
I disagree, I‚Äôve actually seen more new players  lately and it seems to be slowly increasing. I could be wrong, maybe everyone‚Äôs working on other characters..just my observationÔøº
---
Depends on if you clear the area out before event starts. Had a really rough time trying to handle both with the couple of people that were willing to show up in the nuked area.
---
We had to deal with the horde of glowing ones and couldn't complete the event on time.
---
Yeah you tried spending 12 a month yet?
---
I do... depends what's it worth to you
---
Chaos and explosions everywhere are beautiful.
---
How would it need the whole game reprogrammed? All it is is altering the net code a bit.
---
I bought the year subscription?
---
On their website I had to contact them, tell them I had requested refunds before and was doing so again. They only gave me the refund because I was backed by the ACCC. Just in case I always took screenshots of them refusing refunds etc, but thankfully they gave in before those were needed. The legal nightmare of me being in AUS was too much for them.
---
In other words, just contact them via the refund screen on their main website and remind them you've already submitted tickets. They'll try bullshit to get out of it, but they have all the information about you stored, so don't trust them. They know you already requested, they just hope people forget or don't notice this change.
---
It's likely intentional, since taking a whooping 33% less damage from everything is pretty powerful for a support mutation
---
I appreciate where you‚Äôre coming from, but this still wouldn‚Äôt get me on fallout first (I agree completely about the classist name though). 
---
I won‚Äôt ever pay a subscription on a game I paid full price for. I won‚Äôt ever pay to RENT a game I already bought. Make the scrap box and tent a dlc that I can play a flat rate for and I‚Äôll consider them, but asking me to pay for items over and over and over again is ridiculous.
---
Re-contact them, as in request another refund and remind them you already asked for one in the past, you are owed a refund. They will try and say that you need to prove this, but they sharply told me to disreguard that and gave me all my money. They have all the information about you and your requests stored, so don't let them lie to you.   
---
Just request another refund stating that you had asked for one in the past. They will contact you.
---
Farewell, soldier.
---
i really wish more people understood this...
---
Haha, I found your Camp tonight.  Your message is confusing, do you hate the Sub or love it since you bought it, strange.
---
We'll probably get some more pops of the new companions or prominent characters in wastelanders.
---
You think the next Fallout and Elder Scrolls is gonna be out by holiday 2020? O_o
---
Thanks, no need to apologize, you do you. I filed multiple times over the year, from not long after the game went "live" (even though it was the same as the "BETA") and over the rest of the year. Each time they refused for different reasons, but the most popular one was "We can't refund digital copies, you don't have that right", even though that statment alone is illegal AF in my country.
---
The servers are the same ones they're already renting from AWS, quite possibly with lower bandwidth requirements due to the substantially lowered player cap. No further expense.
---
&gt;They have all the information about you and your requests stored
---
So in my last refund attempt I may have called them a bunch of cunts, so this might get awkward lol
---
I believe what I see and I've been wearing my ranger outfit since the day I got it (unless I'm in PA) I haven't experienced a moment of grief from anybody. I have seen quite a few scrap boxes in people's camps though.
---
No, it isn't intentional, otherwise that would contradict what the perk actually says it does. Like, DIRECTLY contradict.
---
according to [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dp7xj9/unofficial\_but\_comprehensive\_bug\_roundup\_mischief/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dp7xj9/unofficial_but_comprehensive_bug_roundup_mischief/) we can't get that empty pumpkin rack plan. So yeah, don't bother to farm for it because it's unobtainable.
---
Nothing wrong with that if she is having fun, you are a good guy to help her.  I am sure you are both having a blast, wish my wife was interested in gaming.
---
Wtf!?!? You just sniped that guy with an assaultron head?! That was nuts. What keeps you from taking rads with that thing?
---
Fun is subjective, it's far from fun for me. I'm also all for my rights to get my money back, no matter the amount. $100 is a lot of money and you would be a fool to say "DAW NEVERMIND HYUCK HYUCK". See, once, that's bad, but if you do that for, say.... several games? Maybe there are three games, not that many right? Three games you never play because they are shit, broken, have been lied about or otherwise. So that could cost you $220 - $300, suddenly that starts to add up.
---
I'll never understand people being against the consumers rights and being with a company breaking the law. What a world, indeed.
---
Then don't do it
---
Don't worry, I got pretty bad too. :') But they still owe you money.
---
Do a hard reset: 
---
1. Power down the Xbox One.
---
2. Unplug the Xbox One.
---
3. Wait for 10 seconds.
---
4. Plug everything back in
---
5. Power the Xbox One back on.
---
It clears the cache out as well,
---
You can only see 23 other players at a time......
---
Seeing plenty of scrap boxes out there...
---
What do you mean by that? Are you supposed to take rads from holding it?
---
It's strange to me that this is so, because I used to be a huge fan boy. I played Fallout 3 for years, NV for years, Fallout 4 for years, same with Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim. Hell even Elder Scrolls Online was good, or good enough. 
---
I was a massivly obsessive kid / teen, bethesda gave me so much happyness in life for years and I will never forget that, but this game and their current attitude truly did break my heart.
---
I haven't tried the whole river but I did start at the top Western corner and swam for what I would guess is the equivalent of at least a half-mile and the invisible wall wouldn't let me touch the other shore. I was bummed because that's actually a pretty good-sized chunk of land on the western side of that River. I eventually got out of the water because it was my first time swimming for that far of a distance and I thought just because I was aquaboy I was good to go... Until I caught a disease. Lol
---
I got the info from a recent Juicehead video. I‚Äôm not sure of his source but I‚Äôve never seen him present inaccurate information.

So you really made this post because your done paying for ps plus and wanted to make a funny video.
---
Fair. :') hard to tell on this sub, sometimes.

The vast majority of the purchases where the one month subscription allowing users to get the skins and 1650 atoms

Im pretty certain the number of people reupping next month will plummet

I'm a 1st member but I don't see how to set up my tent. How??

That was absolutely beautiful now I can raise Australia to a 9 (not 10 yet cause idk what rights y'all got down there)
---
Not if we look at a percentage no, yea more people like f76 than me but percentage wise almost every1 who knows me like me but most people that know f76 dislike it
---
Haha! I love it.
---
Ha - I'll admit that after completing it twice, I thought to myself, "I wonder what happens if we nuke it, maybe something special..." Because it almost seems like you should, because the event goes through the first or second-most nuked place.
---
Thank you, friend, for your intelligence and understanding. I haven't bought or played Fallout 76 but I've studied it thoroughly because it's one of the largest pieces of evidence of The Fall of The Gaming Industry, which is a topic I find sad but quite interesting. And I've always argued the ignorant people that say, "I bought it and it doesn't affect you!" because exactly as you said, it DOES affect EVERYONE who wants Bethesda to sell GOOD and QUALITY content like they used to. Why would they EVER start to do quality which takes effort, when they can take no effort or time at all to give what should've been in the game at a $100 a year price tag? 
---
It's the people buying these disgusting deals that allow for MORE disgusting deals to come through later on.
---
Thought I did, I've answered so many people, so I'll tell you too.
---
The game was, IMO; Bad, broken, there were multiple lies told about the game, including in it's advertising (that includes shit Pete and Todd say) and they lied about our rights to a refund. They proclaim that as a digital user, we have no right to a refund. That is a lie and against the law in Australia. 
---
There, happy?
---
We're talking about consumer goods, not life essentials.  Stop buying consistent consumer offenders and support consumer rights.  Especially in the age of digital licenses and the all mighty Eula.  When companies can yank your license to consume for absolutely no reason there is a very lopsided dynamic.

Haha, ooooookay. Have a good life. Hahaha
---
I‚Äôm glad to see others are thinking this.  It‚Äôs seems like forever
---
Except that it's the players allowing for the game to remain crappy. I understand if you haven't thought of it this way, but this is how it does and has turned out. 
---
They test the waters selling complete crap or something that should've been free. If enough people buy it, then it doesn't matter what anyone says or how much backlash there is, because they're making profit on doing basically nothing. And then the people that want Bethesda to go back to making quality games and content, they suffer because of the people willing to buy Bethesda's lazy greedy crap. Because why would they ever go back to making good content that requires effort and initial investment on their part, when they can just shovel literal nothing or stuff that takes them barely any work for a top tier fee, and people actually pay for it? 
---
The problem is yes, all those buying that subscription DO affect those who don't, whether they know it or not, it does affect all people who play Bethesda games or want to play Bethesda games that are as quality as they used to be.
---
Except for crashing and it being done so fast because so many people are there and you hardly get to do anything
---
Well I feel a little silly roaming post apocalytic ruins at level 363 with a queen melting junkies ultracite laser gat and fully decked out x-01 power armor.... collecting teddy bears. on the positive though you ever seen the old scooby doo hallways gag where they're running left and right through all the hall way doors. that's what I see when I am holding security and my wife is looting. its funny as hell. she liked the quantum paint for the x-01 so her purple ass runs across the hallway. fucking rad roach follows. I hear gun shots. she runs back across the hall way hehehheheh. sigh. that shit just doesn't stop being funny.

I kept my stuff *just in case* this game takes a turn for the better. Otherwise I‚Äôve deleted and moved on, too. I‚Äôve been trying Outer Worlds, but I‚Äôm not as into that as I was in Skyrim and FO4.
---
Watched every last second and even gave a salute. Good luck out there, brother. Glad to say we left the vault, together.
---
I'll be honest, my guess is because most of the time it isn't worth it for the ACCC to take action. They have a very limited budget and have to pick and choose which actions they take on. They aren't going to spend a ton of time and cash helping just a few people get a refund for a digital game.
---
Australia has a hard cap at a 7 for me for everything that can kill you there.

You clearly haven't been to Oklahoma then

I‚Äôm glad it seems like they‚Äôll be releasing faction themed paint jobs for Wastelanders. I wonder what the Raider version looks like
---
That is a lot of anger over 60.00, really u hate a group of people that much.
---
Well this is disappointing to know, sorry that‚Äôs happened to you.
---
I'm just happy to be refunded and annoyed that Bethesda had to be forced to give a refund by a government body dedicated to protecting consumers. That alone, I thought was news. But I also later provided info and links to people that needed help getting refunds. People are PM/DMing me for help and I'm replying to everyone, as to help them if I can. This is my intention, though I won't lie, I do also feel overjoyed about being vindicated by the LAW. 
---
^(Nobody breaks the law on my watch! Now pay the court a fine and forfeit your stolen goods.)
---
Come on Bethesda, just give this poor man back his donuts.
---
Good comment i agree
---
It‚Äôs fixed and those of us who lost scrap won‚Äôt get it back. In my ticket they said they would give some random amounts of scrap as compensation, but not sure when that will happen.
---
How can games be free? I would rather pay then have huge banner ads across my screen, no thank u
---
Yeah I do know how it works but no point in trying to explain if it only results in downvoting me.
---
&gt; Buyer's remorse should not be a valid reason for a refund.
---
FO76 was a lot more than "buyer's remorse", pal. It was a fucking broken mess.
---
Ah you'll be 'right mate, so long as you're white of course. And even if you ain't, we stopped disallowing people into the country based on the colour of their skin [way back in 1973](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Australia_policy)! Of course we'll likely have to chuck you in one of those concentration camps of our's for a bit. Not too long, [just a year or so](https://www.asyluminsight.com/statistics#.XbzxfTMzaUk) until we get you sorted. We're a very welcoming country you know!
---
I saw a post related to this. I believe I saw that there is a donut recipe in game and they dont spoil. if I remember correctly the guy had a pre war food resturant complete with donuts and a slocum joes sign. OR maybe he just built near one of their bill boards. [https://youtu.be/2Jz1M7uz6Bk](https://youtu.be/2Jz1M7uz6Bk) for the donuts. cannot find the old post i was thinking about though :(
---
I‚Äôm betting many don‚Äôt see the scrap boxes all over...lol
---
The bridge building mechanic is broken. But seriously though, I was around here because I wanted to see the news about this game, see if there were any improvments. I hoped time would temper my own mind and that Bethesda would actually improve this game, call me foolish for holding out hope, but alas... at this point I have no faith in them. Don't worry I will be leaving you alone, I just though there MIGHT be some useful information to my fellow Australians here.

No, ACLU does more than workplace discrimination, and making someone pay just to be able to type in chat could be considered a discriminatory business practice against hearing-impaired individuals.

It's fun, but very, very limited. And while I haven't crashed, it's incredibly laggy even on a high end system with a very solid wired internet connection.

This in no way mitigates Fallout 1st, the further delay of Wastelanders, bugs that keep not getting fixed, etc.

So, I did preorder and you are right, I was an idiot for doing so. I no longer preorder, but truth be told I never did for games other than Bethesda Fallout and TES games, this mistake will not be made again.
---
I played the BETA thinking it really WAS the BETA and not the finished game. Then the game came out and it was mroe the same, I played and waited giving it some time to improve, but I didn't play enough to consider it taking advantage IMO. I didn't get enjoyment out of this game or have fun (keep in mind this is my opinion and does not devalue any fun you or others had), so I requested a refund a full year ago. It was refused on grounds that I had "purchased the game digitally and was not entitled to a refund." &lt; That statment is a lie and against the law in Australia but I also had the right to a refund due to other factors like; the game being broken and/or false advertising. Not to mention, not likeing a product in AUS also often gets you a refund, within a set number of days you can have a refund for ANY reason, as long as it wasn't YOU who damaged the product or unless it's underwear etc.
---
I thought it would've been the Hellscape nightmare animals that kept it from being a ten.
---
$100 is a lot of money to me, games are more expensive in Australia. I also may value money more than most, even small amounts as I used to be homeless. I no longer am and have full time work and study with my own place, but I still value every little bit. Some people just don't have the money to throw away.
---
In regular mode you take like 50 rads everytime you shoot the damn thing. That‚Äôs the downside of its power. I‚Äôve never used it in nw because I was always worried about that.

F76 was the most fun I've had online for 2 weeks straight. But it was the worst game I've ever played. It was hilarious to play a game with my friends that was completely broken and didnt work but it got old pretty quick
---
And that one year where we couldn't go outside because there were bushfires and the air quality was horrendous
---
That‚Äôs not how math works.
---
LMFAO, winning a debate would require you to actually counter my arguments and bolster your own!
---
All you've done is insult me and your "counters" amount to "nya you're wrong!"
---
You never addressed that people will abuse anything when there aren't checks and balances. That refunds without term limits will put businesses out of business.
---
LOL, and as soon as you gave you a real world example of what I was talking about you gave up on that whole "it never happened so you don't know shit!" angle and promptly ignored it.

But nice projecting with the grasping at straws though, I'll let consumer reports know you rate a 7.5/10.

They just wanted to give you a reason to tug at your wallet and the ranger armor was the best way to do it.

Shady as fuck imo

When they did, we would have to contact "Tier 2" so that they could discount the price to whatever matched their protection.
---
They did owe me the refund, paying for a product willingly is what happens when you are a law abiding citizen. They refused a refund on grounds that I was not entitled to one for owning/playing the game digitally. That statment alone is a lie and illegal in AUS, but that wasn't the sole reason for my refund.
---
Same. So much hope, only to feel twice as stupid.
---
It's worth a good time... And I'd be willing to pay some caps
---
Cool. Stop posting here then. This isn‚Äôt facebook we don‚Äôt need a status update.
---
Nah, Oklahoma is about the same
---
&gt; How much was the Tricentennial Version? Oh, right ... the same cost as paying monthly for Fallout First for a YEAR.
---
What the fuck are you on about?
---
The Tricentennial Edition doesn't even come close to a year of Fallout 1st.
---
Fun is subjective, just so you know I'm not downvoting you. A different opinion to mine is just that, different. I hope you keep playing and liking the game my friend, though I feel you are supporting something that I can not abide.
---
I'm just happy that I got my money back and, even if they were forced by the ACCC, Bethesda did the right thing. Unwilling or otherwise.
---
That plan is unobtainable by normal means. There is no reference for it as a reward or drop of any sort.
---
You can actually see a lot more than that. When I log in, I can see about 30-40 friends showing as online in Fallout 76.
---
Exactly .... they shit on all the people that got them where they are. They don‚Äôt care about you ... they only care about the profits.
---
It is if they then go around and with the newly found excess wealth built more easily from that extra storage option, buy high tier weapons from people that most wouldn‚Äôt be able to afford, at least not as easily.  There isn‚Äôt -much-  of a pvp element outside NW at the moment, but the fact remains that you could in theory turn that storage into a ‚Äúp2w‚Äù element against other players.
---
Can‚Äôt part with mine for any price. But best of luck in your search.
---
Been looking for weeks mate
---
Fuck Bethesda.
---
Makes me feel that a LOT of AUS players must have requested refunds and contacted he ACCC.
---
Just imagine. Their 4th of July is in the winter. They must have a hard time with their celebrating.
---
Plus the Steam decision helped the ACCC a lot as they could point to that to Bethesda and say the Court has already decided what is legal.
---
&gt;Not only sex tents, most of the Camps I have visited while checking out vendors had sCrap Boxes in them, on Xbox.
---
I have seen the same thing. Like you I have seen the scrap boxes.  The sex tents popping up everywhere  just really drove the point home to me for some reason.
---
I do wonder how much it would cost them to get some songs they had for past titles. Wouldn't mind having a Duraframe Eyebot buzzing around me playing a somewhat staticky version of the song playlists from New Vegas or the Capital Wastelands.
---
From some of the comments yes..... for sure, but i wanna say it could be just people who are die heart fans who still love the game and want to see it succeed, but have the bais that it cant be that bad.....
---
&gt; If they introduced microtransactions 3 months after release and people wanted refunds, maybe they‚Äôd avoid that, or even try being totally transparent about it before release so people don‚Äôt feel cheated.
---
Your example literally outlines my worst case scenario, after three months a lot of people will be ready to move on and will gladly cash in on a refund.
---
There's a reason why standard refund periods are 30 days, or in the case of digital games less than two hours.
---
&gt; As I said, this sort of thing is reliant on faith and goodwill at the moment, it needs to have laws regulating it like any other trading activity. If people play fairly there shouldn‚Äôt be a problem, and that goes for both sides. There is also no doubt the right to appeal.
---
They will never play fairly, the company or the consumer, because it's in their best interest to get whatever they can.
---
And every time someone wants the government to do more, there are always unintended consequences as well as a gradual increase in reach and authority well past what was intended.
---
Easy example is the American income tax; when it was first passed it was promised that it would only ever touch the single digits top percent of income earners. Now it touches all but the lowest.
---
These are patterns that repeat themselves every time because it's human nature, they're not fear mongering at all.
---
Huzzah, a man of quality
---
They don't celebrate the Fourth of July
---
**(Not a 1st subscriber.)**  
---
Sorry that you're experiencing this. At first, when I read this I was thinking that this was someone just being 'ridiculous' about being killed on a server when they could just simply go to a different one and go about their adventure *(grief free)*. But if they're going out of their way to continuously join the servers you're on just to mess with you, that's pretty toxic. 
---
There's a part of me that's all for the 1st hunting since it adds to the entertainment of the game, kinda like our own little civil war that we can enjoy! However, when it comes to a group of people relentlessly hunting a single person and joining their servers just to kill them? I think that's when it just becomes harassment. Still, I hope you're able to somewhat enjoy the game despite some of these people trying to ruin it for you! 
---
(1st Hunters, if you kill somebody enough times to make them leave the server just mark it up as a victory. Don't be a douche and follow them wherever they go, it just makes you look toxic.)
---
Thank you, I'm glad that you are enjoying the game. I hope that one day we can all just talk about these things and not get into wars or combat over things like this. See this is what we need more of, amicable talk. Even if someone disagrees with me, as long as they are constructive and don't use their emotions like a Sith, I'm happy to talk with them about it as well.
---
That's still a tiny number though. 
---
Even if you could see 100s we're talking 100s lol.
---
It'll be worth it for that Perth accent
---
I honestly do not know, as others have pointed out, depending on country laws, you should be able to get refunds.... depending on the reasons.
---
I was serious.
---
ohhhhhhh this explains why I was heavy all of a sudden a couple months back!!
---
I had a Homer Simpson build where I only ate donuts and drank beer and used a bowling ball cannon.
---
I hate that robots attack me when I cant Vats them. Don't know if it Is a bug, lag, latence or shitty game design. The only ones that become targetable are those which I attack first. That, plus a drop on fps really hurt the event. 
---
Also, those bugged invisible ghouls should give me a break.
---
Not poor don't wanna waste my money on a shit fucking subscription on a game I payed $100 for.
---
I considered embracing the role of vault tech employee assigned to investigate post apocalyptic appalachia. this would include confirmed deaths. confirmed mutations IE how many super mutants spawn at west teck. I think it would be neat to do but ended up repairing power plants.  
---
What struck me about the end of your post is the fact that in game my guy has fully adopted the role of fixing power plants . I tend to take the workshop at monongah for the fusion cores and between events I go repair the others. i also help other power plant owners defend their shops. 
---
I stumbled into the role of power plant maintainance after I got a vampiric laser gatling as a drop in a queen fight. I shot it as a fun little experiment and loved it. then I rebuilt my sniper into a heavy laser gatling gunner. I am level 363 and I am still trying to tweak and adjust and find that right balance for all the perks I need on the day to day. BUT I now have a junkies ultracite laser gat. the powerplants are still my main mission, I can have all three repaired in less than an hour and I almost always own monongah to keep a steady supply of fusion cores. 
---
the exp and loot are decent rewards for repairing them and even though people rarely use the power I provide its a nice feeling of accomplishment when I get the grid up. no idea why I like it so much but I do. a short plays session is typically me running in and claiming the shop at mongah. I build a generator to get the fusion core generator running, throw a fast travel mat and some prebuilt turret towers down. defend the first even then go repair the actual power plant while the fusion core generator runs making me more ammos. If I am getting heavy with fusion cores sometimes I do the repairs first just so I dont have to use scrap to build a nuclear gene. anyway after mongah is all squared away I will go get the other two plants running. then I will run off and do events or whatever and just check in from time to time for my fusion cores. this is pretty much something I do every time I log in. after the setup is complete i can actually go do other things and enjoy them. if I skip it I am annoyed and distracted that I dont have them done already lol.
---
Fo76 blows garbage
---
Wish I had know that when I was farming for those plans lol
---
I figured this out the hard way as well. Plz fix Bethesda!
---
Yeah I have all the info, I even went to the accc with it and they still said no originally
---
I think the best part about this is there are probably more people who want a refund now then at launch. Many hardcore Fallout fans were probably thinking "yeah, it sucks now, but they'll fix it!" and now a year later they know that was BS.
---
I won't pirate games, just my personal feelings there. But refunds are always a right and should be in other places in the world. If you chose not to exersice that, that is also your right. $100 for a game a never play due to MANY reasons is too much, I used to be homeless and I think that might make me value every bit all that much more, maybe too much, maybe not. Still, I was entitled to a refund and had to fight for it, with the law on my side. 
---
I used to buy their games on day one or pre-order them. I spend $200 on Fallout 4's collectors edition and find it more than worth that, sure I like Fallout 3 and NV more, but I spent so many hours in Fallout 4 and love the pip-boy that I feel it was worth it. Keep in mind that Games are more expensive in AUS, not just because of conversion rates, but more so that just that.
---
I don't think I will be getting more games from them, my worry is that future titles will have things like 'Creation Club' embeded into them from the get go, though one of my main issues with it was that it broke old mods and not all of them are kept up to date, unfortunatly some REALLY good ones are left in the past due to this CC rubbish. But CC is a WHOLE other topic.
---
Again, that‚Äôs not how math works. 
---
You‚Äôre assuming an overall result from a limited sample size. None of us can actually give definitive answers about the overall population; only our personal experiences. 
---
I can say that out of about 200 people I‚Äôve tagged as friends in FO76, I haven‚Äôt noticed any significant decrease in their attendance. Three of them got very into Borderlands 3 but they had planned that for a while. But since then they have been back fairly often.
---
It‚Äôs life changing once you find one. 
---
I have the sledgehammer version on one of my alts. Bought the croquet mallet skin just because of that.
---
I stopped playing a LONG time ago, I hoped that this game would get better, but still. My refund request was over a year old, I've been on this sub for the news and hoping either something like this would happen or the game, SOMEHOW would be made better.
---
even before selling I have to get mongah repaired and making me fusion cores first. I am nuts, but if I dont I am annoyed .
---
I‚Äôm not sure what part of the world you are from but countries with proper consumer protection are awesome. I disagree with most of what you wrote but I think it‚Äôs pretty clear we‚Äôre on seperate spectrums so don‚Äôt really see the need to continue, it‚Äôs moving from a debate into an argument which isn‚Äôt helpful to anyone. It‚Äôs your apocalypse and my evolution, you see it all as a negative and I see the positivities. That‚Äôs fine.
---
Funny enough because before eb games had been bought out there was a eb games and a gamestop in my local mall so when eb games was bought out there were basically two gamestop locations in the same mall and also another gamestop a bit down the road from the mall which ended up with a scenario that I got to be able to check 3 different gamestop's to find a specific game. Now there is just one in the mall and another store down the street.
---
$100 right back into my bank.
---
Lol That's literally what I've been saying..
---
Disagree, if a company lies and releases the shittyest DLC i ever saw, i would definitely quit and emplor others too as well
---
I THINK it was meant to be a joke, that or people really are that much up Bethesda's ass.
---
Was your on PS4 and had the shrine in a greenhouse with smoke machines?   (That was the one I saw tonight...)
---
Man, good on you for not doing just an "I'm done" thing and actually making an event out of it and giving to the people who are still playing.
---
When the community finds unique ways of making a game interesting, it makes the experience much more memorable.
---
Yeah, well thats, like, your opinion man.
---
I used to get the BSoD too (PS4 Pro) then I saw a post about using third person view, and I haven‚Äôt crashed since...
---
Not very many, I played the BETA and IMO that should not count as we were supposedly doing something for Bethesda. Turned out the BETA was the game, as when it launched it was the same. I requested a refund, I think.... around day 2? With less than a couple hours a day? I tried to give it a chance. 
---
Funny thing is; If I played TOO MANY hours people would complain I'm a theif and that I have no rights (when I do) but if I played TOO LITTLE hours people would complain that I didn't give it a chance.
---
I did some big testing with Empath and it seems the hard cap it can actually reduce damage is actually 25%, not the 33% listed, so with Empath/Class freak/SIN, you are good as it works out at 25%; the extra 8% going from 25/33 when being boosted by SIN only helps to negate DMG taken %
---
I tested a mule with Empath (but not me) at default 25 and 33%, I still took the exact same dmg, only when I got Empath myself and used Class freak 2 instead of 3 did the damage change(as the damage taken % took me below the 25% cap)
---
I did not get anywhere near that, if you expect a refund YOU ARE A NORMAL HUMAN because when you BUY a PRODUCT then you are granted the right to REFUND THAT ITEM, at least in Australia. See I played the BETA, thinking it was the BETA. The game came out and it was the same. I stopped playing pretty fast, I can't say how many hours were in the BETA (since I was in it from the start) and how many were in the "actual" game but it was less than 10.
---
I might also add that I never looked at the Bethesda launcher again after my refund request. I have not at all, ever, played the game after asking for a refund. I uninstalled it.
---
Thats..the joke?
---
Because you‚Äôre presenting it from the (apparent) presumption that Bethesda has lost players. This is contrary to the majority of people‚Äôs personal experiences.
---
It may have been received differently if you had presented with less of an apparent bias.
---
It was a bad joke
---
Ok.
---
I know how you feel. Me and my friend were so excited waiting for the vaults to open, it literally broke my heart and I feel so ashamed he bought the game to play with me
---
Thanks! figured i would try and do something nice for the remaining players.
---
Fair enough, but some people on here clearly don't like the game, maybe the just get so downvoted that you don't notice them? I came here because this is where a lot of people come for news on this game and events around it. I really did think that this might be useful to my fellow Australians who might want a refund or previously requested one.
---
Wasnt knocking it all, Man. Everyone is their own person. Glad things are going good for you now.
---
It‚Äôs the best discount in Atoms so far, hands down. And in respect to Fallout First only, what did they lie about?
---
Its a dev room item, was fixed ages ago yes, but they didnt remove some stuff.
---
Smokins bad, mkay
---
Well that's pretty short sighted of you.
---
You sure it isn't your ehm...adorable personality that makes people hunt you down? I mean I don't even play this game but I would spreak my cheeks and take a huge dump on your head instantly just for the way you acted in this thread.
---
It used to stack until some update. I speculate it was removed because of duping, but it could also just be stupidity I guess.
---
I would imagine Country Roads and Ring of Fire cost a bit as well.
---
What country has these consumer protection laws?
---
I see what you are saying, but I asked for my refund very soon after the BETA ended, I stopped playing and uninstalled. I know Bethesda watches that and I hoped they would see that I was an honest dude and would give my money back. But it took the government body ACCC to force them into doing the right thing, sadly.
---
Are you able to get it in the US?
---
That's pay to win
---
I don't know, they said that it was part of being refunded that the game was not accessable, but I uninstalled after I asked for a refund. Because I'm an honest dude, or so I like to think.
---
I m based in Asia. However, my country has a lemon law to counter defective goods with full refunds
---
Anything that flies can follow you around. I've had government stash following me for some time and scorchbeast carcasses bugging the shit out of you is so common it ain't even worth mentioning
---
Play Fallout New Vegas Ultimate Edition. I played FO4 first and played FNV after people kept urging me to and I was pleasantly surprised. FNV is WAY better than FO4. Try it, you won't regret it.
---
No I think that's fair. The beta doesn't count. I was just curious if you were one of these people that played like a hundred hours only to say "I don't like it, I want a refund."
---
If you like the game, that's good. I really do hope you keep enjoying, I wish I could. I got very little play time myself even if you include my "BETA" playtimes. Less than 10, I'd guess. 
---
Though as others have pointed out, this isn't the point. I would like to say however; If I had played too many hours people would complain and brand me a theif or whatever, if I had played too little people would complain and scream that I didn't give it a chance. 
---
Though it should be noted that the ACCC would not have given refunds out to people who played too many hours UNLESS it's within the time frame of Bethesda having lied about refunds and breaking Australian Law. I guess Bethesda is kinda being punished for breaking the law by manditory refunds to all who asked over the past year.
---
though that vendorbot isn't flying
---
A question. Did you receive stable fluxes? If so, how many? Wanna know if Bethesda's been extra generous with some of the more valuable junks
---
Yeah, I'll pass on places that have spiders the size of my head.
---
Wait you weren't talking about vertibots?
---
Yeah for the first time since launch of the game, I‚Äôm crashing before I load into the world
---
There‚Äôs only a few songs I don‚Äôt like on 76. I like it personally
---
No, I played enough to know I didn't like the game, that it was broken and I was lied to. I also played the BETA, but the BETA was actually just the game, as when it first launched it was the same. I got my refund I was owed, I didn't abuse it and keep playing, I uninstalled after the request and it's been a year since I played.
---
NOTE: People are going to complain and call me a theif if I played it too much, BUT people are going to complan and say I never gave it a chance if I played too little. ALSO ACCC would not grant me the right to a refund if I had played an unreasonable amount of time.
---
If winning is donuts, I don't think that I want to lose
---
There already was the liberty prime PA. But it was limited time.
---
You're the only one
---
You're doing terrific
---
Nah it has so many bangers on it
---
As long as you had requested one it the past, it's covered by ACCC current choice to grand EVERYONE refund rights in that time. Just talk to Beth again and ACCC if needed. The link in my OP should give you more needed info on this. :)
---
That is the one thing I don't have, Only have infinite basic build stuff,  only recently cracked 100lvl. Wish I had flux to give.
---
Why do you think that "fisting" is P2W?
---
\*Palpatine walks in\* I WILL MAKE IT LEGAL.
---
We actually need someone nuking whitesprings for today's daily challenge . That guy was doing everyone a favor
---
And they did the numbers and found 12.99 to be a better price point.
---
They have more experience at this kind of thing than you.
---
But then you don‚Äôt get a shot on the squatch - right?  So you are playing just for the rewards ?
---
have screws, gears, and adhesive, and essentially the other building stuff, when on, I am open to give it away.
---
Yeah the biggest DLC for FO76 isn‚Äôt hard to top.
---
I know that, as a consumer in Australia, I can IGNORE POLICY IF IT IS TRUMPED BY THE LAW. In AUS the LAW always takes priority over company policy. HOWEVER Bethesda DID NOT STATE that no refunds would be given, not at launch. When I got the game there was NO INFORMATION about refunds being denied.
---
Not just for me.
---
#DonutsForAll2020
---
They said that after all the pre-order people bought the game too. But only after.
---
Had a burger that had black buns for Halloween. Guess just colouring things black is part of the Halloween spirit
---
no...the traderbot at trainstations
---
No, I was still here for the NEWS and my HOPE that the game might actually improve, what with that was my only hope after Bethesda refused to follow the law and refund me initially. Don't worry, I'll leave you all alone after this, I just hoped my message would inform more people and help them.
---
Australia is a BIG market, in the past companies have had their asses handed to them or had to change specifically FOR US. Fallout 3 had a tiny thing, Med-X was originally Morphine, but Australia demanded they change it or class the drugs to have drug use, making that akin to 18+ that AT THE TIME was not sold in AUS. Steam has been forced to offer refunds to users thanks to Australia, that whole refund before 2 hours or whatnot? Yeah, AUS got us that. At least here. They also had GTA 4 changed to be sold here. So I think we're save from being blacklisted, due to companies being scared of being blacklisted BY US.
---
I've gotten some pretty good stuff from the preveyor
---
This is the most entitled post ever. You should be embarrassed.
---
But if you stop and think, how many servers did they have after survival got shelved?
---
Lets say 30 instances. 30 servers as an example:
---
These 30 servers where modified to acommendate 8 players including the world owner. Im pretty sure there was more than 30 people that signed up for Fo1st.
---
Remember each person who subscribes, gets their own world. Bethesda may had to buy extra servers from AWS to accomendate the extra private worldspaces they provide to Fo1st Subscribers.
---
No sadly that is the one commodity I lack, with junk though, ethically I view I can't sell it since I have it infinitely.
---
I ran into the Flatwoods monster this afternoon for the first time ever. Agro music played, he disappeared, I remember thinking what the heck is this!?!? in a more adult language though
---
I wouldn‚Äôt go so far as to say I‚Äòll keep enjoying the game, but I got my money‚Äôs worth. I‚Äôm wrapping up Outer Worlds right now and it seems I will have spent the same amount of money for 30ish hours of entertainment there vs the 100 I got in Fo76.
---
LOL true ! I forgot about liberty. he talks when you're trying to talk to other players and sometimes he is quite for a long time and you forget about him. then when youre nice and relaxed he jump scares the ever living shit out of you. COMMUNIST DETECTED.  yup female softer ai.
---
Well, you know what they say about FO76: it‚Äôs not the best choice.... it‚Äôs spacers choice.
---
My most recent trade was a bloodied fatman.
---
Agreed.  I love it.  üëçüëçüëç
---
Consumer protection in Canada largely sits at the provincial level, so look in to your provincial consumer protection and the agency that enforces it. 
---
For example, here in BC we have the Business Practices and Consumer Protection Act , enforced by Consumer Protection BC. Not sure what section of the act you'd rely on, but just complain to the relevant agency and let them work out if they can do anything.
---
Look, nothing against people who like the game. I don't like it, but it also was broken for me and there were a few lies told about the game. They also lied about our right to a refund, a big NO NO over here.
---
I'd rather my money back and to have rights that worry that they might not deem to sell games to me anymore. But besides that, companies are more worried about being blacklisted in our market. They'd never refuse to sell here unless it REALLY wasn't worth it. But they make a lot of money here, they've changed things in the past JUST SO THEY COULD SELL IN AUS. Steam and Bethesda have both in the past had to change in order to keep doing business here.
---
As a explosive laser user I sadly have to use both
---
You still havent shown me any graphs on any of their calculations on the monthly price.
---
Its my word vs your word.
---
Plus 12.99 is still more expensive than most streaming subscriptions. 7.99 would attract more people to join.
---
Thx, will post here or on 76 facebook with junk when I have tons. Glad this post made it through, posted osimilar that seemed to be deleted.
---
not this fallout firster. giving it away would involve going through the tedious inventory system which is why I love having the junk box anyway. for close friends I already give and help but I will be avoiding that tedious inventory management as much as possible.
---
They'll probably make a female liberty prime eventually. Most likely fallout 1st only though.
---
Oh, good fellow! I traveled to a base one time, which was kind of like a saw (movie) thing, you had to figure the way out or die. After you figured it out it led to vendors with cheap prices and vintage nukashine. I usually make my camps look like real homes, though i found that so clever, id love to make my own. I need the ingredients to make maybe 3 decontamination showers. If you should have them
---
As someone who used to be homeless, I highly value ALL my money. I don't like to waste it. $70 USD can feed me for a week. So YES, I want my money.
---
Oh man, you're doing great! I wish i would need it. but my C.A.M.P. budget has been exceeded and i can't build literally few more basic items i need to. I wish Bethesda would double the budget so i could finish my masterpiece.
---
P.S. I can't show you any photos of infinished buildin :( It's still under constructon.
---
I never claimed to know more than them like you are.
---
What analytics are you basing your price point on? Exactly, nothing.
---
I still don't expect it to be free and I'm completely ok with this. But the scrap box and tent should be free
---
No problems here, seems fixed.  PC.
---
It's pretty fun clan on clan. I'm an Aussie with a couple of American friends I met on here, and there always doing clan wars. It's also fun to join in üòÇü§£
---
Yeah. Their support team has been hardcore hitting the copy paste lately, sadly. I'm on my third reply waiting to actually get a legitimate answer.
---
Only ones I care about are claimed ones
---
Which platform are you on?
---
You may not like him minister, but you gotta admit; Dumbledore's got style!
---
Just because I'm not rich dosn't mean I'm not entitled to enjoy an escape from reality, or try to. I'd rather spend my hard earned money on games than drugs or alcohol. Though, when a game does not provide me with entertainment, that is a waste of money (among the other reasons I refunded). 
---
What you are saying is, if you don't have much money you should only ever spend it on rent, food and water. To survive and live a shit boring life. No thanks. 
---
I've said this a few times now but, I used to be homeless and I value EVERY BIT of my money, when it is wasted like this, I want it back. ALSO The game cost $100 in Australia, because everything is more expensive here. (that's about $69 USD right now).
---
Astounding. Ish.
---
suits me I already subscribed. in the old days gaming was a prohibitive expensive hobby. pcs were expensive internet was expensive, and the original online games were all subscription based like UO WoW etc. then pcs got cheaper games got free to play and the more main stream and accessible gaming got the dumber and more obnoxious the player base became. now its just a bunch of crybabies expecting free stuff. if you cant afford 13 a month you should probably be gaming less and working / improving yourself more. whining about it on the internet is the least constructive thing you can do.
---
I'm surprised I haven't seen any posts talking about this yet. Every time I log on I have 3 - 4 dailies that are automatically active, even if I'm no where near them.
---
My hobby is gaming, and I'll play 76 till I die.
---
Entitled, TO MY RIGHTS AS A CONSUMER AND HUMAN, YES. Thank the Australian Law and thank goodness that people like you don't pass laws here.
---
But you did say you knew the numbers but failed to provide proof.
---
Look i base the price on other subscriptions in the market. The Fo1st monthly plan is more than a month of Playstation Plus monthly while not offering near the value PS plus offers.
---
Its more than Netflix standard plan and only a dollar cheaper thsn their top of the line plan. Once again the value isnt there to support the price.
---
PC
---
That's handy as hell.
---
Found the Bethesa shill. Gave me a good chuckle.  Almost human-like.
---
I wish I had the flux for those, only recently cracked lvl 100. I can't even make my own decon shower.. Looking to help those that need screws, gears, and other basic what needs.
---
I wasn't complaining about it. I was trying to make a joke. Also i don't think I'm aloud to work at 14.
---
Now get to work on fuel price rorts you ACCC peanuts.
---
welp your fat fingering fumbling will take some time to sort out. the world is full of idiots who cannot master the extremely technical manipulations of the atomic shop so I guess you will have to submit another ticket. maybe practice some fine motor skills and wait till they can work their way through the pile of spacticly clicking teens to get to you. take a number and suck it up. maybe do some thinking about how to avoid fat fingering things in the future.

Americans need to gather funds to lobby for a ‚Äúlegal path to refund‚Äù in situations like this. No company should be allowed to behave in a manner that doesn‚Äôt provide fair trade. Somewhere along the line software companies started thinking that they weren‚Äôt nerds and dweebs, and that got them thinking that they could bully gamers around and rip them off. Laws and trade agreements involving fairness in trade, that require the enforcement of sanctions and the freezing of assets, including the revocation of rights to continue trading their products in the international marketplace, should take care of that bullshit. How do we get that going?
---
Holy shit this is so embarrassing
---
They played for more than six hours because Bethesda refused refunds for a year....
---
I‚Äôd like 999999999999 plastic please
---
I view it as simply asking what you  need, hate that there is no text chat, but am buying a mic so I can ask people what thy need when they run across me. Bethesda, text chat or in game mail... Get on it.
---
LOL sorry reading that I can see the problem I will edit it. it was a genral rant about the player base not you specifically. I was feeling your vibe /sarc and trying to expand on it not attack you specifically.
---
Pretty much anywhere but the US.
---
Didn't buy this at release, did you?
---
How? Talk about it, complain, speak with representatives. If enough people ask or demand something and aren't silent, it can and will happen. Just need to make enough noise and be noticed by the right people. 
---
Remember a politition will always help you IF it helps them. What helps them? People on their side and as possible votes due to the support they give to us.
---
What does this even mean.   Are you saying I screwed it up? I‚Äôve been transferred to 7 different ‚Äúagents‚Äù and it‚Äôs all been atomic shop until this time.
---
Send me a message if you need repair items, I can check my inventory, I am a bit of a hoarder/scrap hound. Gotta scarp it all. If I have it I offer it freely.
---
Oh lol sorry. That's probably a problem on my side. My autism and ADHD makes it hard for me to understand that stuff. Heck when i was tested on it the person tested me handed me a paper that had a bunch of facial expressions. And i got 0 out of 20 on it.
---
It's not about a movie being shitty. It's more if the movie didn't work. If I go to a movie and it, say, skips an entire scene or plays like a slideshow, you're goddamn right I'm demanding a refund.
---
Would a Bethesda shill say FUCK BETHESDA AND THERE FUCKING PTW SUBSCRIPTION
---
wouldn't we all. Bought sub today, if I have tons of plastic, I'll hit you up for a drop.
---
I did actually.. It played just fine for me. It was far from perfect but I really didn't have the vast majority of issues people complained about.
---
Certainly wasn't the worst game I've played at launch.
---
Xbox. Although I've seen people saying they've been experiencing it on ps4 too and a little bit on pc.
---
there were lots of you's and yours in it so it could have been easily misconstrued by anyone. it was written badly I changed it a bit .
---
it read sort of like the robot vendoer in free states talks. "you think the federal government blah blah blah" mother fucker dont tell me what I think.
---
Daaaayum...why are ya actually mad? (Don't worry. I used my skinny finger.)
---
*Because it didn't work as advertised*
---
It's a multiplayer game, just to remind you.
---
oh yeah man I am just so furious I am shaking sooooooooo mad grrrrr raaaargh. thats it! you nailed it.  you are one smart cookie too I can tell already.
---
Why for free? They still have to put in the time, effort, and sometimes caps in order to get all of that. Heavily discounted? Maybe they could do that. Completely free? FUCK no.
---
Give us the aliens too! üòÅ
---
Then don't bother
---
You forgot the heavy breathing.
---
Lol. That vendor was always annoying. But i do understand where your coming from. The new age grew up with having things easy. With video games they're used to having free things and having it be really easy. But then are basically insulted over needing to pay for something. Or in school where they are used to teachers giving yhem everything they need and basically spelling out answers for them. But then they get to a point where they need to do their own form of studying they just complain about it being too hard. It's just what they grew up used to. And I'm not excluding myself either. I was upset over fallout 1st as well. Only about the costumes but still upset. And i know it's not the best way to live but it's hard for me to change that when i grew up with it.
---
Cranberry moonshine and nuka dark are all you‚Äôre missing, firecracker whiskey and it‚Äôs variants were never added to the game
---
I am saying by your own words you Fucked up a simple transfer. now your requesting a refund - now youre mad because youre gonna have to wait for customer support to fix your transfer. instead of loudly complaining about it here perhaps try not fucking up something so simple in the future.
---
Why do you EXPECT to get free stuff for THEM paying?
---
How can we leverage this to other countries and games?! I have been doing everything short of mailing my fecies trying to get an Anthem refund. My shit stinks less rhan theirs but i still get no refund.
---
Ok. So because it worked fine for you, there were no issues? Did you go on a full internet blackout for six months after the game released or something? For many, maybe even most, the game ran like shit on release.
---
This is a pointless post.
---
SWEAR A BLOOD OATH THAT YOU AREN'T A SHILL!
---
Imagine if they included the main building interior as part of the event. Now that would be mayhem. Constant endless robot spawning.
---
It prolly wont glow
---
Nah.
---
I am not sure when I said I expected anything, I simply ask that those who access to the ability to have more scrap then they can use due to the advantage they paid for to share the wealth, I apologise if that offended you
---
I never said I knew the numbers, I said they did the numbers.
---
And again, they have more experience with this than you.
---
Ok
---
Look, I really don't care to ague with someone who can't even read.
---
&gt;When a consumer has purchased a product that has a fault which amounts to a major failure
---
&gt; That's the point I don't understand, **personally.** **Genuinely.**
---
&gt; The game works for me. **Did it not work for you?**
---
It worked for me.
---
As for blackout, yes actually. I moved and was pretty busy from January 2019 til now so I haven't cared.
---
Every time I popped into the game, it worked just fine. I don't personally see the issue but if you read my comment and try to understand my point, you may see I'm not trying to be a jackass but I'm actually curious.
---
I don't come to these forums frequently. Everyone here is angry af and I don't need that negative energy in my life.
---
are you putting your junk in your vendor at 0 caps or do people have to actually  approach you and ask you for this free junk? I appreciate the sentiment (you are a 'Hero of the Wasteland' for sure) but what you're doing is basically the equivalent of telling someone hey if you need money I'll give it to you because I have an infinite amount. I have a job and since I go to work every day and they give me money, I have it infinitely therefore I will give it away for free.  You sir/ma'am/chosen pronoun, are a better man/woman/chosen pronoun than me and I applaud you. Hopefully when my level gets in the triple digits I will be able to afford to be as generous as you but for now unless it's steel wood or cloth even though I can store it infinitely I still burn through it so fast I don't have enough to give away. (Especially screws, Ho Lee fuk I go through screws so quick I buy them any chance I get... As long as the vendors not charging douchebag level prices then I just go to work and grind for them)
---
That's funny... I bet you wanted Bernie to win the election
---
Take your dirty communism and shove it.
---
Then don't but understand your not helping a game you like stay alive
---
What did I screw up exactly? I‚Äôm not mad either, or complaining.
---
Because he's a young post millennial. Everything should be free
---
I will shove it, keep the game alive your don't
---
So, by financially supporting the game I like, I'm killing it? Sound logic.
---
A red slap or a blue slap doesn't matter, it's about keeping the game alive
---
We can do 0 caps??? that will make this easier, posting it in bulk for all.
---
Ive posted about this before, do they kill everyone in your team with one shot too? Not one shot missing, and killing even with marine armor and mutations?
---
"You, the fans, asked for it, and we heard you loud and clear! Introducing: Fallout 2nd!"
---
I didn't say don't buy FO1st I encourage it, just pay it forward
---
&gt; I see most of the sub complaining about his game except *they are still playing*
---
So, you should read that sentence until you understand it because your response indicates you do not.
---
And how does me giving away my junk keep the game alive?
---
"TheThirdGate, what you just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response, were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul."
---
I own every Beth game up to Skyrim. I love their games. After Skyrim I said I wouldn't buy another game of theirs until they actually started using a new game engine. I am just so tired of all of the same problems and limitations. I haven't bought a Beth game since. Dropped them like a rock. I'm not sure why anyone feels any loyalty to any corporation. Those corporations are not loyal to you.
---
Well then theres something else out there that offers what Bethesda does.
---
Sighs, best wishes my friend, not sure how to explain having a large player base is a good thing
---
They are holding it back to monetize it in a few months.
---
Ok boomer
---
I‚Äôts a unique variant of the combat rifle, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs exactly the same thing. Notice it already has a unique paint job.
---
\&gt;Clearly breaks sub rules  
---
\&gt;Gets banned by mods
---
\&gt;"The Mods are paid off!"
---
You're overestimating the number of people who are going to quit playing because of it.
---
This would be awesome... if TSEs were actually worth a shit...
---
Wow. You really are, lol
---
I might be, my sample size is 2 me and my wife, still don't understand why you have an issue paying it forward
---
Touched the heart did it
---
I was just thinking how you might be stopping in at a train station and you hear someones radio as they go by
---
Free stuff wouldnt help. Others would just sell it in their camps. I put some stuff in my vendor near V76 and had stims and low level BOS rifles for new players for free and some dickhead higher level took them all.
---
You don't expect a slightly feature boosted version of the service with a much lower player cap (cheaper to run) to be free? Despite all the talk of ALL DLC being free forever? This is so little it doesn't even qualify as DLC, but something that should have been added to the base game.
---
This is why Bethesda feels quite confident going back on that promise.
---
Cool, you do you üëç
---
Omg my husband bought me I think the 10$ pack and my 18 month old got ahold of my controller and purchased a 1300 atom pack. I didn‚Äôt even like anything in it and imo really wasn‚Äôt worth what was in it. It was disappointing, but kids will be kids lol I feel ur pain
---
oh that game your playing is it ? 
---
 I am saying by your own words you Fucked up a simple transfer.  you bought something on accident from the atomic shop. you literally say so in the title. 
---
by quoting their line here on a public forum you are implying that their customer support sucks, thats a complaint, or it at minimum it reads like a whine. 
---
I am pointing out the fact by that buying the thing on accident the whole situation is mostly your fault I am directly telling you that your whining is annoying and you should definately be more carefull in the future when buying things. I am expounding on that further by explaining that the world is full of people who spasticly spam buttons and a customer support team can only go through so many at a time so you should definately go talk to them instead of posting some beta wuss whine thread. if you cant comprehend what I am putting down you should probably stop gaming all together and take up being a vegetable.
---
Because I'm not spending my time and effort farming junk to just give it away. How does that make sense?
---
All I got from that is how much you love Todd Howard's lies?
---
That one guy was using an automatic weapon but it did normal damage  he was still aiming at the sky when he killed me.
---
Considering it's you and 15 others.
---
Not a loss LOL
---
Happens
---
yup super angry I am getting trolled so hard grrr rargh salt everywhere.

Okay, finally got pics uploaded. Took forever to figure out where they were stored! The camp's mundane but well-intended and still has some work to go ‚Ä¶ I need to add some Scorched parts to the lab, for example, and decorate, but, here's where it is as of this morning:

I feel that this would have the opposite effect of what you are trying to achieve. 
---
Grinding and hunting for materials is a relatively large part of the game. Without that element, a big part of the game is lost.
---
Already got 5 Pm's praising me.
---
Pointless Lies
---
BAN ME!
---
Are you going to ban me Schill?
---
It doesn't make since to you so don't do it, your way may the best way I can't see the future

&gt;majority

Lol ok then

Of course you did puddin'. You're a brave little soldier.

Pics are up!

Please be kind. It's still a humble lil' thing.

All sweet little lies Todd so cute.

Did you get permission from Uncle Pete before you posted?
---
I had this for three rounds in a row, was no way someone could see me or my team then we get head shot by full auto .50cals and handmade rifles, they where not spraying the area it was only head shits, this happened while we where in buildings so guessing aim bot or X-ray mods.
---
Pics are up! Please be kind. It's still a tiny lil' thing.
---
My god, why!?
---
Suck it up is how you deal with it.
---
Been a problem since inception and bethesda is not equipped to fix it
---
You may absolutely be right, just not how I see it, I am often wrong
---
I am happy ranting...if that makes any sense lol. I like calling out doltish behavior online with a bunch of internet strangers. dunno why I can almost see the mental machinations of wanna be trollers grinding in the back ground as they try to turn their "sic burns" in the right direction.
---
They can already do that ? Put it on a frame and it weighs 10
---
I know, right? When I take pics, I always leave goodies as well. Usually a roll of film and some wine, but sometimes a bit more. Adding Halloween candy right now's a good bonus. I've been dropping those all over.
---
Jason Schreier was right.
---
Literal paid schills over here LMAO!!!
---
Yeh but that was before it was a legendary available. They were a novelty back then but honestly how many people run around with non legendary anything weapons anymore? Plus the agurement is it uses combat mods like the enclave plasma does don't get me started on it
---
It will be in the "Fallout 2nd" subscription rewards. Thanks for your suggestion.
---
I hate you...but your probably right
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
nice shadow ban like the others. I love it.
---
They‚Äôre usually pretty good about it if you tell them the truth, I‚Äôve had my account automatically buy at least 2 things and I‚Äôm the only one with access to my account.   Most of the time they let you keep the items, so now I‚Äôve got a useless race car bed.
---
No need to tell it to everyone. Just uninstall.
---
I'd pay Bethesda for a scrap cannon and shoot my new apparent wealth ?(  because I bought the craft bag ported from eso where it works exactly the same and not had any issues )at people
---
LOL kids are notoriously fat fingered. my son spilled mountain dew on my keyboard during an important discussion. it was my turn to type but all they saw was bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr. anyway had to call some peeps and explain that shit lol.

I can't get any quests from Biv. Would love to collect recipes.

I just played against another one just now......

Haha I was farming the asylum the other day and I had to help my one of my little ones and my 6 year old was running around and spinning all crazy and I had someOne message me ‚Äú????‚Äù
---
I thought about messaging them but then I thought it was basically like a present from him so I wasn‚Äôt too worried.
---
The people who paid for their 'advantage' don't owe you anything. Keep playing the game and have fun. Don't get jelly cause someone has more imaginary garbage than you do.
---
I just started playing that mode two days ago level 115 on main game but level 14 in NW, played about 30 matchs, had three matchs with no cheaters the rest I had to send the game setting up traps using mines or finding a place to hide.
---
I agree they owe me nothing, didn't ask for anything
---
It seems like, if I do them once, it's assumed I always want to do them. It's a bit of a pain in the rump.
---
Yeah I was disappointed they included plans like the resort signs and gilded clock. I wish they would‚Äôve included all plans that can‚Äôt be found in regular play
---
I see your argument but given it‚Äôs a unique variant with a skin I see why you can‚Äôt skin it. The fixer is more or less an in game combat rifle skin. It‚Äôs like the unique weapons in Fallout New Vegas, where you can‚Äôt mod them like the other weapons. In this case you can mod it, but the skin is more or less what makes it ‚ÄúThe Fixer.‚Äù
---
YOU THINK I SHOULD JUST DO GOOD THINGS?! IS THAT THE WORLD WE LIVE IN YOU DAMN BERNIE VOTER?! IF I WANT TO SPREAD MY VILENESS TO A VIDEOGAME I WILL! WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO ASK FOR NEXT, HUH SOCIALIST? ENDING HUNGER? TREATING THE POORS WHO GET CANCER?! YOU ARE A DISGRACE TO AMERICA!
---
Has anyone received a response to their ticket for refund yet. If you have do they just refund to the payment method provided when purchased or can they refund to a different account. I purchased with a temp card and will  not have access to the funds should the refund be issued to that card.

I'm in a clan made up of 4 Japanese people and 3 Americans, I'm one of the Japanese ones, we really don't take part in a war but we have a town-like area in western cranberry bog, 7 C.A.M.Ps in a circle.
---
No, they have had way too many chances. People here remind me of spouses in abusive relationships thinking that Bethesda will change or there not that bad. They have given us a black eye and 5 broken ribs that ain't love!
---
It's always a challenge figuring out if it's a noob or an alt character, unless they're wearing like a plague mask or something. I just sold them because I figure it cut down on people selling dropped plans. (Of course I'm sure the person who bought all 3 of my witch masks planned on doing just that)
---
About 3 weeks ago I decided that I'd take my more pedestrian ones and out them in the cash registers at train stations. No deep pocketed armor plans but no single action ivory grips either.
---
Nope XB1
---
I don‚Äôt think what they‚Äôve done here is that obscene. The game launched broken (bad but not unlike previous Bethesda games) they added some utility items to the shop (a dumb move but it frankly doesn‚Äôt change much) and now they are paywalling content.
---
The paywall I think is the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back. And if Bethesda listens to the backlash then they have the opportunity to not do such stupid things.
---
(I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs more controversy around this game but I‚Äôm just going off hand)
---
I always put them in my vending for 1 cap
---
   At 14 I was saving up for my first vehicle by cutting grass and working at farms. probably started working at 10 or 12 looking back, by the time I was 15 I had about 3000 bucks saved up and bought a used truck the day after I got my learners license. could not wait to drive. I never even questioned that to get money I had to work and that to get ANYTHING in the world I would have to pay. 
---
   My son on the other hand, completely different upbringing and environment. no farms for him to work at. wasn't even eager to drive, he is 18 now and has his first job. its a completely different world he lives in and trying to explain something as simple as work ethic and independance to him or really any young person these days is so much harder than I would have ever believed. if someone says " They charge to much its too expensive" my reaction is. "then dont buy it" but then they branch off into " theyre greedy theyre bad" - no motherfucker they have a product for sale at x amount if you cant afford it don't buy it or go make more money. they can charge 500 dollars for this game if they want to. its their game. if it became 500 dollars my post would simply be " damn ! ok I am out. " and I would just quit playing. having some sort of crusade or protest in this forum is just a dumb shit thing to do. I don't get these peeps. the entitlement, the whineyness blech.
---
I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs an oversight. If that‚Äôs the case, this will be in the patch notes in a month or so. I‚Äôm not really surprised. Attention to detail doesn‚Äôt seem to be high priority down in Austin.
---
Try the gays
---
We can live in hope! Yeh I know but they are trying I suppose just disappointing.
---
It's probably a set value per item because there's a perk that reduces construction costs but it doesn't do anything for camp budget as far as I know. If it does I haven't seen anybody mention it but I can't speak personally because I don't have that perk. (If it does make a difference I'm going to start a new character and build the Taj Mahal. Lol)
---
Made me think of this meme that took too long to find
---
[brrrrrrrrr](https://youtu.be/Yn4se09rnl8)
---
I get it. If you consider this to be a success, good for you.
---
This post could be from myself...
---
...Back when the first atom shop repair kits dropped.
---
Good times.
---
Lmao
---
How?
---
I wish more folks would take a stand like you have. All this talk of being fed up with Bethesda and yet they still play, and even sink bits- er- atoms into the game. I left a few months ago myself, without a sound. Just uninstalled and didn't look back. 
---
I gotta say, I haven't lost a wink of sleep over it. 
---
We have our fond memories to look back on and that's what matters, I think. I paid the $60 at launch and, despite all the bugs and issues, definitely got my money's worth out of the game. Anymore it seems like more headache than it's worth.
---
So all I can do is just deal with it?
---
It's a specific value depending on the item, it roughly represents how costly it is to render and process the object within the overall budget purpose being to stop full camps from killing the framerate too much.
---
But Imaginary garbage is all i have. And my right hand. Ok gotta run
---
Wow. I don't know who is downvoting you quicker - the Fallout 1st subs who feel insulted or the people who think you shouldn't defend Fallout 1st subs.
---
I really don't think they will be able to make this game look great. You see, we have this hacker problem that's been plaguing the game for quite some time. They have no working anti cheat, they don't do nothing when people report cheaters, it seems Bethesda decided to just ignore all these hacking problems and expect people to be just ignorant about it. When this gets big, there will be another fiasco I'm 100% sure
---
If they hadn't fixed it by Halloween I can't say i have hope they even care.
---
The game came out unfinished not broken, as an idot who bought the $80 edition and played the since beta I know this. Most of their games come out with way to many bugs but this was not that, this was shit like stuff not loading enemy's not have attacknor moving animations guns looked in part not together as well.as many other things.
---
Many's things have happens since but they are still way to many bugs around many that are 3 or more months old. And yeah they have made so many stupid moves with the atom shop. They have shown they care about money  if you spend big at the atomic shop you a good honest player, if you complain about bu does then your a bad person.
---
Then the people hear talk about it and after a couple of negative response we get some like this OP who ether say we should forgiven and forget or just complains about seeing so much negative.
---
I have never seen a community like this one, most are on the same page with few stragglers. Bethesda won't listen to fan feed back not unless player count drops like a rock like survival did. 
---
I quit after the release of fridges and scrap bot, haven't been on since only heard about the subscription on the news. These guy have become worse then Take Two because even GTA  online despite its pay to win bullshit and annoying kids was fun to change with friends in a private world doing shit without interruption , but in 76 I have to pay to have that option.
---
Well I wouldn‚Äôt know about that, I‚Äôve been playing the game since launch and haven‚Äôt encountered any hackers so far.
---
nice back handed compliment sir but a clean miss saw the back handed aspect immedieatly and counter by saying hell yes its a success. go think some more slowboi.
---
Oh you poor fool.
---
You will see one day how blind you are now, like a lot of us were before.
---
If you were like me, it would have happened after Fallout 4. If you were smarter, maybe back with Oblivion's horse armour.
---
Remember this post and this moment because that day will come when you finally get it.
---
Your console can't handle the event. get a better console or go PC
---
It'd be faster if you just tried.
---
This made my day.üòÇüòÇ
---
Well, it applies to all games in AUS, as well as anything sold here as a good (even games as "service" are goods in AUS, fucking companies trying to re-define games to get away with shit). As for other countries, the best I can think of is talk lots, complain, both at the company and your representatives. Dunno how it works in most places, but you should be able to talk to rep's, better if you get lots of likeminded people to join you. Remember to stick to your guns and keep things legit, or you only hurt yourself.
---
If you have anything similar to ACCC, ask around, see what they think about all this.
---
But, none of this is true.
---
You could until one player takes it all to resell it...
---
I doubt they care. I love this game, but I guess the crashing is just part of the game now.
---
Yeah, can attest to the fact that they didn't get everything when they did the Dev Room cleanup. Ran into a camp well after that, it had a Thirst Zapper, Laser Musket and other FO4/dev room items on display
---
I think maybe they just don't like you.
---
I‚Äôm sorry, I didn‚Äôt think this was r/pcmasterrace. Maybe you should put this comment there instead of here.
---
It's just a lunch a month, and I have the ability to throw it around while being richer than you.
---
Try getting yourself into a PVP situation. If you are playing NW or anywhere near decent while doing adventure mode pvp and can fight back, they turn that shit on or even resort to editing the game client itself and start wreaking havoc. Good luck trying to report them cause Bethesda doesn't give a fuck
---
I'm trying to look how to off load stuff to help fellow players, hate me because I bought a sub, but my personal thoughts are if I can share the wealth since I can give the scrap I have infinite access to.
---
you can't fix stupid. also jesus christ the mods are fast at deleting shit. must've hit a nerve or something.
---
Same, but i seem to love dumpster fires. Take my ex wife as an example
---
TSE? Pff, useless.
---
Haha very nice üëç
---
Yeah I‚Äôm gonna have to agree with you on a lot of those points. Maybe I‚Äôm just too nostalgic towards the company for my own good.
---
Either way I‚Äôm going to try my best and keep being patient with ‚Äòem.
---
That is them,  not me, or any other 76 subber that offers the same when it comes to junk.
---
Are boomers that stupid? I said it'd be faster and you went "hate me all you like", wtf?
---
Fair enough, I suppose I haven‚Äôt done much pvp in my day.
---
No I'm serious. Xbox one lacks power. It's not just consoles shitty PCs are having the same issue. At least you can lower your settings when you are playing a pc version of this game. Don't take this as a troll post or a pc dude trying to shit on consoles.
---
I make deep pocketed leather and BOS sniper rifles for low levels all the time to help out. 
---
However I‚Äôve seen generosity like items for 0 caps be taken advantage of, that‚Äôs why I mentioned it.
---
Great job suggesting an idea Bethesda will most likely monetize.
---
I have an active 1st subscription, I also never run or jump because it crashes the moment i do, if someone runs or jumps in my line of view it crashes, and the worst part is multiple times the game crashed and it respawned me on top of the legendary sentry as its exploding. This event is complete trash.
---
I wish I could say the same but these are no longer the people who made my favorite game ES4 Oblivion. They something different something darker and evil!
---
Fallout 4 was already on a dated engine and had its issues typical of Bethesda games but it was forgiveable. 76 is not what people really wanted being an MMO we had to make lemonade out of lemons but the idea is not bad its a fun game. Weve adapted.  A year later and here we have another large event with alot of people unable to do it due to crashing, and another broke prize RNG. 
---
I dont even have to discuss 1st or atom shop items. Its straight exhausting at this point. Its a lot of little things we can overlook but its just always there and new events have been very disappointing to alot of players both in content and in the rewards you get for it or the infinite grind you have to do to maybe possibly get a good item. Combined with the fact that most events are dead in days. Its hard to be optimistic when many have been trying that for a year straight and than you sign on and crash within minutes.
---
zero
---
I wouldn‚Äôt go so far as to call them evil. I think they‚Äôve just fallen out of touch, and if they get a good reality check they might keep strong.
---
Dang, I can tell you haven't been playing for quite some time, at least for about half an year.
---
I can maintain a solid 60 FPS in the Scorched Earth event. Frame rate is still more than decent before it crashes. I honestly don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the console.
---
Honestly my goal in beta was to make it to the lake in the top right corner of the map,only made it to doly sodstho and last thing i did was claim it(level 12.)
---
When the game released i lived at thunder moutain power plant trying to rebuild and help out others. By keeping the power running. 
---
Took till level 50 till i decided to quest tho.
---
Was really focused on how to build and manitain workshops for public facility and defences. And still going hard.
---
Just stop playing the game. Bethesda is just going to add more game improvements and items for 1st players only and they are going to leave no subscribers in the dust with a broken tedious game.
---
Everyone knows that as of now Bethesda develops the game only for Fallout 1st players.
---
ya that could be it, but I live in the SF Bay Area, we have the best and fastest internet in the world, I have 1 gig a second internet
---
I'm betting at least $25,000
---
This game is so shitty it can't really run smooth on top PCs, nor any console.
---
They also lost a war to emus which isn‚Äôt exactly a proud achievement
---
Bethesda obviously lack the ability to scan and auto ban hack users. Well at least do something when people report those fuckers. Wtf is wrong with these people? They release a battleroyale mode and have pvp in the main game but don't give a fuck when hackers are taking advantage? Just remove pvp element from this game if that's how you gonna manage this shilpile of a game
---
As a PC gamer on public servers I get laggy during the event, if the event is nuked I get even more laggy. if a bunch of ultra high levels show up firing duped legacy split beam 2 shot exploding plasma gatling gun the whole damn server crashes. the lag is real. a large part of it is dupers and shitty players using duped legacy crap they bought off the internet. Beth needs to delete those files already. the players who use them and the weapons them selfs suck for the game. maybe while beth is doing that they can just get rid of energy weapons turning bodies into goo and ash piles because that causes a lot of problems too apparently.
---
I think fallout 76 still has potential with wastelanders.
---
I feel like at this point they are trying to pad time until wastelanders is released. If it‚Äôs as ambitious as they are saying then I believe it would bring them back to their former glory.
---
Besides that I do see where you are getting at and agree with much of what your saying.
---
‚ÄòSuppose it‚Äôs just a matter of optimism.
---
What even is that? I keep hearing abt it in HOI 4 vids but I can't just assume Australia lost a war to literal emus it had to be a tribe or something called the emus not the actual bird right?
---
Many many people have not given up or even considered it- Reddit is not a good example of what the general population is like or the general overall opinions. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I love Reddit I‚Äôm on it all day but outside of this sub not many people care about fallout first etc.
---
They aren't everywhere, Australia is an entire continent. The weather, flora and fauna varies where you go.
---
&gt;  ability to scan and auto ban hack users. Well they can at least do something when people actually report those fuckers. Wtf is wrong with these people? They release a battleroyale mode and have pvp in the main game but don't give a fuck when hackers are taking advantage? Just remove pvp element from this gam
---
Well "mange" is too strong of a word because in order to manage something poorly you have to be able  actively screw it up in the first place.
---
Apparently yes... Boomers are oten drunk.. atleast this one is. Hate me if you want. I want to help you. scrap is scrap, I have an unfair infinite containment of it. I offer my scrap for free. what I can offer that is.
---
I won‚Äôt give you junk for free- you can come play on my server tho and collect what you want.
---
just picked this up the other day at gamestop
---
What's the current meta now then? I also haven't seriously played since Dec. 2018 but I'm getting back into it now and as far as I can tell my TSE Gatling Gun is still powerful enough to solo the Mischief event with, although admittedly with much care.
---
No the lost to emus, the bird. Basically the emus were being a nuisance so for what ever reason they declared war on the emus. The reason they lost the war was because the emus were still being a nuisance and there was something like 10 bullets fired per confirmed kill plus some other mishaps that I can‚Äôt remember.
---
Everybody complaining about the pay wall is just crying to hear themselves whine and get validation from others. I see tons of them say they've been playing since beta. That means the majority of them have hundreds if not close to a thousand hours of game time. to me that seems like they've gotten their $60 worth and they're just a bunch of crying little Mitch's wanting shit for free now. there are no other RPGs that you can get a hundred hours worth of game play that are not made by Bethesda/zenimax (with the possible exception of gw2) that are not boring as fuck after the first 20-30 hours unless you have OCD (Minecraft). to give up on Bethesda just because they're trying to get a subscription service to support the further development of the game is childish. (Downvote me all you want I already think you're a bunch of mitches, downvotes won't hurt my feelings, it will just confirm my opinion of you) . Everybody who 'gives up on Bethesda' and take their ball and go home for all I care. I also think this shit with the Australian government getting involved is a bunch of bs. The entire continent of Australia should be happy I'm not the CEO of zenimax/bgs because I would give them ALL refunds  whether they wanted it or not and I would never export one of my games to their country again. they would get a big FU when they started complaining about where's my fallout 5?!, where's my Elder Scrolls 6?! Along with an automated message from a bot saying...
---
'We reserve the right to refuse service to any crying little mitches that get their government involved over their dissatisfaction with a fucking VIDEO GAME.' 
---
(I bought games that I didn't like. did I whine incessantly about it on a public forum and demand a refund? No. I made a note to self and I never bought one of their games again. Maybe it's because I'm older and I played games in an era where quite often they didn't live up to the trailer so I'm desensitized. I couldn't honestly say, all I know is, to me all this shit seems ridiculous and petty)
---
And if the Australian government came at us for refusing to sell to their citizens as CEO I would just tell them. "Murica damn it!, The population of your entire continent barely tops that of LA county and New York City combined. Keep your money, you're not worth the headache"  And that would be the end of the conversation. 
---
(as an American it's nice to see that there's another country out there that hasn't even bigger bunch of meddling assholes in their government than our congress. Although as a Californian I can't say the same about California's state legislature. It's right up there IMO running neck-and-neck with its level of BS with the type of crap AUS is pulling.
---
Let the troll downvotes begin... ü§ò
---
Scrap is the most inventory demanding thing in the game. Meaning with unlimited scrap you can craft more pieces, put them in your vendor for cheaper because the scrap has an unlimited cap. Also bulking prizes scrap can fetch a decent price. So these folks can now flood the market with otherwise time consuming plays for nothing. All because they have a private server to harvest.
---
You actually make really good point. I just figured it might be a good place to ask, but I‚Äôll keep that in mind.
---
try selling silver instead it's one of the most valuable mats but with the least use.  Beats water and is easy  bang for your buck. it's also easy to get. Water is needed for too many things and it requires a little baby sitting to sufficiently gather. Water takes up too much weight in your stash. Silver is lighter and can be put in a scrap box. water is more valuable on the chemical bench. Especially making massive amounts of stims. Silver can be gotten tons of places including robots. it isn't really used in mass quantities except maybe for power armor or weapons? but workshops are still useless unless your afk farming.
---
you people are all assuming that a game with 24 players on a world actually has an economy prices vary drastically in it really has nothing to do with the economy the only time the economy comes in the play is when people are allowing the vending machine to put the price on it.now I'm talking about in game if you're talking about Black market or one of the marketplaces that's different story prices for things are usually fairly similar because why did you buy that one when you can see that one right there for less you know I mean not people compete more but in a world with a Max 24 vendors in it.people tend to price things however they want and people tend to buy them because they can't be bothered to hunt around and look for a better price
---
Yes, giving free stuff to people unwilling to put in the work themselves is going to save the game...
---
Piss poor logic.
---
No harm done! Just don‚Äôt worry to to much. The sub is very grim but many people still enjoy it- I just spent like three hours attempting and failing a raid with people I met playing the game.
---
It was a blast.
---
Mate I see what you‚Äôre getting at here, but I also think we should be a bit more civil with a discussion, no? And I think you forgot what subreddit you were on at the end there.
---
Dunno why your getting downvotes man, maybe they salty they could not get refunds? I mean, they couldnt be doing it cuz they are still TRYING to defend this dumpster fire?  I mean, if anyone still is trying to defend this game, needs a permanent padded room in a maximum security asylum asap.
---
You said our vendors "should" have bulk for free. That isn't asking, that is demanding like you are entitled.
---
Good on ya mate, I‚Äôve met some cool folks playing as well.
---
Best thing I did was join a player faction on Xbox. All adults and all very friendly
---
It's all bloodied now. I find myself doing more than thrice the damage with my bloodied weapon. Low health is a bit pain in the ass to manage but you'll get used to it
---
Yeah, you are right... It was stupid. Get over it.
---
Oh lord, they made even that kind of things?
---
Yes, I can see that eventually coming. Gosh that's pretty hard milking, making content and then selling it on two games.
---
&gt;, that first 700 atom $7 halloween bundle, looking at the 3rd picture on Atomic Shop page it contains the witch on the wall decor which wasn't included in that bundle at all. In fact, that decor wasn't included until the next seperate 700 atom bundle a week later. 
---
Yeah that witch was in like 80% of atom shop items for halloween. It's really funny looking, so I can see they really loved it. Well maybe that's the naive version, in reality they included it so often because it's very appealing.
---
They do that all the time though. Display one atom shop item that's on sale and then the different pictures contains other atom shop items which aren't in the one being sold. 
---
Often it's obvious, like vending machine skin and then there's a person with atom shop clothes in front of it. But too many times it's like some camp item or pack of them, and you have to read carefully the text what's actually included, and ignore the rest.
---
Ill take a dump on a console any day of the weak. horrible device. peeps buy a console happily then complain like crazy about beth charging a sub fee. 
---
"oh but the pc is so expensive. " - no motha fukah - upfront yes but its an upgradable expandable platform. 
---
in the long run the gaming rig will be cheaper. 
---
a brand new decent gaming rig will set you back 1500 intitially (thats a high estimate if you go new egg and discount shopping you can waaaaay cut that down) but if you replace power supplies and individual components as they become outdated it will last a good 10 years. in fact theoretically a frame could last a lifetime if you modify the mounting brackets as needed for new hardware. 
---
a console will just be obsolete in a year or two. youll have to replace it with a new one, a ton of your software wont even be compatible. by the end of the ten years console players have spent more on broken controllers, periphials and everything else than I ever have as a pc gamer. 
---
console players are getting suckered by slick marketing and a convenient pretty package. getting boned in the long run.
---
Also, ping is atrocious.
---
Why would you not just go to one of your camps? Scavs gotta scav.
---
This game has banned more ppl for duping than hacking. 
---
That's an indicator of bethesdas thoughts on ther matter.
---
These ‚Äúnightmare‚Äù animals are in fact some of the most nightmarishly timid animals in the world. No hellscape here besides the heat and sooty brimstone air.
---
I'll save your comment and keep it in mind.
---
hell no you keep her
---
I want to be optimistic with WL but i can't. Im looking forward to it, im just not hopeful based on the track record here in 76.  WL is very much a make or break moment for this game. If its a dud idk how people can defend the game and its potential at that point.
---
Fasnacht donut recipe, you're correct they dont spoil.
---
Well scorched earth is the most your machine can handle. What's the use of that when your xbox fails miserably during the mischief event? When I see people complaining about games crashing during the event, it turns out they are all console users. With 8gb ram and near decade old hardware. Why do people think their consoles should be able to handle everything that's tossed at them?
---
Sunday was my day. Just logged out and walked away.  More than one of my friends lamented all the legacy/bloodied/explosive/etc weapons in my vendor/stash. 
---
I'm playing The Outer Worlds now and once I'm done with that I'm planning on trying Death Stranding. Hopefully between those two I'll make it to cyberpunk
---
My mumma ScoMo bear don‚Äôt care ‚Äòbout no rights though.
---
Wholeheartedly agree.
---
I think they have this shot, and if it‚Äôs a bust even a hardcore fan like me would agree that‚Äôs the end of this poor game.
---
You having a laugh mate?
---
Am Aussie, also have a buttload of experience dealing with our consumer Law.
---
Basically, you can have as much play time as you want, if there's something about the game that would've made you not purchase it had you known about it before buying (such as being a buggy mess. Or even that they'll introduce a paid subscription when then promise they won't introduce paid DLC), you have the right to a remedy. The remedy can be refund, repair or replacement, the company gets to choose which.
---
Dropping out as well, just really sucks cause I love Fallout and used to love Bethesda games but they're damned determined to walk this road and taint not only their current but also their future games with this continuous train wreck of lies and seemingly unending bold faced greed. I'm sure they'll say that the new elder scrolls or whatever sci fi game won't have the same issues but they've lied so many times that I can't gift them even the slightest bit of trust. I really hope things turn around but at this point I just don't have any hope left for them.
---
In Evey game that has a system like this how it usually works  is 
---
Farmers get rss (faster and cheeper now due to fo1st)
---
‚Üì
---
Crafters buy the rss from the farmers 
---
Crafters sell their stuff that's usually better then the common Joe can make thus making there investment on mats back + profit
---
sigh I got your upvote yonggo some nerd didnt catch your sarc.
---
Oh ok so they never added the firecracker stuff then.  All I can do is keep trying then.  I just wasnt sure if they dropped at all and was in doubt.  Cheers for clarity!
---
Yeah, getting no drops from the bis, bi gay straight. Twas a sexuality jib, or jabber if you prefer
---
I haven't really noticed. My PC is little below minium recommended. I think loading time is mostly about CPU speed. SSD might have little effect.
---
Well if youre on ps4 i sell the ones Ive gotten in my vendor.  Let me know and youre welcome to buy em.
---
I mean yea, it was kinda stupid, but i put more blame o. The guy who stole the gun than you, it was a hell of a dick move. Its one thing to take stuff out of a bag thats been left alone, its another to take a single item standing between two players who are obviously trading.
---
Is it awkward to observe a fish on its inability to walk on dry land? 
---
So why would it be awkward to have once observed, even observe again, a gaggle of cunts when they queef repeatedly and with impunity, into your face?
---
A jib jabber you be I see.
---
I'd rather earn them, thanks anyways.
---
Aye, that i be, now a goodnight i bid to thee!
---
Yea no worries Im the same way.
---
Fair thee well.
---
Like I said, good for you. üòÇ
---
Not really though, I mean sure a good dev team using Bethesda‚Äôs tools and framework can make a very Bethesda like game but having played around 6 hrs of Outer Wilds it‚Äôs just not really my thing.
---
Thanks. It was a troll comment anyways. Not something I didn't expect since people are quite sensitive when it comes to anything that involves real money in this game
---
I hope you do, and I want those that purchased the sub to do the same, just me is all.
---
But without Country Roads the game would be FIGURATIVELY unplayable.
---
This kind of stuff is cringe but it is your game and time. Bet whoever got it liked it all. Just feel like people qre acting out of spite but do what you wanna do! Lol
---
Put my hard earned, grinded out junk for FREE in my vending machines?? No chance in hell. Fuck outta here with that entitled bullshit
---
And then OP goes back and buys 2 more copies anyway. There are 2 types of gamers those whom hate RNG and those whom HOLY SHIT I JUST GOT AN EPIC!!!
---
He should have given it back, take it at first to greif, sure. Then give it back. There is honor amongst thieves
---
It works now. Don't exactly remember it being broken. Maybe it was, haven't been doing that for a lot.
---
I think some events might become bugged. 
---
My main char has few week ago always had the cloe quest in the last stage, go back to cloe to get the reward. But it won't register anything. Rejecting that event won't fix it. 
---
Before I was doing it every now and then, often when I was visiting Purveyor. It could be that I need to carry some random stuff that Im no longer carrying, for it to register the completion, and I have no idea what to have, so I can't really fix it. I just have to ignore it.
---
My other chars can do the event fine.
---
That‚Äôs what happens when you play a child‚Äôs game.
---
Cool, it's nice to have a gear goal to work towards again. Thanks for the info
---
Dont let the glitches get u down 
---
See u in 2020 when they do the soft relaunch of the game (wastelanders)
---
Anyone else see this coming from a mile away? Remember when you could download the open beta, then suddenly you couldnt uninstall it unless you paid for the full game?
---
Play those two games. Even with the limited mods from ps4 I love playing them and always go back to them from time to time.
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre understanding how the unlimited space changes the game. That‚Äôs all well and good for the person who has the space but under this pay to win structure you‚Äôre going to see an increase on the cost of legendary weapons and a decrease on mats. Meaning non f1 payers will be left at the bottom.
---
Wastelanders is a soft relaunch of the game so yea u just might come back
---
Well ya kinda fucked up - but he didnt have to be a dick and take it either.
---
I have to farm fusion cores for my laser gatling at the power plant. (its the only way to get 100% ers less than 100% cores cause ammo load problems etc.) 
---
because I am built for pve I suck at pvp - because I need cores I have to make myself vulnerable to pvp. because people on your friend list can see you're online and help people come to your server I no longer trust anyone to be on my friend list. I had a friend I literally caught conversing with a guy who regularly ganked me. after I dumped the friendlist it was no longer a thing. 
---
because people can join party and initiate pvp with someone and there fore rope you into pvp as well I dont join parties. ever. if you get downs I will poke you with a stim pack. i will let you tag things and not kill steal . i will gladly answer questions and be helpfull. but I dont join parties. 
---
for future reference the most secure way to transfer items in the game is in the player to player trade option or in a closed shop with  player vendor behind a locked door. just post is and price at zero if you wish to gift it. otherwise dont drop anything you arent willing to lose. 
---
I feel you though I have plenty of faith in 99 % of the pop its those 1%ers that get ya though.
---
Yeah things stacked only during first few months, and yeah it was due to duping.
---
What are you smoking? I hate the game, I hate MTX's, I hate loot-boxes and so forth. Got my money and fuck ever spending on those little shit things. I'm of the mind that MTX's etc should not be in a full priced game, only free and even then I still don't like them.
---
Not sure why everyone thinks all the lag and crashing and server kicks are Bethesda's problem.
---
I play Fo76 nearly everyday and maybe get kicked from the server a couple times in a week. I've been running the Mischief event as many times as I can in a day, it hasn't crashed on me yet. If there is 15+ plus people it gets a little laggy when blowing up cars but it usually gets fine again before end of the event. It really does suprise me no one ever suspects a shitty internet provider with spotty speed.
---
Np. But keep in mind that bloodied build has been dominant for more than 8 months now. If anything's getting nerfed in the future it's likely bloodied
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
Maybe so, maybe so.
---
I‚Äôm just gonnna keep optimistic for now
---
You're right. It was both unfair and you were stupid. Sorry to hear that you had that item stolen by such an arsehole but you were also careless.
---
The question is what lesson are you going to learn from this?
---
I really don't know who u are but man i really just miss you and the countless players not playing 
---
Im no saint but i have not been playing this game for 2 months now and can only see my self getting time on December
---
Does steam even have the rights to re sell the games? Do they then have the right to give that right? Would‚Äôve thought that would belong to the publisher or something. Also, is there infrastructure to allow such reselling to take place?
---
Didn't have terribly high expectations. Was roaming around WS doing the usual when it started up so figured why not. Not tea bag really. Nothing spectacular, but its at least something new to muck about with.
---
Have you unlocked the ability to wear them from the pioneer scouts tasks?
---
Some places here it only ever rains and it hot or dosn't rain and is hot. Half the year is one, the other half the second. Plus you know, all them deadly animals. GOD DAMN DROP BEARS.
---
Right? I have taken stuff out of bags before. I remember back before scrip you could find full bags in front of the golf club. But if people are clearly trading, you are stealing. Which sure, you can do if that's your kink.
---
Oh, I didn't know about that. Where can I find that quest? I do already have a backpack, I found a plan for it and it allows me to wear it.
---
Don't worry they're certainly en route to 1st members. Display your pa in style. Unlike those filthy non-members
---
Second person in the last day to use the exact same reply whenever someone says something they don't agree with
---
this is what happens when the pot overflows... too many things have been screwed with and people get angry(and i'm not just talking about fo76 because it's spreading everywhere)... this is also what happens with wars and revolutions on a larger scale in the world so maby don't be surprised this is happening now. could have been stopped a long long time ago with the help of everyone else :/
---
No they meant the biggest dlc they‚Äôve done all together, like as in all their dlcs they‚Äôve made for games.
---
There's actually people like that on both sides. I respect your opinion, but don't agree about the game.
---
Yeah, the gamers are the ones scamming the shitty constantly lying company, and the people who try to hold them accountable are responsible for the state of things. You are a moron of grand proportion. The reason shit is bad is because people like you will eat shit and pay for the privilege.
---
That was my thinking.
---
Truth is though Whitesprings for what ever reason is laggy even before Nukes,and Mischief Night.
---
The game has so much potential.
---
Yet is often unplayable.
---
In my last 3 Nuke launches ,2 have resulted in Game crashes for [me.One](https://me.One) on Prime,and one on Whitespring.
---
Australian laws say that you must offer a refund if not fit for purpose or advertised which FO76 was and a minimum guarantee of 1 year on all goods sold.  
---
I remember reading on its release that refunds would be available to Australians, due to these very laws. Clearly they were always going to try and fight them :-D
---
Ive seen plenty of people trade this way when i was playing, especially my friends (its often less hassle) and you can obviously see when people are trading.
---
In this case, they were on a train station roof! Dick move
---
I think people use Bethesda / Zenimax as synonymous for each other, though they actually aren't. Especially legally. There's also Bethesda the people who make the games and Bethesda the people who sell those games and provide platforms etc. Unless that changes from last I looked.
---
You do understand that it actually wasn't Bethesda refusing you the refund it was the company they go through for digital purchases? Digital river is a huge cause of the problems that everyone faced with getting refunds
---
Good Move.
---
I was torn between both.
---
Still trying for those illusive Ultracite Calibrated Shocks after about 30 SBQ events.
---
I've only done a few runs all the way through. Usually I crash out and hope I rejoin in time for the finale. Only way I can get to the end without crashing is go directly to the courtyard section from the start and wait for everyone to get there and do event from there on. I dont like doing this though.
---
Infuriating thing is my husband plays too. I crash out and hes still happily causing mayhem in Whitesprings.
---
Yeah, but confirming my own admission and then saying "get over it" is less conversational and more just, rude, y'know?
---
No, but you can hop on the "support your consumer rights" train if Bethesda previously told you to get fucked when asking for a refund. Plus you can still apply for a refund, further ACCC action would be too much of a hastle to Bethesda/Zenimax I'll bet. All you can do is try, if you want to.
---
Hunters long coat is around 2-3k and the fixer plan is 10-15k depending on how bad they want it
---
No my friend, they simply tried putting the game to a launch ready state which they still have yet to achieve. Look at what a state eso was in when they brought in subscription service as an option and look at how fo76 fares currently. With wastelanders, they *might* be launch ready, but until then i dont believe that they deserve more than my 60 dollars + however many another 60+ for sure ive given them in atoms.
---
i'm sorry.. you have to subscribe $99.99 to "enjoy" the game on top of the other subscriptions and micro(macro)transactions. and don't forget to pay for your shitty internet that can barely play online.
---
Drop Bears though. \*shudders\*
---
You need video evidence or they ignore you
---
thats the only motivation possible at the root of all of it. the only reason to take my shop is to just fuck with my day. all other justification are bullshit.
---
If you give away screw for free, you won't have them for long. I really would suggest you sell them instead.
---
For anything else, no high opinion. 
---
But yeah I struggle with selling any junk because it's just so tedious and the small caps you can get is quite pointless to active player. I still try to sell it more as a service, I don't see much players having reasonable junk prices on their vending.
---
Long time I've wanted to consolidate all my junk and other bulk stuff I could sell to have it on one char, then permanently park it on nuke free area and just to arranged trading. I think I will get a second account to easier transfer stuff between my chars on Black Friday. Maybe later I could take one month of 1st, mainly due to get the atom shop items. Though I don't really desire them and I usually have plenty of atoms to buy anything I really want. So it's possible I won't ever get a single month of 1st. But getting second account seems quite likely now. It would so significantly expand my abilities and allow me to play with 5 different chars all build differently and having lots of room in stash and inventory, and then have 5 different mules. Compared to how now all my stashes are full and I usually have 20 to max 50 lbs of free inventory space per char.
---
Yes you can set the price on vending for 0c.
---
they ARE angry at bethesda. they're just doing everything they can to make that point across to them and the random people paying ungodly amounts of money to play a shit game not worth even a penny are just... in the way to do it
---
Mister sandman only works at night with ranged supressed guns.
---
I'm level 140 on Xbox. Been over 100 for months. Sure wish I could get the achievement for it though. 
---
I'm not going to get another character to 100 just to have it 100%, and it's the only one I need. Think Bethesda Support Ticket would do anything?
---
Infinite scrap was never what they said was impossible it was infinite stash space which are 2 totally different things. As for the free content would you rather wastelanders had come out unfinished or a buggy mess? I'm betting it's probably a fucking no since literally everyone has complained about the game doing that at launch.
---
I dont care about sneaking up behind you while you're bulking acid. I like more the larger fights with several people. You need to stop putting everyone in that troll category. I'm not classifying you as things you could be lol. Also you know going into it that a workshop is a pvp zone. Go to a private server if you want complete peace. Dont enter a rad zone knowingly then complain about the tumor.
---
What do you mean? Anyone who got refunded didn't go through Bethesda, they would have gone through EB Games or something. But them refusing refunds to all digital users is still illegal, no matter how many other people they were "nice" to.
---
Three cheers for a jolly good fellow!
---
at this point i don't want an elder scrolls 6. and they're taking their time away from it because of the mmo of elder scrolls which is why we haven't seen it sooner
---
Realms is also a much easier and smaller and less server intensive implementation of a private server. Fo76 worlds take a lot of processing power to work.
---
Jokes and something being funny is subjective.
---
In case you didn't realize the money they are getting from the atom shop and sub service goes to you and everyone else continuing to get free dlc in the future. That's how this game is being funded and was announced before launch that it would work like this.
---
It's hilarious that I don't even play this game but every post I see is about how fucking *terrible both it and Bethesda are*.   
---
I genuinely feel horrible for you guys.
---
its really confusing, since bethesda game studios and bethesda softworks are both called bethesda, but the way I understand it, at the lower level are the game studios, eg. bgs (both the new austin one and the todd one,) machinegames, id, arcane, tango. then above that is the publisher, bethesda softworks, which pretty much has nothing to do with the likes of todd howard and whatnot (which is why I find it weird todd is the centerpiece of all the business shit when he literally has no say lmao,) and bethesda softworks makes descisions to appease their owner, zenimax media, a corporation that holds several publishers and studios, run by a dude who is banned from the concept of banking, a random baseball player, and trumps brother. essentially, if the game's shit, blame bgs, if the business is shit, eg. microtransactions, launcher, sales, anything to do with money, blame bethsoft and zenimax.
---
I‚Äôve seen all I need to see.
---
They are a company. They will always put money first. If they truly lose people, they will do everything in their power to keep the money rolling. And despite the drama around fallout 1st I don‚Äôt think things are as grim as they seem.
---
The point of those accounts especially when people are acting like assholes is to give a response that the community has been asking for.
---
&gt;piece have some predetermined value? 
---
Yes. Usually the more complicated a particular object it, the higher the budget cost.
---
Isn't that one of the core purposes of consoles? They're supposed to modify the games around the system itself to ensure compatibility, whereas us on PC more often than not may require the system to conform to the games requirements (sure you can drop graphical settings on PC, but running at the highest possible being the overall goal can and will eventually require some hardware upgrades).
---
I mean obviously as time goes on, the software aspects are getting more advanced through the life of a console, but to me that was one of the few things consoles generally had over PC. That and the lack of upgrade requirements (which went right out the window with the middle of life higher tier systems they offer now). 
---
Regardless it's a damned shame the event causes so much havoc on systems. This PC can generally deal with 76 well, but my fuck the servers were so utterly laggy the past few nights and I wasn't even participating in the event or anywhere near WS.
---
Unless there is news on this, the survival servers are not expected to come back. Bethesda pretty much indicated as much when they announced the survival servers going offline.
---
The plan seems to be to better integrate PvP into the main game.
---
Obviously not if they are replying and getting down voted to Oblivion. It only looks like they abandoned the fan base because some people want to be assholes and hide anything a Beth person says
---
Think the problem is with their wording though.
---
I do think they said that wastelanders could be pushed up to February maybe even January due to the fallout 1st profits.
---
(All offhand, I‚Äôm not doing a lot of research)
---
I think some of the stuff that‚Äôs been paywalled here doesn‚Äôt deserve to be, but I see your point in that the money will be used for future content.
---
Ok so if they post explaining that they are listening and you down vote them so that no one sees it then it's your fucking fault that people think that you're shouting into the void.
---
Trick or treating (phase 2 and 3) seems like the best/fastest way to complete the event. Just run from candy bowl to candy bowl spamming activation key on each one until the activation button popup dissapears. The game seems to register it multiple times per bowl while it lags. And it lags all the time on public servers with more than 2 players participating. Avoiding to hit the bots helps immensely. They do not aggro at you if you don't hit them throughout the event. I guess, only the sentry bot boss does for obvious reasons.
---
You mean it's wastelanders choice
---
So when the community is asking for answers and they try to give the community answers you think it's right to down vote them to make it seem like they aren't giving any reply?
---
The jumpsuit is rare?? I played the event today for the first time and got the jumpsuit. Doesn't look like anything special.
---
If you read my OP or any other post, you would know I have not been playing this past year. I had requested a refund A YEAR AGO and Bethesda denied it, and kept denying it. The ACCC forced them to give me my money back, so, please read the whole post in future my friend.
---
How fucking stupid can you be?
---
Only Bethesda knows.
---
Possibly
---
It's basically a trade off. Either they find a way to bring in a renewable income source or we end up having to pay for dlc later on.
---
No, sorry, I skimmed the post again and couldn't find the exact mention. I want to say that there were 3 "stealth effects" and 3 cards and 1 armor topped you off on 2 of the 3. With lighting being the last one.
---
For some reason it wont even turn on for me. I checked my consoles settings, and the games settings, but for some reason after one match I no longer see the little speaker icon. Is this a known bug?
---
Pc
---
When there answer to a year of inexcusable mistakes, bugs, glitches, negligence to player base, etc. is to drop a gamemode and add in a monthly subscription program then yes. I hope they know how much I hate them &amp; what they‚Äôve done to such an amazing franchise.
---
I have noticed that in many games the actual ingame community is nice, but when it comes to reddit, the communities are really bad.
---
I am not saying that Beth doesn't deserve criticism, but I am talking about games overall.
---
For what it's worth, I thought your comment was funny. Too much anger in this sub lately, I'm just trying to have some nice conversation, about nice things, and Donuts to me are represenative of whimsical treats that cheer most people up. As adults, we eat healthy, pick up kids from school, shopping, home renovations: always making the adult choices, sacrifice our whimsical side. Deep-frying cake batter, glazed in confectioners sugar, dipped in chocolate, filled with custard and topped with sprinkles? Sweets bring people together, cheers people up. Take a plate of cookies, donuts and cupcakes to someone you know who is feeling down, make their day. I'm trying doing that here.
---
Sorry to hear that man. I hope thing turn around for better to you.
---
Absolutely. While this stuff is a bit shady, it does open the door for good content in the future.
---
I just hope Bethesda delivers.
---
I think since it is the law that they would have to, they would be forced to for that country, no?
---
They dropped the game mode due to the fact it was barely used. They have been fixing bugs and glitches with each new patch. The subscription program was set to come out with wastelanders but because they had to delay wastelanders they released it anyway so people wouldn't complain.
---
Well next time when i see u in the lobby i will send u a friend request and maybe we could join forces because i use bolton 100% of the times lol :) 
---
I am going to use your method from now on (uploading to Youtube) since its very annoying having to cut and render videos in order to send it to Bethesda via ticket .
---
I usually play the recorded videos in slow motion and you can see quite well if you were being aimbotted . I hope i am wrong but being 2 shot with automatic weapon while jumping at a safe enough distance ,without taking any armor damage (meaning headshot) is suspicious .
---
Fixed. Neither me nor my friends lost anything stashed in the scrapbox during the last several days. (On PC)
---
i sold the fixer plan for 10k not sure about the coat tho.
---
Yeah, FO1st is a rich people's privilege(even if I had money to spend, I would not spend it on FO1st thou. It gives me nothing I want).
---
I mean I offered my modding services free of charge since I know most of the mods in the game. I usually only ask for Flux if I don't have enough. Now I have a scrap box and can continue to offer my modding/crafting services for free.
---
What console or pc you on
---
Why on earth would someone pay 15k caps to be able to craft generic fixers? Without legendary modifiers a basic fixer is pretty trashy compared to the god roll fixer 3 star your could probably buy for less.
---
I'm sure it wasn't THAT big of a deal.
---
Just lost my job too. Eh. I won't ever support Fallout 1st on principle.
---
True, sorry I do use Zenimax and Bethesda (softworks, not GS) as synonymous. I need to stop doing that for the sake of clarity, but either way it was "them lot".
---
Many people left the game way before without announcing or saying a word. Is it really such an emotional departure that requires dramatic tension? I stopped playing a while ago but this post popped up and I don't really know what is it for.
---
r/ihavemoney
---
I'm glad people are getting refunds but at the same time I've purchased the game at least 10 times now.
---
Yeah I've even seen people take my 5x 0c lockpicks. I don't really know why anyone would need lockpicks, I sell them all the time to vendors since they are handy 1c items you can easily take the last few bottlecaps off from the daily 1400. But I have few listed for 1c and then little for 0c since I have plenty of vendor slots free anyway. I still keep occasionally stocking up the 0c ones but it's a bit boring and doesn't seem worth it. It sucks that I need to go to my camp to do it, too.
---
I've sometimes sold junk really low like aluminium for 1c ect, but then I saw few players from my friendlist coming to pick them up all the time. 4th time during same day, is just too much for me.
---
Or if I had fusion cells for both 1c and 0c, with the idea that people can then deside the price below 1c. Yeah, people just took the free ones, I did keep trying but I never saw anyone to pay for them. So no fusion cells for anyone since they won't sell at 1c.
---
What do you mean, with the MTX's?
---
No I've bought many accounts. I have a few for leveling and then a few I use as mules. I play on pc so each account costs me money unlike console players.
---
You son of a hitch
---
I learned this two days ago ..... after playing from launch
---
It's toothbrushes. The bowl can have toothbrushes.
---
Wait, what the what? You have to re-purchase the game to have a new character? Dude, that's messed up.
---
Yeah, when it finishes downloading in ten hours.
---
Its cool, I'll still play it, because its one of my favorite franchises. Maybe someday it'll be usable and people will return or whatever
---
Not new character. You have 5 character slots. There's never enough room. I have an entire character dedicated to collecting one copy of each plan in the game. I'm about 80ish off from completing that right now. Each seperate account itself costs money
---
Serious?
---
Are you saying you do all that, for more space to store things?
---
Not all of them were abd u difnt need a beefy pc to play all of them either guild wars for instance dindnt have a sub fee
---
And because I feel like 5 characters isn't enough. This is also my first fallout game. I may or may not have a bit of a hoarding problem. I swear I need that 5000 spoiled meat!
---
Just on my way to work today there was a 1m big male Huntsman spider that chased me down the street, lucky for me there was a rabbit nearby that distracted it.
---
I just learned it now, and i pre ordered this game lmao
---
Im pretty sure only the duped items stacked
---
Oh really .... Thx . Gonna  have a look for them....
---
Finders keepers right?
---
Any one carrying that much scrap In that event  must have been a real plonker so dont feel bad..lol
---
Didn't the trick or treaters have toothbrushes on them sometime?
---
I didn't get to experience Fasnacht events as it was ending when I bought the game and was still figuring it out.
---
As a somewhat low level character, I've been able to collect tons of great loot and leveled up four times so far. Though it has ruined nearby quests when enemies in the area are spawning 30+ levels above me.
---
Im on PC, I've started to sell them for 4c since they aren't exactly a sales success and the components for them just keep piling up. It's funny since I got the recipe on my first ever visit on the event, and I didn't have any idea what to do there, even got overencumbered just from looting the place and thus didn't manage to tag the boss before it was killed. But still got the plan and it's fairly rare, lol.
---
There is a trading sub you can find via my profile. Check the "submitted" tab. It can't be referred directly here, that's why I refer it like that.
---
Xbox scene is very active on the sub, if you can't find an open post anyone offering them on sale, make a post offering caps for them instead. Offer anything between 50-200 and there's good chance someone might offer the 3 for free, anyway. When searching, use "diffuser", because technically the proper name is stimpak diffuser but a lot of people mistake it to stimpacK diffuser. But the diffuser is usually written correctly.
---
Also, you can't trade backpacks, so you can't offer that. You can only trade packback plans which are much more valuable. Good luck.
---
DID YOU STEAL MY CORN!?
---
I came to this thread to be entertained... I haven't been disappointed so far XDXD
---
I like how ESO handled MTX though. Very disappointed that Fallout 76 wasn't an improvement on their existing techniques.
---
Bad customer relations cost companies tons of money,  so do bad products. Do both for long enough and things will be grim.
---
I think that particular bot is for whatever reason bugged. I've seen a video about month ago, someone following it for a while, and it went back to it's place. Slowly of course, and sadly it didn't open the door to it's cage.
---
This is actually incorrect. They made it so even if you do manage to get in you can't pick anything up or access any containers or objects.
---
Oh my god. You sir are insane and I love it! Lol. That‚Äôs actually crazy though, I hate the game after I ‚Äúbeat‚Äù it earlier this year. Just feel the content is lacking and the events really suck. I really don‚Äôt want to buy another fallout ever again but hopefully they do right the next one and I‚Äôm interested again. We‚Äôll see.
---
The old man winter and sun mask were 1 in 100000 chances but because it was in a list of 10 masks the rate was actually 1 in 1000000. The goblin, skull, and jester masks were 1 in 50000 or 1 in 500000.
---
Yes while I can see the connection, fallout 76 and fallout 1st apparently did better than expected, so financially they shouldn‚Äôt be struggling. They are faltering in their customer relations, but they still have a chance to redeem that with their future ‚Äúin the vault‚Äù articles and such.
---
It all depends on if Bethesda starts to make the connection, and if their products are selling well there really isn‚Äôt much of a reason to make them.
---
I'm not that familiar with the tradition here in Belgium. About 5 years ago it gotten hyped , but only for commercial purposes
---
I meant the dead bodies of one's that are in game lol. At least if you move to the US you can hand out toothbrushes and claim ignorance!
---
My point being that it‚Äôs equally on our shoulders if we support decisions we deem as bad. The company has no reason to care just so long as they are making consistent income.
---
About 20 minutes after the event the other day I was walking around picking up robot parts and found a bag with 6000+ Steel in it haha people are crazy not dumping their inventory before starting
---
Collecting things is fun too. There's a lot of things to see in the game world including a new hidden vault. I've been playing since February and I still find things I didn't know about to this day.
---
Lol.....
---
It was a little better, though there were still crappy loot-box type things. Though a good chunk of the 'MTX' in ESO was more DLC style (like the guild stuff). However it was behind a "buy our currency to buy things lol" rather than a "you can directly purchase this game addition".
---
thats your fault for feeding the money hungry companies you made your bed now sleep in it
---
right and because of its success started the gradual migration of free games for people and micro transactions. they kinda are the original big hit play for free guys that started us into where we are now. shitty games MTX everywhere and a stupid demanding fanbase with unrealistic expectations and petulant lips poked out.
---
I just did the same thing with call of duty modern warfare. Too many bugs and crashes, after 23 hours of playtime I decided to get a refund, was refused, emailed their legal department threatening to go to the ACCC. Instant refund.
---
Yeah, because I‚Äôm watching YouTube while it downloads. I haven‚Äôt played since launch day.
---
good for you have a nice day :)
---
Same thing happened to me when Imposter SS event first came out. Picked up a bag and it was 1.5k pounds of junk. Stood around for 10min and no one came looking for it so kept it.
---
Fuck. I shoulda done that. I deleted/uninstalled the game the moment I heard/read about Fallout First and haven‚Äôt looked back.
---
Ignore that and carry on.
---
Damn son, nice. Though 23 hours is a lot of gameplay, I've had friends finish games and get them refunded because they were returned within the 30 day no questions asked refundable purchase rule. Well almost no questions asked, as long as the consumer didn't intentionally damage the products etc.
---
Don‚Äôt know, but if so, the law would have to apply down the chain and it would restrict the ip rights that publishers or game creators would have over their work (since they can no longer control reselling rights).
---
If it‚Äôs not yours, it‚Äôs somebody else‚Äôs. Thief.
---
I was one of those sweaty nerds on day 1 lol so my hours went up quickly, but half of my playtime was waiting for their servers to get fixed because they broke on launch
---
Yikes
---
Indubitably.
---
I have my tent in my friends server.
---
LOL indeed o7
---
Everything here sounds very reasonable and likely will please alot of people. 
---
So naturally it's not gonna happen.
---
It's possible
---
And you're not a 1st member?
---
Why's that?
---
I've tried the event once and it crashed on P. C I also bought a month of 1st to see how it went and due to being taken for a ride by Bethesda I won't be doing either again, along with all the hundreds if not thousands of bugs in the game the never seem to get fixed I'm supprise any of us are still playing really so @Bethesda well done here is a chocolate fireguard award for you.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't *that* much, but probably still more than they'd usually spend on music.  All things considered, Fallout 76 actually seems to have the largest library of music between all the games if I'm not mistaken.  I recall the current Appalachia Radio has 50 existing songs, and over 50 for the classical station.  
---
While there are some repeats from Fallout 3 and Fallout 4, Bethesda seems to be growing their playlists steadily, but it'd definitely be nice to have more as time goes on.
---
The ACCC has also come to my aid with a car purchase and a college, neither small amounts of cash. Didn't get money back, but got what the money was supposed to pay for.
---
A fool and their money...
---
Fair enough, I played the BETA and a little bit after launch to try and give it a fair go. But damn, was it horrific.
---
Cool, thanks for the response:)
---
It says you're a twat mate
---
That‚Äôs likely the small backpack they added awhile back. You cannot add skins to those, only to the regular one you get by progressing to Possum scout.
---
You can start the quest by looking at the Pioneer Scouts poster in train stations.
---
You said it.
---
of course.
---
Funcoland was another nice one....I remember them having a glass case with a Gameboy in it advertising all the peripheral attachments....it's where u bought my "nuby" pack that turned my Gameboy into a MIDI boombox.....with horrible distortion if you turned the volume above the max the Gameboy normally had
---
Weird flex, but ok
---
Lil bit of duct tape will fix ya right up
---
My game doesn't really crash but all the servers I join nowadays have high ping and furthermore, the event is a damn lag fest. To make it worse, people freaking nuke WS and it fucks up the stability even more, not to mention it slows down the even progress and reduces the number of rewards we get due to no one being able to stand in those rads in a costume.
---
Why didn‚Äôt I think of that?
---
Right.
---
It's just the trend of the times it seems. Same goes for a lot of so called gamers on YouTube, doing "reviews".
---
Take the new Call of Duty for instance.
---
The cutscenes in campaign are stuttering on PC. "UNPLAYABLE. 1/10". Really?
---
Don‚Äôt buy star field, or ES6. Fuck this company.
---
Yuuuup
---
Zrt Graveyard on Xbox, I have a few you can have, wont be off work for another 4.5 hours to, send me a message and I got you.
---
You‚Äôve tried the best - now try the rest!
---
Skeleton unlock? I think I missed some news. Anyone able to link or explain?
---
I sell my plans for 10c each and get sold out pretty fast. Is your camp very remote or something?
---
I would really like them to come back. I'd like to test the waters of pvp, but I dont wanna go around disturbing people who just wanna enjoy the game. Plus I used to love claiming workshops and building them up to be something special. Now its pretty much putting a bullseye on my back. And maybe then people will finally stop relentlessly punching me at train stations.
---
Didnt sound like they wanted survival to come back, but I really hope it does.
---
I‚Äôm a member. I can place mine also. I have used another persons stash box as well.
---
people like you deserve to be hunted keep crying scrub
---
I honestly think it boils down to the fact that plugging in a console and starting a game takes roughly the brainpower of a molerat.
---
I always trade by dropping. Personal trading just takes too damn long.
---
"Yo, this molerat dropped a bloodied 3-star rolling pin. You want it? Ok it's by the fridge."
---
Can you show us some pictures or some sort of proof of the refund?
---
Not really that just suggests they knew it was a bad idea and cant beilieve how many people bought it
---
It‚Äôs Halloween rewards through Nuclear Winter, they are releasing one reward a day for reaching a certain amount of exp. Each reward requires more exp and I believe they count exp of each one separately so everyone is waiting until all are released to grind for the once instead of multiple times.
---
Absolutely! On occasion I'll have free stuff in my base. Especially plans I already knew. I've only ever seen one or two other people doing it, but it feels great when you really want something and bam! Free!
---
I think I'll take after you on the "free junk" whenever I happen to get the first sub.
---
Ok big man, what should we play?
---
Try selling at 11 caps per plan and they will disapear in no time...
---
I did NW tonight. All of the unlocks were there through 7000 XP, and each one gained XP as I finished. So it does look like once all rewards are there they will all gain XP as you go. I am going to wait to do any more NW until the 14k XP reward is live.
---
Just the reply that I wanted! Thanks dude!
---
Turrets cost a ton! Very upsetting, as I need some serious defense
---
All I meant was, people were always going to want a refund, despite how long it takes.
---
People wanted a refund days after it dropped. Hell, people canceled their pre ordered before it even had the chance. 
---
Someone made a point of, should refunds be given a year after release. All I was saying was that if the option was there for those who bought it digitally (myself included) we would have taken that option. The fact it's been a year doesn't change that. 
---
Maybe I said that really moronicly, my bad
---
We haven't played yet. It should work out fine.
---
It's mostly likely related to the respawn loop, yeah.
---
When you're alone there and don't want to solo it, you can serverhop. 
---
Happened yesterday to me. On the other server was big party
---
No problem.
---
Ring of Fire was made by a coverband, though :P
---
Solo was fun, but not worth the ammo.
---
&gt;I cant for the life of me wonder why, when everyone is dead, does it matter to complete the requests on the holotapes?
---
It's pretty simple -- these people died before they could complete their worthy tasks and, as part of the effort of to rebuild America, you're now completing them.
---
Thanks for letting everyone know, we feel much smarter now!
---
Uh huh.
---
Lever with bloody mess, tank killer, rifleman can do it with a headshot. Unless you mean kills you quickly, but with multiple shots, then it's some of the better auto rifles/MGs with head shots. If you're being sniped at huge range with 100% headshots with a handmade, then it's safe to assume the other guy is aimbot.
---
Sooooo I only have 1 of each type of armor.... How many do you guys have?
---
This is why Australia is best, our consumer laws allow us to be eligible for a refund on basically anything, it's great
---
Hey if anyone else is quitting lmk TattooedPink I'll take your stuff please
---
Ask Thomas Beckett.
---
Yes. There's nothing I want more in this game than Slocum Joe stuff. 
---
 #DonutsForAll2019
---
I could totally see the funny thing in it though. I mean, it IS being played through your pipboy.
---
Sneaking up on a supermuty.... *HACKIN AND WHACKIN*
---
I'd pay for fisting. Fisting is a definite win. Fisting=P2W
---
That's why they should have released next gen consoles by now. They ain't doing that. They are just trying to milk that lacking console as much as they can without providing any upgrade till end of next year. How are console users okay with this? It already sucks that many games have to be toned down so that console users won't have to feel left out but now they are demanding that the game be modified to their favor so that their shit hardware can run it. Wtf man people should riot against Sony and MS for milking 8gb shit cpu shit gpu dry, not Bethesda
---
Oh okay. Do you know if my friends that aren't members would be able to set the tent and use the scrap box?
---
I received a scrap fancy white vase for my display. I live it xD
---
I did the event maybe 6x until now, died around 100x but we always won.
---
I guess your PC sucks.
---
I don't play on PC. How utterly rude.
---
if you are not a member you dont have a tent or scrapbox to set.
---
If ur refering to the microtransactions in gw2 i can sorta agree with that but i was talkin about the sub fees not the gem store and sayin people are demanding for not wanting the scrap box in there is kinda rudiculous in case ur wondering i thought gw2 was shit and the community was terrible when i played it if u mentioned a bug in that game ud get yelled at
---
Just curious, what makes you say it's broken?
---
&gt; not worth the ammo
---
That's why I stay away from that event.
---
Here's a question for you. Say that money was no object. You could easily afford the subscription.
---
Why buy it still? 
---
You're supporting a product that is very explicitly anti-consumer in nature putting scrapboxes, survival tents and ranger armour behind a paywall. 
---
You get a private server that right now isn't that private depending on how many people on your friend's list. 
---
You also get a token amount of atoms that aren't even enough to purchase a single premium skin per month, let alone most of the bundles. So you either have to pay even more still or grind out Atoms within the game, which only gets harder the longer you play.
---
On top of that, you're paying for not that much extra content. First year it's $60 let's say, but you then pay $100 for every year afterwards, an extra 67% more over the base price you already paid. 
---
You're paying $100 per year to make the game less frustrating to play (something Bethesda explicitly designed into the game) to get no extra in-game content than a person that paid the base price. 
---
Rather than spend that $100 per year on one or more games that could potentially give you a better, different and more fulfilling experience, why sink that cost into a game you've already bought?
---
Why reward Bethesda for intentionally making the game not as good as it could be, reward them for that practice and encourage them to keep doing so in future?
---
Bear in mind, I'm actually not looking to hate on you. I mean you can't afford it anyhow. I'm genuinely curious as to why you would if you COULD afford it, since all the things I've stated aren't opinion, they're objective facts.
---
On a final note, I'm truly sorry to hear about your situation. I hope that it picks up in the coming months and years.
---
Soooo yeah I just started playing NW today... I'm assuming you're talking about the character challenges. I didn't realize they were going a new one every day... But they are already at 7000 xp. I don't know how dedicated you guys are but just thinking about playing for 7k worth of xp in one day would be extremely tiring. But! What I can tell you is what I have accomplished so far they have all been given xp at the same time. So if I get 300xp in a match, each challenge gets 300xp added to it. Once the new one rolls out I will let you know if the new one starts at 0xp. If it does, yeah you might as well grind it out in one day. 
---
Is the last one coming out on the 5th? If so, is that the only day you have to complete it or do you have the rest of the week?
---
You have until the 12th to complete it so no need to one day it unless that‚Äôs how you roll lol.
---
Yes I do know, I double checked the list of costumes to make sure that I was wearing one of the right ones. I've even tried different combos of outfits with no success so far
---
I managed to do it completely fine got the trophy
---
They can use your tent but they cannot access the scrap box
---
Oh thank fucking God. Like I'm not really that big in to battle royals but I do enjoy it better than pubg and fortnight.
---
That actually would make sense, pardon my idiocracy lol would my friends at least be able to use mine in a private server if they aren't members? Sorry I'm just not sure exactly what non member friends can or can't do
---
Could say the same about those this game changed my life posts
---
I hear you lol, I‚Äôm not big on them either but I actually enjoy NW more than I thought I would.
---
Well I guess I have possible anger to face tomorrow... lol thanks for the answer!
---
How about legendary power armor pieces
---
I feel bad for you.
---
I‚Äôm so happy to hear this. If y‚Äôall ever see me online I‚Äôm orangedracula337 and I play PS4
---
Well it doesn‚Äôt have to be, because now you can pay $100 per year for a more stable private server...
---
I will give the beth haters this much validation. they are right about many of their complaints, but they sit and scream at beth while completely ignoring the fact that dupers, griefers hackers and pay to winners who buy and sell duped shit on the internet did as much if not waaaaay more damage than beth ever did.
---
Nope I grab it every hour when I'm on.
---
To me, it feels like people that demand a refund after seeing a movie at the theater because they didn't like it. 
---
Art is subjective, people. If you're not comfortable with buying a game you may not end up liking, don't pre-order. Rent the game to try it first. There are ways to prevent this situation entirely.
---
There's a new handmade skin coming to atomic shop  [https://imgur.com/a/J50Nqdd](https://imgur.com/a/J50Nqdd)
---
Aw man that‚Äôs a shame, I‚Äôm on Xbox. Fingers crossed for cross-play one day.
---
Uh oh!  Sorry.
---
I can afford it but I will not buy it. I do not like the route Bethesda is going. I do not like how anything the involves making them money they fix right away. Yet, other issues to them are not important. They built limitations in this game to the sell you back the solutions. I mean the list goes on and on. It saddens me as I keep lurking here to get news on turn around for this game and company but I'm constantly being kicked in my balls by a company I used to massively Respect.
---
Bethesda softworks is no different. They made MG turn wolfenstein Young blood into  what ubi did withfary cry new dawn. Which was a mess within itself. That being said I will support their other devs because some really good people work at Arcane, ID, Tango and machine games
---
I only ever downvote babies who cry about downvotes.
---
Even when I ran it solo, I barely used any ammo. 10 mil some cars, don't shoot robots, melee everything else. Focus on the candy, paint, bonfires, and the forks. They take zero ammo and the candy can be done over and over. When it comes to the boss, melee or whatever you're stacked for.
---
I mean I guess, but depending on info shown I might have to hide some of it, like personal deets. I'll get round to that after dinner.
---
The private servers, that‚Äôs it. Felt dirty as rolling in shit though, I have nothing against the price for the servers, just the bonus content we get like the scrap box. I think everyone should get it.
---
Exactly what I do
---
Exactly, "alright, comming to ya, ill just shit it on the floor besides you", due to my partner squatting untill it drops under her characters ass
---
Most folks just uneventfully and without a public declaration simply go play other games.
---
And the shitty environmental policy‚Äôs.
---
Witch one of those is it?
---
Oh I see
---
I bought my copy from Harvey norman In Aus, am I eligible for a refund?
---
Haha no worries:)
---
Nice.  Thanks for playing.  Best thing to do is pay it forward to all the noobs coming behind you.
---
You would have been, directly from harvey. You might still be, but I doubt it since it's been so long. Unless you purchased it not all that long ago.
---
Yeah I'm currently trying to do that, and I also make sure to stimpack any downed players I see even if they are really high level
---
Good job, this game is complete garbage and the company is even more trash.
---
U have a point but hackers dont exist on every platform least in my expeirience idk about any recent duping i dont look for these greifer is overused so idk what ur refering too and buying and sellin weapons exists in any game with a trade system beth for the most part cant stop all of these things they couldve stopped this service from being horribly implemented
---
Nah I got it a few days after release date, bummer
---
Rip
---
just store it in scrapbox and be happy that you never need carry and lose your junk
---
Nope. They cant acess it at all. Before I got 1st my friend just held all the extra scrap for me till I needed it.
---
Seems legit, for now i have found the whitespring jumpsuit, the full halloween skeleton outfit, and the fireman helmet
---
Thanks those revivals are greatly appreciated.
---
I love this service. its not horrible it all, considering the enviroment and the way the game evolved along with the player base private server has made myself and probably crap tons of other players very happy. seriously all the rage and hate directed at players who perchase it and the obnoxious fools can see they're the exact reason why its needed? the toxic eliment of this forum and in the game need to be squashed banned and eradicated from this friggin community dude.
---
I used to crash out half the time - then saw a post about using third person view and haven‚Äôt crashed since...
---
Off topic a little but how and ever. People are happy to pay for DLC but unhappy to have an optional subscription to obtain free future gameplay content. No one is forcing them to pay. So what if those that do pay get a couple of skins? But when far harbour came out it was like ‚Äúshut up and take my money‚Äù I‚Äôve already seen people say they would pay any amount for outer worlds DLC, that‚Äôs a game that‚Äôs main story line was recently completed in under 30 mins without mods or glitches. It just bamboozles me that people expect bethesda to create future content in fo76 for free when the game itself has 100+ hrs of base content costs just ‚Ç¨30. Would they prefer to end the subscription service and have wastelanders become a DLC locked behind a pay wall?
---
Woe ok way to many typos I and slurring my speech on a fucking keyboard its time for bed. cant even track what I was arguing about specificaly. blah not important. gnight see you tommorrow.
---
Got 1G Google Fiber ethernet connected to a PS4 PRO and the event crashes out 2 out of three times.  It is not internet.  It is Fallout 76.
---
Third person view? I still crash even in 3rd person. I've only managed to stay in a complete event in 1st person.
---
The only possible exception is if you already tried and they refused, you might be able to use this case by the ACCC to support your current one. But this case in the OP only applies to Zenimax refusing. Though it could be worth contacting ACCC to see what you can do?
---
My buddy and I started new characters recently, to test out what the ‚Äúvault to fissure prime‚Äù experience is like as us against the world.  We‚Äôre both around lvl 25 now.
---
We tried a Mischief Night and did great until the Sentry boss. The thing would just smoke us with one arm bash. I was doing alright with a vampiric shotgun, until it broke. My buddy was having serious trouble getting into melee range.  It was humbling. We got utterly stomped.
---
My main character is a stealth sniper with a bloody fixer and top end unyielding armor. The difference between him and a lvl 25 shotgunner is like the sniper is from another dimension.  The sentry boss is down in under ten seconds vs running out of event time and limping away with three broken weapons and no stims left. 
---
TLDR, the event difficulty is relative to how much effort you put into a character/build.
---
It could work, ill see what I can do when I get home
---
I managed to get one just now surprisingly and it's like the millionth time I attempted to do the event without it crashing.
---
I have all unique outfits and masks/helmet already, so If there is something else on the map I skip Mischief might, no need to farm it anymore.
---
The private servers. Everything else is just icing on the cake.
---
I'm fine with people leaving shitty reviews on games like that honestly. Fuck those companies for the loot box tactics and shoving gambling in kids faces. I do hear what you're saying though
---
I'd rather take long load times than getting to an area and finding it's still the long distance LODs and the enemies aren't showing up and I still have to sit around 2 minutes for things to finally load normally.  However, having a 2 minute loading screen and this shit still happening is really fucking frustrating.  What the fuck was it loading in that case?
---
70% of my plans in my vendors are 25 caps. Besides recipes, they get bought all the time.
---
Are my stolen goods now forfeit?
---
You sound bitter because you don't want to pay.
---
With steam, you aren't buying the game, your purchasing a LICENSE to play the game..
---
Mans just said Skyrim 2
---
I have to say, at first I find these posts to be quite humorous, but as they blow out of proportion I quickly realize that not only does the Fallout community as a whole lack the necessary mechanical skills to be decent competitive players, but they also lack the humility to recognize their place on the competitive ladder. As such, I would urge you guys and gals to take a glance at some of the top tier (or even just the average) competitive players in Unreal Tournament, Battlefield, and even Apex Legends, whose mechanical skills are far better than my own -- and thus far, FAR better than yours. My point? Just because your reaction times are slow, you lack an understanding of the game's mechanics (i.e. reveal enemies), you have zero team communication, and are unable to take a tactical approach does not make me a hacker, it just means you are likely incompetent and certainly lack skill. That said, while knowing full well that 99% of you are entirely convinced of the legitimacy of your hackusations, i will still extend an olive branch and say that if you have any questions about my gameplay, not only will I offer an explanation, but I will also link a video (as I often record my gameplay and upload it to youtube) that details the concerned aspects of my gameplay. Thanks.

Sincerely,

Your Master

I'm trying to get double as I give half to my son. - just need another pirate outfit &amp; 2 short jack o'lantern suits to go, so ill grind for a little longer

Well said, whoever thought of doing an event like this at one of the games most popular CAMP and nuke locations - whilst doing nothing with Pumpkin House or even beefing up Monster Mash for Halloween - probably doesn‚Äôt even play or know the game enough.
---
The freedom to do as I please, in my own little world with my son.
---
Significant doubt.
---
I am actually yet to see someone have a legit "i was banned for no reason". It's always buying fifa coins, doing a chargeback or being a racist. 
---
Companies don't just go around banning people for no reason, it makes no business sense for them to do so.
---
The skins and the atoms and the private server. Scrapbox and tent i really dont care much about.
---
I play for the most on public servers. But very often when i do quests in an area there have been or is much higher level player around that make the game spawn high level enemies. Way to high for me. I then jump into private server to get clean spawns more matched to my level.
---
If your playing on a basic Xbox or PS... well.
---
Inb4 the account gets banned for trading, just to twist the knife
---
Yeah, I've been putting witch and skeleton outfits in there and telling people on my headset that if they want a costume to be in the spirit of halloween and that they get extra rewards to grab something from that chest. 
---
I've been putting radshield in there too but I'm almost out and I cannot seem to find strangler blooms anywhere lately.
---
It just seemed like a good deal to me. I spent roughly $10 a month on atoms anyways so getting more atoms, skins, emotes, and private servers for less than that seemed like a good deal. I purchased it before i checked with reddit to see if it was ok. Didn't realize i was the worst person ever for spending my own money. I do see how some people think it gives people an advantage, but the outrage it caused was extreme.
---
Haven't booted the game since they announced F1st. From the sounds of it the event was another 50/50 glitchfest.
---
Sure, understandableüòâ
---
bruh asking about respecting opinions instead of defending WHY you have such opinions, typical deflection but I'll bite....It gets hard to respect opinions when  fanboys defend corporations and pretend like things are not that bad when said corporation doesn't even care about their customers and prefer to keep buying their products regardless of their quality... what you think  all the "haters" just hate 76 cuz is popular to say something bad about it?, most of us were here with the franchise longer than some of the fans have been alive , I played every single Fallout game, even fallout tactics,   
---
I LOVED this franchise And company. But when their product no longer has the quality it and drops it to abysmal levels  and we complain about it  we are suddenly "haters" lmao, but I guess is Better to be a "hater" than a complacent fanboy, because that's what people are if they just accept and defend terrible  products with obvious critical issues..   
---
I just hope Bethesda learn their lesson, or better yet  cut their losses, sell the franchise to the Original creators Obsidian entertainment, their fallout games are superior to Bethesda anyways
---
Dude, I'm not paying 99$ a year for a game that craps out when I explode a car in an event, it's a waste of good cash. And the benefits are very slim but future updates in the game might only be available to subscribers
---
I have more important thing to pay for like petroleum for my car, my dog's medication and my mother's medical bills, things money is useful for.
---
Imagine subscribing for things that don't even work well. You must live with your parents or have no responsibilities.
---
Pay a fine or serve your sentence. The choice is yours.
---
As long as it's stealthy skin and not 700+ caps I'll only complain for a week or two
---
Day 4 and 5 jack o lantern combat rifle skin and power armor skin
---
That's their argument, yes, but the French lawsuit says differently.
---
Oh God no, feel free to grieve them, just don't think that they themselves are bad people, only that they're special.
---
When do they plan on doing 4 and 5 star enemies so we can get higher legendary drops
---
You know that Bethesda drones are upvoting dumb comments. Otherwise this would have 0 upvotes.
---
What cheats are these exactly? aimbot? because I miss quite a few shots - check out my youtube videos. ESP? because I often have a "terminal" hacker on my team who reveals locations. Lagwswitch? because it is certainly a lagswitch and not just an issue with Bethesda's net code, which is notoriously awful /s. Anyways, just curious what these "hacks" are that you speak of? Also, and maybe this is because i have zero idea how cheating software works, but how exactly would an update impact one's "cheats"?
---
Lately last i heard months back they never seemed to spawn
---
If you don't like it, don't get it, I like the outfit and atoms, and I got the money, so I'd get it, that's all.
---
Your mother must have got sick taking care of such a kidult like you.
---
your own country likely has its own competition &amp; consumer rights commission that you could contact, and maybe even still receive a refund since they often have government links, or in some cases, are part of the government.
---
I bought it mainly for the private server, scrapbox and not to mention that sweet ass NCR Ranger outfit.
---
Congrats bro.
---
You can use throwaway gatling lasers. The event literally consists in killing sentry bots so the ammo is free.
---
Thanks
---
I've read in the datamine that it is indeed rare. I  run almost 10 events per day, only logging in for the 5 minutes of the event every hour, and I still haven't got it.
---
No, now when they've added it to event reward pool many people have it, usually doubled.
---
No loot boxes in the new Call of Duty
---
Personally I've never crashed and the event has never failed. I find this event much more fun than Meat Week, and more people turn up every time.
---
Who?
---
Yo bro I think it's just space.
---
Pretty sure there was i know thats why i never bothered makin any nobody seemed to know why it wouldnt spawn
---
So when Patch 15 comes out ?
---
Regarding adrenaline, I use that sometimes but most of the time I swap in other perks for a degree of tanky-ness. In agaility I invest in action boy and dodgy to make me more resilient to being surprised (also 2*s in blocker and 3* Serendipity)
---
at first i just wanted to see how it was in general, i've been playing for several weeks after a break of 4-5 months 
---
but then the unlimited scrap, workshops, and basically everything else was for me to take and farm...
---
so yeah, it is a subscription that gives loads of advantages.. but the most unfair of this subscription is that you are actually able to use the scrapbox and fast travel tent in a public server and that's facilitating pay2win (yeah i know not the exact definition of pay2win but definitely leaning towards it)
---
i enjoy the private servers, but everything within that private server should stay there
---
Both this and the perk for armour are kinda bugged from the start, it seems it's another thing Bethesda never fixed.
---
stimpaks can heal crippled limbs
---
Sweet
---
I understand that except the part with lil jimmy. Don't denigrate people because they have better gear or are more skilled; it does invalidate your arguments.
---
Btw. I stopped playing NW because of prevalent cheating. Adventure pvp feels actually more fun.
---
This is the right answer, yet it got downvoted.
---
Don't ask questions if you don't like the answer I guess?
---
bro you're in an apocalyptic world with radiated monsters everywhere, i dont think it matters if you find and take stuff that's not yours, pretty sure you loot places for junk, too! 
---
if you happen to find good junk from a player who couldnt take care of him/herself, then it would only make sense to take the loot 
---
(yesterday i saw someone die during the event and i took his loot too, was a lot!)
---
2 hours a week at minimum wage..
---
time to find a new job man
---
I don‚Äôt have crashing problems
---
i think we are friends already, join my server today if you can bro 
---
i can help you with quests, raids etc 
---
gotta tell you i like workshops tho, so i might be claiming them at some point
---
There's no official definition of pay2win that I could find but for what it's worth, the closest thing to it is probably this:
---
["In general a game is considered pay-to-win when a player can gain any gameplay advantage over his non-paying peers." - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-to-play#Pay-to-win)
---
Pretty sure they say ‚Äúbiggest dlc we‚Äôve ever done‚Äù meaning for FO76. The map size won‚Äôt be getting bigger but the map will be getting bigger in terms of locations being used. It will probably be less running around finding so many abandoned  quick to explore sites, and more of a reason to stick around and explore those once abandoned places.
---
I think often too ‚Äúeveryone shouldn‚Äôt hit person, not only shouldn‚Äôt hit the boy.‚Äù
---
and I agree your opinion that ‚Äúhit back if you hit person.‚Äù
---
I hope this world to be nobody hit the people.
---
https://discord.gg/bDge823
---
Yeah, since i figure out that little bit about steam, ive never bought another title from them. its physical or nothing. And if a publisher decides they want to release something digital only through that platform, i let the pirate flag fly.
---
I appreciate the sentiment of your comment but people don't upvote or downvote because something is true or not.
---
We live in a post-facts world. If you're not happy with the facts, you either put down the actual facts or make up your own. 
---
Thanks all the same though :)
---
Shh! Don't let Bethesda know about this!
---
‚ÄúThanks for doing business with us‚Äù -Todd
---
Well I put over 370 hours in the game, and I like. So I can give my opinion on it if I want. You have no place to tell me what I can type. The people in this sub act like they have some right to shut people down from giving an opinion. I defended this game and played it from the start. But what Bethesda did by hiding features that should have been in the game the entire time is a bad move to those who have stuck with it all the way.
---
dunno if you noticed but on reddit many posts start out with downvotes, just because anger is a better motivator  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE3j\_RHkqJc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE3j_RHkqJc) 
---
then sometimes people see it on controversial or new and start upvoting, be it due to context or that it was downvoted and people don't understand why
---
at a certain point of upvotes (lower single to two digits) the angry people are a lot more likely to just move on than to downvote, as opposed to 2 to 3 or especially negative karma, that is when psychologically the feeling of power and punishment feels most successful
---
it's a really crazy thing, becoming more and more the focus of scientific interest
---
but what I find even more crazy is in most unpop opinion threads where critic about downvote brigading and such is voiced, there's always several people who are like "but what about how else can we punish them?" "but it's right, we need to punish them"
---
it's similar in other places and the first websites changed their layout to not nurture this very easy to addict to thing of power abuse
---
imgur also has pretty regularly posts on how it's one of the most favorite things for people to do
---
"I only downvote"
---
and it's super interesting how many people will stop downvoting if they feel their downvote doesn't matter, a bit like in politics an real votes since "the enemy having votes" keeps those people from voting at all, just that in this case it's all about punishing people
---
supposedly it's a really big issue with how powerless people feel in this society and being forced to realize just how many people there are
---
The problem with adrenaline is that single shot rifles are too slow or use up too much AP in vats. You get less relative value out of it than other weapon builds and it's only 1 rank anyhow.
---
Do it if you have nothing better to spend it on but might be better off shifting some cards to take on some crit or defensive perks instead.
---
Yeah, a lot of us have known for months, even well before NW was released.
---
Bethesda did something back in the earlier days banning people. Not so much of late.
---
The truly sad thing is that it's not an issue of visibility. I'm pretty sure Bethesda knows. It's gotten so bad, some of these cheaters are so well known that even people who don't play NW know their names.
---
They say the server is started for you. They seem mostly unused. But it seems like things are missing in areas where i haven't been in days. But all the worlds may load up like that. I've never seen meat piles that weren't mine. I don't think they are giving us used servers, I think it loads the worlds up bad. ü§î
---
Exactly. Recently, a new cheat engine dupe method has been posted like once a week on UC. Bethesda is sloppy af
---
Yes they are they require servers and online connection to play. If anything destiny 2 would be more server intensive than fallout 76. There are a lot more players on that than 76.
---
HOW?! I purchased the most expensive edition because I thought this wasn't going to be a disaster of a game. Can someone give me a step-by-step about how I might go about doing this?
---
The gist of the argument was that steam argued it was a subscription service according to its TOS, but the court found that no one in the public would see it as such. 
---
I mean, it is a wierd subscription where you only pay once, have unlimited time to use the product and don't have a periodic fee...
---
bruh the BFV community was cancer until their latest update, then i came here and i noticed how cancer it is here and im hoping wastelanders will fix that
---
I bet by the time that comes out it'll be Fallout 1st early access like that EA thing. Anyone who doesn't pay has to wait 1 or 6 months depending on how they wanna do it.
---
Good for you man, in the meantime I shall sit here in Europe having bought the Tricentennial edition and regretting it entirely
---
Or spend time gathering.
---
You're mostly right. It's less that they stopped caring and more that PC players are always on the bottom rung. We just don't pull in as many sales as other platforms.
---
All the UI and interfaces are console-centric. It took considerably pressure early on to force Bethesda to implement changes and bug-fixes that were more PC-centric, such as unlocking FPS beyond 60, ultrawide monitor mode (which they did a hack job on) and so on. Why do you think people are STILL asking for text chat, a basic feature for a lot of PC games but not one that's all that useful for consoles.
---
If cheats and hacks were rampant on consoles as well, I'd imagine that we'd see more of a response.
---
FNV more than makes up for that.
---
this 
---
always looking for that quest to disable, switching tabs in the pipboy all the time...
---
I remember 2009's duststorm was around this time of year too.
---
Dont over think bad game decisions from zenemax
---
&gt;Bethesda said it‚Äôs supoosed to be their ‚Äúbiggest dlc we‚Äôve ever done‚Äù... 
---
They said it was the biggest free update for Fallout 76 they'd done, not the biggest DLC they'd ever done. 
---
&gt;that had me thinking about how Bethesda shut down that fallout 3 remaster mod a few years back. Maybe they‚Äôre planning on putting it in 76? 
---
It's not going be anything that huge. It's a game update. Think a slightly larger Wild Appalachia.
---
So does Fireproof lvl 3 üëç
---
Look at you, using the art of memisis to look like the rest of the criclejerk
---
Exactly. Frankly curious that there is more than one of these stories up right now
---
Its flat out disrespectful. Pc has the worst economy, the most flamboyant NW hackers and the most dupes. I'm baffled that they thought that no anti-cheat at all would be acceptable
---
They are basically remaking the game plus they cant since they said wastelanders is free content
---
wanker haha
---
It's all about priorities. It is what it is.
---
Yep. Same boat. Got it on sale when it went on a free trial week a while back. Played it a fair bit, haven't touched it since, then this all happened. I believed it had potential, excusing all the other garbage beforehand. Turns out touching fire burns you.
---
And anyone still playing and enjoying this game and STILL believes it can be redeemed, more power to you. But I think y'all could do better.
---
Look at you defending a terrible game.
---
There have been times where junk is dropped even while the event is still going.
---
I saw it and thought "oh my god this is horrible" and then I thought "$13 for 1600 atoms? I usually pay $16 for 1600 atoms."

They should have just left the stash box alone, and made scrap weightless for everyone. I haven't lost any scrap that I know of. But the fucking scrap system scraps everything in the stash box first, before using the scrap. So everything I was saving is gone now and any junk I want to save I have to list in a vending machine üò°
---
The tent is total pay to win and sadly I love it.
---
I got it for the atoms.
---
It could still be free but fallout 1st people would just get it earlier. They said everything with this game except cosmetics from the store was supposed to be free.
---
Yeah, but the costume does not use perk points.
---
I'm here from all and I dont know the situation with this game but why not just chargeback? That's what I do when I want to try a game with no refund policy.
---
nice! what about the other costumes?
---
if you kill ghouls in whitespring in a public server and switch to private, then the same ghouls are dead and the same goes for looting stuff
---
thought it was something like that
---
You are wrong they said they are only bringing 3 small dlc for free and then 3 big dlc for free
---
remember that good old video where people got banned for bullying a kid calling him a homo
---
You get our own.  I've test looted places and the respawn timer of objects works as I would expect for only one person on the server.  I do get my friends that drop in to my server from time to time and they may go and loot areas I would wager and kill things that they run into which would generate meat piles.
---
Yeah. Meanwhile, players are wiping NW matches and duping weapons and armor out the *ss
---
Oh Homie!
---
If your niece doesn't prefer power armor iron clad is definitely worth taking to boost that defense since your not wearing P.A.
---
Shit I should hit up Ubisoft re Breakpoint with threat of the ACCC. This is a milestone case.
---
In my humble opinion. They should made a law that bethesda should kiss ur ass while inserting ur purchase price in pennies into it, like a slot wait a slut machine. Cuz we all know they would have loved it.
---
I.o legislation doesnt even go far enough. They should pay a hefty fine imo.
---
This is just straight up customer deceit.
---
That was Santa covering his tracks
---
Yeah, she will wear PA in Nuke zones, obviously. But for most other activities she just prefers to wear regular outfits and armor. So I give her decent regular armor with lead lining. But when I saw that Iron Clad gives 10 resistance in both ballistic and energy, it seemed like it might be useful.
---
Cool dude. Must be very fun playing with a group of friends. I‚Äôve played solo must of the time and had a friend playing with me a few times. It was always fun.
---
The last 5 times I have tried the event it has crashed every single time right before the legendary robot appears or right as it appears. This is beyond frustrating.
---
Ah, a literal perfect first hand example of sunk cost fallacy. Nothing wrong with this, I feel the exact same way about other games too. But it's a dangerous thing that hours poured in give us an almost stockholm syndrome towards the game. That's exactly what live service game publishers want.
---
It definitely is a useful perk to take I myself have it maxed it out since I spend most of my time not wearing power armor unless of course the nuke zones come in and usually when you're in the nuke zones most enemies that I've seen just deal physical damage that your power armor should do fine against once you're done with the nuke zones just take off that power armor and your good to go explore again with the iron clad benefits becoming active again soon as you step out
---
The boss is garbage. The event is even moreso garbage with the lag. And it makes it extremely difficult on lower levels who constantly die because of the stupid bots getting triggered on the original grounds. I had 3 assaultrons kill me at once. Sorry. But bethesda did not PROPERLY think this event through. Only reason I stick to the game is because I want to see if Wastelanders will be good at the very least. Because this event is trash.
---
Criticals only apply to vats when your crit bar is full and you manually select to use it on an enemy. Stealth ‚Äúcriticals‚Äù are different. They are sneak attacks and don‚Äôt benefit from crit damage  directly. Now if your sneaking and get a crit shot in vats they will stack for some nasty damage.
---
A win for the Fister or the Fistee?
---
Actually, nevermind. I really don't want to know the answer to this one.
---
I wouldn't give them any money at all till they fix the game.
---
Nearly every PC game is digital nowadays, you can't avoid it. Physical copies just have a redeemable code which you can't refund or trade to another account.
---
At $100 per year and when you consider you get 1650 Atoms each month to boot, it's a terrific value for me because I  enjoy the game.  I didn't buy it because  it makes the "game less frustrating to play" as you stated in another post.  I bought it because it I ENJOY THE GAME.  I enjoy the private servers and the benefits they give me in a variety of ways as part of my entertainment.  The scrap box, tent, and Ranger outfit are great bonuses for what you get with the private servers as well.
---
I just don't want to feel like 400+ hours of my life were wasted but I can stop playing at any time. I feel the only thing compelling me to still play is the limited time rewards that I like as well as the datamined items that are coming relatively soon like all the communist china items, especially the power armour
---
He should of had fallout 1st lol
---
Yes
---
What originality, shall I save you the time and suggest your next copy paste line should be 'yOuR a sHiLl'
---
I don‚Äôt understand why you got downvoted. As someone who has a fully PvP build (to defend myself) I agree with your second part, PvP in this game it‚Äôs just for the sake of PvP. No penalties if you get killed, no gains if you kill. It just feels like a purposeless arcade sandbox.
---
You can't refund digital copies from uplay/Ubisoft store either. They were doing this before Bethesda launcher existed. Why are they not shamed into oblivion already?
---
havent had any issues getting the games i want on physical media. but there are always exceptions, i was excited for Youngbloods, but when they didnt offer physical, i opted out. No skin off my teeth. I just wont "buy" something that isnt "mine" anymore. i choose not to support that model.
---
Just submitted my second support ticket: Asking for a refund per the ACCC ruling. If I had realised that I could ask for a refund I would have, and since I've looked into the ACCC rules, it looks like I'm still able to get my refund so. FUCK BGS - and as to not break the rules of this sub, I will *not* be pirating the next Elder Scrolls. You're not getting one more damned one of my dollarydoo's.
---
I never understood to love for junkies. Is it really worthwhile dealing with all those debuffs from addictions. It‚Äôs not like there are any perks or mutations to lessen their effects.
---
Does that mean empath doesn't stack with more teammates?
---
That sound alright in that way but... average subscription fees would be about 0.14c a day, that is in USD. In AUS it's more than the conversion, every time.
---
But that aside, think of it in terms of fule, would you rather pay 0.27c per mL ($2.70 per L) or would you rather 0.14c per mL ($1.40 per L) ? This is the USD for example, now the AUD:
---
0.391c per mL ($3.91 per L) or 0.203 per mL ($2.03 per L) ?
---
No PC game you physically buy is refundable once you have used it's activation code, and most boxes include a steam code anyways.
---
Thx, that I wanted to be sure ;)
---
I'm holding off, I got the first 2 and decided to wait. I only really want the skeleton. It was so nice of them to let us earn it in November so that we can use it for Halloween next year. üòë ü§î üòï
---
The nuclear winter stuff should have been available before Mischief Night started. üòí
---
I dropped off 36 pumpkins last time
---
Yeah that was my thoughts too üò¶
---
Which America would put their foot down on Bethesda. I got burned so hard when I bought this...
---
So far but there are RUMORS it might change
---
That‚Äôs what I did. I doubt I‚Äôll be playing fallout consistently for an entire year to make that worthwhile, but one month is nothing. I still get the scrap box for that time so I‚Äôm just gathering materials like crazy plus I get to keep all cosmetic additions. The ranger helmet looks really nice with urban scout armor, plus it doesn‚Äôt reduce perception like other gas masks so you can wear it at all times without a penalty.
---
Not exactly true, I purchased a physical Sims 4 expansion pack and activated it only to realise I was given the wrong code in the right box by the store. I contacted EA and they reset the code and I returned it to the store for a full refund.
---
Two things could fix this.
---
Implement anti-cheat the way everyone else in the industry does, and raise the weapons levels to 100 so all the current magical weapons become underpowered junk.
---
I'm not holding my breath, but that would fix the current problems with cheaters and dupers.
---
Yea I have so many fusion cores now
---
Remember, bethesda is still a business and like any business, at the end of the day it‚Äôs always going to be about making money. They are not here to be your friend.
---
Putting the profit in profligate
---
That is all I want. I wanna rp as David S Pumpkins
---
Great job! I too asked for a refund and was refused over and over.
---
Any idea for people in the US what to do? We don‚Äôt have an ACCC...
---
Yes, they‚Äôre going to change out the outfit every couple months as well for a new one, as it currently works you have the option to modify the ‚Äúpaint‚Äù on the Ranger armour and helmet but you don‚Äôt have any options yet
---
Yes. That‚Äôs how it has worked for all of the others. I‚Äôve unlocked a few. I Currently have two challenges active. One shows 250 xp earned the other shows 600 or so.
---
You don‚Äôt need 7k xp in one day. You have until November 12.
---
I bought a month last night for the scrap box.
---
And avoid blowing up Whitespring buses
---
This right here is the most helpful thing in the wasteland and I thank all who do it. While not new, I did start over as of late, and those 10 c plans are life savers when building back up the collection.
---
Ranger Armour.. felt wrong at first (still does in a small way) but I‚Äôm treating it like an E3 Outfit Bundle and moving on
---
Just any anti-cheat would suffice in stopping 99% of the non sense going on right now. A majority of cheaters know nothing of programming and are just using the same thing 1 person made.
---
Really? Or do you have a dense mod on your chestplate? I do and I take 0 damage from them
---
Honestly going digital isn't even necessarily a bad thing, granted internet isnt where it should be at in all places but in the long run, at some point games are going to be only digital. Being able to cut out disc manufacturers, shippers, and retailers is good for a the producers and the consumer, only one really benefitting indirectly is the online platform
---
Well ppl got banned for using cheat engine before.
---
If they were carrying that much junk it‚Äôs their own fault. It‚Äôs the only consequence of death in this game.
---
Wrong thread
---
CE is one of the 3 programs that fo76 is actually looking for. It marks your account as "cheater".
---
But Beth doesn't care because there hasn't been a strong enough outcry for them to take action.
---
[https://youtu.be/cD9RMEb5Urw](https://youtu.be/cD9RMEb5Urw)
---
Nah they got banned for using cheat engine to do very specific tasks like 1 shot a queen. Plus, with 76 keys being sold for $6 on some sites, most just buy another account and continue hacking. It never fixes the multitude of hacks and problems associated with letting a player base openly use cheat engine. I can right now use cheat engine as long as i dont flag certain things
---
I'm on a basic ass xbox, yet I havent crashed or lagged out once, I've done the event an absolute ton, every time it pops up
---
Good job dude
---
No dense mod. Just zoned into a fissure site after event and noticed it, tested it out a little. Can wear nothing but the costume and take 0 damage from sb blast
---
Yeah, I guess my question is, I have the weapon and combat armour skin to unlock today, say if I play 1K points of NW today, when the skeleton challenge unlocks, will the points for that challenge be on 0 while the other 2 today be on 1k? If that makes any sense at all lol!
---
Im pretty sure ppl got banned for other reasons than that. Your account get flagged if you change the values on your character.
---
Huh, neat. Just traded the pirate suit for the fireman one last night, had the helmet already. Just to be safe I'll keep the dense chest on
---
It may mark a flag but all i have to do is change the string to twitch and bam. Cheating as usual. I kbow cause i did it to test. Bethesda needs to take a hard stance on client side modded files to stop cheating.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQjsFVPkGQs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQjsFVPkGQs)
---
You're welcome. It was worth waking up this morning see?
---
EA handles those cases really well if you've gotten a wrong product code or when a code isn't working. Since you've got a good reason, I doubt they'd be able to help you with the reason of, ' I just want to return the game to the store'
---
Well news flash. I changed my ap to infinite, bullet count to infinite. Still not banned.
---
It will be zero. If it‚Äôs not currently active, no xp Counts for it
---
I have never come across him (except for the Enlightenment event). I guess I need to quit fast-traveling so much and walk more.
---
No one got banned the second the used cheat engine, all of them got banned later.
---
Well im going on almost a year of testing haha since beta
---
Bethesda has become a trash company and hopefully this wakes them up about the quality of their games recently. After 76 I'm so scared of what the new far scrolls is going to be like...
---
See you next year for Wastelanders!
---
I used to post Camp videos to Casuals, then they said I couldn‚Äôt post YouTube links anymore, so I stopped. Then someone made a post of their YouTube and tagged me saying ‚Äúthank you for the idea!‚Äù And I was banned lulz 
---
Casuals is not very casual haha
---
For me its hard to believe that.
---
U got a video for the dupin i can see u know for research
---
Fallout 76 had by far one of the best communities in gaming, but those nice people have been pushed to far.
---
Many of the features you are paying for are owed to the people because we bought the game. By buying in to the scheme you are actively supporting bethesda in locking us out of content we are owed. So the concept of your consumer rights being violated is a chicken or the egg situation. 
---
Its an online game with an online service. If you dont like the pvp (a built in feature of the game) then utilize your private server. Its an online game, people are allowed to do as they please.
---
If you dont like it, blame bethesda. Their at fault. Not the community. If you want to see a real toxic community try GTA online of LoL.
---
Yeah. Go to unknown cheats and look for the fo76 dupe script if it hasnt been taken down yet. A new one surfaces every couple weeks now so dont worry if its not up right now
---
Ah, makes sense! So definitely wait until it unlocks then, thanks!
---

1\* Instigating Lever Action with a Calibrated Receiver
---
Use VATS and Sneak and you'll be 1 tapping level 68 super mutants and under.
---
Get a 2\* Handmade or Fixer with +50% VATS Critical, mod it with Tweaked Automatic Receiver and you'll be doing more damage then 95% of the ADS META builds.
---
HAHAHA! And how to not adore those kids defending Bethesda and whales giving them money just so they can suck a Bethesda giant fat D. :D
---
Well damn. At this point the pirate costume should give you double alchol effects as well as perk!
---
So 90% of matches had cheaters in it? That's far worse than when I used to play NW. Damn.
---
If that is the one you really want, I say yes. I decided just to go after that jackolantern combat rifle skin. That‚Äôs enough for me
---
my known plans are always up in my vendor for 0 caps each :) spread some joy
---
To my knowledge it goes by every time you activate the fire button/key. So if you spray and hold down the key with an auto weapon it only counts as 1 chance to proc instead of every time a bullet or laser is fired from the weapon
---
Why does Fallout 1st just kinda sound like Ark's basegame
---
Hitting the nail on the head.
---
There's always lots of people willing to help you. You dont need the p2win, I love helping people just like most of our player base. Being poor sucks as does feeling like a large section of the player base has a huge advantage over you. 
---
Do you need certain stuff on pc? Lemme know I can reinstall and drop stuff off to you.
---
Seems like a problem on your end, I have an xbox1 I got when they first released, no problems like that, but the occasional crash while doing something random
---
Thanks man!
---
Upvoted for giving your shit away.  Downvote for not inviting me to your party.  Upvote for video.
---
This conversation is a gem.
---
Same. Bethesda support were the final straw for me. Copy and paste responses, and clearly couldn‚Äôt give a crap. See you all somewhere else.
---
Combat not scout.
---
Are you really salty over people calling out you idiots for defending garbage?. Open your eyes the game has been a shit show since release. Face it Fallout is gone. They killed the series.
---
I would like to see the roving trader outfit &amp; cap included in-game
---
Been saying exactly this since first cheaters in NW appeared. Their unfettered presence absolutely deters legit players... 
---
I honestly can't comprehend why devs don't have a dedicated banhammer person going through reports/vids and cleaning this shit. Guess Atom shop needing new skins takes precedence.
---
If you stop tracking them they should never pop up again. They all give script tho, so I do them all.
---
Heart of the enemy gives 8 script the most from what I've checked.
---
Taking a couple seconds to get Jack some pumpkins, 4 script.
---
Getting Red Rocket cores, or Queen of the Hunt 7 script.
---
Getting Sweetwater some honey, 3 script.
---
All the Camden park ones are 5 script.
---
And there's a possibility of getting one star legendarys as well. ü§î
---
Agree. I‚Äôve been playing the best fallout game ever as captain Hawthorne. Ain‚Äôt nobody gonna tell me I‚Äôm not captain Hawthorne.
---
Ppl got banned for using it a year ago. Why would they remove the protection now after a year? Also i still play the game, every day in fact.
---
Good!
---
The fact that people have the opportunity to be assholes in this game is a good thing. That means when you encounter someone who isn't an asshole, that encounter is meaningful.
---
This is what a functional democracy looks like.
---
To bad I live in the Corporatist, Fascist United States.
---
Yup, only if you have a genuine reason.  I was refunding the scrap bot because they stealth nerfed it‚Äôs collection rates after I had bought it.  They changed a product that I had.
---
There‚Äôs a big difference between getting a refund from Amazon and Bethesda you imbecile
---
Oh okay I bought it too, what was the Nerf about ? I'll probably won't refund it because I like that something happens in the camp now, but I'd like to know the Nerf
---
I sure fucking hope so. I really miss survival mode. I haven't wanted to play since it went down.
---
They went in and changed its collection rates and tried to hide it from the patch notes, but if you compare the files it was obviously intentional.  
---
Just got a response back, claiming it was an accident and they‚Äôll look into it.  I really doubt that a file was accidentally opened and somehow exactly half the rates were changed.
---
Are you crazy?! Go look up beef_curtons. Cheating is alive and well. People didn't get banned for using cheat ebgine a year ago. They got banned for having 100k of the aame legendary and then claimed they didnt dupe. Do t be naive
---
They would not be for displaying. It'd be so you can easily switch what armor set you're wearing.
---
Thx!
---
Brand new instance
---
Lol I just wanted to post a positive thing for once because of all the hate that the game is receiving. I mean I understand why it is but idk... I just wanted to try to even it out I guess
---
actually you're not buying the game, but the access to it, I think
---
Dont buy this shit!! If people buy it they dont stop
---
Cmon guys money for Private Servers????
---
They will never Chance, only if no one buys it
---
Let‚Äôs see what they can make in a year sure Im not expecting a incredibly deep or multiple quest.
---
It has the potential to be a great game, but bethesda isn't trying to make to best out of it. It's like if they had the pieces to build a ferrari but decided to put them together with duct tape
---
If Bethesda allows Camp damage it means you remove Camp feature.
---
I just pee in that water fountain that cures diseases.
---
I get this sometimes, I jump in at the end of the event. Normally it doesn't crash then. Maybe try that?
---
Yeah, i know there are cheaters in the game. Seen them in nuclear winter aswell. Its been a big problem for the game. But i don't think its cheat engine they are using but some other hacking tool.
---
Still think ppl will get banned when using cheat engine. Even trading high amount of items between characters can get you banned,  which is wrong.
---
If you don't use PA you have to take this perk at max level.
---
I don't care about the subscription. I'm still bummed about survival mode being wiped. Haven't had much desire to play at all since. It's not like a grand protest or anything, I just straight up lost my appetite for this game. The few times I fired up the game I just stared at the wall in my camp before giving up and moving on. Like I want to play, I miss the game, I might have supported them, idk. But adventure mode is like a flat crappy version of the game I've been playing. Haven't been able to enjoy the game since.
---
I agree... I miss the danger aspect of the game. Always being on guard around other players. I also think we should lose junk during events. Now I don't care to die during events. I played way differently back then.
---
That might be the case, but if so, the repair done is less than 1% and thats kinda useless for a 3 point card
---
So *that's* why there's a sulphur taste!

what u think about that? Only may swap out barbarian for bandolier, just concerned about cary weight really and farming for weapons to sell.  I have the tadpole backpack but i havent ever got all the stuff to max carry weight of it and dont even know what u do to do it since ive always ran power armor.
---
The whole game, the base game that is. In AUS that cost $100 (That's about $69.09 USD, though I think it was more like $72 USD at the time.)
---
if only the game got moderated as strictly as this subreddit. the post already got deleted by the mods because I guess the truth hurts
---
Where do you find dense mod? Never found it for my chest üò≠
---
It's funny you say that considering there people with top end PC's and on all platforms with the same problem. Its more fallout 76 can't handle the event
---
Come on dude. I was hoping that this wouldn't be the place for that kind of thing.
---
Feel free to make your own post about it elsewhere. Just wanted this post to see why people chose to buy into the subscription and for how long. This is not helping.
---
I didn't ask for anything personally just looking for a community work around for the questionable decision the developers made
---
What promise? Wastelanders is free, there is no quest in the game locked behind a pay wall. 
---
The scrap box is bullshit, doesn‚Äôt affect me in any way shape or form, I‚Äôm not going to win the game just because I have a million moulded plastic. 
---
Would you prefer that wastelanders was a paid DLC and the subscription gone? because as it stands you don‚Äôt have to spend a single cent more with Bethesda and you are still getting wastelanders for free.
---
Youre not at risk, itd be same as the marine helmet that they said is fine, and if it becomes a problem they can just delete them all. Doesnt help you really in any way so i wouldnt worry. Ive collected dev room items and similar since i first learned about them, had that plan for months and im fine.
---
Awesome üëç
---
I'm pretty sure they're reused. I went to take munitions factory last night, and there was a machinegun turret inside that I didn't place. No one was in my server but me.
---
I don't 'hate' the game it just becomes very boring after getting to the nuke launch stage, I still play fallout 4 instead of this (I know they are different types of games). I can replay f4 over and over and have 4 days of in game hours before starting with the middle to end parts of main questline, this a lot to do with settlement building as well, but I just feel like when Wastelanders is released (if its good and bug free) what f76 should have been on release rather than just plopping some human npcs into a game after more than a year of bugginess and bullshit that led to a lot of disappointment due to the fact they charged ¬£50-60 for it. Then asking for an extra ¬£13 p/m just to get access to something that also should have been in the game on release. My main problem with it is that felt so unfinished and unpolished (which is still is) and not worth the money I paid for it
---
Might pop in every once in a while for a game of NW or something, but won't be logging in every day any more. There's nothing for me to do.
---
Sure it is. It's true for the worlds I visited at least and in my circle of friends. I mean, you basically telling the other gamers that your a piece of shit. Screwing future gamers with bad purchases because you have the money to burn is selfish and dumb. They are hurting the real players. When someone gets First it should banish them to First only servers ... Public and private do not mix.

If you use a high damage rifle like a gauss consider skipping tank killer. The single shot damage is high enough you will get a minimal  damage increase from tank killer perk.

Game itself is wonderful with an incredible amount of detail.  But the structure of the Atom store is offputting. And subscriptions for a full price game that isn't close to the MMO scale of ESO or WoW is not good.

---
   * On a related point, bugs that were previously fixed regularly get introduced back into the game

* The introduction of new features that no one asked for and have been the cause of several game-breaking issues that have lasted a long time before being fixed, such as:

   * A public event queue. All people asked for was a notification when a large public event went live. That's it. No one asked for it to be placed in a queue.
---
* A very mediocre main story and no dialogue system to interact with the few notable NPCs in the game, none of whom are human
---
* The game is very unbalanced in almost every aspect - combat, inventory management, player economy
---
* Bethesda broke a promise for the Atom Store to be cosmetic-only and incorporated [pay2win](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-to-play#Pay-to-win) utility items. Click on the link if you want to get all mealy-mouthed about what pay2win actually means.
---
* While more the dev than the game itself, Bethesda has numerous instances where it's acted in bad faith. While it's not about the game itself, it directly impacts the game. A few examples include:
---
   * The previous point about cosmetics-only promise
---
   * Various support snafus including illegally refusing refunds for Australians that they were entitled to
---
   * Illegally selling new items on the Atom Store at a discount when it was never sold at full price (several countries)
---
   * Taking the community's feedback to improve the game and selling it back to them, rather than improving the core game
---
* Content is lacking, particularly for the endgame and Bethesda hasn't delivered close to half of what they promised in their 2019 roadmap
---
* When we do get new content, often it's poorly thought out and not well tested. Examples include:
---
   * Project Paradise
---
   * Vault Raid No. 2
---
   * Matchmaking for Nuclear Winter battle royale mode
---
   * Survival mode. So much so that it eventually was abandoned
---
The truly sad this is that this list is hardly comprehensive. It's just what comes to mind now.
---
In some ways, I don't even really hate the game. The game is almost a victim in of itself, much like a good portion of the player base. It's really Bethesda I seriously dislike.
---
I am not entitled, just suggesting a way for the fallout community to bypass the developers choice to lock unlimited storage behind not just a pay wall but a monthly pay wall
---
Sure, but at the same time, that's 30 HP you have to replenish in some way.
---
I realize that's not hard - taking a Stimpack or chugging water - but it's not like you're getting that 30 HP for free.
---
I know someone with at least 3300 hours now, I have over 2000. The game is what you make if it. I‚Äôve added at least 400 people to my friends list since the game came out, everyone is doing something sort of different and has something unique to add to the game :) my friends list is still very active and it‚Äôs very normal to see 100 people playing at one time. Despite all the bugs, I‚Äôve had an amazing time
---
Have you tried lowering your graphics settings for the event?
---
WELCOME TO THE CLUB
---
Don't build a game if you don't have the capital to do basic maintenance. Relying on your user for funds, is a great way to crash
---
Yeah, but there's always a limit, a point at which the cost of going through the red tape, pushing for the rating they need, the increased staffing cost of having one country with a different refund system...
---
Just pushes them into the point of "This is just too much for this one country", I doubt it'd be this refund policy specifically that does it, but it's another straw on the camels back to businesses already dealing with a lot of crap in australia.
---
I high doubt they can.
---
Sorry, but are you directing that sarcasm at me? Because I agree with you.
---
Thanks to this people the refunds I'd getting harder and harder to get.. I never refunded anything, I don't buy atoms I just buy the stuff in the atomic shop with the atoms I earn in the game. To be honest I don't feel like refunding something I bought because I wanted it. Maybe if I haven't noticed that the thing I bought is only a skin or something, maybe then I would consider refund.
---
Appreciate the offer, I personal need nothing, allowing others to use your server is nice, not that you could stop them if they are on your friends list
---
No thanks.
---
Too many people doing the event. It's too much for the game. I honestly believe they test it, they see it collapse and say "we can't do better, lets hope it Is enough".
---
Lmao I don‚Äôt want no damn refund. I just want them fuckgoofs to get a team to focus on actually making 76 playable. Stupid micro transactions. Don‚Äôt get me wrong cosmetics are nice and I‚Äôd pay for more...but it seems that‚Äôs all everyone is worried about now days. Instead of actually getting a good rep for the game, it‚Äôs like all these companies are seeing who can get the worse backlash from micro transactions
---
This sounds like a trick and a treat.
---
What's more interesting is that was the only thing I found off. Nothing seemed to be looted anywhere, and didn't find any dead enemies. It's hard to tell but maybe it just didn't entirely reset, and my thought about them being reused could be wrong.
---
Raider one came in the same patch, it's the scrappy one that was released to the Atomic Shop a bit ago, along with the non-Power armor one.
---
Dance emotes
---
&gt;aged account
---
&gt;no comment or post history 
---
bethesda really out here buying aged accounts lol
---
Yeh I know what you‚Äôre getting at and I agree
---
Bruh
---
I wasn't attacking anyone there, calm down!
---
So now have a tent, a unlimited scrap box, a scrap robot and a fridge are now behind a pay wall. All are gameplay related items which break their promise that all that sort of stuff would be free.
---
And to answer your question, no, I'd prefer then to sick with their promises though. If you look at the economics behind a business, everyone who brought those items or the subscription have told them its okay to do what their doing. You may feel that way to. However it is true that as a result, more content will be behind a pay wall. The game will remain broken as there's not business sense to fix it (not profitable as people are paying already) and you never know, maybe there will be paid DLC one day. Not all live services have free DLC.
---
Edit, fixed my bad spelling
---
Are you picking up 180 other items to refresh the spawns?
---
I agree to a point. I definitely miss that fear and adrenaline when you just looted a place and you saw someone getting close. Having to bury your little shack out in the middle of nowhere. 
---
In the early days, this game was exciting and dangerous. Now its soft and fluffy. I'm not a pvp'er by any means but I can definitely hold my own if need be. The wasteland doesnt feel like the wasteland anymore. I'm no more afraid of a person than I am a mole miner. Maybe the next patch they will get rid of all the weapons except the commie whacker (no bladed mod of course) and a junk gun that will only fire teddy bears.
---
Yea thats not bad, try to squeeze escape artist into your agility somewhere. That perk is amazing for stealth, when you crouch the enemies lose sight of you and you can keep sneak attacking them. 
---
If you do find that you need more carry weight, you could move points from luck to strength and get some weight perks, radicool isn't too bad either, if you stay low health it will add 10 strength? I dont remember exactly how much. Full unyielding set will add 15 strength, so that helps too. 
---
Keep an eye out for weight reduced legendary pieces, that will help with weapon weight. I also look out for any unyielding with the increased sneak effect so maybe keep that in mind too for combat effectiveness.
---
Getting the high capacity backpack mod takes a while, its a grind for sure. Might have to look up a guide on how to do it. The 2 possum scout dailies(stings and things, and operation tidy) and the campfire tales event give out possum badges sometimes, its a 25% chance to get one. You can also complete the possum challenges, its under world in your challenge list. You need 8 possum badges, it will take a while.
---
Here's the build I'm using if you need any reference.

---
JuiceHead has made me well aware.. I really want that Armoured Veteran one.. makes me wonder if they‚Äôll do more New Vegas outfits and skins in the future like a Sequoia skin for all revolver weapons
---
Holy shit I‚Äôm jealous
---
Lol yeah I was as surprised as you, I read about it in the below article, obviously there‚Äôs more to it than just trying to finish as quickly as possible, I heard most people finish the main quest in 30 to 40 hrs. I was just making the point it‚Äôs impossible to finish FO76 in less than 30 mins, and now we‚Äôre getting practically another game with wastelanders as well what we‚Äôve already got in nuclear winter and some of the other events and raids etc..
---
https://www.pcgamer.com/the-outer-worlds-speedrunner-finishes-in-under-25-minutes/
---
Yes on PC. No one won the match. Thats what was buggy. I stayed til it shut down the match. I agree about the cheaters, but I would assume that they would have won after the team died... but no one did.
---
Over two days probably several times that... i mean, its fine, i still get it on regular servers, just have to compete for it.
---
You couldn‚Äôt stand any other game in the franchise... the fuck is wrong with you? I mean the positivity is a breath of fresh air on this sub, but the fuck is wrong with you...???
---
So I agree with this except for hating the others. Nothing will beat 3 for me, but like you said.. cant put my finger on it but I love it. I love the creativity, people coming to my camp, seeing other builds and just... constant stuff happening. I just love fallout haha
---
It all seemed like a good deal but if I were to buy those same emotes in the atom shop they would be around the same price point
---
This series has printed money the only reason their charging more now is becuz they shit the bed they dont need to but why not work for free the money they got from initial sales shouldve been more than enough i like the game to an extent but cmon this game was basically fallout 4 with alotta stuff ripped out i doubt it cost alot to make to begin with
---
Thanks, i'll try this later!
---
I like it too, but feel like Beth doesn't know how to make a endgame.
---
God 60 bucks. And you waited a year? You probably had 30 times that amount so was it even worth it?
---
I got sheepsquatch staff plan, but i did nukes in between so maybe it dropped from queen
---
If you're not literate enough to type "by accident" instead of "on accident", perhaps you shouldn't be criticising the intelligence of others?
---
Probably because it seems like you‚Äôre just trying to whip up a hate-frenzy. 
---
If you were serious, all you have to do is scroll down the main page of this sub and you‚Äôll already have all the answers you need.
---
Wah wah no one cares.  Nothing worse than people that make "exit" posts.  Just freaking leave, and stop looking for validation.  Tons of people still play the game and will continue to, you're trying to validate you're leaving the game and thinking that you are going to make tons of change and all these people will leave with you.
---
You're not that special or important.
---
Outside in the laundry area I believe
---
It‚Äôs extremely rare for a company to invest time, money, and effort into a project that they ‚Äòknow is a bad idea‚Äô.
---
That tinfoil hat really fits to halloween.
---
That can't be said because they seem to be enjoying the game. 
---
What is with you people that won't let other people like what you don't like?  Go play something else.
---
Yeah fallout 76 is a good game
---
Eh you're in a post apocalyptic wasteland so finders keepers.
---
Record proof
---
Interesting. Thanks for clarifying :)
---
Are we talking about the same Bugthesda?
---
It‚Äôs weird sometimes 1-2 people show up and other times 12-15 people show up I guess just depends
---
someone could just be experimenting with hacks, trying to perfect their mod.
---
What project investment all they did was put some clothes in there which theyve been doin for a while unlock some servers and release a tent and a box behind a paywall oh and throw some atoms in there other than the servers i see no real investment here
---
Forget that, try Auntie Cleo‚Äôs!
---
Udom might not believe you.
---
He was a twat for doing the dance to rub your face in it but you were really silly to drop it on the floor in front of a random.
---
Just hold a button for a few seconds and trade with your friend. I don't know why people still drop valuables on the floor.
---
Most players are really nice and good peeps. There's a small number that are outright dicks too though.
---
It was in a private server. I'll check back later today though:) is it always in an upstairs room with a hole in the wall leading outside?
---
Pre-war firemen weren't fucking around
---
you‚Äôre doing great lol
---
Idk about that because I've damaged random camps recently without being in pvp
---
Funny you should ask...
---

---
From what I‚Äôve seen, yes. I‚Äôm not talking about just on this subreddit.
---
And even on this subreddit I see a lot of the people with negative views are either the same people that regularly have nothing but negative things to say about the game or Bethesda, others that admit they haven‚Äôt played in a long time, and even some that admit they‚Äôve never played the game. 
---
There‚Äôs the extremists on both sides; those that will trash talk anything Bethesda does and/or this game, and those that claim Bethesda and this game are perfect in every way. 
---
But when you get to the middle majority, those that look at it rationally, I‚Äôve seen more than see the value here than those that don‚Äôt.
---
If u wanna see real whining i can start complaining about games that bring more tears than this game
---
YES PLEASE, I loved traveling the wasteland so I could find camps to unload on, that was my endgame.
---
It won't, but I'm staying for the drama
---
What was that? I couldn't hear you over the sound of reupping my WoW account for another disappointing expansion.
---
I‚Äôm not sure they could. Logically, they could lock it behind a paywall for sure. But I would say the vast majority of players do not have fallout 1st. On that token, there would be far to much disparity between non 1st and everyone else. If there was such a huge landscape altering dlc as wastelanders is looking to be, and they locked it behind a paywall, the vast vast majority of people without it would cease playing entirely. With that, I don‚Äôt think they could lock it behind paywall.
---
Unlikely to happen anytime soon. The tech is there, the companies just wont allow it. Somebody would have to convince Microsoft and Sony that allowing crossplay would make them more money than keeping players separated does.
---
Yeah that's my friend. Just wanted to ask it myself
---
Strangler is pretty good overall but ballistic dr goes to t51 I believe
---
Marketing. Design. Implementation. 
---
They didn‚Äôt just ‚Äòhit a button‚Äô and call it a day. 
---
And regardless of the effort involved, intentionally implementing something that they believe is a ‚Äòbad idea‚Äô is not something hardly any company does.
---
I heard something about exploiting traps. Maybe because of punji board traps? I don't have any traps or turrets, they are crap.
---
I get that POV honestly, it‚Äôs like watching your junkie best friend get clean. 
---
You know it‚Äôs self destructive but you want them to get better, yknow?
---
Firstly you never answered my question, would you prefer wastelanders to be a paid DLC and no subscription or atom store or is it just that you want them to add content for free? 
---
like I said a tent and a scrap box are not items needed to play the game. I‚Äôve been playing the game without them since launch never needed them and never will. So to say that you need a scrap box or a tent or a scrap robot to play this game is just wrong.
---
But you are correct in one thing and that is that everyone who has paid the subscription or bought atoms have sent a message to Bethesda, but that message is that ‚Äúwe like this game, we want to see it progress, we want new content, and here‚Äôs the means to create that content‚Äù 
---
Like it or lump it, game companies have to make money so wether you the consumer pays for it as DLC or a subscription is irrelevant, if they don‚Äôt make money you don‚Äôt get your content, the only difference with this service is that you and I will be able to play wastelanders free of charge and those with the means to pay the subscription are funding our ability to do so.
---
No one is hating on the game everyone is hating fallout 1st
---
Wait, so you're making a duplicate post from a friend you knew already post this same post?
---
Why?
---
Don't know
---
Ive expierenced this on xbox, my team (3 left?) was the last. At the end there was no where to go, and we searched like hell, the last tiny circle. Then we were all engulfed and still  no one to be seen.
---
Everyone commenting "uninstalled days ago and never looked back" are looking back, posting on a 76 thread. Is funny
---
I haven't seen any hate lately about 76, just people hating on 1st.
---
Because that's a cool thing to do in internet.
---
Just felt like I had to do it to em
---
Well done on the video.
---
I like the secondary camp. Also the private servers.
---
T51 all the way
---
\*$100, more expensive in Australia. Also it was worth it, I'm not rich and I don't like wasting money.
---
T-51b
---
Nice.
---
True
---
It really do be like that
---
I‚Äôve run it dozens of times! Only missing the Empty Pumpkin Rack and the Short Jack O Lantern Suit.
---
In the video game industry it seems strangely common otherwise yes ud be right normal companies also weigh public perception in there too but all the shit this game gets i dont think they even care anymore
---
I've never seen one dirt cheap on ps4. They may be duped into oblivion, but they still go for a good amount.
---
I literally just said pacifist protects you from PvP................................
---
Because 76 hated us first üòâ
---
Oh for sure, I completely agree.  This has been my favorite game and I can only hope that it stays on the right path.
---
You have to be engaged in PvP with the owner to destroy their camp
---
If you enjoyed your time man, it wasn't a waste
---
Imagine playing a game you don‚Äôt like because you want to prove something on the internet. Sad days. You c bat convince anyone you like it brother. Good luck.
---
Because it‚Äôs so buggy and it includes things we wanted, but are locked behind a paywall
---
With Outer Worlds out, there's little to no reason to play Bethesda games anymore. Until of course you finish Outer Worlds, which will take a while. But even then, there's better to choose from than a Bethesda game anyway.
---
Game is very soft. It was soft to start with now its a childrens playground.
---
&gt; I mean I literally couldn‚Äôt stand all the other Fallout games.
---
Oh this is who bethesda makes content for and who actively likes the game then. People who don't like Fallout. Makes sense why it's such a bad game.
---
:D
---
interesting Idea
---
Why not , provide a reason
---
Really sorry for the super late reply, but I was surfing around and saw your comment and felt like I had to respond:
---
For one, I think given the sheer amount of hype Doom Eternal has going for it everywhere online along with it looking fantastic, it's bound to do well. The first teaser alone racked up 14 million views on YouTube, with subsequent gameplay videos also reaching millions and being very positively received for the most part. If the game reviews well, which is looking rather likely IMO, I think it'll do great sales-wise.
---
As for the preorder numbers, DOOM Eternal was not available on Steam for a number of months after its initial announcement, while preorders were quickly opened on Bethesda.net. That may explain why the numbers may have seemed weird or low.
---
Moving on to Starfield, I kind of agree that it will likely end up not selling as much as a TES or Fallout game by virtue of it being a new IP. However, I don't think reputation will have a major impact on it. For all its flaws and the endless controversies and internet bashing, 76 still has a very sizable playerbase as evident from the community, and has managed to remain in the Xbox top 50 long after its release while others like Division 2 and Anthem have long since dropped out (it's at no. 38 right now in the US). The casual player (who are what make the vast majority of people who buy big AAA video games) also does not care for internet controversies, no matter how major they may be. If the game ends up reviewing well and looking good, and is advertised as well as Bethesda games usually are, I think it'll still sell very well. The issue is it won't sell as well as their other two prominent IPs, as I pointed out, but that is something Bethesda Softworks has already accounted for.
---
Leaving all that aside though, even in the off-chance that nothing is as expected, I do not think Bethesda Game Studios will stop making single-player games at any point in time due to publisher pressures. Even for other big name publishers like EA and Activision whose online, multiplayer titles are often their greatest sources of revenue (e.g. COD, Battlefield, FIFA), they still publish single-player games and include single-player experiences along with multiplayer ones because that market will always be there. Zenimax might decide to open up more studios and make more online games, but I doubt any reasonable publisher would force their developers to make games that are not their area of specialty. For what it's worth, TES VI will inevitably sell gangbusters anyway (doubly so if Starfield turns out to be good).The Creation Club's existence means a form of tail-end monetization already exists, and I can't really see anything else being added to Bethesda games or replacing those. They'll be fine, IMO.
---
LOL Is this still happening? Time to pop on my 1st icon and my NCR gear.
---
I got a meat pile in the first office on the left in Defiance when I hadn‚Äôt been there for at least a week. It was still there on the public server last night after 3 days. It doesn‚Äôt have a title so I think it‚Äôs a bug following me. 
---
The first time I went to a private world it was pristine. I never realized him much junk is actually supposed to lying around.
---
True, just sad to see alot of people who've been playing for a long time playing for just as long as me or longer and quitting to potentially return next february
---
You and me both. I played the game for a year when it was released so i seen some shit and this is the lowest. Like you said hopefully they bounce back cause it is fun and a good game to play.
---
Fallout was one of my favorite franchises, until Bethesda took over and turned it into something completely different. Also Bethesda's awful money-grabbing business practices, I have no desire to support their greed.
---
Look at it from the perspective of a character already wearing gear/leveled a bit.  Imagine you have like 100 HP and 100 DR.
---
Going from 100 DR to 130 DR isn't going to change much for the vast majority of low damage hits you take... A 25 damage hit, for example, would be reduced to 7.5 damage with 100 DR; you can take 14 hits from that 25 damage attack reduced to 7.5 damage at 100 DR with 100 HP... With ironman and an extra 30 DR, that 25 hit would only be reduced to like 7.2 or something instead because there are diminishing returns the higher your DR gets relative to the hit... At 7.2 damage, it would still take the same 14 hits to drop you...  So you just used 3 perk points to accomplish nothing.  Where as with the 30 extra HP, you could just eat 4 extra 7.5 damage shots, meaning it would take 18 hits to take you down.
---
For higher damage hits (hits that are up near your DR in value), it would matter more, but even then, the effect would be marginal... 100 damage hit at 100 DR would be 50 damage taken... Going up to 130 DR it would instead be like 45 damage taken or something like that.  Either perk would make you take 3 hits to go down instead of 2 (3 50 damage hits at 130 HP or 3 45 damage hits at 100 HP), so its not like one is better than the other in such a situation... But for lower hits more HP has the clear advantage.
---
Stop being the big broke
---
No
---
CAMPS are actually very tanky atm. But I do think there should be some sort of pay off for pillaging someones CAMP beside just to piss them off or troll them. Like In my opinion you should be able to rob peoples stash boxes of junk or get the materials for every piece of their camp you destroy.
---
Says a guy who got FARMED by a 'foodbuild'.
---
I wish I could lol
---
they'll be like "is this a cosmetic?"
---
Same
---
You're doing the right thing man, Ever upwards.
---
I feel ya, but I have 800+ hours into this game on an endgame main and still love it to death.
---
But I also know that Bethesda will believe it‚Äôs OK to continue practicing shady business models like F1st if their metrics stay on trend. That‚Äôs all they care about, cost benefit analysis to the stakeholders.
---
By playing, you‚Äôre still a potential customer, regardless if you purchase or not; losing customers is the only way to show them you‚Äôre not supporting their stupid decisions.
---
Did they start class warfare so Todd would have his flavor added to the game üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I suggested a solution to this in the post have pacisfist mode protect you from camp destruction and slap damage. Slap damage worked well imo because you could be doing your own thing but still be bullied or threatened by other players but not insta murdered so you have some time to outwit a group of people surrounding you, yet you still feel pressured because they are draining your hp with powerfists . My best experiences in this game were the early days where I had a well know griefer on my friends list and he'd hunt me down sometimes with his sidekicks. If I ever didn't want to deal with him I'd just block him.
---
Agree
---
what do you mean?
---
That meat piles is a bug, or something having to do with the story because it's there for me too.
---
false, any common clothing item would stack (no durability stat)
---
Time that you enjoyed is not time wasted.
---
Same. Something about it is so alluring and enjoyable. It's honestly even better now that all the cringiest dramatic people are valiantly uninstalling to protest optional content lol
---
Maybe don‚Äôt release poor quality products and you won‚Äôt have to rely on over priced subscription models to float your business.
---
If you can‚Äôt preform the very function your business exists to preform, you shouldn‚Äôt be in business. It‚Äôs that simple.
---
You having played fallout 1/2 (as have the majority of fans) is irrelevant and I don‚Äôt see why your post was half you asserting your tenure with the series as if that means anything at all.
---
Do you really think they plan to improve though? Do you really think Wastelanders content wont be locked behind 1st?
---
All the downvotes are food builds lol
---
another 2 months old account, seems legit
---
What does that even mean? I joined reddit two months ago... okay?
---
You'll be back, they always will
---
Just leave pacifist on and it wouldn't bother you.
---
Slap damage would only happen if you didn't have pacifist on. You could still play vanilla that way. Give us the option at least.
---
In terms of the number of hits you can take, yeah.
---
Damage resistance scales pretty well up to the damage of the attack you are getting hit with; if those values are equal you take 50% reduced damage.  IE: 25 damage attack at 25 DR, you only take 12.5 damage.  But once you get above the attack's damage, DR starts getting hit with significant diminishing returns to where you need far more of it to make much of a difference.
---
I, myself, have been playing fallout since 97 and never knew about this project. Thank you for the read. üëç
---
Man that video is fantastic. While I haven‚Äôt logged in in months, I can‚Äôt just give away all my stuff or delete my characters in the hope this game will turn it around, but in all seriousness it‚Äôs a year post launch the turn around isn‚Äôt happening and the Fallout 1st leaves the sourest of tastes in my mouth.
---
Good luck out there OP.
---
I can afford it but I won‚Äôt be getting it, there‚Äôs nothing really important to me in it. don‚Äôt feel left out.
---
Shoulda just not bought it
---
I can certainly understand why you gave it up. I played the game during the open beta. And I played into December or even January. But I kept getting kicked from the servers during the fight with the SBQ.
---
I quit.
---
But I heard Wastelanders was coming out a few weeks ago. And started up a fresh character. I find the Pioneer Scout stuff to be refreshing. 
---
I come home wanting to play. Yeah the Fallout 1st stuff sucks but I dont find myself wanting that.
---
When the game gets better and based off what I'm seeing after almost a year away, I believe it will. But maybe when you return. Starting a fresh character can give you a new appreciation. 
---
If you choose not to return I get it. Hope the next game will do it for you.
---
Lol, is that you Todd?
---
Fallout 2nd subscription? But in all honesty, yes this would be great.
---
I was wearing this cause I thought it was cool, wish I didn't read this cause now I feel guilty...
---
Ah yes, copy paste response #11. Wanna know why I think your opinion is irrelevent? Why I disregard your high horse crusader nonsense? I got exactly what I wanted out of Fallout 76. Back in Fallout 3 (where third person was effectively useless) I always said to my friends about how I, and them, wanted Multiplayer Fallout. Fallout 76 Gave us that in spades. The Series will continue, it will thrive, and no amount of crusader salt will stop that.
---
Why would we buy the game again?
---
The subscription isn't really overpriced at all private servers like this usually have a subscription service like this.
---
That‚Äôs smart, I‚Äôll add one of those too. Also will build a sign at workshops.
---
Claim a workshop?
---
Oh please rich people my ass. Skip a few cups a coffee at dunks and poof your a First. You all act like you're in the gutter poor. If you're playing games your far from destitute...
---
The point is the subscription is not cosmetic in nature and Pete Hines said they would only be doing cosmetics for additional revenue.
---
I can see some of that for people who claim they‚Äôre RPing as ‚Äúraiders‚Äù but the Moth dance... that‚Äôs inexcusable. Doing the Moth dance should spawn an invincible Mothman to kill whoever just did it.
---
I've found it pretty packed consistently in my experience, This was even middle of the night
---
I think there was a post, when someone said, that the PA display in the data files already, so lets hope we will get the display station soon.
---
It really would
---
How many atoms is wastelanders going to cost? I bet about 3000. Unless your a 1st member of course. Then its just 10,000 atoms.
---
This but unironically
---
#HEY GUYS BETHESDA BAD GIVE UPVOTES
---
Yeah. Lets hope
---
Strange ghost music again...must be nuthin
---
I‚Äôm surprised at outer worlds popularity and immediate fandom, the game isn‚Äôt bad but just feels generic and last gen in some ways.
---
Calm down Todd
---
Me to all four builds, I got sick and tired of repeating the same thing over and over, this game needs a definite end to it. Finally got fed up of server breakdowns at the end of quests and the purveyor us just a joke, so long can't say it's been good to know you.
---
First - I answered your question, no, I'd prefer them to sick to there promises mean I'd prefer it to be free because I they said it will be. Honestly my stand would be different if they never made such a promise and would pay for the DLC if they didn't.
---
Second - I didn't say anything about those things being needed to play the game. Like you I get along just find and don't own any of them. I said their behind a pay wall, you're counter if you really needed to counter it is that you can grind the atoms for the fridge and robot. Not making up claims I didn't say
---
Third - Those with the means are very unlikely to be funding the means to get free DLC. No, business doesn't work like that. The subscription is likely helping improve it. But hell Ubisoft has shown that you can sink a companies money to fix a live service which would in to improve the money they make.
---
I found a nice spot in the Mire that would've been perfect, but ghouls spawned in front of, and mole miners spawned behind the area.
---
Done that a couple times. Doesn't work.
---
Because youtube tells them to
---
This is sound logical reasoning. 
---
I‚Äôm not a F1st subscriber because $20(CAD) is way way over my allotted monthly; costs more than any other sub I have and the benefits are far too minimal imho. If the pricing were more in line, and the scrap box was free for everyone I‚Äôd subscribe in an instant.
---
I really hope you enjoy your time in Appalachia! I certainly did.
---
Agreed
---
Gotcha. Only just saw that you said this is an ATX item, I was thinking this‚Äôd be a quest reward and there‚Äôd be an in-game Raider equivalent. Should‚Äôve known better, all the good stuff costs extra money...
---
Ya I make most stuff in my CAMP cheap for new players since it‚Äôs on the edge of the Forest and I‚Äôve had other high level players clear it out.
---
Probably
---
Forget to log on to your sock puppet?

Having worked in the industry I can tell you that you may be right. I also believe that originally this was intended to release with wastelanders and possibly even earlier. You don‚Äôt release an online game across multiple platforms without planning on having a paid subscription service eventually from the start. A lot of people don‚Äôt like that and don‚Äôt want to believe it but it‚Äôs the way of the industry love it or hate it. You cant compare the practices of a major studio with niche PC only online titles from indie developers....It appears their formula was to have special throwback outfits each month and free little things along with atom bonuses for paid subscribers. We‚Äôve actually seen that before fallout 1st hit. Over the past several months there have been monthly atom bonus packages for sale (1,500 atoms for the price of 1,000) plus a unique throwback outfit with each one. About the same time this started we started getting little freebies in the atomic shop. I believe those outfits were originally intended to be part of the fallout 1st plan but the game wasn‚Äôt ready for it and they were holding off hoping to introduce fallout 1st with wastelanders. To help fund themselves we got the special atom bundles with those outfits and they gave out some free stuff. Wastelanders gets delayed and for reasons of either pressure or financial need they had to drop fallout 1st now adding the bonus features to it that they did to increase purchases. You‚Äôll notice that to my knowledge there has been no special atom purchase with an outfit this month as there has been in previous months now that Fallout 1st has dropped and is offering that.

Just have a read of this mate and try to keep up.

If we could make our server a survival mode server, or if we could even keep our friends out, would be nice. I think the reason most people think it's over priced is because other private servers have options.
---
I do!  Its what I wanted; Fallout with Friends.  And we make our own fun
---
When I ran a guild in wow just to rent a dedicated voice chat server was 7 bucks a month, to me fo1st is worth it.
---
I was sick of the PVP, toxic players, one shoters and the griefers as well as going to locations and finding entire buildings looted clean. The PVP on workshops was really starting to make me rage quit. If I had claimed a power plant then ok fair game but when I claim a small practicality useless workshop, get stealth killed and they don't even claim the workshop, that really pisses me off.
---
I will spend a few hours on public servers to vendor and check out people's camps but mostly stay on my own server with my team mates. 
---
The scrap box and tent are nice however I believe these along with the ranger outfit should have been atom shop items as well as being included with the private package. The extra atoms and emotes I believe were fair to be a private world exclusive. 
---
I'm on the fence about the outfits. Unique or exclusive outfits included yes but with the lore around the NV ranger outfit I don't think it should have been included in the package. Perhaps if they had offered a 76 lore friendly outfit or weapon skin (responder, fire breather, free states, Mothman, MOM, Mr Fuzzy etc) with the package then it may have been a slightly more positive reception.
---
Was it the same responder bot or the wandering one with the cool outfits?
---
I agree, if our camps break random spawns, they should break enemy spawns.
---
Really depends on the weapon. A handmade TSE can go for as much as 15k with the right buyer. Most others go for much, much less.
---
The plan has a 2% chance to appear in the inventory of vendors in the bog.
---
Not a clever thing to make the trade in front of other people, but I had people of sponge off others when it's obviously not meant for them. Most players are very kind in my experience. I accidently sold someone my bloodied SS deathclaw gauntlet by mistake a while back ( glitched; selection changed in the trade menu) and after I got on the mic panicking about it he gave it straight back.
---
Long ago I used level 1 of this perk and it worked ok. I later upgraded to the 2nd rank and it didn't work at all. It was identified as a bug and likely never fixed.
---
Oh damn. I wish I was on when you got off. I'm going to eat breakfast and hop on.  Can't wait.  It's a fun game.
---
Fairly frequently, mostly when dying at the end of events.
---
That communist power armor skin is awesome
---
Man, I didn‚Äôt even think of that. Camps *will* block *good* things from happening, haha...
---
use turrets 
---
my camp is on the golf field in whitesprings and i get hordes of zombies / robots and sometimes scorchbeasts show up 
---
my turrets only have issues with scorchbeasts as thats the only monster that can reach them lol
---
This looks oddly like a repost from several days ago
---
I would like to see a mid priced tier. Stash and tent, but no private world, no atoms. $3.99
---
Crashing on ps4 pro.
---
Maybe you don't know what you're talking about. What's the saying about better to be quiet and let people think you're a fool than to open it and prove you are.
---
All of those things are temporary and the minute you buy it, you‚Äôre over it lol
---
Ps4 pro, meanwhile my friend has a regular ps4 and hasnt crashed once.
---
Ya the other sub is full of new faces due to all of the negativity here. If there is one thing a vocal minority can do is ruin things for everyone else.
---
he had the same items I just sold to the trainstation one so I think it was the same
---
Thank God you people are finally leaving. Thanks for being just as toxic as Bethesda.  
---
Don‚Äôt let the door hit ya where the good Lord split ya.
---
They‚Äôre never going to take the right steps forward :/
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm familiar with Pete Hines later backpedaling, what of it? He implied during the reveal nothing but cosmetics, he later ‚Äòclarified‚Äô. It doesn‚Äôt matter what he ‚Äòmeant‚Äô what matters is what the customer base was led to believe when they purchased the game. 
---
I promise you if people knew then what they knew now FO76 preorders would‚Äôve been less than half of what they were. 
---
And regardless of how you spin it, private worlds are a competitive advantage because the characters aren‚Äôt unique to the players world. I can go capture all workshops, farm endlessly, do whatever uninhibited then use those resources to oppress the more casual public server players.
---
What the Bethesda boot lickers don‚Äôt understand is that in business customer perception is reality. It is irrelevant what he meant because what he made us believe whether willfully or by mistake was contrary to reality and their long term monetization goals.
---
I have this every time I do encrypted. I had it once recently in Mischief Night and I waited about 25 minutes doing other things, and it finally let me respawn and I was able to loot the legendary too.
---
Yep 0 is possible. I do it with any 'Delbert' recipes and I was doing it with my 38 ammo for  the low-level people tell some 140 lvl person came along and took it all once. Then I went to their camp and saw it in their vendor for sale for 1 cap. F that guy.  now I just carry it all on me and give it to peolple directly when I see them fresh out of the vault or in flatwoods and below level five.  (People above level 5 I give my 10mm ammo to)
---
I defend Bethesda when it comes to the bugs and shit. It happens. It's happened to all of their games. But I love Fallout 76. Don't get me wrong. But microtransactions on this game by this company is a step in the wrong direction. 
---
That's not what fallout is made for. Nor what the fans want. Some people of course don't care because they're blinded by the game. And to and extent I understand why people support it but this is new to Bethesda because of Zenimax. If  you guys support this it's only going to get worse. The bugs are manageable, a game where you have to pay for every feature is not. Don't support the micro-transactions is what I'm saying.
---
Yeah Fallout 1st is... well.. you know
---
That would give me zero incentive to subscribe to first.
---
There is a massive amount of communist themed stuff coming out, because that was obviously super requested and nobody wants BOS or Enclave themed items. I seriously question the item/sales strategy of the atomic shop.
---
Did someone say Nink Girl &amp; POP! figure? I‚Äôll be in my bunk...
---
"IT Is WhAT ThE commUniTy WanTS"
---
Yeah it happens almost all of the in mischief night
---
Yeah me too
---
Do you have a bar with 'spirits' written on it?
---
If you are already/still playing they probably dont care.
---
That's why I was asking if he puts it in his vendor. To me it seem counterintuitive or extremely charitable to free up that stash space with the scrap box then bulk a bunch of junk and put it back in your stash space just to give it away for free.
---
Oh yeah it's thriving isn't it. Fallout 76 gave you junk in spades. You just don't want to realise you wasted time and money on garbage. How many people do you think will buy another Fallout game after 76's cluster fuck of problems?. You and the 25 other people who still play can enjoy it while you can.
---
I‚Äôve been asking this for a while. Hopefully they will see one of our posts and add it.
---
You should be able to to take stuff from stash boxes if it was like Rust :) so it should be really hard to get in
---
I don‚Äôt want my camp to just be a floating platform with 10 turrets on it.
---
You can use your vending machines for trades, I dislike dropping because there is a real chance the game will crash.
---
Quad cannot drop on heavy weapons or black powder. However if you ask around, maybe you could find a Legacy heavy with Double
---
You just know if they're a noob.
---
I will admit I was very annoyed when I opened a ticket about he mischief night crashes, and they said to restart the game, reboot my console, and reinstall.  Umm ALOT of people are having the same issue lol.
---
And I work in IT, when you start getting a lot of people reporting the same issue, you don't just blow them off as a one time occurrence.
---
From a fan/player standpoint that would be great. From a business standpoint that would be a horrible marketing plan that wouldn‚Äôt meet costs and would kill the game.
---
Thank you very much! I kinda figured it would be something that wouldn‚Äôt be in the game such as the legacy energy weapons.
---
Normally if you just wait after mischief and it happens. You still get the rewards, they just dont display as normal. But they'll be in your inventory when you relog.
---
It can be a pain in the ass. Don't swing to far wide from the bouy.
---
If they want to retain and regain any semblance of a player base, they probably won't lock any more actual features behind a paywall. Cosmetics, sure but if they paywall wastelanders like locking quests and features behind first, this community will burn to the ground
---
Well you get atoms equal to the amount of the real money you pay I think. The thing is they should have given us just private servers - I mean real private servers, persist and with customisation possibilities to the max and nothing else. 100$ a year for that is absolutely fair. But they can‚Äôt manage to that and therefor just add stupid gadgets that splits the community. How blind can you be not to see this coming?
---
I'm level 290 and I've never seen a double heavy weapon, except in videos.
---
Have not tried that, would I use a junk extractor?
---
Sorry, it was Friday night and I was 4 (10% abv ipa) beers into my night and got a little fired up. I actually WAS toning it down some. (I'm a Cusser by nature) üò¨ My bad. My fire got lit and I was off to the races. Apologies .
---
Actually, I don't think their are a ton of people playing anymore. I think the facts kind of support that. I mean with players reporting that they're finding killed and looted mobs in their solo world indicates that they are recycling open world servers along with the monthly/yearly subscription means that they aren't making enough money on selling atoms.
---
I believe so.
---
Both Watoga vendors or only station one?
---
Maybe when Wastelanders releases we‚Äôll be able to send settlers to our camp to help defend it and tend crops.
---
I bought a month to check out private servers, the stability and farming potential is amazing, so I‚Äôll probably sub for longer. At this point I only go to public for vending and events.
---
Yep, it said it failed but I had the rewards.
---
They look like garbage and break what little immersion this game allows.
---
you're lucky. Half the time my character is missing her head.
---
You easily can stop them- you just block for session
---
Does it work for explosions also? It would be nice to reallocate my fireproof points.
---
That sums up about half of my play session last night.
---
Why listen to Pete Hines? He's always been a marketing blowhard
---
If I saw this on Yongyea it would make it all worth it
---
Get over it. 99 percent of the time you're not looking at your characters face and seriously a mark on the lip just gives your character....character.
---
Ah yes, the classic vocal minority must be the majority fallacy. I saw that in the Halo Community once, then 343I made a decision using in game data that directly contradicted them, it was a fun night of bans for sure.
---
Great now they have a new thing to add to private servers to make us buy their shitty subscriptions
---
Herpes doesn‚Äôt give my character, character. It just gives him herpes.
---
TL:DR; I may purchase FO1st when there's enough new content to enjoy private servers. Give me a lot of new content and I'll give you a new subscriber.
---
I will be (probably) buying Fallout 1st for private servers a few months after Wastelanders drops. 
---
Why wait a few months? Well tbh bugs. I'll wait for the bugs to be ironed out. Also I want to make sure there is enough content to justify the cost for private servers. I may even end up waiting until the next dlc after WL IDK right now. 
---
Currently when I feel like playing I'm just doing my daily stuff (caps,scrip) I mean I haven't even felt like picking up a controller to enter the wasteland in the past 2 days. There's just nothing to do I have all my end game gear. The new event is fun but I'm not waiting an hour between events. It's too long of a cool down. Should be 30 minutes then I'd play a lot.
---
So, I'll be working on my backlog of games then I'll return to 76 full time. Until then I'll be working on finishing BL3 great game playing it now.
---
Then off to Doom, and all the Wolfenstien games which I have purchased but not put any time into. They're all sitting either unopened or waiting for me to download because I got them really cheap and couldn't pass them up.
---
If you‚Äôve hated every fallout what made you give this one a chance? Lol
---
I am a huge fan of the series in general and each game has been an improvement in my opinion. This iteration allows fans of the fallout series to enjoy the game together. The great thing about 76 is that there is no "end" to the game and it could be infinitely re-playable if Bethesda keeps cranking out expansions and content. Hopefully fallout 1st helps with that, we'll see I guess.
---
idk man, i think whatever you got out of the game is all youre gonna get atm. cant imagine these guys have the funds to start creating content. I dont even think wastelanders is gonna be the massive content people were hyping it up to be.   
---
i liked the game, was my first fall out game. was really cool and spooky. but its pretty easy to tell from the state of the game ( and apparently this is the best its ever been)  that htey just dont have the funding or are limited by the game engine or just something.
---
That‚Äôs weird and potentially handy. I wonder if it was duplicated or if the station was empty.
---
Good question. Every fallout game that has released I‚Äôve tried so I thought I would try this one as well with very low expectations and I was instantly hooked.
---
So, I wouldn't use AUS as an example personally. I would agree that international pricing is fucked. However, ANY time I see pricing in AUS it's always fucked. Like a 1st world 3rd world country or something.
---
private servers, my wife and I are starting some new character builds  and wanted to go through the whole time line again with no interruption or people interfering
---
Really huh was pretty sure they dindt
---
I seen the double mini cryo, gat gun, LMG, and flamer. At least for sale. Got a double 50 myself.
---
They're not already? Ubisoft doesn't exactly have the highest reputation you know.
---
One doing it before doesn't make it any better.
---
subs got content, so they come here instead
---
Can you blame them for not being able to take their eyes off this train wreck? Plus who said they can‚Äôt still love fallout ?
---
Do you sit in your parents basement with a piss jug and a thesaurus?. If anybodys the minority here it's people like you. The game is universally panned. Empty your piss jugs, stroke your neck beard, pour some Mountain Dew, grab your anime body pillow and sit and think about how bad this game is.
---
Good to know going to buy one month of FO1st when waste landers is released
---
guy made a little event out of quitting. i thought it was funny
---
If you're on pc, I can craft you one. I believe I got plans for every armor type.
---
Thanks man found a server where it had been cleared and slowly got closer till it ticked it off
---
Yup, I do it all the time to one person haha
---
He‚Äôs implying that you‚Äôre being paid to promote the game. Just ignore it; not worth the trouble.
---
I got the vault door one yes
---
Thanks. I appreciate you saying that.
---
Seems like you like open world adventure games more than role playing games. Do you play R* games and such?
---
Thanks man glad you‚Äôre enjoying the game
---
blame google and all them. they steal all the good devs. only ones left are these damn devry graduates who havent played a game since Sega, and barely at that.
---
Just a quad levergat over here
---
Well, TOW works, which is a good start.
---
Sad that game companies feel quality and morals can be increasingly sacrificed.  I think we will see a growth in popularity and support for studios that put gamers first.  Fcuk EA, Bethesda and Activision.  Going forward they will not get a single cent from me.  I hope other gamers will follow suit, plenty of other studios creating good games.
---
No way :o
---
Wanna know something weirder than me hating previous fallout games? Red dead and GTA online bored me super fast.... lol. But I‚Äôve literally put in thousands of hours into world of Warcraft. I‚Äôm strange when it comes to games. I‚Äôm playing BL3 at the moment besides 76 but even BL3 is starting to become boring to me.
---
Thanks for the head up, I was gonna waste my time, unfortunately they may charge for a future fixer skin
---
I'm sorry, I realise that there are alot of fallout and bethesda fans. We all grew up with these amazing stories/games, But there is 0 excuse for fallout first. This is mobile games level of monetization. They've created a problem, and now they're trying to sell the solution. Offering, "Private World", was what made so many people angry. This is a fallout game, not Rust, or any of the other 100 survival games that fallout 76 tried to emulate. 
---
This isn't about them not having money, they have so much of it they could probably drown in it. This is about them continually over and over and over again trying to implement some kind of monetization to fallout 4, for the last 5 years and failing hardcore. Every time they tried to implement some kind of monetization to that game they were told to screw themselves and back away from it. THATS where this started at, and that's why they released fallout 76 like this. Now that it's to little to late, the publisher wants to add more monetization to prove it can make money to authorize more work. This is a desperate tactic to try and save the game from being canned from the publisher. Let it be canned, maybe they'll learn a lesson from it, maybe they won't, but at the very least we'll probably finally get some consequences for extremely greedy practices.
---
Oh boy, now who is the salty one? I could kill a Supermutant with all that salt. I'm going to take it the implication of being a minority in the Fallout community is highly, highly, triggering. Also, it sounds like it's time for Bethesda to launch another free play week. That was a fun week to read these forums. Players giving 76 a try, immediately saying that they were lead astray by the crusaders. The crusaders getting triggered and trying to downvote, only to get outnumbered. Courtesy of being both the minority and not having anything notable enough to draw in the supporting Trolls and Dingi population following on their coat trails. Kind of like what happened here within a week when the Trolls got bored with the '1st scandal'
---
It's a great mission.  I came so close to soloing a couple times but just a bit too slow.  :(
---
Is this the equivalent of saying your gonna commit suicide to get attention? I am with you on stability issues. I have even looked around at other games and found nothing to exciting. I still enjoy this game. If your leaving I understand and please give away all your stuff,thank you. For the paywall unhappy broke ass people get a job or go play fortnite I will piss on your grave while wearing my samurai helmet and my forest uniform.
---
I might join next year psn plus ran out this year
---
It's a glitch. Bethesda will patch it out.
---
was a pretty cool game. still is. my first and only fall out game too.  
---
but having said all that, once you sink some hours in the world suddenly seems really small unfortunately. It's also easy to tell that there wont be much new added to it. Either way i think i got my sixty dollars worth. It's a shame  though because i would gladly pay a monthly fee for this game if i knew they had competent developers. These guys cant even give their players decent stairs, man. People have stayed through the worst part of this game for thousands of hours and i read all they wanted was some decent fucking stairs!   
---
just cant give folks like that my pesos.
---
It's supposed to be a Responders-style MASH unit, but I haven't gotten it all done right. Display cases to show off medical gear, since you can't place on shelves, is the start, but I really hope that we can get some Responder-themed stuff at some point. I need little faction signs and displays like Raider or Free States people get.
---
One step at a time, you know?
---
Good to know it drops. It is funny, I want what would be considered the common drop, and yet instead I get stuff like four fireman uniforms, three pirate costumes and the hat.
---
That's nice
---
I build out in the water now, and every once in a while I'll end up getting attacked by a mutant or whatever that will spawn underwater and be able to attack anyway.
---
Nice
---
T-51b has the best total ballistic resistance out of all the armors, but lower rad resist than the Ultracite, X-01 and T-60. So if you're looking for pure ballistic resistance, go for T-51
---
Nuke lip is forever.
---
If I can get 100+ hours out of a game, it‚Äôs definitely worth $60 to me. That‚Äôs my rule.
---
Logic fail on your part I think:
---
No because he/she did it.
---
I'm sorry
---
You don‚Äôt get Karma by not writing a heartfelt ‚ÄúI quit‚Äù rant. 
---
Or hell, demonstrating that you aren‚Äôt going to play the game anymore... by playing the game more to ‚Äúboard up‚Äù your shop that doesn‚Äôt even exist if you aren‚Äôt in a server.
---
It should be a first perk.
---
&gt;(its the only way to get 100% ers less than 100% cores cause ammo load problems etc.)
---
lol this fucking game. all the bugs almost make it seem more realistic. these fucking weapons that look like they were made in a garage would have these problems.
---
I haven't gotten the empty pumpkin rack yet, but multiple of everything else
---
Tbh if a game changed your life that‚Äôs pretty sad. If it‚Äôs the people you met while playing the game, that‚Äôs another story but the game itself?
---
What drop is it? I haven't got the Hat yet
---
I‚Äôve met low levels in game and invited them to my private servers to help them. I‚Äôve found it easier to help them level, get materials, weapons, armor, etc. Me and all my friends are at the point where all we have to do is help be players, raids, NW and new events.
---
Truly enigmatic XD guess you just enjoy leveling and collecting gear!
---
"I'm a hoarder" - THIS.  I save stuff in the event that a friend needs something built or repaired.
---
76 just has something unique. Just playing a fallout game with friends is just very pleasant.
---
No, that was just the exchange rate, not how much it costs here with everything else on top, the pricing you are looking at in my example is worth the same amount, (1USD = 1.45AUD as of this second), just a different number that allows you to see how fucked it actually is.
---
Yeah. Shit doesn‚Äôt crash because you opened a menu. That‚Äôs a plus.
---
I uninstalled 76 just to make space for Outer Worlds...  
---
Ironic, huh?
---
It's original seriously it's great. There's way too many similair themed camps out there.
---
Or just given up on it, milking it for what it‚Äôs worth, and moving on to the next project
---
I deleted it a few minutes after walking into my room with my copy of Outer Worlds. I might return for Wastelanders, but I doubt that this game is redeemable at this point.
---
I didn‚Äôt bother announcing shit. I was busy when the big announcements came. And I just... never bothered logging in again.
---
&gt;if you're defending their policies, you're an idiot because you're actively supporting something that is not beneficial to you
---
Finally gamers are starting to grow spines.

I‚Äôm still waiting eagerly for Starfield. I suspect they‚Äôre waiting on the next console gen in late 2020.
---
If you're on PS4 I have a vault door plan you can have. 
---
I'm wondering how so many people got the Pant suit. I keep getting the Short suit and those socks are the worst. ü§£
---
That being said, if anyone on PS4 has the Pant Suit for sale/trade I have MN plans and some caps üòÉ
---
Camp in the forest region and use rocket turrets. I have my camp near Bolton Green and my base is built like a military base with all sides covered. My camp launches rockets all over that house. It's beautiful and full of explosions.
---
not only is it already in the files, it's already in the game world itself in the area where you do the Excavator PA quest, the PA display station which was already in Fallout 4

Why they didn't release it yet just showed how few thoughts they put into the display case system itself (also the dozens of unused 'display cases' that we currently have in the build menu)
---
for sure, man. was a great experience. im just glad i came in at the time i did. im the loud socially guy that most folks want to avoid on a game like this since people like to be loners it seems. but the few i talked to told me some fucking stories about this game mannnn.  
---
Apparently, you couldnt see peoples houses on the map, or teleport. you had to walk around and just hope to run into them. so the game just felt like a single player game most of the time. my favorite thing to do is to go to peoples houses and talk to them (try) about their builds. cant imagine this game without it.
---
I have seen people come back because no other game satisfies. I did a week on rdr2 and was right back. If there was a similar open world game, I would go. The new event dashboards me 8 of 10.. I understand on stability alone without the koombaya politics or class structure
---
That is ridiculously over dramatic.
---
Bethesda don't deserve it though.
---
It's very easy to forget the sins of the past and write them off in some romantic notion of a struggling company trying to do their best. They've made numerous terrible and tone deaf decisions since those times, quite a few of which are explicitly anti-consumer and in bad faith. I'm not even just talking about the game itself but also all the tie-in issues like the bait-and-switch canvas bag or the very misleading Nuka Rum bottles.
---
All Bethesda had to do was listen to their community and put in the time and resources to do things right from the first time and people would have thrown as much money as they could afford (and maybe then some).
---
Bethesda instead chose to rush out an unfinished and buggy product by a studio that was severely lacking the experience and expertise in managing such a game, (outside of microtransactions) and then brake several promises to us to nickel and dime us all the while putting in as minimal effort as possible.
---
For god's sake, they're selling us back our own ideas we've given Bethesda to help improve the fundamental issues with their core game!
---
Had they spent a little extra time before launch and afterwards testing new content and bug fixes, they would be in a much better position than they are now. No time, money and reputation wasted on constantly recurring bugs that have to be fixed multiple times. Think of how much time and money that had cost compared to doing it right the first time?
---
Come on dude. Hold higher standards for yourself and for the company. Bethesda is reaping what they sowed for many years now. They deserve this.
---
It's not up to us to keep throwing good money after bad to keep Bethesda afloat (if that is even remotely true). It's on Bethesda to do right by us, follow through with any promises they've made and show us that they're worthy for us to spend our hard-earned money on.
---
It's a story driven RPG with dialogue and choices that matter, and at least personally it scratches an itch that only games like KOTOR or MAss Effect can do.
---
It's not a game I'll dump 500 hours into like F04 or Morrowind, but much like KOTOR and ME I can see it being something that I "pull off the shelf" and play through again in a year or so.
---
I'm just going to copy it for free.
---
There's been alot of people thirsty for a good old fashioned single player rpg which leans into player choice and agency. It doesn't need to be SUPER MASSIVE AAA HYPER AWESOME BEST GAME IN THE UNIVERSE EXPLOSIONS FIREWORKS OMGTHISCRAZY!!!11!!1
---
Some people just want a good story with interesting characters and nice writing. It's ok if you're not into it, it's not for everyone. It's just tailored to a certain crowd that has been thirsty for a decent true rpg like they used to get fairly often but haven't seen in awhile from sources that used to provide it...
---
Different strokes for different folks and all...
---
I'll stop rambling now lol.
---
I concur. Its seriously got some major hype around it. Its mechanics seem dated an not super well planned. You get stuck in companions cut screen forever if you take any CD perks. The weapons are mediocre. Even the science weapons were whatever. The games incredibly easy even on Super Nova. The story was decent but I was kinda bored at times. An I seriously love Scfi stuff but it just feels flat IMO. The only thing I can truly say I enjoyed in my 2 play through were the graphics an some of the different reactions characters have when saying different things.
---
From what I understand from dataminers, the Empty Pumpkin Rack is simply unavailable.  It's not linked to the loot list for Mischief Night or anything else. 
---
The Vault door pumpkin definitely is, however.
---
Extra pant suit? ü§ûüèª
---
It's actually just a company of liars; it's ingrained in their culture.
---
Hey, I'm not trying to be a naysayer or dissing you, just trying to get to the bottom of this. I'm on xbox1 too, and haven't had a single crash. Done the event over a dozen times. Some lag spots here and there, but no crash. What's your internet connection like? Does it crash during certain times? I noticed the dropped frames get real bad when everyone flames the legendary sentry bot. Rather than trying to power through I pause for a bit. Also, are you third or first person? I notice was less lag in first person.
---
But why lock anything behind a paywall in the first place!?! Everything was supposed to be free/available to all from the start.....
---
Fallout isn't their only game title in the works though. They have multiple titles and expansions going on as we speak. People need to STOP thinking this is their only game title. They treat this community like an atm. I don't see them doing the same to Rage,Doom or Wolfenstein or any other title. They have a great opportunity and decided to sell this title short and quick.
---

---
The official description of the event stated that Fasnacht masks counted as costumes.
---
Assigning some kind of headgear and taking it off usually fixes that, if you care to fix it.
---
Oh sure it does, even in the wasteland ;)
---
Double exploding gatling laser and plasma are available on ps4
---
yeah having a vendor follow you so you can instantly sell your junk or other stuff sounds handy but also broken
---
Incoming ‚Äúemergency‚Äù patch in 3...2...1...
---
I think I've run into something like this, except not as extreme.  My main had some kind of pock mark on her lower jaw and I could never figure out where it was coming from.  It wasn't from Extras or anything under that.
---
They‚Äôve followed the ESO model. Scrap box is the craft bag. Monthly in game currency stipend. You can buy a banker and merchant that appear at your command in ESO. Honestly, I expected them to do this from the release date.
---
Having played ESO for years I find the complaints here cute. I can log into ESO and see someone who pays $15 a month ride by on their $40 mount on their way to their $100 villa or cavern. I was in a housing guild for a while where people spent huge amounts on furnishings with both in game and real world money.
---
My main complaints with FO76 remains: they need to fix their damn tool chain.
---
Don't forget to deface the walls during the cottage phase
---
It's a known bug that has to do with dying around the same time the event ends.  It's kind of like the Event Complete UI messes with the death UI and blocks input.
---
Only if you are notified that your camp is under attack.
---
AND IT'S EXPLOSIVE?!
---
Dude, cherish that for forever. Never let it go. Like ever. Seriously.
---
I was really hoping the mounted skeleton holding the cauldron, happy halloween banner, and wooden coffin plans would be rewards as well. My camp needs coffins!
---
I didn‚Äôt even equip anything either like all I did was go into the menus for blemishes to see what it looks like and without even equipping them, the game just did that to my face lol Glad to know I‚Äôm not the only one to experience something similar, but also sad to hear that I‚Äôm not the only one to experience something similar
---
A recycled server however you don't get to keep the workshops when you disconnect. You have to do that all over again when you log in again.
---
That's sort of what they did though. Outside of big ticket things like Power Armor skins, the 1,650 allotment is enough to buy most of what we've seen posted each month, and you get to keep it if you unsub down the line.  I don't know how a carte blanche everything-in-the-store approach would work with that.
---
Can confirm vault door plan drops.  I heard rate is low, but it‚Äôs all RNG.  I haven‚Äôt seen one alien plan, yet many are selling/trading.
---
Well, the Harpoon gun is heavy and can drop with Quad. I think that's the only one tho, would love a Quad/explosive LMG tho...
---
Consoles often last until the next gen is released. Right now, the 2013 edition Xbox One can run Scorched Earth AND Mischief Night (even with a good 10 players) at 60 FPS. Only upon death does it crash for me. 
---
Now let‚Äôs get to the price. If you bought every next-gen console since the year 2000, you would have paid a total of $1200. Let‚Äôs say you buy a PC for the same amount that same year. If my $900 PC from 2008 can‚Äôt run Sims 4 in more than 15 FPS, I doubt a $1200 one from 2000 could run Scorched Earth or Mischief Night in 60 FPS. 
---
So no, consoles are not super expensive things that are obsolete in a year or 2. The 2013 Xbox One just got a software update last week. Can you say the same for Windows 8?
---
Oh yeah you're right, that is a heavy. Probably each gun was looked at
---
Both
---
I actually put design effort into my camps.
---
I hate to beat you while you are down... but this sort of behavior: buying expensive preorder and "blindly"  defending a game to the upmost from an early stage are part of the things that have led to this fiasco. Despite all the fiascos and frustation "numbers" show they make money and peoplestill defend them and play the games... so why would they stop doing it.
---
This year has shaped to be an infamous one.
---
* Anthem... that already died after all this shitstorm and despite all this is still a best selling game.
---
* FO76 that keeps digging its grave deeper and deeper... and also dropping the last bits of a semblance of reputation bethesda had.
---
* And then that ghost recon shitpoint that aparently finally shaked ubisoft from their open world stupor a little bit.
---
Yetbi am still skeptical that anything will really change in general...
---
Tldr: sorry for text wall, i just started typing. Shit is fucked in here and we are to be blamed.
---
I recently moved to the Forest because I found my Savage Divide CAMP besieged by triple Scorchbeasts and a Legendary Scorchbeast.  Nothing like that had ever happened in the months I've been there.
---
You still get dinged from the random spawns in the Forest, but at least they can be managed by the turrets.  The problem with higher-level areas is that the turrets are woefully inadequate for dealing with any Lv. 50+ enemy.
---
This whole mechanic needs to be redone, imo.  At the very least, turrets need to have a reliable symmetry with the things they attack.  No more hiding just beyond their range and taking pot shots all day.  No more ignoring enemies until they are right in front of the turret.
---
Definitely no pay to win going on here, move along.
---
It was when the event has barely started. I had 60FPS with no lag spikes, but upon death, it just crashed.
---
I have some money to spent sure, but I have to think and count what to use it for. For example: do I spent it on stuff that my kid wants or what I want? I already spent too much to stuff what I want. 
---
and my bank account is always 0 about a week before a payday.
---
Ps. I am on a disability pension.
---
I once stated my opinion about the game and asked others to share their opinion and all of us got downvoted into Oblivion.
---
The Dragon is a 4 barrel black powder
---
All good mate, I understand.
---
But it only gets one shot
---
Absolutely. I have to gauge and test new players before I give them stuff ever since I had a low level try to get enemies to kill me for loot that only a higher level would know how to do. Last time I helped a lower level I built up their camp, gave them like 30 plans and recipes plus built them their own custom rifle. Feels good to do that for a legit new player.
---
I got it by going to the map and using photo mode, not the camera
---
You don‚Äôt take the photos with the prosnap. Use photo mode.
---
Placing your camp near unmarked locations isn't safe, anyway. Someday they may change something in the area, which will make you move your camp.
---
There's no hope for people like you lmao Bethesda could tell you they're releasing a patch to fix all bugs tomorrow but it's gonna cost you another $50 and you'd pay it no questions asked
---
This is a known bug. Don't approach that buoy from the right, approach it from the left.
---
Yeah it doesn't make any sense to me, either.
---
They get a solid hand shake from Todd Howard himself, and a wink from Pete Hines
---
Bethesda‚Äôs choice!
---
Yes exactly why I was wondering if steam even had a right to re sell that could be passed on to the customer. They cant give a right which they don‚Äôt have.
---
Seeing as two of those were public worlds..
---
I go on every other time or so. The rewards aren't THAT great.
---
Lol the interview he is quoting took place before FO76 launched so the information was out there before hand. 
---
Extra servers cost money, fact of life. You don‚Äôt need a private server to play or complete this game, and they are of no advantage to completing the game or it‚Äôs events. 
---
‚Äúoppress the more casual public server players.‚Äù
---
LMAO oppress them with what, their bulk aluminium? You‚Äôre bending the reality to try and fit your narrative but you just come off as sensationalist. It Doesn‚Äôt matter how much anyone farms they can‚Äôt stop anyone else from playing the game, it‚Äôs events, main quest line etc... that‚Äôs a weak argument mate but I got a good laugh from it lol
---
Again your last paragraph is based on rejecting the facts as presented in the link I left for you. But you are correct customer perception is important to business and wether you like to admit it or not, people enjoy this game and want more content, and the reality that people continue to over look here is that that content needs to be paid for in some way, in fallout 4 you paid for it by buying DLC now you pay for it with micro transactions, a method that was clearly expressed before launch to facilitate free DLC.
---
I bought Fallout 1st for the atoms. I looked at it this way and did some math. If you buy the year long variant of the membership you get give or take $198 of atoms and that‚Äôs not even adding to the scrap box, the tent and the private servers. Plus all the freebies we will get every month along with the membership. Now am I happy that‚Äôs it‚Äôs expensive. No but I understand. I feel like everyone should‚Äôve gotten the scrap box because junk is heavy. Now the only real reason I bought the year long member ship is because I know I‚Äôm going to get my money back. I‚Äôve put almost 1,000 hours into this game and I know I‚Äôm just gonna our 1,000 more in. But anyways I feel like this membership whether it be a month or a year membership is a good deal
---
I‚Äôm sorry you can‚Äôt afford cake.
---
Well, it's *Austin's* only game title.
---
And the latest pair of Wolfenstein games had some goofy MTX mechanics too, iirc.
---
I have vault door I think
---
I agree with you. I was telling someone that the other day, how I miss having to rush back to my Camp to defend it. You remember those days? We had fun. I mean I'm still having fun. But I do miss that sense of fear also.
---
Same here, deleted last week started playing NMS instead.
---
I just want balance, and from what you were describing was too much the other way is all IMO.
---
Thank you for discussing this civilly and I wish you a good day and happy gaming!
---
Yeah. Conversion is fucked. I'm well aware.
---
Then you're just easily amused and have little to no standards. Congrats, I guess?
---
I definitely want more music. Four Freshman, please! Also a DJ. I was thinking a Mr. Gutsy, and he tells you when nukes are about to fly or what event is going to pop up next. Otherwise he insults you for being unpatriotic Lily livered pansies for not killing commies like a real American.
---
Look at their Profile, unless it's a new account, experienced players with new characters will have a lot of completed achievements.
---
Which one is the alien plan? What does it look like?
---
If you're kind to fo1st subs we like to invite people sometimes to bring with us to our servers for these events to share the extra rewards.
---
No need to be nasty. I don‚Äôt get why so many people on reddit are like this.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox too and I‚Äôve been avoiding killing or shooting at the white springs security force. I‚Äôll only kill the ghouls and shoot at the legendary sentry bot at the end a few times then I‚Äôll back away so he doesn‚Äôt aggro me specifically. I‚Äôm a bloodied build so the sentry bot takes me out in about two seconds
---
But you want people to do the work and say they "should" be giving stuff out free to others. That makes no fucking sense.
---
I feel like you just chose the wrong mouth. Choose a 1 or a 2. Those don't usually have wrinkles.
---
Careful, the snowflake will downvote you because they cant handle other peoples opinions.
---
The lips were smooth and nice until I opened the extras tabs, and even on my new character face, when I enter the extras tabs, it will attempt to give my character that Nuclear Lip.
---
Community workaround? How about you do the work and get your own junk like the rest of us. And no, we "shouldn't" have free scrap in our vendors for people.
---
People usually carry about 10 to 15% of their junk on their character(before scrap boxes). We all know the risk of dying. I've had my loot stolen. You have had yours. It's just part of the game. Now if Bethesda gave a damn about the community it would have been standard to guard the bag so the person can get their stuff back
---
The greatest mod team on Reddit strikes again, what a useless fucking sticky
---
Except literally none of that happens. You‚Äôre super cringe as well. Imagine thinking the forums that are going to be moderated by Bethesda is going to be a great place for user reviews. Delusional as hell my dude. Also not reading any of your cringe shit so either don‚Äôt respond or just delete the game like a good girl.
---
Yall are some real bitches
---
It makes people feel good that others agree. Reddit/YouTube feedback loops are what people seek instead of finding their own means of having fun.
---
I really doubt that. Ran the event more than 20 times and didn't crash once. Likely they have their settings set way too high
---
Yup, it's a known glitch that's been around for a loong time
---
Harpoon gun does like 20% repairs. It works wonders for some weapons
---
Where do I go to see them? I don't see any on your profile, or a link anywhere...
---
What I'm saying is, go to the normal face editor, change the mouth. Be sure to apply the changes before exiting the edit. Also the neck is wrinkled. Try the smooth or slight rash neck.
---
Bad troll
---
Happy to see you having a ball in 76 like the rest of us, and good on you for finding a ray of light in Fallout 1st. I will say though, and feel free to chime in, but personally, I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve had a bad experience with anyone on the map. I understand that there are a few rotten eggs in the dozen, but it‚Äôs just such a big map, I feel for like for someone to be trying to troll you, they‚Äôd have to be targeting you from the start, yanno? But that‚Äôs just my experience
---
I can do it for you on xbox
---
https://m.imgur.com/a/mo4rABU
---
And theres that firster superiority complex.
---
Your title says you purchased something by accident though?
---
Oof
---
Yep
---
Yeh
---
Seems like a great deal to me, I purchased the full year on one account and the monthly on another.
---
I get a lot of hours of entertainment from the game, and that combined with the Atoms and other items makes this deal seem phenomenal to me, the Atoms alone are a great value, and private servers are a breath of fresh air.
---
It would not bother me at all if the Tent &amp; Scrap box were added to the Atom Shop for all to get, but I like the Idea of the Ranger Outfit being an exclusive FO1st Item.
---
I hate to admit this, but due to the crashing I've become a leech at this event. I have stopped doing anything to help move it forward, I just go to the end and wait for everyone else to do it. I'll take a few shots at the legendary at the end then back off.
---
It seems if I do anything, kill a ghoul, fork the lawn, light a fire, grab candy, it doesn't matter. All of it causes me to crash, and I'm not going to help progress and not get rewards because I crash, so I just stand there. 
---
I've even had it crash just from me jumping in the air. Get it together Bethesda!
---
Yes i have that one. Just missing vault tec
---
You people crack me up " I got rid of all my stuff! I'm quitting! " and then start playing on a different character, just because you want to jump on the bandwagon. " I haven't played since first week, but this game sucks!" Grow up.
---
Then don't and enjoy the game üëç
---
Assaultron are not that big of a deal. Melee can almost one shot them, shotgunners and heavy can criple their legs. People freaks out when their hear them charging their laser
---
No one cares
---
I have 200Mbps business class internet at home. It's 100% not my internet.
---
Bye felicia!
---
After running this perk at Rank 3 for months I noticed it was rarely ever triggering and when it did there was no visible difference with my weapons condition.
---
Now I‚Äôm running with Rank 1 of the perk and it triggers very often, but still there is no visible difference in the weapon condition across a variety of weapons. 
---
This perk has either bamboozled us or it works in such small amounts as to be useless. It seems like Rank 2 of the perk does absolutely nothing and Rank 3 of the perk frequently stops triggering until it‚Äôs unequipped and then reequipped.
---
I did the same but the opposite side of armor. I named my armors 01-07 and then what piece, for example a Right Leg or RL, so that way I know all my armor is at the top and incase I'm looking to replace A piece I know which is which
---
It never gets better after you leave. You just laugh that you don‚Äôt have to deal with it anymore if you keep lurking.
---
Finally someone with some manners and intelligence. For some reason I keep running into the bad eggs, I don't know why, guess my luck is really low lol. I've met a few good people, but all they did was a mooch and ask for stuff instead of actually working for it themselves and it was very annoying because I have to take care of myself in my property I don't have time or resources to help you. Thanks for being a decent human being
---
So many people ''stopped" playing, but stil go on pages like this on to complain complain and bash the game... 
---
Believe it or not there are stil plenty of people playing the game and enjoying the community.
---
And there are the peoples who havent even played the game but come here to bitch about the game...
---
I know i prob wel get some hate for this but hey IDGAF
---
üòÄüòÅ
---
So was country roads still costs a hell of a lot
---
Honestly, the infinite scrap box...
---
I haven't lost anything. Seems fine now. And as said above, it was patched pretty quick. Time will tell if it was patched effectively. But so far, so good.
---
Find anything else just hiding away?
---
Its easy come out with the stuff non requested and hope people buy it then release the good stuff and hope they buy some more
---
Really
---
Your consumer behaviour ruins the industry for everyone else, I'd say it is fair game people have some fun with you.
---
Sadly, they still bought the game which makes it a bit hypocritical.
---
I agree that a power armor display would be good to have. 
---
What I don‚Äôt get is your ‚Äòbig brokes‚Äô comment, as PA isn‚Äôt exactly the most expensive thing to own.
---
That doesn't sound like firm data
---
You forgot: 
---
**Phase 3.5 -- Don't be a dick and one-shot the Legendary** . Get a tag in on it and let the other players get a chance at legendary loot too.
---
I don't know how you i would even try to make money now. I'm in florida so no snow to shovel. I'm virtual school so i can't advertise anything. O have a comic business but people say that they're good cause they're bad. So not a cent is made. Let alone getting money to get a car. I'm scared to death to drive. But I totally agree with you. If you can't buy it then save up. The only time i don't agree with that is if it's one of those poorly made mobile games that are usually free and just spam you with ads but instead of being free it costs ten dollars and still spam you with ads.
---
What a great way to say good bye üò¢
---
What exactly are you winning?
---
Yep. TOW is lacking in EVERY area except for writing. The game is worse successor to FNV than Diablo 3 was to Diablo 2. It just shows that FNV was great thanks also to Bethesda (engine, assets, mechanics), not just because of Obsidian...
---
Ultracite or vault94 pa
---
whatever the fallout version of fashonframe is i guess.  only thing i can guess
---
Remember when Todd said during development "it doesn't always just work"
---
Kinda ment that the 'big brokes' are people who don't own PA or like a specific one like X-01 or ultracite
---
It‚Äôs no problem man, I have tons of fun playing too, and I feel that. Only 1 time ever has anyone ever came for me, he kept saying ‚Äúshoot me, come on shoot me, f*ck Bethesda, f*ck Fallout!‚Äù, and to that I made my character in my power armor literally just stroll, like I was walking so slow lol I‚Äôd stop every now and again and just stare at him, but I could tell he was mad cuz he was wasting his time lol And tbh, I have more supplies than I have reason to own, so normally whenever someone asks me for stuff, I see it as the one time I‚Äôm gonna interact with another online player, so I just let them have it. The last guy asked me for screws because he was so excited to get his laser shotgun more powerful, he was telling me about how cool it was and even showed it to me, and that experience and those like it warm my heart. Makes me feel like I‚Äôm playing a game that isn‚Äôt just about killing each other, we can all be friends in this Wasteland.
---
im not that high enough level tho
---
;-)
---
Trolls everywhere
---
I heard that wearing the pirate outfit will mesmerize your enemies and they will gently lay down their weapons.
---
I might be interested in trading a pant suit for a short suit. ü§î I kinda want to wait a bit tho, to see if I can win one.
---
*right in the feels* *that day this Reddit user's heart grew three sizes* well.....shit. that's really something man. You're definitely welcome in my server any day. Maybe I'll give that a try, just ignore the trolls and find one of those nice gamers like you did. I do however enjoy my solitary gameplay but will consider social servers again.
---
Uninstall. If it makes you feel any better, plenty of other people wasted $60 or more on this.
---
Yep got now thanks  for the help !
---
Possibly but the game does lag and crash on its own. I think it's just all the explosions are too much for the game to handle with everyone there. Considering it is a fun event and a lot of people use TSE gun too.
---
I've been in since beta too, but the thing is, it's not a year old game that is getting new content for free--it's a game that was sold a year ago, that's almost, but not quite, ready for primetime today.
---
I sort by weight. That seems to fix it.
---
Cool- keep it in mind! Ima keep tryin for dem pants too!
---
I‚Äôm happy to hear that I‚Äôm not the only one who‚Äôs heart grew a couple sizes after that experience, and thanks man, one of these days I‚Äôm totally down to join if you‚Äôre on PS4! I love my solitary gameplay as well, which is perfect for me because my friends don‚Äôt play 76 so it gives me the perfect opportunity to go solo every time, but I gotta say, aside from thinking about making a post for that person to maybe see if they use reddit, I look forward to more encounters such as those.
---
Steve Rogers - "I got that!"
---
I am a solo player and just the convenience of not fast travelling somewhere to restock and find it empty is by far worth it. Also this subscription is basically same as ESO. I only have 1 character so I don‚Äôt know if the unlimited storage works for all characters but if it does it finally fixed a major issue of transferring between characters
---
fair enough, then i suggest you try and place your turrets on tactical places within your camp
---
You've been the only person to comment something positive. Good luck to you man, I hope you become as powerful as Frank horrigan with lots of wealth. Finally someone with some human decency. Good to see you enjoy it as much as I do
---
I'm in your boat, I fly solo so this would be ideal.
---
I use reddit or a courier service from Facebook.  I'd prefer just being able to transfer stuff myself.
---
I had read there is a 15 minute window, but I don't know if that's true for private servers.  Yesterday I just joined a psn friend in a public, stashed my shit quick in a box and switched charecters, hoping my friend would still be on that world so I could get my stuff.  It's always a fun/scary time...
---
Oh...you shot a robot didn‚Äôt you?
---
Those features are nice, but can we all agree that those should be features we get for free?
---
I think that‚Äôs probably the logical answer, we want a decent SP RPG so badly that we will sacrifice graphics and gameplay for charm and good writing, maybe this puts Obsidian in line to start a AAA caliber project next.
---
Someone posted about doing this a little while ago. He was successful like 3 out of 4 times. 
---

It is rather limited data, but Microsoft's Xbox most played games in the US chart shows FO76 to have stagnated around the 40th place since October, with no obvious large increase or decrease after the subscription was introduced. The ~2700 people on /r/fo76 right now also seems to be the usual number. Overall, the game is gradually losing players since last December, most likely simply because of the lack of content, and the small updates so far were probably only enough to slow down the decrease since the spring. The one major chance to reverse the trend would be a successful launch of Wastelanders.
---
I suspect a number of subscribers will buy more months not to lose access to the convenience features, such as the scrap box. It is probably not without a reason that the crafting bag in ESO is still exclusive to the subscription. And more items, even if mostly just new outfits, will likely be added each month.
---
Amen
---
All rewards are also free, unlike other BR with battlepass
---
I like the event, a lot, but I feel like it needs to be slower.
---
There's no time to trick-or-treat / collect candy. JES-2R moves pretty fast between locations, and if you fall behind, you can't look the candy bowls. When you get to the courtyard, I feel like your options are to fight robots or cause mischief (forking especially), because there's not time to do both.
---
Basically the T51b has the best protection where straight-up combat is concerned, but the X-01 outclasses it when it comes to radiation resistance by a significant margin. It's worthwhile to have one of each; one for nuke zones and one for just tooling around under normal circumstances.
---
Pretty much this.
---
Yes. Some like it, some don't. There have been problems but it's never going to be immediately obvious why anyone does anything. Was just asking for clarification
---
It's not that you need to spend the atoms, or that they are "free" because of subscription. It's that they are included in the subscription fee, which also includes an outfit and a bottemless scrap box and the opportunity to play a world by yourself.

I don't know how many in game caps I made making theremins and greenhouses, which I got from from the stom shop.

I‚Äôve not tried the private server... I assumed you would still need a friend to tie you to that server.  
---
I would experiment with easy-to-replace junk or weapons first.
---
Why not change severs?
---
Are you praising yourself and your own post? Holy sh*t your either a top tier troll or one of the worst most self deluted people on the planet.
---
I guess lots of us just don‚Äôt feel as entitled as you. Bethesda is still a business that needs to make money. Otherwise it will all go away. Again as someone else stated just the atoms alone are worth the price.
---
I think what I love about the game is that it captures my fallout post main questline experience, I can roam around the map finding shit to do indefinitely, and this is coming from someone that still plays his original character from fallout 4 with about 6 months worth of hours on it (I do play other playthroughs so I'm not limiting myself)
---
2 types of people. I purposefully place my camp in an area like that because then I have a better chance of spawning legendaries...

You aren't OP, and your reasons could be different. Plus, op said it was over a year ago that they asked for a refund
---
Just about every online rpg game has an account stash these days. Some even allow you to purchase extra space, which makes money for the company without pissing off customers. It's been suggested several times since beta, but they seem to like watching people squirm. I can't help but wonder what this game would be like had they actually put the resources into creating the fallout mmo they were working on ages ago.

---
Rdr2 comes out on pc on Tuesday, i preordered it and will be playing that from now on. Gonna get outer worlds on black Friday. 
---
I really loved fo76, i loved playing alongside my bf, loved planning new camps and collecting things people want to buy, dropping things for new players, helping new players build. I loved finding the little details that the devs put in the game from the beginning, like Teddy Bears in portapottys.
---
But that feeling has been gone for quite some time now.
---
The candy bowls are what cause the fastest movement of the progress bar. You just need to run up and down the cottages raiding the bowls continually and then around in circles raiding the courtyard bowls. I‚Äôve actually picked up a ton of candy doing just this... and it helps to ensure the event progresses.
---
This maybe a little unrelated but with the release of Borderlands 3 and the FREE events and content they have done since that release along with a massive amount of patches to improve QoL has made me proud that there are still AAA developers out there that care about their game and community and let the money flow based on the quality of their product and happiness of their consumers--ie they dont squeeze every dime out they can and instead take great pride in their art.  Plus, the fact that EVERY major/top complaint the community has put forward on the forums has been directly addressed by the devs with great response time with a road map and constant communication every week.
---
Its games and devs like those that generate a happy community and has greater potential for a long success imo.  Go over to that Reddit page for BL3 and its night and day different cuz the community just seems so much happier than many gaming forums I've been to.  If only more devs of these once great franchises could follow that same model that Gearbox has put forward, we wouldn't see so much potential in games go into the dump I feel.
---
Crazy how people are still downvoting you.
---
The trade function wasn't working. I mentioned that in the post. I didn't just decide I'd rather drop it than trade, it wouldn't let me request trade or accept a trade. I reloaded once to try and fix it even.

It is literally crashing their ubisoft stocks as we speak.
---
Properly because games are made to run on them and there's a load more problems on PC as there's no way a developer will know your set up.
---
However your crash claim is wrong. The game crashes on PC a lot, I've seen it, a lot of people have. A lot of PC player from all ranges get crashes. There no two ways around it sorry as it's not just a console thing. Honestly you should know this if your a PC player.
---
They obviously knew that people wanted the private servers the most, so they added the atoms to justify the price. I know bethesda needs to make money, but to charge people that much money a month, just seems ridiculous to me when i compare that to other subscriptions. 
---
I dont know how much running servers cost, but it definitely seems like they could cover most of the cost with purchases from the atom shop. Atleast minimize the cost of the subscription. It cant be that hard can it?
---
I have mine right near Super Mutants who sometimes spawn at Level 70. However a lot of the times it‚Äôll be a legendary one, which is cool. It does get annoying though. Especially considering Turrets and rockets launchers in camps are fucking pointless to enemies, it‚Äôs like their being tickled.
---
I'm willing to help everyone trading their stuff between characters, if I get paid  (I'm cheap af).
---
But who want to trust a stranger these days, right? üòÅ
---
That's cool, my man. Bon voyage. I still like the game, and will be sticking around. Not leaving anytime soon.
---
Oh sorry. I thought i was on reddit. My mistake.
---
&gt;I 100% completed 4 and all the dlc without mods.
---
You name it. Mods can make the experience so different, it may come close to a new Fallout you've never played before. And what exactly is this "constantly updated" content you're referring to? I see none of it. All you do is the same old daily again and again, and now you're paying for it to do it in private. üëç
---
Poe's Law bit me hard for this one I guess, sorry dude.
---
ROFL, lets wait and see if it is free or not. They also said only cosmetics would be sold in the atom shop. They lied about that, so why wouldn't they lie about future DLC? I mean the made the same claim on ESO that all future DLC would be free, so they just call them "chapters' or some other shit now.
---
For me, I've found they're only active when JES2R is very close. 8/10 times they are inactive and don't work.
---
Ah yea thx forgot about those.
---
Lol thanks, I cant believe I rolled that. Its insane
---
Yeah that's fine, just needed clarification. Could've assumed it was those common reasons, but you never know.
---
I only paid about ¬£16 (UK) and have enjoyed it for the most part and feel I've got my money's worth.  Running out of things to do in game now but I don't think there was any chance I'd get a refund myself
---
I have found that avoiding praising or criticizing the game itself is sadly somewhat necessary to avoid too much contention and thus downvotes.
---
New events, New challenges, sometimes even new folks. With Fallout 4 you have to download stuff like that and sometimes it crashes the whole game so I'm going to stick with 76 and not something that relies outside help to be entertaining
---
That's right, "your" mistake
---
I haven't been in since beta, I've been in since the original Fallout back in 97...I don't think there's ever been a Bethesda game without lots of bugs - you could say that it's part of their "charm" (you had to see it that way as Bethesda certainly weren't going to fix them). FO76 is no worse than usual for Bethesda, the only difference is that it's happening now and this time they've also done something specific that lots of people are unhappy about....
---
Most major bugs have been long since fixed - sure there are recurring issues but not game killers anymore....not like at beta launch. I fact just prior to FO1st launch the forums (showing my age...I meant subreddit) were quite positive about the game (remarkable for this subreddit), the dissatisfaction just reappeared when FO1st was launched.....this is not because bugs have gotten worse, it's straight up transference. Lot's of people are upset about  FO1st  and are taking their anger out more widely.
---
I'm happy to agree with you that we haven't had 12 months of satisfaction, but then nor did I expect that when buying the game. In my view the game has been perfectly OK, not great...but OK, since late February...and that's without considering all the free new content released this year since launch (events, burrows, vendors, purveyor, raids, etc). Just prior to FO1st I was perfectly happy with my experience - if I wasn't I would not be playing it anymore. 
---
That experience has not gotten any worse due to FO1st, it's probably slightly better what with bobble head weight reduction allowing me to place an entire new light in my base 
---
# living the dream
---
So far outer world's is kinda.. lackluster. But it is still a great game. 
---
I'm close to signing off of 76 for a while too, maybe when they do the NPC launch next year I'll check it out again.
---
Yep, you can deface the walls, but there are limited opportunities to do this. The candy bowls actually progress the bar the fastest because they renew and you can get candy from the same bowl multiple times after a short cool down. Simply running up and down the cottages or around in circles in the courtyard is the fastest way to move the progress bar along... way faster than defacing walls, killing the Whitespring robots or blowing up cars.
---
Oh ya. Context too. I got an offer for 100k for one of those. It sold for 150k. It was 3 star tho.
---
I get that they need to make money, but it still looks like they are just throwing the atoms in there to justify the cost. Im not sure how much running servers cost but if they really need to charge people 15 dollars a month, it seems like they could cover more of the cost with the money they make from the atom shop. I love the idea this game brings to the table and would love to see it succeed, but i just dont think this is the right direction the game is heading in (needing to pay for every new feature)
---
Edit: also i think it would've been a better decision to make players pc's run the server locally. Im not sure if thats possible for consoles tho, and that might be the factor that led bgs to decide to run the servers on their part
---
Yeah, I don't like to do it, and figured if the weapon was lost because of a crash I had better stuff I could give her once she gets up to Lvl 50. But the whole response from the guy was just a degree of immature and petty that I wasn't prepared for.
---
Haha same.
---
Don't know about the breaking within seconds of repairing.
---
But the second part; if you re-equip a weapon as soon as it breaks you can use it forever if you don't change weapon. Works well with missle launchers as you can fire the missle at a distant enemy, go into pipboy and re-equip the gun as the missle hits.
---
If you do it with a Harpoon gun with the fletchette mod you now have a Broken, unlimited ammo gun (unlimited ammo as the fletchette mod gives you more harpoons than you fired)
---
This has been a bug since beta.
---
Crashing on pc usually happen if your RAM is too small or your setting is too high. You can fix that by buying more RAMs or just lowering your settings. You can FIX it. But non of that is possible on consoles. You are stuck with all those problems till game developers intentionally tone down the game

Looks like you were 100% factually wrong. LMAO

I'd argue that would be "Good Vibrations", but with Brian Wilson there are a lot of valid choices.

Very well put. It gave me good kotor/mass effect vibes. Especially kotor. And people have wanted a game like that since me3.

How is getting clean self destructive?

I can confirm its true you take 0 damage from scorchbeast echo blasts wearing the fire breathers suit.
---
Look man -- it's cool. You got freaky with a scorched, and now you're paying the price for it. We're all friends here. You can be honest.
---
Most of my experiences with other players is decent. I only deal in workshops love enough to claim them for atoms, then leave. I don't usually take random group requests, and if I do, I ungroup shortly after. I figure this is a game, and not generally worth making it stressful on myself. But this was honestly a more distasteful interaction than the time someone was masturbating on team chat in NW.
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm really looking forward to the sequel‚Äù is the best way I can describe my feelings towards TOW. 
---
It‚Äôs a game with a very interesting world with a fun story and well written characters that needs some polish on the mechanics - lets hope the sequel takes the strong foundation we have now and builds on it, because MAN do I want more outer worlds
---
Well you will be missed, and I wish you the best.
---
 I find this to be the honest reality of this game. It unfortunate, but how many developers does it take to screw in a light bulb?
---
 We are a week away from year 1, and the game is more broken now, than it has ever been. 
---
Bethesda management continues to live with this fantasy of playing there own character types, by being raiders. And expecting there loyalist followers, within our community, including myself. To continuing to put up with more and more of there ridiculous bullshit. 
---
 I think that Bethesda motto should be, 
---
LIE, CHEAT, STEAL!
---
To be honest with everyone, it was hard to walk away from this game, I still have a place in my heart for Fallout76. 
---
But I can't stand being considered a corporate donkey, chasing this false carrot, especially from a company that continues to dig themselves deeper, and deeper with controversy. And not making any honest effort to make things right with there community. 
---
In addition,  not  having a stable game after 12 months from release. It just goes to show what this companys real intentions where from the beginning. 
---
I may come back in the future, if there is a future left for this game.
---
 I did get my money worth out this broken down golf cart, we call Fallout 76, I guess!
---
 But in the end, I still payed for something that should have been fixed at least a couple months after launch. 
---
And not to mention,  all the bullshit I had to deal with on a every day basis, really doesn't add up in the end. 
---
This not including my power armor addition, the amount of atoms I purchased in the beginning, to receive really nothing in the end. 
---
Just a big thanks for being a sucker, and falling for our PR campaign, and I even got into some pretty heated debates, defending this game at one point. 
---
I guess, in the end, I thank Bethesda for opening my eyes to this reality, I call nice guys finish last. 
---
I make one promise to them, I will never purchase another product from there company, or any other company that associates with them. 
---
As I have said in the past, you can fuck me once, you can fuck me twice, but the next one is on you bitches. 
---
Well I guess we will see how much longer Fallout 76 stays a float! 
---
This was probably the reason why, the wastelanders was put off till next year. 
---
I can't see Fallout 1st saving this game at this point either.
---
 And you know, I would have probably supported the fallout first membership, if this game wasn't fucked  from the beginning. 
---
Nonetheless I wish you, and everyone the best. 
---
It's the final countdown!  Let's see how long this game lasts from now! 
---
I give it till new years. Lmao!
---
Well there you go, you spent money on something else. Next month skip it and join First. If you just don't want to then move on, you made a choice as other people did, don't complain after the fact.
---
Honestly I hope to get options to change core mechanics and mod later on. Plus my wife will not play on public servers. She's seen people try to screw with me too much to even wanna bother with it.
---
As someone who spent over 130 hours playing fo4 I was disappointed reading the reviews of 76 so I didn‚Äôt buy it until 2 months ago and now I totally see why everyone was complaining what a shithole game it is. Didn‚Äôt even get past like 10 hours on this one and it‚Äôs back to siege.
---
Private servers are usually private, usually dedicated and usually work. So yes it is overpriced.
---
I wish there were a few smaller tents I could add. There needs to be a little one for initial check-ups. 
---
Luckily the area is large and flat, so I can expand it pretty well if needed and I still have about 25% budget left, which was quite a surprise. 
---
All in all, I like the place and if anyone on PC ever wants to swing by, just look for "Wakshaani's camp" on the map. It'll be by the dried-up lake west of the Whitespring. 
---
If anyone has suggestions for integrating the vending machines better, I'm all ears. Wish we had the smaller ones available, so I could plop down some proper medical dispensaries, but, hey, use what I can for now.
---
At 240, if that was his first good weapon... well, clearly he needed all the help his subscription could give him and every underhanded tactic in the book.
---
Seriously
---
jeeebus. wow, shit really JUST WORKS, dunnit?
---
thanks for this. i suppose it wouldn't be a FO76 holiday event if there weren't bait-and-switch rewards, right? -\_-
---
I suppose that is a philosophy

I'm not gonna sell it. It's a final roll type weapon lol. Even without the 3rd star.

Amazing!!! Cannot stop watching that video. Saving this post no doubt.

How you gave away the last of your stuff, committed suicide, died a moment before someone came to save you, and then gracefully glitched below the map to that music. 10/10 man please keep that video up forever because it‚Äôs so perfect.
---
The amount of people I've seen unironically comparing Bethesda to an abusive partner over this drama really skeezes me out.
---
It's a number 5 mouth for sure. I don't know why it would switch like that. The first blemish is eye shade, the second nose. So it doesn't even affect that part of the face... plus blemishes are overlays. The files are different and everything.
---
I was just trying to help you out, but in like 11 years I've never seen the face editor just switch stuff out like that.
---
Amen!
---
They should have given 1'st the account stash *instead* of the unlimited scrapbox. It would have generated way less controversy if they did that.
---
$9=$15?
---
That's stage one of the scorched plague.  You've got to get the cure.
---
Chems can get you to do a lot of things you wouldn‚Äôt do normally....
---
So Bethesda itself is no "outside help"? You wouldn't have a game at all without them. All you are entertained with is their work, not yours. Could as well accept the help of talented modders. You talking bullshit, and the only reason for you posting this in the first place was to be an asshole for posing your wealth. And it's shortminded people like you that keep those practices of the gaming industry, and as well many other industries, alive. "I have enough money, fuck the rest." But that's your decision to make. Fact is, Fallout 1st isn't worth the money they're asking for nor is it something that should get any kind of support by anyone.
---
Yea I'm also wondering why it started at the same time and lasts 1 week after, instead of starting 1 week before.
---
At least if you wait until all rewards are active, you only have to get 14k overseer points to get all the reward cumulatively, while if you did them daily as they are released you would have to get \~30k overseer points total.
---
EDIT:  I will say though if it started before, and still had the 1 week time delay before the final reward, we would either grind out \~30k in the first week getting the rewards 1 at a time, or wait until they are all out to only do 14k, but have to do it between halloween events.  So I think after was a good call, as we can focus solely on NW.
---
So, you don't earn XP after events like the rest of us? I'm confused how you don't see why playing an event three times an hour, when other people can do it once, is totally one hundred percent Pay to Win. But whatever.
---
come on over to r/fo76filthycasuals
---
The bugs do happen, when you use the same failing game engine. Over. And over. And over... again.... that's the one thing that always annoyed me about Bethesda. They know it's buggy yet use it for every fallout game they make. It gets old real quick for me.

---
Salty af are we? You prove nothing and are wrong from the start. Can't afford $13? Sad.
---
I think it's just the general feeling of the world being alive due to other players. I thought multiplayer was a terrible idea, but I doubt I'd keep playing it if it was single player .
---
I don't even cross paths with other players that much outside events, but the fact that they're there seems to make a big difference. 
---
I preferred the worlds of 3 and 4, and they definitely had much better missions, yet '76 keeps drawing me back in...
---
Legacy Handmade? What are you talking about?

I'd prefer barbarian(str) or evasive(agi) over iron clad, sounds like you running a str build so barbarian would be more point effficient than iron clad.

---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong dude, I appreciate the help immensely! And good looking out for a fellow vault dweller. If only Bethesda was as quick to help us as we are one another.
---
Yea that sounds like the location. I first saw it on public and thought someone had left it.
---
?
---
Oh so never talk about anything for the game ever b/c they might monetize it?  Forget that.  Just stop playing if they monetize too much stuff that you think should be free.  Vote with your wallet, instead of censoring people on reddit.
---
The way I see it, it's a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation. If you keep playing, you condone what's been done so they don't have reason to change. If you don't keep playing, they don't have a player base to update for.
---
Knee jerk reaction for me is that they've got some whales spending like no ones business, so they're basing choices around milking the whales and not around general player base improvements. So while I expect changes in the future, I don't think any will be for the common player.
---
That's just my opinion though. I'd love to hear what other people think.
---
Hey thanks mah dude
---
Iirc There is 2 tent plans at the Charlston vendor a large tent and a small tent. Also Campfire tales rewards a tent plan. Are you on PS4? I can check my inventory if you are I may have said plans though I recently reduced the cost of all my plans to clear up inventory so I'm not certain.. If not I'm sure someone would help.

Also, for the vending machines maybe a small brick or wood building or just put them on the side of your tents.

Not true, really don't know much about PC's do you? Software can crash regardless of RAM and so on. There was a batman game that proved just that. Software can break itself and all video games are software. Though your right you can't buy more RAM for a console. Though it's a bit of a weak argument. 
---
Video games are made for consoles (usually one) then ported to other consoles and PC. Indie however tend to work the other way around but Fallout 76 is a AAA game which was most likely developed for Xbox then ported to other consoles and PC (as Fallout 4 was but I could be wrong with 76). So then people on Xbox would expect their games to actually work. All things considered there are no games made solely for high end PC so everyone should expect that. Not shit on consoles for not being a high end PC.

That is the only thing I didn't test but I would assume and have experienced it does not stack, otherwise it would be incredibly broken.

You you proved you have way too much time on your hands to argue with someone who clearly has posted bait, you've clearly proven yourself to be a fool! ü§£
---
As the person who created the organic post, I approve this message üëç
---
But I find it interesting that *we* can't be trusted to be civil considering ZeniMax lost this lawsuit and Beth is radio silent on Fallout 1st ü§î
---
I she'll make a shrine in your honor
---
That's a low priced one I'd say. A mid would be just no atoms, and be around 6,99. We could call them Fallout 2nd and 3rd, lol. But all of them would get the atom ahop offers like the  NCR ranger outfit.
---
lol thanks, you I like.  good hunting
---
Most people have to pay 15 euros
---
In terms of cosmetics and other items, I suspect it will be similar to ESO‚Äôs subscription service;  you‚Äôll be given a handful of premium currency to spend on the store each month (or, buy currency with real money)
---
Pathetic try. You lost.
---
Oh my God, at least I can afford a $13 monthly subscription ü§£
---
Same here my friend, made it to the end of one of them, the other six attempts were all crashes.
---
hmm ok I didn't know that
---
What? I've got an old amd phenom black edition 955 x4 from nearly 15 years ago. It still can play fo76 and any modern game, just at low settings, which are still above most consoles...
---

You want it to be free? I just don't see how that would make sense
---
I've got all three, and remembering that I had the larger one was a big help, but a smaller pup tent would be super useful. 
---
The vending machines are set up nicely, they're just a tad ‚Ä¶ jarring. They don't fit the theme so I keep them off to one side. More thematic medical dispensaries woul dbe better but, you know, don't exist, so.
---
I didn‚Äôt say that. Maybe try reading?
---
Those two are quest related ones so everyone gets them lol the T line is way rarer since you have to farm the pieces and the plans.
---
I don't think people are buying as many atoms as they thought they would.  Some of the stuff in there is cool, but personally the only time I've bought atoms was for the Santa outfit and Santa power armor skin.
---
Is anyone selling fireman outfit? üòÖ
---
What argument is this please xD??? Paying monthly for a full game with huge addons or paying the same amount of money for miscellaneous items is NOT a Good Deal. Thats excactly what this company wants, brainwashed people who actually spend money for this crap hahaha
---
Fuck Steam especially for this. I once bought a game that, on my computer, had a debilitating bug that would very commonly arise and cause the game to crash. I tried a bunch of different fixes but nothing worked and the game was basically not playable. Tried to refund it and got generic copy paste OH SO SORRY!!! YOU PLAYED FOR 2 HOURS ALREADY WE CAN NOT REFUND YOU :)
---
‚ÄúYeah but literally 90% of the time was spent either trying to play the game or trying to get it to work‚Äù
---
LOL WE DONT CARE :)))
---
Oh damn. You dont even know your a troll. See that superiority you have is why you cant maintain any meaningful relationships in life. Its not "us", its you.
---
I can see how it would be tough to make them work given your chosen aesthetic. I'm sure you'll figure it out.
---
Reality check.   Thanks üëç
---
You ripped that straight from the internet ü§£ good try
---
I feel you. I did this last week when I saw the archaic subscription service. Like, how dare you ask me for more money when I get stuck in terrain and fall through the map. Then I saw one of the new features of the sub was wiping inventory. Par for the course. We had some great times but you a crazy bitch now and thanks for giving me all the closure I could ever need.
---
Running Server costs are not a problem for a multi billion company like beth that already published several mmos and other games xD Its just a cash grab for even MORE money.
---
As an aside, the is a weekly atom challenge to pick up candy.
---
IIRC, its pick up 50 candy...at least 10 atoms, maybe more.
---
And
---
Since its Halloween, 2 more atom challenges for scrapping human skeleton parts...
---
Smh
---
Got 2 of them full .
---
You‚Äôre Captain Alex Hawthorne? *I‚Äôm* Captain Alex Hawthorne....
---
I'll agree it was weird to drop the subscription without Wastelandera &amp; the game in its current state. No questioning from me there.
---
But, even if you go the month by month route, it's something like 0.433USD per day ($13/30). I don't think you can even get a K-Cup for $0.43 each. Very dubious one could get an AWS server for that cost. That's ignoring entirely the atoms included (which I mean, it's a fake currency, they set the value of that so its kinda moot unless you were already gonna buy that many or more).
---
I think if we banned people like you from playing games the gaming scene wouldn't be mostly exploited by large players to make money of lazy and mindess children
---
Wow :D that actually sounds really nice!
---
For the price of 15 bucks per month that really sounds really like something of worth todo in this game!
---
Dodgy uses too much AP for a VAST/Crit build. It triggers every single time a level 1 ghoul shoots at you. Also I figure that I am in stealth, so if I‚Äôm getting hit, something went very wrong.  Serendipity is a ‚Äúmust have‚Äù, blocker is very good for the SBQ. 
---
I use more of the defensive perks on my Bloodied Heavy Build, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs nearly as necessary for a stealth character.  I guess it comes down to play style.
---
You can blame the software if everyone crashes. But if the case is that only select people with bad hardware are crashing, then it's likely the user is at fault. You think crashing on PC is something common but it is quite rare. I have to note it really is the hardware problem with consoles since RAM usage of this game can shoot up to 13gb at certain situations, further proving consoles are just not powerful enough to run this game. With that 8gb ram on consoles, there is no way it's gonna work.
---
Thanks for the advice
---
Yeah i spend alot of time here cause im unemployed. Want to be best friends?
---
&gt;The 2013 Xbox One just got a software update last week. Can you say the same for Windows 8?
---
Uh, yeah, windows 7 still gets updates and it is far older than the 360...
---
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4057281/windows-7-support-will-end-on-january-14-2020
---
I normally get them instantly, don‚Äôt even require a restart of the game
---
Yep! Jinx! Lol...JUST HAPPENED TO ME! I shouldn't have said anything, right!
---
Sure bud I'll be nice enough to let you play on my private server too üòâ
---
Much kudos, it really is a shame Bethesda turned bad guy, I mean don't get me wrong they've never been angels in the gaming industry but up until the whole 'games as a service' bs they were one of the better publishers out there imo. I just hope FO76 wasn't the end the Fallout franchise, I doubt it but other franchises have died for less.
---
You got 10 minutes to join back your private server before it resets
---
I would report that to the customer service.
---
On ps4 i have them within seconds after i buyed them. Sometimes even earlier than the email.
---
Hah, got the pants suit as soon as I commented.
---
Hey, Bethesda, I've never gotten a 3* Gatling either. (I know it doesn't work like this. I don't care.)
---
&gt; I miss when you'd get surrounded by raiders and pummelled with a bunch of power fists.  
---
Doesn't this belong on a *different* sort of subreddit?  I'm feeling a little queasy.
---
I have an empty one and an extra. I guess I will charge 15k for it then.
---
Just stay at the white spring resort the final stage of the event just wait there till the event comes to you then you avoid most of the glitches it‚Äôs helped a lot and doesn‚Äôt effect your rewards
---
I have neither of these costumes yet Haha
---
The event just keeps giving me clown costume üòÇ
---
I said that I would not pay for 1st even if I had money. It offers me nothing and it's fine for me. It would be awful, if I wanted it thou.
---
I get it when im overwieght
---
That woud be the "Classic" Jack'O'Lantern. The Happy one is this weird one with a unibrow. Unfortunately I don't think I have a spare Classic Jack'O'Lantern.
---
I read that turrets work in tandem with spotlights and Target enemies more efficiently when you light em up. I have to admit I have not tested this myself though. I prefer ambient lighting and keep my camp a little on the dark side.
---
&gt; I have a full-time job and I can easily afford that each month I could even buy the yearly subscription too. 
---
Sounds like you are living the best life, but still your wasting money so you can play a multplayer mmo alone xD 
---
Yeah i can see why its call fallout 1st lol
---
If ps4 I have an alien pumpkin and an empty rack but I am hearing the empty rack is extremely rare.
---
Totally agree
---
I have done it a few times, I use the lockers inside Sutton station. Just make sure you log right back in so it does not change servers.
---
No it was set up right behind the white springs train station. Made of metal building walls. Top floor is a church and mothman decor. Bottom is vendor and workshops
---
It's a speed run, skipping everything possible, like the Skyrim speedrun in 39 minutes, 32 seconds. You can't even see what menu options he's clicking or what he's doing in his inventory, he's so fast.
---
Yeah, for a second I got excited when I saw 'happy' but then I realized I already had that one. So I'm looking for 'classic', thanks for the tip!
---
The happy one, my fiancee thinks looks like Bert from Sesame Street.
---
I'd pay any amount to get away from filth like you üòò
---
Adrenaline works off kills (not necessarily from VATS).  If you can chain kills, it‚Äôs a very strong perk.  If you are playing a Bloodied, you should‚Äôve able to chain kills pretty easily.  There‚Äôs great synergy here.  Also, VATS is more efficient with Rifles than pretty much any other weapon.  
---
I run my Adrenaline at max rank with any of my Bloodied characters.  The only reason not to take it is if you play at a very slow pace as a pure sniper or something.
---
Just go to pumpkin house. No video needed :)
---
Well done you
---
That's not very nice.  It hurt my feelings.
---
What a sad sad day...  in so sorry that all them people had to listen to that god awful song (if area chat worked lol)  but you did sink like the titanic so maybe that's fitting in the end....
---
Hope you have fun and better luck in whatever game you find next safe travel's and super cool you helped on your way out respect.
---
Nah.  Public event, so you don‚Äôt lose junk if you die while the event is active.
---
My bet is someone got taken out by robots after the event ended...and for whatever reason, didn‚Äôt come back
---
So BOTH the costume and the fire breathers uniform?
---
Not sure if it works on this particular one, but sentry bots can normally be one shotted with a critical hit to the fusion cores.
---
I have 32 gigs of ram and can run any game at 6880x1440 without issue, except for this game. That isn't a hardware issue on my ned or else other games would also have the problems. Kingodom Come at ultra wouldn't run if my pc was way beyond what this game even recommends.
---

---
And my axe
---
Stopped playing also, hopefully bethesda makes some kind of comment instead of just staying silent again (which they said wouldn't happen)
---
With a 1* Instigating Lever you should be 1-shoting up to a 2* Legendary Supermutant.  That‚Äôs on a VATS headshot.
---
People play just fine with worse systems. Maybe you need to tweak ini to further optimize the game. This game is very demanding. Keeping stable 60fps is really hard to pull off and 980ti is never enough to run this game.
---
I'll take Meaningless Gestures for $500, Alex!
---
Seriously, what you do with FO76 doesn't matter one iota, what matters is what you'll do next time Bethesda tries to sell you something.
---
Great guide, just a couple other things I'd recommend. 
---
I've found that walking to the event start instead of fast traveling makes it less laggy on PS4. I usually fast travel to the train station about five minutes before the event starts and walk over. This gives everything a chance to fully load into memory before the chaos ensues. If you fast travel in there are usually already people wreaking havok and it can cause the game to slow to a crawl.
---
Also painting walls in the middle section is a good way to advance the bar and is a good way to contribute if you need to stay out of the way of the robots and exploding cars.
---
Its a private sub now
---
I do not yet have my "perfect" weapon, but I recently bought a Vampire's and reduced weight super sledge because I accidentally scripped my All Rise, and I named it Vampire's Rise.
---
Collecting plans is one of the few things to do when you hit endgame. I‚Äôll sell them for a fair price, but nobody gets a huge stack for free for the sole reason that long term it‚Äôs going to hurt their experience.
---
I think a subscription is better than a battle pass which is how most games get their monetization. Sure those are usually f2p but I would rather a subscription over those
---
Eh. It is what it is dude. 
---
Appreciate the sentiment all the same :)
---
Are we allowed to sell items on here or request items?
---
That‚Äôs what I mean yeah after the event when all the aggrod robots RIP
---
ROFL, this game isn't demading at all. I run Kingdom come at ultra at 6880x1440 resolution. 
---
If my rig can play that at max settings, it has no problem running multiple fo76 instances at once with them all at 60fps.
---
Also, are you seriously trying to say the 980TI aka TITAN isn't capable of running this game? LMFAO
---
Thank you üôÇ
---
Another thing I noticed with the full set : I can destroy cars with a meet hook and get zero damage from the blasts. Ever . I have dense mod, Though . i'll test that furthermore...
---
I hate to say it, but it's true.  
---
The game is very linear, and without spoiling man was the ending abrupt and anti-climactic.  I thought I'd hit a halfway point, and it just *ends*.
---
If I had paid $60 for it, I think I would have been mad.  Luckily, I played it with a gamepass trial.  Too short to be $60 imho.
---
And a pet peeve, the game looks open-ish world at first but in outdoor areas uses invisible walls to make you take certain paths.  I freaking hate that.  *My objective is right there, lemme just jump these damn rocks.*
---
That‚Äôs fine, if they need the location for future content boot the residents. Not exactly the end of the world to *maybe* have to move your camp *someday*.
---
The copy paste wasn't enough for me, so I kept at it til I got a real person, who promptly told me to go F myself (last year when I wanted a refund). The customer support network is toxic, the rabid fanboys (who love fallout 1st) are equally toxic. At least they deserve each other.
---
You should know that Fallout 76 was intended as a Fallout 4 Coop Dlc, but the game itself already went into the hands of modders which means that there is a huge amount of incompatible stuff that would never allow for a compatible multiplayer game. Thats why they decided to make that dlc to a standalone game, which they did. And all this missing content and story that is actually missing, was actually everything that was in fallout 4. With wastelanders they just reimplement all the features that are missing from the singleplayer game. Look at the trailer and you can see all those Preston Garvey Settlers lol.
---
Yup, uninstalled last week. I have no desire to support or defend this game anymore.
---
Yes, ive tried it a few times and no worries
---
To be fair I was in SUPER HYPE mode for the first few hours of playing OW, until I realized how short the game actually was.
---
Its self destructive to watch
---
This basically sums up my experience with it as well... I invested a lot of points into persuade, intimidate and lie and I could talk my way out of almost everything. That got boring quickly but still it's a decent experience and I shouldn't complain I paid 1$ for Xbox game pass pc to play it lol.
---
And your a raider lol ü§î
---
You have to realize that this is a multiplayer game and it can be more demanding than some fancy looking single player games. And it's funny you mentioned RDR2 because it's not on PC yet.
---
Lmao you played yourself
---
‚ÄúOh, my sweet summer child," Old Nan said quietly.
---
I've had no crashes, done it about 6 times on PC. 
---
I wonder if there's a setting or something that helps?  I keep "lighting" set to low because I hate the god-rays and stuff - I wonder if that helps when there's a dozen explosions happening all at the same time?
---
Downvoting truth lul.
---
I know RDR2 will run as it is basically the same engine at GTAv which runs no problem even with the photoreal mod( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAgf3DPJyNQ ). So RDR2 won't be an issue. Also, preorders are already out for the PC. :)
---
If the issue was with my pc not being able to handle fo76 then I'd not have been able to run multiple instances at the same time with stable 60fps. I can, yet still get CTD quite often.
---
Video guides are a huge help to playing Fallout 76.
---
My favourite part is how you‚Äôre praising others for being ‚Äúdecent people‚Äù while making no effort to be decent yourself.
---
No  crashes on console for me. My buddy had issues, reinstallation worked for him. YMMV. Good luck.
---
If you're indecent to me, you shall get the same in return. That's how this works
---
That's neat! Just goes to show what you can do if you put your mind to it!
---
Same, glad I didnt buy it. Wont be playin anymore after this 2nd run that I'm almost done with. Done one "good guy" run an one "asshole run".
---
A quad/explosive Dragon, can you imagine? I'm sure the devs did and said "No!"
---
Don‚Äôt know where the borderlands is coming from. To me it‚Äôs got the style of bioshock, the combat and wacky humor of fallout, and the dialogue system from kotor 2 (the system every rpg should have ever since kotor released imo). Having different allies respond to your actions and dialogue is just great to experience
---
I have only named 2 of my weapons.  My "Beta Stomper" from beta days,  My level 5 Vampire, Explosive, Vats refill, Laser Rifle.  And my "Vampiric Stomper", my level 50 vampire, explosive, vats refill Laser Rifle (exact same gun minus level).
---
Thanks for the info!
---
I'm not sure if my message went through, but I added you to. Hit me up when ur online
---
Pumpkin towers are cool
---
No wonder he became an alcoholic, you named him after chav central, AKA Sheffield. And he is so drunk he can't even spell it correctly.
---
Thought you said you run the game just fine lmao. So you lied unless you are some gaming journalist that got a copy few days earlier
---
I hadn't realised that - I had it in my head that it was just melee like blocker...but then that perhaps explains why my action points are sometimes stuck at zero in sbq fights - perhaps that's a dodgy glitch? I think that I may need to re spec now though to at least 3 points in adrenaline...either that or gunfu anyway.
---
Stealth isn‚Äôt a workable plan in a SBQ fight though so the not getting hit argument doesn‚Äôt survive there.
---
NDA's are a hell of a thing, and it isn't just journos who get press copies. Game devs with connections can get them as well. ;)
---
I see your point but your trying to agrue a point that would mean people with high end PC crashing is their fault for not having a high end PC (not your words but is basics of what your saying).
---
Also yes crashing on PC is very normal. Just because you don't doesn't change that. The only way that it would be any different is if you custom made a PC for every different thing you use.
---
Hell Microsoft word has crashed on me a few times in the past.
---
Plus again, games are MADE for consoles. Kills your point when 8GB of RAM is what the game is designed to use.
---
These virtual items/services add value to my experience, I can cancel any month 1st doesn't add value (as I enjoy the base game,) and it's within my means. Unintended value added: schadenfreude.
---
But then how will he get karma?
---
I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre a bare bones, purely utilitarian camp person. For those of us that put a lot of time and effort into our camps a sliiiight chance of a legendary spawn is not a good trade off.
---
look at me not playing the game and not circlejerking constantly about how awful it is
---
You know, i actually 100% agree with your statement! :)
---
I‚Äôve seen this happen a few times, and it‚Äôs been going on since the Flatwoods map days. Pretty sure it‚Äôs just a bug.
---
Well are you the one with connections tho?
---
Are you really expecting the NPC launch to not be spectacularly and hilariously broken beyond belief?
---
They've already got your money. Why should they even give a fuck?
---
Check my post history, I did work on Guild Wars 2.
---
A trustworthy raider üòá
---
Trustworthy until he takes some chems and thinks twice about the deal. üòÇ You can't say that your friends hadn't warned you.
---
Its even more ridiculous when you realize how many other companies can keep online servers running WITHOUT charging a subscription fee.
---
ESO added that same feature to ESO+, and that's also $15
---
People just wanted a game that wasn't shitted up to high heaven with $99 "microtransactions" and loot boxes.
---
I just stopped playing. Perhaps I will tinker with it here and there in the distant future but i am honestly disappointed and may not.
---
Nothing wrong with being hyped up, it just needs to be tempered with realistic expectations. I'm in my thirties now and the last decade of many disappointments by "RPGs" has made me a bit more cynical than I'd like to be.
---
From my understanding though OW wasnt meant to be AAA level, big game. Obsidian was going broke, and as much I dislike the corporatism the gaming industry has evolved into, it still takes money to make polished, large scale games.
---
As long as Obsidian can keep their heart and soul now that they got that sweet Microsoft money I think they have the potential to make some really amazing stuff. I've barely had time to play OW (still doing quests in the first town) but so far it seems like a good base for future titles to build off of.
---
Sorry to see another person drop, but no point in wasting your time I'd you arent enjoying it. I myself just came back after a break, guess I'm in the minority as I've never had any big issues and still enjoy the game.
---
Cap'n hook the bloodied swing speed meat hook
---
The Lamb Sauce, my bloodied rolling pin
---
Eastwood the bloodied explosive western revolver
---
Prime Time the prime explosive suppressors minigun
---
Vamp champ the vampires minigun
---
SpaceX the two shot auto grenade launcher
---
Major Tom the two shot missile launcher
---
Nope. I just make sure to kill everything. I keep crops and 1 power pylon with a wire attached to it as that's what enemies agro onto the most from my experience. This way I can keep my budget lower with no turrets and can decorate more.
---
He said that like being easily amused is a bad thing. I think being easily amused is great! Good for you.
---
Ah no man you don't get what I mean. People with high end systems tend to go full ultra and that can make their game crash often. But if you lower your setting to reasonable level, you are very unlikely to crash. Me and my friend never crashed during the event not even once.
---
the discord to this reddit has trade channels
---
Thanks üôÇ
---
That‚Äôs still not decency, and you‚Äôve insulted people who‚Äôve said nothing hurtful to you.
---
So far for me on XB, the Atoms are issued instantly. The new balance is reflected by the time I drop out of the MS store. 
---
Sounds like you were having issues with the MS store?
---
Beautiful. I wish I could double upvote just because of how much I love The Lamb Sauce
---
Restart reboot and the event is gone problem solved according to them lol
---
Well? You got the connection or what?
---
Once again, you are ignoring the fact I can run multiple instance of fo76 at 60fps, yet I still get crashes. Even when not multiboxing and using fresh installs with zero mods.
---
If it was an issue with the game being too demanding than it wouldn't run at all multiboxing it.
---
i agree, but the fact he got it like that...
---
My came freezes when I try to fast travel to the event. I have to try at least 4 times until the game will actually get me to the event
---
Yes, but I can't say anything else due to NDA's. Which is also a major part of early access.
---
Neat also, I noticed pumpkins don't cast a shadow.
---
&gt; FO76 was intended a Fallout 4 coop DLC.
---
Do you have any source about this? I have curiosity about it.
---
&gt; was a pretty cool game. still is. my first and only fall out game too.
---
Please go play the other Fallout games, how can your first Fallout game be the one everyone has made fun of and criticized? What made you say "no not these Fallouts, but this one? Yes sir"
---
Pretty sure I'd forego the extra rewards in favor of Power Armor.
---
What the hell man. I can run three fo76 with 60 fps when I'm using my mule. Have you tried multiboxing mischief event? Do that and tell me how it went. Lemme know if you maintain 60fps
---
I bought 500 atoms yesterday on Xbox and they still have not been added in game
---
&gt;More people need to realise this, and stop blaming Bethesda.
---
Ima stop holding Bethesda accountable when they release a statement that the reason the game is such a mess is all on Zenimax.
---
Also its a corporation not a human being, its ok to blame them because they are a multi billion dollar business selling a product.
---
So now the question becomes: is this a bug or intended feature?
---
Awww shiet that's a shame. I was about to share my story of Elderscrolls 6 playthrough with you but yeah NDA is a bitch ain't it. It crashes on consoles but I can't say more
---
Big superiority complex problem here, bud.  Have fun having fun. But when you're having fun to attempt to rub it in the face of people, youre probably not having any actual fun in the game. Just the enjoyment of justifying posts like this in your head. 
---
Pitter patter.
---
Called my BE gatling plasma "BFG" from Doom and my BE gatling gun "Death Warrant" because of UT3
---
I named one, way early, it was a two shot single action, I called it Baby's Love.
---
I stopped naming items when I discovered that it lost the name when I gave it to another player. I tried giving items to my fiancee that had her name on them (____'s Shotgun, for example), and they all reverted to their base names when I gave them to her. Lame. I'd be more interested in the renaming function if the names stuck.
---
Sure, but now that they've linked beneficial utilities to a monthly fee, they're likely just going to give them to all the First Citizen Lynette's, maybe even raise the price every year. I'd be astounded if the free players even got access to Wastelanders
---
&gt;I don't think people are buying as many atoms as they thought they would
---
This is thier own fault. They don't add enough new items to the shop nor do they add stuff players actually want frequently enough.
---
I mean really no Enclave items yet?
---
Knowing them, it'll be exclusive to the inferior .44 revolver
---
I uninstalled when fo1st was announced. I was getting crashes even only playing my main character with a fresh install just doing normal game play shit.
---
The game has many bugs in it that cause crashes, on the PC.
---
Just like how there are bugs effecting specifically the x box 1x the most powerful console on the market, with bethesdas coding of the mischief night crap bugging out the "enhanced graphics" settings of the one x, it is why only some get the issue, because the tv connected to the xbox has to support the enhanced graphics settings as well. That is why it seems so random for xbox players.
---
It has nothing to do with their hardware being shitty, it is literally the exact opposite, it is the scorpio systems that are crashing due to the coding added in patch 14.
---
I have named a ton of weapons:

If someone knows what all these things mean then congrats you are a person of taste.
---
Coffee is not the problem and I can‚Äôt wait until the idea that it is dies.
---
This comment is 100% the only reason I want Bethesda to let us share weapons and keep their name. That‚Äôs some sweet shit, man.

Immediatly followed by

*STOOOPID HUUUMAN*
---
I thought I should be able  to grab candy from the buckets . Haven't been able to interact with those yet.
---
Except the fact ES6 is years away, while rdr2 is weeks away. LOL
---
I spaced out and forgot that it was the end of November when it officially launches, but hey, if you don't want to believe me that is fine. 
---
I really don't care what you think if you think the fucking 980TI isn't strong enough to run this game, a fucking gtx TITAN isn't enough to run this game. LMFAO
---
I contacted Bethesda support so now im just waiting on a response, i was going to contact MS but on the help sight it said certain games currency wasn't their jurisdiction so i guess we'll see what Bethesda has to say first.
---
I still have the Civil Unrest shotgun on my wall so I don't scrip it accidentally.
---
More opportunities, it's their First Citizen Privilege
---
I was trying to be all romantic within the confines of a post-apocalyptic hellscape video game. Bethesda didn't let me.
---
Those comments make me feel like this is just a troll post. There's a lot of trolly comments in there. OP literally start off by calling everyone whiny cunts.
---
Look up the cost for it in AU. Where this is taking place.
---
Hence my disengaging tone. I'm not getting suckered into an argument over this crud. Well, not this time.
---
I did get to play with friends, i dont feel stupid for the time we enjoyed together. I spend more on a nice nice night out for food a drinks than the entire cost is debacle. Live and learn I guess :)
---
Every product has a base objective value though. A new car has more base value than an old one for instance. If some people then place more value on it that's up to them.
---
Again it's fully deserved ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
We will get to access wastelanders free but with some new features locked behind the paywall. Mark my words
---
Lol, right there's even a comment which makes me think op forgot to switch to an alt.
---
Nah I prefer Rizzo‚Äôs Purpleberry Crunch
---
Allow single account players to turn their other 4 character slots safely into mules and put that behind a paywall?
---
Oh no no no no. This would have been more controversial since it has similar functionality to the unlimited scrapbox in terms of scrap storage but you also x5 your max caps, max daily scrip, max daily vendor caps and, most importantly, general storage to store your excess legendaries.
---
I've been on and off of it since it came out, I was a staunch supporter of it to all of my friends. Soon the server disruptions and their frequencies changed my mind bit I still supported it. Now almost a year later, I find that I just couldn't care less about this game. All the money spent to preorder and it all fell flat. They had their shot. It was promising but now it's dead. Even NPCs arent enough to bring me back. One day maybe but not any time soon. Bethesda, you've let us all down once again.
---
Mind helping a bro out?
---
If so NtHStormer98
---
I dont think you understand what pay to win is exactly. Are people who are doing this event 3x an hour getting weapons and armor that others are not? Are they getting weapons amd armor exclusive to a membership? 
---
Ebay is pay to win. Not fo1st
---
I dunno man. I thought you were getting crashes during mischief event which would be somewhat understandable, but now I see you getting crashes even before that. Maybe you can't say much about settings or troubleshootings and stuff? I mean come on man who runs into crashes on PC?
---
QE Dragon will kill everything lol
---
Yes. 
---
"Main weapon."
---
"Back-up."
---
Honestly, I'm boring myself over here.
---
Literally 90% of the player base, even fo76filthycasuals even admits they get CTD with this game. They are literally a sub dedicated to only "positive views" of this game and even they know it is there.
---
It is obvious you don't know much when it comes to PC's when you claimed my 980TI aka TITAN gfx card isn't capable of running this game. LOL
---
Sorry, but you don't get to decide what P2W is all by your lonesome, and there are several varying definitions which could equally apply. People who are doing any event more often than is meant to be allowable are earning more rewards, and yes, that is gaining an advantage. People are going to sell the rewards, right? So if someone does the event three times an hour, that's the potential of earning triple the rewards, so... Yeah, P2W. I don't really care that you disagree, we're all allowed to do that.
---
---EDIT--- FO1st isn't Pay to Win. Using it to do an event more often than other players can, totally is.
---
I like that, tbh. 
---
Raider: *So what did you kill him with?*
---
You: *Main weapon*.
---
Noted
---
Wait... isn‚Äôt fallout shelter a completely different game than fallout 76?
---
5k plus upvotes are from people who never even played the game I would bet anything.  Look at how few upvotes anything about the actual game has. People are garbage.
---
Actually if you had any common sense to read the whole thing you'd realize that I posted this in response to all the "saying goodbye forever" posts in this feed, they're very f****** annoying and I'm just letting y'all know that I'm having a good f****** time too bad you aren't
---
It's just on them to make a product that makes money. And that's it.
---
Yes it's perfectly safe. I have transfered a lot of stuff between characters. This is the best feature about Fallout 1st to me.
---
I have a pretty good 3\* Minigun; two-shot, 90% reduced weight and something-something VATS (I think?). It was doing a number on anything I used it against; Scorchbeasts were being downed in a couple of seconds. I ended up naming it 'Tyrant' and giving it a chrome finish!
---
Oh you don't know about gaming industry bro. Can't tell you much cause NDA
---
And srsly what's with all this love with TITAN? Isn't it somewhere between 1060 and 1070? It ain't something that NASA is using it's just mediocre atm and ffs it's been out for 5 yrs now don't expect your TITAN to be performing well after all that aging. And don't tell me you bought it last year cause that's just being stupid
---
You forgot to switch to your alt account pal.
---
The Fixer (as it drops during its quest line) is a "semi-legendary" item that provides faster sneak speed while aiming, and that buff is what makes it unique - not the configuration or appearance. 
---
It probably has a slightly different item name in the game code, so for now, other skins can't be applied. 
---
You can craft a Combat Rifle with short barrel, suppressor, sights, and stock that will appear identical, but without the buff.
---
The same buffed weapon was a rare drop in FO4.
---
My Instigating Crossbow, Lannister‚Äôs End, and my Instigating Death Tambo, Rhythm ‚Äòn Bruise.
---
Makes sense the firebreathers one does, given the firebreathers were all about killing schorched and scorchbeasts. But kinda surprised pre-war firemen had the same defenses in mind lol
---
I got that. I agree. I doubt all the PC gamers that I have seen complain though have the game on max setting. Most would though, not doubtful all do as the game runs badly on its own. My point is though that following how game development works and using this game as a example.  A game would be made for the weakest console they intend to release it on (Original Xbox One) or the weakest best selling console (Original PS4). 
---
Therefore, whilst what your saying will help PC players. It wouldn't be the reason for the crashing but instead something to do with the game itself, could be the lag coursing, the explosions, the fact it's always online (maybe even people own internet) but not the console unless its faulty in some way.
---
Anyway it's good your not having the issue, it's a fun event :D
---
Yeah... GTX 980ti aka TITAN, Mangetter, The Myth, The Legend
---
It's not really relevant but I recently acquired a quad ffr double barrel shotgun. It's not very useful but it is amusing to use with additional increased fire rate applied. If you pull the trigger fast enough it's basically like full auto for 8 shots.
---
I hope they git rid of all location restrictions except mission locations. That way we may build a city in specific Charleston area together...
---
Good to know, thx
---
Also, don't be that person that nukes the event 4 minutes after it starts. 
---
Really annoying when that happens.
---
Im almost sure that most people started with Fallout 3.
---
My point is: it was a dead franchise, could stay dead with f76, but, at least, they're still working on it.
---
It's not an excuse for selling crappy nuka cola dark drinks, cheap bags/etc. But well, there's at least something on the move.
---
People just have different tastes. For example I just cannot stand RDR2, but I love Control despite many don‚Äôt...
---
Van Buren? Heh, another curious fact: a lot of lore content from New Vegas are from Van Buren.
---
Always a legend this thing.
---
I think that suits it quite well, if I‚Äôm being honest. I really need to dig deeper into weapon customization, anything that can take a scorchbeast down in couple seconds sounds like heaven
---
good to know
---
Makes a lot of sense. And it would not hurt anyone, if that was only for the exclusive outfit/etc. And a lower price.
---
I mean come on man. We need more people, more explosions to have fun. I'm frustrated future events or contents will be locked to being some washed up jerk off party to meet that non-pro ps4 and non-x xb1 standards
---
Not trying to act like a martyr, probably could have worded it better.
---
I mostly use a 1* bloodied handmade, have a few 3* combat rifles but I always use the handmade lol
---
Dude... you're like the epitome of a 15 year old on the internet
---
My explosive railway rifle is named "The Stapler"
---
thx for the suggestion.
---
Another game breaking bug lol
---
HOW? how i can do 14k exp if peoples go afk or left the match ? how?
---
I don‚Äôt think there can be a better railway rifle name than that
---
I like the cut of your jib.
---
Hilarious and original
---
Never understand the point of telling people you quit the game, do you expect Bethesda to change because one person logged off. They already got your money they could care less now. I will stop playing when it‚Äôs not fun for me but spinning up new characters makes it interesting for me.
---
Hope you move on to better prospects my friend!
---
Yeah I just contacted Xbox support and they just sent me to Bethesda
---
Viper, a two shot 50. Cal sniper
---
Boomstick, explosive levergat.
---
Scorchbitch, two shot .50 cal machine gun
---
Really? Amazing.
---
I've been playing on my friends worlds and I can dig it. They get to keep all my junk too. No hate from this non paying member.
---
I love the game, too.  400+ hours in.  But at some point you have to draw a line and stop supporting a shitty company that just keeps getting shittier.  I haven't played in over a week, even though I was really looking forward to the Halloween event.   I'm watching and giving them a chance to unfuck what they've done, but if they don't, I'll ultimately be deleting the game.
---
Big fan of Scorchbitch
---
Same, I can‚Äôt get into outer worlds like I could fallout and Skyrim. It‚Äôs still a great game and I love it! It‚Äôs charm and humor is almost matching fallout new Vegas wits.... but it lacks the breath and grasp fallout or Skyrim had without the open world aspect, it feels too cramped honestly
---
I read a TIL recently about a beach boy member that dodged the draft. I thought, "I wonder why Bethesda picked a song by those commie bastards?".
---
Meh, it way haven't got a high end PC, waste of money when no games are made for the specs.
---
They can fix I believe and make it better, I had no lag being nuked in white springs with all the cars exploding at once. It was glorious! 
---
They should just make their servers more stable.
---
That's it!! That's the last straw with these game breaking bugs. 
---
**I'm done screw you guys I'm playing the Outer Worlds.**
---
*posts to the 76 market sub 5 minutes later*
---
I have an AA/FFR .50 cal I call My Precious. Gotta say it in Gollum‚Äôs voice
---
And ffs RDR2 launches in like two days man... Is this NDA you be talking about some new drugs or something?
---
This is what I do. You just go stand on top of one of the tall buildings and look at the ground make sure your part of the event and you get the rewards. Crash every single time I did the event unless I just sat there idle opening the pip boy made me crash as well. 
---
I know it‚Äôs lame to not be participating but there are plenty of people doing it.
---
Gladis - the .44 revolver.
---
I do partake it in when online if the timing is right.
---
Sadly my rewards have been the same golf ranger outfits with the same pumpkins.
---
The first Fallout went from a time where D&amp;D/GURPS where THE shit, and the challenge was to not get bat-shit-crazy while designing the game and it's complexities that comes with.
---
Every new game, have it's challenge on it's unique way.
---
It may be for the monny, yes. But it's a good game. There's people employing it's skills, beliefs and dreams in making the thing come true.
---
So, while it is indeed a product, it is also an experience.
---
I think I'm getting a lot out of the subject... lemme check if the F76 servers are up again...
---
Hey there's two of us heh
---
Carry two handmade, both bloodied 1*, so they got HM0 &amp; HM1 : /
---
Just a bit too pragmatic with the system myself.
---
They could have easily had numerous events each month and a good Atomic Shop to fund the game over those months, but they didn‚Äôt and they haven‚Äôt. They‚Äôve been lazy cunts with this game and people supporting Fallout 1st need to die pronto.
---
You think I pay attention to the date of the launch for a game I'm already playing? That makes no sense. LOL
---
i name my weapons like ".308 SNIPER" so i know what ammo i need to have lol
---
Oh man you have no idea what they had to do to New Vegas to run it on consoles. The game could have been so much better. I'm just afraid we'll be forced to relive that nightmare again
---
What do you suggest then? I honestly try to see both sides but alot of people jump too far to one side and I'm intrested to see what you think about it.
---
By that rationale you can return any game for any reason after a patch you disagree with. Not how it works
---
How do you know what amount of XP you've made since the event started to know how much more you need to complete the event requirements?
---
I dont like mutants and scorches that accurately shoot pipe pistols from far outside the turret range.  Are they Golgo 13?
---
On the challenges screen mate
---
Is this sub finally turning against Bethesda and Fallout 76 as a game?
---
Yeah, the still top 20 gfx card even today... https://www.anandtech.com/show/9306/the-nvidia-geforce-gtx-980-ti-review
---
That‚Äôs literally so smart, I might do that now too for weapons that run out quick
---
Wow came out 15 years ago...
---
Well, i cant speak for you of course but i will be round for next fastnacht for sure. Its my favourite event so far. And if you cant find anything in the halloween-event to 'chase after' thats to bad. But to leave the game entirely over it is.. just a wee bit silly in my opinion.
---
And the servers need upkeep no matter how many players are playing on them. Just sayin'
---
Did you praise your own post or did you forget to switch accounts LMAO
---
No, the titan is the 1k$ gfx card that everyone compared all gfx cards to for nearly 4 years, and still in the top 20 most powerful gfx cards on the market, and out performs most modern gfx cards aside from its modern day TITAN X and TITAN Z.
---
It has more VRAM than this game requires RAM in total. LOL
---
I praised myself on how awesome I am
---
Fantastic stuff. I will always love the lore of fallout. No matter how badly they try to butcher it.
---
To be fair, Wastelanders might just as well be their biggest one ever if the update really was meant to turn the game around, and if it is seriously worked on by a sizeable team for about a year. Far Harbor is a good DLC, but it is still quite a bit smaller than the Fallout 4 base game itself.
---
I spent an hour or so perfectly sorting my stash.  I‚Äôd suggest doing this at one spot where you can login quickly and deal with this with each character.
---
My last camp was under the train trellis near Harper's ferry, with only small land bridge to get there. A rocket turret, a spotlight, and two heavy turrets all with crossing fields of fire, and yet daily I would come back to destroyed crops and dead radtoad bodies.
---
Top 20? Good lord the delusion is real
---
It's not circle jerking. The fuckers won't fix it. They make it worse. Get your head straight.
---

---
On the scale of things that's way more convenience and less "pay to win" than the scrapbox, since everyone can still do that but at a risk and the space will sooner or later end, while the scrapbox is a paid advantage that non premium users can't achieve in any way. 
---
It makes more sense to monetise that instead of the scrap box.
---
Of course it is smaller than the base game
---
medic / explosive combat shotgun - ‚Äúcombat physician‚Äù due to how much it heals
---
instigating / power atk dmg combat knife - ‚Äúlast shadow‚Äù because I can one hit kill most non glowing / scorchbeast enemies from stealth.
---
There's not much PvP in the game as of now, only workshops really
---
But I would guess that with the automatic mod, which already fires really fast, 25% less vats cost and faster fire rate and 4x ammo, you could use vats to fire like crazy and the electricity arcs to their teammates
---
Wait for more opinions lol but that's how I'd see it, mostly though it depends how much PvP you do
---
Will it get used or sit in the stash box?
---
It would probably be good for like the whitespring too
---
Sad but true
---
Exactly what I did, tbh I had fun playing F76 but as a mere casual, yet  I don't want to support this greediness which keeps getting out of control. Hope they do NMS-like turnaround someday
---
No, just power armor chassis.
---
Yes, attack the player base for expecting things that should be in the final product rather than in a subscription model a year down the road. Enjoy getting screwed over by Bethesda. What they offer is not worth 13 a month or 100 a year.
---
It‚Äôs handy to have especially if you‚Äôre out numbered. That said I wouldn‚Äôt call it the best pvp weapon. A good ffr handmade will drop someone far quicker that the Tesla. If you can vats or free aim well (tho can be different if they use a SB) The cost of mine was far to great for what it does.
---
I srsly doubt it's top 20 bro. Maybe top 30 but that's only because makers were too lazy to come up with new lineups. Maybe it matches some budget gpus in performance but nothing more than that
---
Yeah I know what your talking about it‚Äôs ridiculous
---
It compares to modern flagship gfx cards like the 2080ti...

---
You can definitely use stealth vs the SBQ. It works very well. I‚Äôm personally not a fan of Gun Fu, I‚Äôd rather tab through mobs with my keyboard, but many like it.  
---
I don‚Äôt see Dodgy be good for any build that uses VATS/Crits. The 30 AP it costs each time you‚Äôre shot at is just too taxing.
---
I‚Äôll buy the shotgun if you‚Äôre on Xbox and interested in selling
---
Take a gander at his comment history lol
---
I can, on any except wood or scout.  No plans for those
---
It‚Äôs the fact that the game will be empty again after this Halloween event probably till Wastelanders. And right now, I‚Äôm willing to bet they are struggling with adding Wastelanders into the world without it breaking and if they do get it to work, it‚Äôll be severely lacklustre. Probably remove a lot of stuff.
---
But yeah, it‚Äôs a shame we don‚Äôt get decently large events every fortnight or so. Only reason I stuck around was to just grab some Halloween loot.
---
Right it's like they forget it's a game and people have lives we cant all farm that much caps
---
Its the closest category when they have anything regarding the atomic shop.  They said they‚Äôd ‚Äúlook into it, and care about feedback‚Äù yeah right. Those numbers were changed on purpose and nobody was told.
---
Very good! And how many months is that?
---
Supply and demand. If something is rare, people will pay more. Some people set prices not based on value but the fact people buy it anyways. I sell Asylum Hats for 300 caps. They aren't super rare and are easy to find in the Asylum, but people pay 300 at my machines for them.
---
Smells like broke in here
---
Todd... Is that you
---
when you forget to switch accounts.
---
Yea and that's fine and I all i do the same but after awhile it gets out of hand people continue to raise prices for it my issue is the greed mainly
---
Smells like nolife
---
W H A T
---
Yea they had a lot of problems but New Vagus was made for Xbox and ported to PC and PS3. The team was new to making console games which created the problems. The PS3 was their bigger nightmare though as it PlayStation is difficult to develope for.
---
The PC issues was created because their port was bad and needed fixing. You can research it yourself. PC is known to be just as bad to make games for to and in a lot of cases on almost as bad as PlayStation as there is no way to know what specs or software people are using. 
---
Look sorry but you need to give up on all games being better/running better on PC. Each game runs differently on different platforms, sometimes that makes PC #1 and sometimes consoles. Hell New Vegas run best and most smoothly on Xbox on lunch, biggest issue being the loading screens (and the bugs). I remember my friends on PC gave up on it and being jealous of me :P
---

---
Obviously, but I meant the combination of the current Fallout 76 and Far Harbor could still be a disappointment to someone who expects something close to a traditional "Fallout" experience with living NPCs and a large amount of dialogue content. Especially on a map as large as Appalachia. It would likely still feel empty if the new content was much less than Far Harbor.
---
But but it works perfectly.  
---
Yeah I hear you.  Never ever worked right.  The only thing I ever enjoyed was building camps.  Many many build bugs, storage bugs, and any other random bug out there made that even less enjoyable.  Then you had the mutants and other players destroying them.  Good times.
---
Well if you have the right perks you got unlimited pets/guards
---
I don't give them unique names, but I do prefix them all with "Dope" so they're all together in my inventory. Makes scrapping/selling everything else easier.
---
I suggest grown adult men on the internet stop engaging in ridiculous corporate tribalism over companies who do not even know you exist and do not care.
---
It‚Äôs embarrassing. 
---
Bethesda on the other hand should either 
---
a) provide a complete and quality product
---
b) go out of business
---
Id pay double the amount you pay. to get away from people like you
---
Wow, wasted my time reading this. Good for you buddy! Hopefully you leave this sub too while your at it.
---
Yeah, be honest, you were drinking last night huh lol.
---
I haven't played the game in months, they're obviously not going to fix it, these posts serve no purpose other than karma farming
---
OP is the definition of circle jerking, especially since he's still been playing it for this long
---
I have a bffr handmade, its evil, but my BE Laser Rifle is stronger in pvp, it kills faster than my handmade. So is the Tesla just hype?
---
Where you coming up with all these weird articles and videos? Don't people just go to Userbenchmarks for gpu  comparison purposes? What the hell?
---
His/her post history combined with him either praising himself or an alt account to talk to himself make me feel really bad for whoever this person is.
---
I've turned up the "half empty" and "half full" pumpkin racks. Have not read them so no idea what the difference between half empty and half full actually looks like...
---
Otherwise lots of pumpkin plans including the Vault Door, and more grim reaper cutouts than I know what to do with at the moment.
---
Really hoping for the Whitesping's Caddy Jumpsuit before the event ends
---
32nd best gfx card currently on the market:
---
https://i.imgur.com/w1MYKU1.png
---
Only ones ahead of it are well above 1k$+
---
Spotlights do seem to help, I agree, but they still don't match the distance that Super Mutants can reach with their Assault Rifles.
---
32nd best gfx card currently on the market from that site:
---
With the only ones beating it being 1k$+ for only minor speed increases.
---
What would you call your favorite power armor?
---
oof this guy has TDS
---
I might give this a try. My issues seem to be with dying.   
---
I can run the event most times well enough except for lag, but if I die the game crashes either as I am respawning or right before. Then when I try to load back into the server through a teammate, the load in takes longer than the event's timer and I miss out on the rewards.   
---
I was going to just sit in my power armor and hide, but avoiding the robots and just shooting at the legendary in the courtyard may be a better course since it will remove most of the threats (fucking Mr. Gutsies) and keep me in the event.   
---
Does anyone know If you have a costume on under your power armor and then remove your power armor right before the event ends, does it count towards wearing a costume?
---
Um... it seems budget gtx 2060 is performing better than your GTX 980TI aka TITAN sir
---
Same and I can barely do that.
---
Wow, I guess you can't criticize people for their political opinions anymore.
---
EDIT: OOF you post there too, that *totally* wasn't expected
---
I use a AAE laser for long distance which destroys, tho it has a nasty habit of making them immortal(qffr Tesla too). Until they fix that glitch I prefer my Jffr/JE handmades.
---
It's nice of you to leave the game but please leave this sub too. You crybabies just stick around for the karma.
---
This is the part I don't dig. They'll stand just out of range &amp; take pop shots while the turrets rotate helplessly. Occasionally though one will be foolish enough to rush &amp; catch about 5 missiles to the face &amp; I find that part pretty entertaining.
---
Near my camp it'll occasionally spawn mongrels, they must be fast enough to just get by detection, as every now &amp; then one will be chomping on a wall of my workshop &amp; a turret + spotlight right above it...would've figured they'd have activated and killed it before it got close...but doesn't happen.
---
Sledgehammer - Called Stop!Hammertime
---
ROFL, says the dude that thinks there are any GTX cards above the 980TI that are under 500$. You might want to check your userbenchmark site, there isn't.
---
I loved F04 and I love Fo76. 4 has a fun single player storyline, but for me I love the open world nature and settlement system, building is really one of my favorite things in Fo4 and 76 satisfies that itch for me, especially sharing those structures with others and also the vendor system is amazing. Crafting and scavenging is great in 76, and the mining feature makes things really interesting in terms of camp location. When it comes to storyline 76 actually has a ton of lore its just not force fed, you gotta work for it with holos and questing etc. The VATS system doesn't stop or slow time but I think its more realistic feeling and still works well. The perk system works like skillset loadouts, and you can set up ur character to meet your current needs on the fly, you just decide your limits with your perk point dispersement. My favorite part of 76 is the online nature, being able to quest with friends, practically do whatever you want. Build a cool base, do some good ol run and gun, sneak missions, launch nukes with friends, sell items like a legit store roleplay, the battle royale is really fun too! Buy this game!! Lol highly recommended over here friend :)
---
I just followed the marker personally
---
how can you say refunds are harder to get when you've never asked for a refund? what are you even talking about? my friend on his 8th refund always had a reason why he didnt like something, like the picket fence not snapping or whatever. its VERY easy to get a refund and you SHOULD ask for a refund if the cosmetic doesnt work as you expected it to, for ANY reason.

---
Could just go to your base or his, or anywhere else with no people around. I wouldnt drop anything around randoms that I didnt want them to take.
---
Why you limiting gpus to GTXs only? Because there are cheap AMD cards that are performing better and making your TITAN look bad? Also, there are GTXs under $500 that perform better. As I said, it's US dollars not Canadian

I think that I named my prenerf explosive shotgun the "DO NOT SCRAP THIS"

The explosive laser rifles are totally glitched.  I PvPd a player last night and died 5 times over.  The first two times I had my BE auto handmade.  Then switched to AAE auto handmade.  Then went to my Quad auto Tesla with FFR and held my own but still got ganked.
---
It‚Äôs a great White Springs weapon for farming that‚Äôs for sure!...lol
---
Because AMD cards can't push my super ultrawide resolution.
---
GTX cards are well known to be the best for ultrawide gaming: https://www.slant.co/topics/6660/~gpu-for-ultra-wide-monitor-gaming
---
I understood that reference!!!
---
LMAO 
---
Player 1: *What weapon did you use to kill that Scorchbeast that was destroying your camp?*
---
You: *It was just my DO NOT SCRAP THIS*
---
True since I know many play with 2 Xbox‚Äôs and have multiple accounts on each, so it‚Äôs a convenience for sure over anything else.
---
And what?
---
and not at all for others
---
Who gives a fuck? Isn't this about which GPU has more power? Who gives a damn about your monitors? Just how many fallout players play on superwide anyways? I ain't here to advise you on your next GPU shopping
---
Me and my brother do this too.  Stims, rads, other chems 6 to 12 caps each water. Water at 4.  How bout anyone else?
---
Understandable. I had probably a thousand hours in the game, played since launch, 4 characters at 70+, one at ~260, massive inventory of random equipment on a mule account.
---
I'd probably still be playing (and buying atoms) if I felt like Bethesda actually cared about the game. It became dramatically clear that their highest priority (by far) was money. The number of bugs that have been "fixed" multiple times (and yet never fixed), the never ending cycle of new bugs arriving as old ones get resolved, the lackluster new content... 
---
The only saving grace IS the multiplayer aspect, but after so many hours of gameplay, you've literally done everything so many times that without new content, new mechanics, something, it all gets old. 
---
But what really killed it for me was realizing how little Bethesda actually cares about the game. Bugs that have been there since launch. Bugs that were added with updates, still sitting around. New content, massively broken. But heaven forbid there's any chance of exploiting Atoms/Shop Items- those almost always are hotfixed immediately or patched in the very next patch. The priorities are clear, and so I moved on back in July. Only reason I'm "here" is because I didn't unsub on reddit and posts pop up in my feed every now and then.
---
Hop around and you might find a spawn that's relatively useful for the trouble it causes.  I found a killer spot in the Cranberry bog right next to a tick spawn(good for healing items), a marked location with a magazine spawn, and the power station where a Deathclaw spawns.  Just a short sprint away is the Ranger's Office with another magazine spawn, multiple Ranger outfit and headgear spawns, and a motherlode of wood.
---
It only occasionally gets attacked by Super Mutants and Mr. Gutsys from the southeast.  The ticks, however, spawn reliably whenever somebody else pops through.  They make maintaining crops a pain, but can't do much about other structures or walls before they're taken out by a couple of turrets.
---
In fact, set up in most areas long enough and you'll probably start making a list of the consistent benefits provided by the location.
---
Almost always happens when I die overencumbered.
---
When you hit something blood gets on it making it look epic
---
I disagree, the build you linked lacks reduced carryweight for ammo (if needed) and has 7 int which isnt needed for anything, gunsmith is pretty moot for semi auto weapons overall, its cheap and easy repairs :) Demo4 would serve you better overall, for example. or 8 int with nerd rage + demo 5. 
---
You absolutely do not want to run tenderizer 3 ever. It is 2% damage for 2 special points, you'll gain more of a DPS boost with 15 PER and Concentrated Fire due to the increased VATS Accuracy and the 0.3% increase in damage from concentrated fire 3, resulting in an overall more accurate and higher performance ;)
---
Radicool and tenderizer both works as alternatives for CHR, i usually pop fireproof if i somehow don't have dense in the chest, depending on what im doing, i always swap it in for fast traveling aswell. the +5STR is lovely.
---
Swap in adrenaline 3 at the day instead of adrenaline 1 + mister sandman overall for a better performance. The reason i dont have adrenaline 5 is due to the high damage per hit that rifles do with the additional sneak bonus, You wont need that additional damage on anything but the SBQ, and even then it's a smooth overall performance for everything :)
---
for an energy rifle version, replace 1 STR with 1 INT for nerd rage3 + batteries included 3 and its viable for the gauss rifle aswell :) Plasma flamer as offhand recommended due to the insane boost
---
Better fire up lib prime with all this communism stuff floating around
---
I always just charge half of what the game recommends I charge
---
I do play heavy weapons and again, it's not hard. People will pay for random outfits weapons etc and then go buy ammo. I've done this for months and have amassed a good deal of ammo and caps. Dude look at the Halloween event. People will buy your outfits for thousands. Go buy some ammo on reddit or discord.
---
Is there a known place we should drop?  Is it trash cans at stations?
---
I dont think you can buy anything for a game from one region and an account on another. It has to be all EU or all US. You can share dlc between accounts but it has to be bought from the origin Countries store. F76 doesnt have shareable dlc as its tied to your bethesda account.
---
ROFL, you are trying to claim you need a gfx card that is over 400$ to play this game and not crash. You don't even realize I've been drawing you out to see how stupid the shit you'd say was to defend this dumpster fire.
---
You've now claimed you need a gfx card in the top 20 of currently available cards to play this game, that shows what shit coding this game has and how bad they are at coding efficiently.
---
I mean look at kingdom come: deliverence at max setting, it is built on the cryengine for gods sake and blows the graphics of this game out of the water. Same with GTA V even in multiplayer. LOL
---
I'm giving you good advice that I know works for cap farming made easy. Not trying to argue. Just take the advice and use it to your advantage. Everything sells. Just post it on reddit or discord.
---
Caps are basically worthless now since so many people have 5 characters max capped. Most people dont even want caps for the good stuff. Its god rolls or 10k+ rounds of ammo. Ammo has now replaced caps in this free market.
---
High levels being kind to new players? That‚Äôs a surprise. All i see from the media is people torturing FO 1st players, which was intimidating and nearly drove me away from wanting the game.
---
If you use BE weapons you need to run Gunsmith (minimally 2) or you gun will break mid-SBQ fight.  Not to mention you craft better items and get more Experience
---
Ammo carry capacity isn‚Äôt necessary at all.  Carry 2K rounds, no big deal.  I have one character who I put all my extra ammo on. With five pieces of unyielding, deep pockets, and a high capacity pack when necessary, I have ZERO issues carrying anything. I think I can carry 460 lbs or something like that. 
---
Fireproof is pretty much a waste on a Rifleman. If you‚Äôre blowing yourself up with a semi-auto, then a player mod is necessary. 
---
I think you need to research how Tenderizer works.  https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a80jf8/tenderizer_is_better_than_you_think/?utm_source=amp&amp;utm_medium=&amp;utm_content=post_body
---
Sand Man is a fine perk if you are willing to micromanage between day and night builds. 
---
Demolition gives you 4% (20% x 20%) more damage for the first point, and 2% after that. So the damage per point is pretty bad. Not to mention, I one shot everything already. Plus sometimes I switch to a B25 Fixer or Handmade depending on the mob and the Explosive resists. 
---
Oh well, I could go on, but I have a party I need to get to. Overall I was complimenting your build, evidently you didn‚Äôt take it that way.
---
They already have my money, why wouldn't I hope that they can make it better?
---
Well......... Bye.
---
Damn, thought a Bloodied Gauss or Pipe Bolt (abused with both rifle and pistol perks) would be the best. 
---
Tried that on yet?
---
I know there‚Äôs one planet we never visit in game so far, so I figure one DLC will take us there. I assume a second would add an explorable moon or space station for the other gas giant. I‚Äôm excited to see where else DLC/Expansions will take us
---
There is. My BE Dragon can critical Head shot it, and so can my Quad Assaultron Critical head shot. 1 hit kills if you know what you are doing.
---
Idrc about FO 1st. I just want to play a game i will enjoy
---
No one will agree with you or read what you wrote, I wouldn't even bother mate. I agree with you however, a pretty idea.
---
Now all you need is a third one to call Jr.
---
Agree. I'm right in the middle of the bog, there are no enemies set to spawn near enough to attack my camp. The only enemies I get attacking are wandering Scorchbeasts and what seem like generated attack spawns because the enemies aren't from any neighbouring locations. Constant attacks sounds like a major pain
---
Na not yet been meaning to, especially with sneak 
---
Yeah harpoons are very underrated, I always run them. My QE is perfect for west two runs and any place with semi thought enemies, destroys them
---
Cool. I'm wondering if I'm doing something wrong with my Bloodied Dragon since it deals way less damage than the card says even if I'm firing at point blank
---
Here‚Äôs a video. 
---
https://youtu.be/g1Ry2hEBAsU
---
I was just thinking about that the other day, but I'd imagine it'd have to be an incredibly awkward and inconvenient weapon, which I probably wouldn't keep anyway, making naming it a moot point.
---
You should be able to on an EU account. Or get a US version game. Ive had games from asia any addons had to be bought from that regions store. I could use those addons on my US account but since its a virtual currency with atoms thats not transferable among accounts. So if you want atoms you have to play your EU game on an EU psn account.
---
There are ~13 around the pumpkin house and then like 30 on the other side of the road where the daily marker shows you to go
---
How much damage are you hitting in the stats? Mine is around 2100, then a critical causes more damage plus the head shot multiplier.
---
Damn. I had one of those and couldn‚Äôt find a way to perk up enough. Clearly i was doing something wrong. Anyway I sold it.
---
Different strokes. I absolutely hated FO4. I mean I think its one of the worst RPGs to come out in recent times but still enjoyed FO76 for a few months.
---
Really? I still see decent numbers of people on the servers and I play on PS4, which has the least amount of players.
---
Wait on Fallout 76 or Xbox live?
---
Not dead. Not too late. I say it‚Äôs a good time to join actually!
---
And what about all of my equipment and character do I need to start new one ?
---
Again, that's by definition *sunk cost fallacy* \- The feeling that your time invested will somehow be a waste if you quit now. Also you pulled a line straight out of the addict's handbook "I can stop anytime". That's the dead giveaway that you're definitely stuck, and the hooks are in deep. 
---
Like I said before, there's nothing necessarily wrong with this, we've all experienced the same thing. But I think it's important to recognize it.
---
As someone else aptly put it, time enjoyed is not wasted, but continuing to pour time into something you only kind of enjoy, because walking away triggers that sunk cost fallacy... That's a dangerous territory.
---
Entertainment is not an investment. It all fades away eventually. That's part of why I mix video games with other hobbies. Sadly video games by comparison provide little to no lasting reward for the time invested, and that's okay. As long as you realize that's what's happening.
---
t-51 is the best outside of a nuke zone. Inside a nuke zone, X-01 is probably the best option but if ballistic is your primary concern, Ultracite is a better combo of rad and ballistic than X-01. Ultra mods are hard to get tho unless you run a lot of queens. X-01s you can just buy the plans.
---
On xbox
---
I literally just got it. Goddamn it.
---
If you have a QE harpoon with fletchette mod and get unlimited ammo, how would one go about easily replicating this  breaking glitch. Asking for a friend of a friend
---
Well I know we didnt get to go to either of the gas giants, one of which is said to have a refinery. Theres also hephaestus, which is probably the most likely, and lastly typhon which is on the edge of the system.
---
Would a quad cryolator be worth anything?
---
Here is [info from the Dataminer AMA](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dhco2s/master_thread_for_the_dataminer_ama_oct_13th/f3nk4pg/) with locations and chances.
---
Ultracite Bloodied explosive Gauss Rifle fully charged with critical headshot and meds
---
How much for a WOW private server?
---
I remember reading an interview sometime ago where one of the developers said specifically that OW was going to be smaller scale. But I certainly don't keep up with all gaming news so I dont expect everyone to know everything ahead of time. 
---
Dragon Age II was definitely one of those let downs where I expected more than I got. At least with OW I expected a smaller game, I definitely understand where you're coming from though.
---
Weird I'm playing Apex rn I could message you to see if I can join your game
---
I can usually take down a lvl 50 with my tse combat shotgun in 2 shots, right to the head.
---
This is the perfect way to put it. It's exactly akin to gambling. Walking away after a $100.00 loss is way better than trying to earn it back and losing $500.00 in the process. Sometimes you cut the loss and walk away, otherwise you get trapped.
---
Video game design has begun to mirror this philosophy to a "T".
---
I agree there should be balance, I don't think either side should be taken advantage of. I hope you have a good day too, all the best.
---
What about a Power Fist? He‚Äôs normally the punch line
---
Well you wouldn‚Äôt need to get 1st when you buy the game. And I think those are isolated instances lol. Plus you can avoid PVP by just not firing back. Media likes to be dramatic.
---
I like Mr Fluffy.
---
Haven't been on the game in a while so I can't remember some others off the top of my head, but two I can definitely remember are:
---
Two-Shot Gatling Gun named Ye Olde Reliable
---
Bonus Scorched Damage Ultracite Gatling Laser (has some other effects I can't remember) named The Fly Swatter. As you could imagine, this is my Scorchbeast killer of choice.
---
I also had a Combat Shotgun at some point with a lot of VATS related effects that I named Legal Aimbot
---
Monarch is the moon of one of the gas giants, so we sorta went to one, but yes I‚Äôd love to see one of the mining rigs!!
---
Yep. I bought a BFFR Gauss and that gun rocks.
---
Dang! Wish I would've seen you. I was shopping around for an explosive handmade for hours.
---
If you liked the combat of FO4 and wished you could show off your settlements(albeit on a smaller scale) to your friends, definitely.
---
The player community is extremely nice to newbies and will help you get off to a good start.
---
Detractors have been saying the game would be dead in a month since launch.  While it occasionally has some optimization issues, like the most recent event in a highly-populated area with lots of explosions,  it's absolutely playable.  I'm on the PC and my game has not even crashed once every two months.  Unfortunately, the haters come with playing the game.  They'll band together and insult and downvote you if you say anything positive about the game.  They'll spam subreddits like this with negativity and vitriol aimed at Bethesda and their customers.  I even avoid speaking about the game IRL because at least half my experiences just end with people who have never played the game repeating what they'd read online about how awful it is.
---
If you can ignore all that, you'll probably have fun.
---
I‚Äôve got some alright names across four characters
---
The Old Fashioned = Gatling gun
---
Live Damn You = vampire shotgun
---
Feelin‚Äô Lucky = .44
---
Cunty = power fist (Silicon Valley show reference, but it works on other levels)
---
My sniper is named Dwayne Schrute, great grandson of Dwight.  His weapons are:
---
America = lever gun
---
Night Time = Fixer
---
Irrigation = combat knife
---
Equip the gun in your favourite wheel, keep an eye on its condition bar and when you know it's going to break in the next few shots; literally as soon as it disappears from your hands, re equip it using your favourites wheel, if done fast enough, bam you're now using a broken weapon forever until you change guns.
---
Works almost every single time on Xbox, I've found it easier to replicate on my high level account because he has more stuff in his inventory so I think that increases the small window of re equip time.
---
Usually I wouldn't share bugs like this but it's been in game for over a year, that's not a bug, that's a feature.
---
Zero issues for me, done it twice since they started allowing it
---
THIS, THIS RIGHT HERE IS SOME GOOD WEAPON LORE MY FRIEND
---
Not the most radioactive isotope in the reactor are we..
---
Level 3 fire proof also does that. Practically no damage.
---
I love how much it triggers you.
---
Not if you never pay any more
---
Glad I could contribute!
---
They just needed better building rules. I loved building a camp, I just wanted to add it over a long period of time and make it defendable and lived in. Like it belonged in the world. I think they should have made turrets really expensive in terms of resources but have them be incredibly kick ass.
---
Thanks for the compliment, kind internet stranger.
---
I doubt all the people saying it's expensive are unemployed nor can't afford it. I think its that it more than there willing to pay or they are against the idea of a mmo style subscription in a non mmo.
---
That being said, its good you're enjoying the game :) dispute the hate it gets, its not too bad
---
Can‚Äôt decide if I like Dwayne Schrute or Cunty more haha
---
Swap you for the dozen shitty hunters missile launchers the bitch constantly gives me
---
Well then that's it the suits gives you fireproof lv3 for free . Totally makes sense. Best suit in game then !
---
Okay with Fallout 1st
---
1) Dedicated always on servers not reliant on the presence of the owner 
---
2) options (even as basic as actually being able to have private sessions that people can‚Äôt just join) 
---
3) separation of private and public servers so the benefits of a private server cannot be carried over to the public ones. 
---
The pricing is in line with competitors, but typical Bethesda, the quality of service is not.
---
Bloodied explosive poon
---
Seems like something so incredibly easy to patch; "if condition &lt; 1%, Unequip item", but it's Bethesda we're talking about here.
---
Other opinions? What the fuck, how dare OP have an opinion!
---
Awesome. Thanks for link.
---
I have the opposite. I'm now in the US but my account is UK. I can't change the country of the profile and I can't attach a credit card to the account because the billing address doesn't match the profile. 
---
I have to purchase UK psn cards through 3rd party website to use on the account. Idk if you can do the reverse. Find a 3rd party website to buy US psn cards to use in the UK.
---
SWTOR is $15/mo, gives you $5 worth of cosmetic money, boosters and cargo space worth millions of credits/tens of dollars, permanently unlocks all DLC even if you drop subscription, and lets you acquire high tier gear from the ~10 raids which take 8-16 players, have multiple difficulties and loot options for raid leaders, and take 2-5 hours to complete. 8 full class stories, All DLCs like Hutt Cartel, Shadow of Revan, the two Knights expansions that revamp the game, and the new onslaught DLC. My main tank and healer have ~30 real-life days of game time and my other 6 characters have around a week. Throw in all the dungeons and easy groupfinding queue for heroic missions on the ~20 planets, flash points, raids etc. it‚Äôs a marvel why people wouldn‚Äôt play a game like that, WoW, ESO or something with thousands of hours of content over 76.
---
I did the same thing, until I was playing with people smarter than me that pointed it out.
---
Perhaps not everyone lives in the States?  There are far more people on the planet, you know.
---
They gave us blue power armor
---
I had a quad harpoon (\* so it was scraped) but a quad AA Explosive harpoon gun would be interesting.
---
I love it when people run ahead and start blasting cars before the Pyres are lit giving us no credit for them. /s
---
So dramatic. I‚Äôm sure Bethesda‚Äôs feelings are so hurt rn.
---
At launch I had uninstalled and refunded because I thought that's how the game would always be. I just picked it up last month and have to say I'm loving it. 
---
It is pretty unique as an mmo and the game play loop is actually fun. When not in a team enemies are perfectly matched. (At least until you have a combat focused build lol.)
---
Overall it's a good rpg and it is made better with the people in it. It's cool exploring other people's bases.
---
Cons: 
---
sometimes the objectives will not load in and you have to re_load. (Super annoying)
---
Sometimes you have to re_load if people of a much higher level came through first (newer characters only)
---
Pros: 
---
The game play loop, the community, the exploration, the building, the bugs are hilarious when not the cons.
---
is the harpoon mag fed (like double barrel) or is it single reload (lever)?
---
i used to run one but never lucked into a quad
---
Have you tried the outer worlds? I‚Äôm enjoying it so far. Wish obsidian would make fallout 5. New vegas was the best!
---
Hopefully this link works (if not, I'll try to send it elsewhere). It's by no means a perfect build; I have a lot of cards that aren't combat related, but it works well. It's largely a power armour focused build also; I have a Gatling Plasma called "Bloodsucker" as it has the Vampire's effect which works well on lesser enemies.

I‚Äôm a solo guy, and not dumb by any means (IMHO), but sometimes the simplest things slip right by you.
---
"Do you want raiders?  Because that's how you get raiders."
---
Only holds one harpoon so like the lever but it happens once
---
If you're asking about the quad it's a single load for all 4
---
Thanks I'm pretty good at guitar too.
---
Google is your friend.
---
just to make sure im reading you properly, you load the 1 harpoon and it fills up all 4?
---
Yeah with the quad it does 
---
This is what in saying QE harpoon are so strong, does 1800 damage as well
---
See you when the dlc comes out. I got a list of accounts to watch for incase they post anything indicating they came back.
---
Lol, still the Atom Shop should be filled with Enclave, BoS, and nuka cola items among others. It's been easy to farm atoms because there isn't anything worth spending them on.
---
Orange paint for my turrets no thanks.
---
However Black paint with a scull design ok here's my credit card number. Or even Jack-OLantern on orange paint. Seriously a missed opportunity.
---
I swear they don't know what we want.
---
badass, maybe its time to resurrect my heavy gun then.  thanks for your time
---
The problem is if I buy in my US account I don‚Äôt know if it will register the atoms or the fallout 1st subscription  to my EU disc and the account
---
Ah okay. Thank you! Hopefully it doesn't take long aha.  :)
---
Yep, PS4. Travaro4 let me know what you're asking.
---
Its a world where i can have the people i actually wanna play with in it. Plus we can farm and not have to worry about the things we want being gone already. F:NV is my favorite fallout so of course also for the outfit and im a huge mothman fan so the emote was a must have.
---
Same thing happened to me last night but I was lucky because I closed the game and reopened it and they were there.
---
No problem for me either. However, you can only do that once every 3 month so chose wisely.
---
Yes!  [https://imgur.com/LjV7scI](https://imgur.com/LjV7scI)
---
Got my Bloodied Explosive VATS Lever whom I hold dear. Also may of named her ‚ÄúThe JFK Experience‚Äù
---
Often times, if you find the exact spot enemies spawn, you can place an object there and remove the spawn.
---
Worked fine for me both times I did.
---
Does this include the helmet, Or just the outfit?
---
Which still doesn't add up.
---
The Tricentennial Edition would've launched around $120 AUD.
---
Fallout 1st is $144 yearly or $14.95/month in Australia.
---
$14.95 across twelve months is $179.40.
---
Last I checked, $120 isn't $179.40 *or* $144 so their comment falls flat because it's bullshit.
---
There's actually giving the game the shit it deserves and then there's lying to create bullshit outrage.
---
They chose to do the second.
---
Hell yeah, dude! I‚Äôm gonna see what I can do with this tonight when I play, seriously thank you so much!
---
you were still saying jester, just with a severe speech impediment.
---
Love the name, the look, and that beautiful 3 stars above!
---
although raiders are bad, they would make fo76 a lot more fun
---
Capture a workshop for unlock, then leave before someone imitates pvp!
---
&gt; I do not suspect any of our users would do this
---
Then you're out of your goddamn mind and need to have a long stay in a mental health facility.
---
I'm in the mire, just south of Robco. I regularly get spawns there, but last time I played I had three legendary scorchbeasts attacking. They leveled my camp. Luckily they didn't destroy my shower.
---
Touch√©
---
I mean hey, if the boot fits haha
---
Doubtful.
---
i bought fo1st, you can have unlimited scrap and a world to yourself, farm anything you'd like without having to worry about weight limit, because your fast travel tent will save you
---
If u like constantly crashing. Comstant bugs and lagging . I would say go for it lol. I have 500 mbps and a direct line and I live less than a mile away from where my service comes from and I still  had all those problems on a daily. Speaking from a guy who put up with all of that for 4 5 months it eventually just becomes unbearable.  Like I said in an earlier post we have too many good games coming out Death Stranding, and FF7 Remake, Last of Us 2, Cyberpunk, Avengers, Halo, Gears Of War Outer Worlds. Dont waste ur time with a company that doesn't give a rats ass about their fans real shit.
---
You could've bought a new copy and returned it with your old, full price, receipt.
---
Sunk cost fallacy..
---
It was a tough one:) you certainly aren't dumb if you were able to figure it out on your own.
---
I mean, i only realized a few days ago Biv E. Ridge is a play on "beverage". So, dont feel too bad that it only took you like a few days to realize "jester" lol
---
Yup, or even a similar glitch where the only respawn is the opposite side of the map that'll cost 80 caps, double that if I want to come back for my junk!
---
Ah, nice one. I don‚Äôt do those quests so I didn‚Äôt know about that one.
---
I‚Äôm on console so the cheating is stupid rare,  it‚Äôs mostly gear nonsense that kills the fun of adventure pvp for me skill death doesn‚Äôt bother me.
---
You are too kind. Thank you.
---
The nukashine questline isnt too bad, considering you meet one of the best npcs in the game so far. Unlocking the brewcrafting workbench is alright, but outsode of Biv's daily quests, i dont really use it. Probably perfect for a character build designed around alcohol tho.
---
The optimistic pumpkin rack and the pessimistic pumpkin rack.
---
There is a video in the same thread.
---
I built my house from the crap she gave me before lol
---
Yeah may I refer to the part when I said they must've been glitched
---
When I visit someone‚Äôs vending, I take a quick look around (clicking VATS) to identify any lurking enemies before I leave. If they‚Äôre there, I eliminate them, then head off to the next vendor. Is just being neat and polite.

20 Days after launch, game was offered for FREE with a refurbished controller.

Every match I played I was auto aimed, could barely level up thanks to cheaters, no matter what traps I set up or where I was hidden I got one shot killed with full hp/damage resist chems active while using the marine armour set, plus seen a player super jump over a building in two jumps,

It happens because sometimes when you die, your character ends up in Fallout heaven with Godd Howard and he'll be so starstruck he doesn't want to respawn.

Actually I'm being a little unfair,  she has just given me in the past few minutes an exterminators broadsider so the equilibrium of the universe is restored...as soon as I pull my foot out of the fucking TV screen.

I spent a solid three weeks picking up every single piece of junk I could find in and around the WS area every time  I logged in so I can sell em all to the robots along with any weapons and drugs I picked up along the way. Built myself up to 22,000 caps and purchased a serum plan to keep the caps flowing steadily. I sell all consumables for pretty cheap (everything is well under 100 caps), with serums being the only thing expensive at 350 a piece.
---
All ammo is set to the lowest possible at 1 cap per round. The only thing I sell expensive are weapons and armor, especially bloodied weapons as that shit goes quick and for a whole lotta caps. I don't have any mule accounts so 25k remains as my maximum and I like to keep my balance around 20k. Prices go up when I'm low on caps and back down when I'm close to the max and low on available stash space.
---
I worked hard for that initial batch of caps selling all that junk so now I need to make sure I stay on top when deals come around from other players for plans or weapons.
---
The wow sub comes with an entire RPG where you play to get the loot, instead of buying it. Imagine, that.
---
I'm quite a fan of watching them shoot endlessly at my camp from a mile away, makes me wonder what the fuck did my camp do to them.
---
Yes, it is. That being said, its extremely frowned upon by anyone who actaully wants a good, skill based pvp. It literally takes no work or thought to make a build that can utilize this gun. All you need is all 3 ranks of commando, a cheap set of vanguard armor, marsupial and bird bones mutations, and a bunch of stealthboys. Its the cheapest excuse for pvp, and most people will do 1 of 2 things. Either pull out a qffr tesla and fight back or. Or block you and walk away. If you want my advice, dont be that guy.
---
I imagine it has something to do with the event locking you to the events respawning point only, but then when it ends none of the respawning points show up because you were technically supposed to respawn at the event, which is now gone itself.
---
Always happy to help!
---
Survival needs to come back, full damage to turrets without needing to agro them, damage to doors and other specific structures should be unrestricted and the kill leaderbored should return.
---
Add more incentives as well like xp multiplyers and loot modifiers to make claiming the top spot competitive.
---
Your day will come just like mine. I pulled ghoul slayers crap then all the sudden the bffr on the last pull lol
---
maybe do some research before you spout such ridiculous nonsense. OR maybe read the thread because folks have stated in several different places that Fallout 1st for consoles is not a month to month subscription, it's a pre-pay service, so there is no "auto-renewal" to cancel.  
---
If people like you would think before you speak instead of making bullshit up on the spot, folks wouldn't be afraid to give new games a chance. Then again, if folks stopped doing that, your favorite thieving scumbag youtuber would be broke and penniless because there isn't a single original thought in their heads....

I named my handmade N.Y.Q.U.I.L. because it helps enemies get their Z's. It was a spur-of-the-moment decision, but i stuck with it.

Thursday i found a bloodied handmade, so now i have Bloodied N.Y.Q.U.I.L. .  
---
I still need to figure out what N.Y.Q.U.I.L. stands for, though.
---
Eh, I think that will lead to unintended consequences where players will use their CAMP to despawn certain enemies preventing other players from killing them

I was so hyped when that update came out and it was great but I never noticed this...

Buy them for him if you are yelling at them for not trying the others out then. Otherwise shut your mouth if your not gonna give em a free copy.

They all must've been glitched? Nah armor must be glitched. Still for the time being it protects against scorch blast. Does what op says. Doesn't mean it'll stay that way

Set up missile turrets.

It could be that doing it on launch day and only then didn't count? Or is this an alternative character? As you have to do it once per character!
---
I was in the mood to buy some atoms for that Halloween vendor machine. Couldn't beat that price for 1600 atoms. I didn't really care about the extra stuff.
---
Yes.  
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/drPCCTJ](https://imgur.com/a/drPCCTJ)
---
Missle turrets are what you need.
---
Honestly, it was a ton of atoms for less than if pay for them anyway. The rest was just icing. Private servers are great for farming certain shit, tents are fab and so is the scrap box. That said I wouldn‚Äôt feel salty if the latter two were rolled out for everyone. I love the game and know that they need money to keep it rolling. 
---
I also have enough experience working on large technology projects to know that what you commit to and what you can actually deliver aren‚Äôt always the same, so I‚Äôm not screaming blue murder about broken promises like some fucking 15 year old baby.
---
Okay sure bud, I must be the only one that it doesnt work for sure. Lmfao you haven't even tried the armor yet, yet you're blindly following this guy lol
---
I only have one character. Either they changed the rules or I do have it unlocked but made some kind of mistake.
---
I would love to get a not in game plan. So deliciously rare. Alas I don't think the dev room raiders did so well on PS4.
---
I dont notice it when i place one down at every workshop i take over.
---
Don't forget you also have to pay for WoW before you can even sub to it, so... And 1st isn't mandatory. So it's a bit different.
---
Well give that a try, if not either I was wrong or your starting character is bugged, my first can't complete a few quests/challenges/achievements due to existing during the beta!
---
Lemme guess they get to the point where your just selling them dont they?
---
This is quite funny, to be honest, you're so arrogant and pleased with your total pig ignorance, that the more you respond the more foolish you become.
---
It wouldn't. This dude's just one of those anti-bethesda tin foil hat freaks that's got one too many screws loose...   
---
But what would I know, I don't pay attention to these psychos. I buy a game, and if I don't like it, I sell it to someone else that might. Looking at reviews about games is a waste of time. The chances that you and said reviewer will share the same opinion are infinitesimally microscopic, as almost all reviewers now are paid in some form to bomb a game's rep, and the ones that aren't being paid generally have some nasty ulterior motive or another.  
---
If you're afraid to try new things, then your horizons are going to stay narrow. I don't know about you, but that sounds like a boring and bland as hell way to live.
---
That tangeant aside, I cancel auto renewals all the time on console, just because paying month to month rather than letting subs sit there and auto-withdraw simplifies balancing my bank account, I've never once been banned. Not on Xbox, Not on Playstation. If They banned people simply for canceling, then I would have experienced SOMETHING in the last 15 years lmao. Fraudulent chargebacks on the other hand, well, if you're attempting something asinine like that, then you deserve to get banned, if not get your ass thrown in jail just saying xD

I too enjoy Fallout76, but saying you couldn't enjoy Fallout NV and the others... you're an odd one
---
I used to leave mine in the overseer's camp, but then i realized if i had been given a bunch of them early in the game, some of the fun would have been sucked out, so i quit doing it. I love finding a plan for a cool thing i don't have yet, even if it's in a vendor and i have to pay for it. Then again, it's also fun to share. XD

I just put a "." and a descriptive name so they sort to the top of my inventory.

I've recently found a static scorched Mirelurk queen spawn in the Mire. Would be great if it wasn't down the hill from my camp. Discovered it after a few days of being there. I know why my crops and generator are often broken while I'm away now.

So yeah I'll be moving after the Halloween event.
---
You can wear a mask with power armor and no helmet and it still counts.

Duly noted, thanks!

By make I mean by selling things.
---
Come on, is there going to be a big dramatic reinstall when you come back? See you in the Wasteland. Lol
---
I require that weapon
---
Ah
---
op I agree with you for the most part. The game was marketed in an ODD way but I believe it was due to the legality of "fallout online" already existing and also trying to tie it in to the lore in a way that left room for later single player installments. It's 72% a different game from 4 so it's Fallout 76? I dunno but I still feel like they could of presented it as a DLC Mode to 4 that was also standalone playable and it would have gotten a lot less flak. That would have been funky as hell to sell though so I'm satisfied with what I got. I just hope they bring back PvP mode or areas soon with better rewards.
---
"be better be best!"
---
you trippin
---
It's weird too because my base is near a spawn area, it's usually just outside of it to be fine for hours but every now and then it'll aggro the area.  The annoying bit is the camp is either spawned by the mole people, scorched, or super mutants, so like you said, if it's the latter they just stand ages away in the woods and plink at my base while missile turrets do nothing.    
---
Also out of nowhere I randomly get mutant dogs and mole rats that spawn (like literally once every few days) and they'll plink at a corner of the base that I can't seem to get turrets to defend and destroy a wall and get inside.
---
If I buy a month of fallout 1st, and it expires later do I get to keep the outfits??
---
I needed some Atoms for a Halloween bundle and it was cheaper than buying the Atoms on their own. Halloween is my aesthetic in game and real life, so... I signed up for a month, and i got to satisfy my curiosity about the private sessions on top of it.

I wonder, would you be willing to check what effect Endurance has on sprint cost and if the effect maxes out ? 
---
I have a feeling it won't work like in Fallout 4 where 21 Endurance gave unlimited sprint, but wondering if we can at least get close to that.
---
if everyone keeps being negative then they probably will.. That means more players and more sales. Lots of people will still be here and damn the market for in game sales will be on fire. I welcome it don't care. People like you won't matter then and you can go play anthem and no one cares.
---
I mean I'm missing 12 damage for what, like 100 er?
---
nah bro it's all tied to pizza gate and ancient aliens
---
I'd have to agree with you here.  I'm not going to avoid building somewhere because someday they "might" make it an actual zone.
---
I‚Äôm confused does grounded reduce damage from your own weapons?
---
L i enjoy my overspawned radstags
---
Yes it reduces you energy gun damage.
---
That would actually be super cool if you could build next to somebody (like maybe if they're on your friends list at least?)  or remove restrictions if it's a private server.  I'd love the idea that you could build houses next to each other where players live in a community together.
---
you mean a newb?
---
Yes you should. I like the game, no dull moments after you reach HL you have always something to do.
---
Your are building in your Camp, one guy launch a nuke and you go to fight SBQ. You meet people make friends. This game is very dynamic and rich.
---
Oh okay.
---
tefuq i cant even sell them for 50 caps after weeks

I‚Äôll be sure to let my friends friend know so he would never do that

How do I get the skin? It a weekly or what?

As much as I don‚Äôt like being *that* person, firing a 2shot fatman at a small wooden camp feels good.

This is a feature coming in fallout 2nd
---
You afforded the game which was $60-80. The problem isn't having the money. The problem is, nothing about this service is worth $100 a year on top of a box sale and cash shop.
---
Their icon is usually a simpler clue
---
Good for close distance pvp but useless for longer distance since the arches just dont go far. Explosive laser rifles are more versatile. Explosive gatling plasma or gatling laser is also good.
---
I confirm. No dense effect as I read recently on another sub.
---
I used to use max level one on my alt but lately I literally never see it happen, ever. So I dropped it. He uses a Quad Fixer.
---
Yessir I‚Äôm a heavy build so that‚Äôll be easy
---
I can afford it. My problem is, its a tone deaf, insult from Bethesda.
---
Must be exclusive to Fallout 1st.   
---
Kidding. :D
---
Nuclear winter rewards!
---
Usually I ignore this type of post because to many people whine, complain and seek attention. The fact that you decided to leave but do a mini event that impacted multiple players is pretty awesome. I think that you probably should have left your armor and weapon on the character though. You never know if you may come back one day because more content is available down the road and just needed a break. 
---
I‚Äôm thinking of taking a break until wastelanders. Two level 300s and it just feels like I‚Äôm doing the motions but not really enjoying the time as much. I think it‚Äôs because bethesda pushed back wastelanders but I‚Äôm glad that they did. It‚Äôs going to be a big release and I‚Äôm thinking it will be a good turning point in the game. Regardless, I‚Äôm glad that you did what you felt was worth it and hopefully you find a game that brings more enjoyment. Games should be less about complaining and more about enjoyment.
---
QE yes. Qffr a lil. Otherwise not much.
---
I don't need that, Godd is always by my side.
---
Yes.
---
Yes, the issue was fixed.
---
Needs more pumpkins. Right now it's like a small flagpole.
---
It‚Äôs an outfit and not armor. Why would it protect you?
---
You realize you just received your good weapon from purveyor's non-crap RNG pool allotment. You will now get medics harpoon guns for the remainder of the year.
---
Which is a lot like a doctor telling you, "Yes, I will cure your syphilis, but I must warn you. You'll never be able to catch it again."
---
It just works.
---
That's what I said so I decided to test it with video proof it was false.
---
Same. Honesty some chems and food items I end up collecting and not using(sometimes I use inert flux for clean water so...) like purified water I sell mad cheap to lighten the my encumbrance of my stash.
---
Glad you did a video then. To many people make to many rumors. Then the rest follow the crowd lol.
---
Get it now and lvl up so you‚Äôre not a noob when wastelanders hits.
---
Honest question: If you had a favorite donut place that you absolutely loved to visit, but they didn‚Äôt have jelly donuts, so every time you visited you requested they start carrying jelly donuts, would you be pissed off that when they started carrying them in the store they made you pay for that donut even though it was YOU who wanted them to start making them?
---
I use a Furious ffr laser Gatling and I run Grounded.
---
Honestly the 12% damage bonus is basically nothing on such a low base damage weapon, and that's even without all the perks that raise its damage. 60% with Heavy Gunners, 15 with Bloody Mess, 50 with Furious, some Anti Armor and limb damage with Stabilised and One Gun Army, 5 ranks of Adrenaline, and a few other things.
---
With Class Freak Grounded becomes basically a no downside mutation.
---
There are a lot of creative names here. I have gone with classic "stab happy" for my separated machete. It makes me so happy!
---
Also keep them for alts you create as well. Any good  Lvl 1 - 35 legendaries (armor/weapons) also should be kept for alts. Huuuge difference leveling up a new character with legendary gear.
---
Give 'em away if you don't plan on making alts.
---
I'm running all old school weapons (still working on finding a 3* Gatling, tho, just a 1* Instigator at the moment) and using Grounded is wonderful. I'm also Eagle Eyed, Speed Demon, Marsupial, and Herbivore, with Class Freak 3. It's amazing. This is what chemical enhancement is supposed to be like, I guess.
---
Yeah, testing things like this is pretty easy to do and show results. It's not like the old days where playground rumors about a secret Zelda dungeon would involve a hundred steps and you couldn't prove it one way or the other.
---
Well, there's all the upcoming communist Atom Shop content that will likely be released in a bundle. Along with scrap collector skins, pretty sure dataminers already know though.
---
Maybe because it isn't "good"? From the pic it looks like a field with some stuff littered around.
---
This is exactly what I thought too.  End of a major event like Scorched Earth, right before you get to loot the thing you just spent 10 mins killing.  This is why this bug is such a complete fucker.
---
I‚Äôm right in a clearing of the bog with three rocket turrets in my roof, when I come home there‚Äôs usually a scorchebeast corpse there to greet me, I think the turrets are very hit and miss, they seem to work out for some while totally failing for others.
---
I loved OW, some of the best writing, voice acting, and quest satisfaction I‚Äôve ever experienced in a game. That said, it ends shockingly soon. The thing that upset me is half of the huge planets on the ship‚Äôs nav map aren‚Äôt part of the game! It felt a little devious to put 5 large planets on the nav map and not have them be part of the actual game. When I got the ending cinematic I was blown away because I thought at most I‚Äôd finished 2/3rds of the game.
---
Trading is becoming the only way to get elite quality end game gear if you don‚Äôt want to wait for RNG. As others have pointed out, caps have become too easy to acquire for high level players. It takes me about 10 mins to make my 1,400 from the vendors every day.
---
For the scrap box. I collect power armor and my character has over 90 suits on unique armor that weigh him down, got to a point where I stopped playing because it just wasn‚Äôt fun. Now that I can put all my spare parts in my scrap box I was able to drop most of my power armor in my stash and now my character is playable again. The added atoms, outfits and emotes are just icing on the cake.
---
What I hate most is those attacks that randomly occur on camps. Had to move out of the white springs cause I was constantly bombarded with Super Mutants and scorched, all max level
---
I like how you people feel the need to shit l
---
talk him. if you don't like him talking about it then don't click on the post.
---
I also love how they limited the Tricentennial paint to three weapons. Like, seriously? This is what you put in your more expensive edition?
---
It used to stack and they randomly removed it long time ago with no mention in notes that I've seen.
---
I often sold stacks of outfits all the time to vendor. Also wish they reduced weight on clothing, especually when they keep giving us challenges and events that require certain ones. My armor stash takes years to scroll through from keeping at least one of each as well as multiple rarer ones and all that weight adds up a lot.
---
It costs less than the $10-$15 a month I was already spending on atoms, plus it comes with all the bonus stuff. I‚Äôm not a fan of the scrap box since it feels kinda cheap, but other than that the membership is well worth the price for what it is. Most MMOs and online games provide a similar service, so I can‚Äôt understand being miffed about this unless people just need something to be outraged over.
---
Have you tried to create another character?
---
It won‚Äôt even let me do that. Every attempt to get into a game has failed.
---
Depends on your build and level...
---
WestTek for super mutants (levels 40+) 
---
Charleston capitol buildings (ghouls for level 20+)
---
Join all public events
---
That's a bugged meat pile that's been there since launch
---
If F1st subbers were able to build with an unlimited camp budget and then later bring that camp to a public instance, it would likely break assumptions engineers made around server load limits since any arbitrary number of players in a public world would be bringing in their unlimited budget built camps.
---
This seems to primarily be an Xbox issue. I‚Äôve always gotten them instantly on PS4 and only see these posts from Xbox users. If they don‚Äôt show up right away closing the game out and logging back in seems to work for a lot of people.
---
I like to make sure people keep positive thoughts about themselves, it's important‚ù§ Take care!
---
I find it funny that they were too lazy to add a skull or spider webs to a halloween themed item and charge so much for it.Yet they can give us different themed varieties of tires.  Its funnier that they are releasing packs of stuff that relates to content we don't have yet. Hard to be interested in something that has no relevance. 
---
Everyone was super stoked about the frat house nuka cola themed room and the skins are already in the game. But forget cashing in on that we need a black turret skin first.
---
Only bad thing about whitesprings is someone always nukes it and if your house is to close then its gone.

I just name all my gear beginning with a special character so they all group together with the default sort

Now that Scorch Beast can be legendary as well, so try to farm them at fissure sites, during Surface To Air ( got 3 legendary scorch beasts in a single event today), and Line In The Sand
---
Maybe delete the game and then reinstall it.
---
The only direction for monetization from here is downhill so I wouldn't be surprised if it ended up that way. I wont be buying it though, they could just make their UI not shit. I have to mod every single Fallout and Elder Scrolls game to give it a normal PC game UI and I can't really do that with this one.

Tried that too, three times.

Reddit has always been 90% toxic.

It's where people go to bitch.

Happened to me yesterday. I uninstalled and reinstalled the game. Still happened. But when I pressed the button on console to turn it off, unhooked the power cord from the back as well as from the wall and let it sit for a minute, the game worked as normal. Just gotta keep messing around with it. 
---
Also, go to settings, Blu ray and clear persistent storage. Always good to do from time to time
---
Ahh. Makes sense.
---
Only reason I brought up the "accident" vs Bethesda changing was the rude comments about you being an idiot clicking "buy" accidentally. Was about to respond but then read your title and was confused.

I ran into this and found  I can respawn on vault 76 and it will drop me back where i died.
---
Kids like the op don‚Äôt know what cash grabs really are. If a game comes out and they don‚Äôt like it or their mommy won‚Äôt buy it for them....it‚Äôs a cash grab! Then again, some youtuber probably told them it‚Äôs a cash grab.

WHO TOLD YOU THAT WAS A THING???

No shit! My camp is on the north banks of that one lake by Site Alpha. Bears NORMALLY only spawn on that little island in the middle, easy enough for me to pull and kill before they reach me with my turrets. But just today I was AFKing in my secure locked Greenhouse dome to keep my Vendor open, go in to check....and a level 76 irradiated bear spawned INSIDE WITH ME. First time that ever happened. Killed me, of course. And then, after respawning to take care of it, game locked up when it was coming out of the entrance lol! Was a rather interesting ordeal, to say the least.
---
Ok. Very different game. But ok.
---
The problem is that's what atoms should be priced at.  The atom prices are currently way too high for what you get.  The prices in the atom shop are about twice what they should be.  Them offering more atoms with the subscription than what you can just buy by themselves for the same prices is a dirty tactic.  It heavily incentivizes buying the subscription so they can guarantee a payment from you every month.  It's downright dirty to offer more atoms with the subscription than vs. buying just the atoms for the same price.  They want a constant stream of income via microtransactions so they load the subscription with atoms, more than you can get otherwise.  You might think it's a good deal, I see that deal as dirty.
---
Same kinda thing I like, open world RPGs
---
Imo it is not easy to use these conduit to improve aesthetics because you'd really have to integrate it into the design of your camp, every time you build stuff you have to think about where to put and how to hide the conduits.
---
To me it's easier to just connect the wire on the external walls, with an external generator, or you can also build a generator indoors and connect it outside using the vertical conduit that has a wire connector sticking out in the middle.
---
They still don't have the range necessary to take out a distant super mutant or scorched that has nothing better to do than to plink away at your CAMP from a distance.
---
And here I was calling him Gesture like some sort of psychopath.
---
Ahhhh I should get one as well
---
14k is still too much D: I even tried to stay alive so much that I was able to escape ZAX and 51, I recorded some holotapes for 76 Dwellers, but in the end, it's never enough D:
---
C.A.M.P. is at the substation just north of Watoga.  Deathclaw spawns every login, legendary about 10% of time.  Additionally, legendary ant will spawn with the same frequency.
---
Factor in the junk resource on site, and it's a goldmine.  Recommend out of reach missile launchers to soften him up.üòé
---
It‚Äôs not really open world
---
Drunk me is surprisingly nicer than sober me. XD
---
It's kind of shocking the disparity I've seen with this. I had some where people were actively telling people to make sure everyone gets a hit, stimpacking and defending people who go down from the boys, and making it all a good time. And then I've had some where people face to one shot the legendary as fast as they can. 
---
Thankfully the latter is way less common, even in other events. It seems like more and more people care mostly about making things fun and sharing rather than just instakilling everything. I've done a number of runs in Uranium Fever thanks to it being free to go to now. Across three characters of varying levels, I've had pretty much every one with people who use emotes and call out on mic to .ake sure everyone gets damage on the legendaries. It's a nice change of pace from the earlier days when people would act as if they were the only ones alive.
---
&gt; Rdr2 comes out on pc on Tuesday,
---
Enjoy the online experience.
---
I mean it's been out a year, and yeah the subscription is expensive and kinda lame, don't buy it. There's tons of stuff I pay for monthly that I don't really need. Netflix, HBO, etc. I'm paying for content and ifbi don't like the content I don't subscribe. Doesn't seem odd to me that not every sun isn't for me.
---
Honor amongst thievs doesn't mean they give stuff back lol.
---
I go out of my way to help out new players. 
---
Not even that. 
---
It's the game if anything is worth it for the lore, and eventually the upcoming dlc which will be even more lore. 
---
The game is loaded with lore. 
---
It's worth it now. 
---
People say it is. But it is.
---
Yeah its not like a melee were its 12%x about 1k+ dmg
---
That‚Äôs terrible. I‚Äôm lost then. Sorry
---
Empty rack has been traded for. However I will drop you an alien pumpkin for free
---
I have to ask, which glitch?  
---
Sometimes it's a glitch that only allows you to spawn at Vault 76.  Sometimes there's no available spot on the map to spawn.  Sometimes there's a spot to spawn at but it won't allow you to spawn (fast travel) if you're over encumbered.
---
Wow thanks, that‚Äôs a lot of stuff. What happened to all the Halloween weapon skins? Didn‚Äôt see any of them in the atom shop.
---
It is certainly one of the best time periods to get 76. Don't worry about what's going on with the micro-transactions. 
---
Just buy it to play it.
---
Used to be a sub, and a few Facebook groups like that, but afraid it would likely constitute a witchhunt for the rules. Now, looking for a Bounty Hunter would be grey area.
---
Not many know this unfortunately !
---
At first it was the Ranger costume and unlimited stash space. I'm a very thorough player and pick up junk constantly and like to always keep a stock of 200+ of the general junk and 500+ of the more intensive materials like lead, acid, steel, etc. I was always tending to my stash, bulking and selling oversupply of less used junk and it was getting tedious. Now I just have stupid amounts of everything.
---
However, once I started using my private session to farm legendaries and level my alts, I'm in love with that part. XP runs are so easy; West Tek, Whitesprings, Grafton Dam, it's always ready for me to clear and level up nice and quick, I love it.
---
As someone with 90876 hours on 76, I can safely say that this game is a cash crab
---
I put my camp right across from Pam‚Äôs House (unmarked but near camden park, has a radroach with a tophat and cane) because I‚Äôm from Huntington and wanted to live at ‚Äúhome‚Äù lol - so far, it‚Äôs pretty quiet over there. The scorched from the park can‚Äôt see me from there, so it‚Äôs convenient. 
---
I USED to have myself camped out across from Camden Park but all of the scorched kept coming over and I got tired of the unwanted guests.
---
Dude, I was talking to a new player. He told me how he was attacked by higher level players. 
---
I gave that man 60 stims, 120 Pure water, .50 Scout rifle 1000 rounds and all my grenades. Who actually bullies people under 50.. sad really.
---
A wow server is persistent and doesn‚Äôt allow friends you‚Äôve removed from your friends list to join your private session without your permission üòÇ
---
Does the -12% damage get taken out of only the base weapon damage, or does it get taken out of your damage after perks, mods, ect?
---
Yeeah! Who needs it! \*starts coughing\* \*loosing breath\*
---
It won't really be a "better" experience. 
---
It'll just be more helpful. 
---
The game is same either way really.
---
Ok thanks.
---
I've already played it on my bf's ps4 and i do enjoy it, yeah
---
It may take a few tries to get that particular reward I think.
---
Yeah, except with ESO+ you get currency on top of unlimited craft space, extra xp, etc. Currency you can then use to buy an expac for permanent use without a sub. That game also has a great deal of content even for just the base game.
---
What can atoms get you? Bad cosmetics and gameplay items that should've just been in the game.
---
Bethesda probably has no idea what the most popular weapon in their game is right now anyway
---
Your experience doesn't match up at all with mine. I've been on vacation from work so I've been doing the event basically every hour for the past three days, and the candy bowls are definitely active for as long as you should be "sowing mayhem" in the right area, be that cottages or the courtyard. It's just that they have a cooldown. 
---
In addition I have never found that JES-2R moves too fast. Pretty much every time I've done the event the people outpace him every time. It's almost always a case of waiting for the both to catch up so you can light the pyre and keep going. I've personally found the event to be pretty well paced.
---
Here is [my post and video](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dqpyq7/fireman_armor_does_not_protect_you_from/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) debunking this. Please don't spread misinformation everyone!
---
I do in fact like the game my guy.
---
Thanks, I just bought the alien from a friend. üòâ
---
Not that much, I have mine and a Radiation Emiter stored, and they take like 1% of the budget iirc.
---
What?
---
Have you restarted the game?
---
Why would I get banned?
---
Yeah twice now and the count hasn‚Äôt changed
---
normally sell for 1 cap in store, or leave a brown bag at the vault 76 door.
---
imagine playing this
---
It happened to me yesterday for the first time at the end of the sheepsquach imposter event, I was blocked in the loading screen for a good 10 minutes and had to restart the game
---
I see the issue here . but for the moment i cant say its "pay to win".
---
Basically all this complaining now will get us ignored when it is a real issue. 
---
If you've played any online game you'll find griefers. and they just get bored and go away. Just ignore them, Pretty simple.
---
It‚Äôs also safe to use from what I understand
---
Hey, thus is a incorrect, you might have just found a glitch/bug
---
When are you going to edit this post to admit you are a lying troll?
---
You are the smartest person in this entire sub. I know this because Godd told me and our lord only speaks definite truth. Praise him and praise Bethesda. üôè
---
I have to mention that Biv is the only NPC in the game that is remotely human, considering he is a Robrobrain which has a human brain, and not malfunctioning.
---
Neither is 76. Unless you count small, buggy, lag ridden maps as open world.
---
 And we have max stupid. Well maybe not, I guess we'll see. ;)
---
I can‚Äôt understand why you would buy it if you hate the others. Was it a gift?
---
It was in the doc Noclip released before 76's launch. Basically Bethesda was working on the Fallout 4 DLC and had aquired Battlecry studios (now BGS Austin), and put them to the task of inputting the QuakeCode into Fallout 4 for a Multiplayer feature they wanted to add, this also is seen by many devs as impossible, but when they tried, they had to also break the Atlas (The idea that the game revolves around the character literally, unloading chunks of the map you do not see), it became too big for Fallout 4 DLC and became 76.
---
They could have named it J-122.  My immature mind would kill me laughing.
---
On console I presume.
---
sadly only Q10
---
THANK YOU!
---
Finally, someone that understands.
---
I can't even use other peoples scrapbox unless I cough up my own cash (which I shouldn't have to). I think they should let 1st members keep their utility items, but also let us other folk have a different version of them cosmetically. I wouldn't care if I got a shit colored brown tent and scrapbox, I just want them as it effects gameplay.
---

I heard that certain items attract agro more, with the scarecrow being the highest priority for enemies to attack, with noise making machines like generators and water purifiers next, I've also heard from plays that putting a scarecrow in a shooting lane (using floor blocks to direct aiming priorities), making enemies who spawn circle the camp to a specific point to attack the scarecrow, and then lining the turrets up to fine on the shooting lane. When an enemy spawns on the outskirts of the camp, the scarecrow gets agro priority, and the enemy then has to move to line up his shot on the scarecrow, and this is the firing lane you place your turrets on. 
---
As an added precaution, I place my turrets on the "steel catwalk steps" (not sure it's real in game name) in the defenses tab, place 3 turrets on top, 2 facing one way, one facing down the steps, and then I put the small pungie boards on the bottom steps, blocks enemies from running up to the turrets, and as they are attacking the boards, the backwards turret cleans off the step.
---
Haven't had a problem since I tried it, and there are always a pile of bodies...
---
I recommend the athletics, archer, and mammologist badges, since I think they are the easiest overall.
---
The worst part is finding an ally to revive if you play solo.
---
I read it on the internet.
---
I prefer the resist since I only use my Tesla for tagging mobs and low level events.
---
No clue. Given how it was an instant ban, I doubt anyone wants to test it either.
---
People keep comparing TESO and Fallout 76 as if Bethesda made both. Zenimax Online Studios runs and made TESO, and I too believe 76 will bounce back, that's probably why the even delayed Wastelanders to next year, to make it work and be great.
---
You should consider bird bones it pairs well with marsupial
---
same here this game has given me hours and hours of entertainment.  I've never bought it though.  So silly people are even playing it but hey I will get to laugh more at people in the months to come.
---
Might have to snag that Ultracite laser name lol
---
Yes. Can't bring up social menu, no buttons function.   
---
Seems to only happen when using an explosive high ROF weapon, and getting bounceback. Haven't found it happening any other time.
---
shame :D
---
And Wolfenstein is MachineGames  
---
Bethesda published games are not Bethesda made, (I.E Doom, Dishonored, Wolfenstein, TEW)  
---
Bethesda games are Fallout (3, 4, 76, and Shelter), Elder Scrolls (Not ESO), Starfield.  
---
BGS austin were making Battlecry, a hero shooter before they were bought out (Thus the original name Battlecry Studios)
---
You can also use the conduit connectors that allow wire attachment to pop through floors and roofs.
---
How do you know they are lazy?
---
Wrong
---
Yea they are but in a way that's honestly boring to the game and time consuming not all of us have free time
---
I'm playing both.
---
The outer worlds is great but it's like a fallout light.
---
 Very well designed but a very short game.
---
Shame on **you** for shaming people for choosing how to spend ***their*** personal time.
---
They can price them that way but most of us are never going to pay those prices.......
---
Obligatory thanks for the silver, my mysterious patron!
---
I was debating that one and forgot about it, tbh. I wasn't sure I wanted to take the additional hit to my Strength, but that was back when I only had Class Freak at 1. It's really not that big a problem now, so yeah, good thought, thanks!
---
What does the text say?
---
FYI, just expanded. Looks like 18 is the max height.
---
Why would you waste your caps?
---
Small? Lmao
---
I woulkd buy it for the Ranger outfit and the monthly atoms.
---
Just did it 4 more times today and it was packed every time.....
---
I've been passing them out for free with the understanding that when they are done with them they come back to me. For the most part this has worked. If they don't return them then they don't get any more from me. With help from a friend, all of the plans/receipes we have for project are on 1 chr (Marian the Librarian) (yes I love the Music Man with Robert Preston)
---
Now we gettin into politics lol but yea I agree the more we get greedy the more it all inflates
---
how did you get the refund? cheque or bank transfer? i thought it was weird when they requested a heap of details from me, which included banking details, but had details that normal aussie accounts dont include, luckly i have a us bank account, lol hopefully they give me 299usd instead of aud, would be nice if i was compensated for having to play that trainwreck

I have them both, but I‚Äôve been playing 76 a bunch lately still. I don‚Äôt know if ‚Äúshame on you‚Äù is necessary here lol Like, no one here is committing any crimes by picking one game over another, yanno? Sure, Bethesda is kind of just shitting on a lot of us, but I don‚Äôt think spending every day, hating on the thing is gonna do any good for anyone. Recent leaks suggest Bethesda plans to add utility items behind Fallout 1st, and while that‚Äôs pretty shitty, I‚Äôm still excited to play Wastelanders and have spent the last few days getting my character, my camp, my inventory, and everything ready for that update. We‚Äôre all open to opinions here, but I promise you, telling us things we already know are happening day in and day out aren‚Äôt going to change our minds lol Personally, I‚Äôm happy to read whatever you throw at me, but other people will just get mad at this, causing more aggression in both communities. Again, thanks for the input, and I hope someday 76 meets your standards of gameplay.
---
Exactly, then leave a bag with on spoiled food and a propaganda flyer or an insult
---
This happened to me once.  Send a ticket to Bethesda, they'll respond because you gave them money.
---
I mean fine you do you but the fact is that people are just greedy now

Which is, of course, very stupid. NW, the first Hiding Royale. How about a sliding scale? Like 100xp per kill in the first min or two, 75 per at the next step, and then it settles at 50 per kill. Still should get the bonus for time survived, but this would 1) Add an incentive to actually Battle 2) Compensate for when you spawn into a complete cluster-fork. In the latter situation I almost always " take a couple with me".
---
Well, then the mutants just shoot your spots first because they see them first anyway
---
Then that's on you for what you think the price goes it's still ridiculous in my opinion I just cant justify it
---
Yeah I‚Äôve sent a ticket to them, annoyed because I wanted to buy the gladiator outfit because I‚Äôve never bought atoms before, nothings ever really interested me in the store that much
---
Its not needed for new players, only if you want the ranger armor outfit.
---
It makes me physically puke.
---
Can't build them yet, might need a perk or plans or something. When the starter turret was so disappointing I kind of stopped looking at defenses.
---
That's a really good theory and it probably tracks with how I think this bug first came into existence around the same time that friendly fire at Events was enforced.
---
I love that idea
---
Ah shit, here we go again.
---
Wow, some thanks for being loyal!
---
Cuz I feel like it and I have more caps than I can spend.  Seems like a fun way to spend it!
---
I have 9 missle turrets because I'm gonna live where I wanna live. Now get off my lawn!
---
It happens. The outer worlds is pretty fun too. It's one of the five games I play, I can't stick to one very long. Still play fallout 4 too, the mods are pretty neat
---
Different studios, yes, but both studios are owned by the same Company.
---
TES is an IP made by Bethesda but the online version is made by Zenimax Studios because Zenimax Studios is better at online games. But why didn't they do the same for Fallout 76? Because they don't care.
---
You forget that a Fallout mmo is something that Interplay even tried.
---
Yea but still not when they make a big deal on It so far i experience most of the people who do this also are toxic
---
As an avid heavy gun user with large clips, I can attest that it does indeed proc after holding the trigger down and not just on initial press.
---
Most welcome
---
Yes I forgot to mention, thank you.
---
The outer worlds is a very different game from fallout 76. Some people prefer one to another.
---
That's a different thing - that's when the perks that buffed your carry weight deactivate themselves inconsistently on death, leading to the scenario that you can *only* respawn at Vault 76 because the game thinks you are morbidly overweight.
---
People keep acting like it;s some fucking slippery slope and keep briging up the fucking horse armor like it's some criticism. Dude it's not 2006.
---
Speak Engrish Trooper!
---
It‚Äôs only a one star who cares. Most people kill it fast then server hop to try and grab a second event.
---
A quad the dragon would be so op
---
Live in NYC been playing since beta no issues. Same as my NYC friends.
---
How about, no. No one has to be nice just cause they paid 13$ for something they wanted dude. You're being entitled.
---
&gt; *Blue Screen Affected Players*: 10 - 15 minutes before the event launches, kill the game to the dashboard and relaunch. This event seems to trigger a fairly large memory leak / memory corruption in the game. To avoid blue screening or crashing during the event, always restart 10-15 minutes before the event is to begin
---
Ok, the rest of your post is pure gold, but this, assuming it is true, is platinum.
---
no i use the spawn to farm legendaries
---
A bit late to the party here- thanks for the recommendation I already have marsupial and was wondering what to buy next.
---
Yea at least it's not an asshat game like fo76
---
Exactly
---
There is no Godd Howard.  The sooner you rip that bandaid off the less it'll hurt.
---
Would have been nice to have other options, hopefully we see some of them in the future.
---
Both, pop 'em like bobbleheads when you need the extra damage.
---
Must be a connection problem, doesn't happen too often for me
---
It works reasonably well on my ultracite gatling laser and 50 cal, and procs in the middle of emptying a clip and not just on initial keypress as many says it does, however it only procs at most 3 times during a SBQ fight. I always use Rank 3 on Queen fights and notice a huge difference if I use One Gun Army instead. Just putting my experience out there.
---
Agreed. That‚Äôs one of the reasons why I started up a YouTube channel. End rumors, test patches and help those who work full time jobs so that they can spend less time farming and more time playing. Need more people like you who decide not to follow the crowd and show things for what it is.
---
Or the fact was that ZOS was busy with ESO, and bethesda had a third studio (BGS austin was bought in 2017) that was doing nothing while Dallas was working on VR, Montreal on Mobile and Maryland was working on starfield so they gave 76 to Austin.
---
Did you pick those words out all by yourself?
---
Failed the event once because of those idiots.
---
Doubtful
---
I second that. It‚Äôs just 5 scrip either way
---
What I've found is that attacks tend to decrease drastically if you have a floating CAMP, and make sure to stick the generator on the floating bit.  Enemies rarely go up the single flight of stairs, so everything on that upper floor is more-or-less safe unless you get a Scorchbeast attack or a particularly tenacious Super Mutant who hangs around outside of turret range taking enough potshots to wreck a wall.
---
I've basically justified this by making treehouses, putting metal poles under the house, or having a lower floor with some less-essential stuff.
---
Lag.  Keep trying.
---
For our sake, I‚Äôm praying they don‚Äôt put utility items behind 1st. I‚Äôm not here just to defend the game, but my own stance on it. It won‚Äôt make me hate the game, but it‚Äôll feel like Bethesda just doesn‚Äôt care about us anymore.
---
Greed is a pivotal factor in capitalism unfortunately, personally I believe in a mix of capitalism and socialism... Bernie2020! But aside from all that its fun to have that freedom in the game, yeah some prices are outright ridiculous but on the other hand MANY vendor camps sell at reasonable or recommended sale prices, lots of people even give stuff away for free. Love that about the Fo76 community, yeah theres bad apples but most of us good folk gravitate together and help each other, feels very organic.
---
I mean fine you do you do bud lmao I just barter at the minute which they curse me for lol
---
TOW is fantastic,  but once I completed the short time it took to complete every quest, I went back to fo76.  Why "same on you"? You can play both and enjoy both lol
---
Wastelanders was ‚Äúdelayed indefinitely‚Äù (canceled)
---
They already have though...
---
Does the tent and scrapbox ring any bells?
---
On ps4 where most I know hit around that price and even if your saying it's too low tell me why what is the logic basing this besides a guessed estimate
---
And you're right. The scrapbox should be free and the war bounds should not mess with the game mechanics.
---
Blasphemous! Do not speak ill of our lord! Peter Heinekens will come get you! You vile crooked infidel!
---
Lol this has been my favorite comment so far thanks
---
For the ranger's armor, i think it was a dirty play, though, maybe it was my last purchase for Bethesda, at least it was the first and last time for Fallout 76
---
You're not at fault.  The trade function wasn't working, no shock, so you dropped the item.  The fault is entirely with the scum that took advantage and stole your item.
---
The Tesla bounces and auto-targets. It's just easier to point in a general direction and kill so you're going to see it more.
---
BE lasers + good aim and positioning will always win, though. It just takes more skill.
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm hoping. Bethesda did say that they will be expanding the membership and this is more of an initial trial run deal. So I suspect that there will be more perks later on. Which will hopefully balance out the price. The price isn‚Äôt horrible when you add the atoms and private servers but I would enjoy maybe something like what PS4 does for memberships and add monthly cosmetics that are actually worth it. Considering these are people who opt to add to their revenue and pay monthly so that they can even afford keeping the game alive. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs much to ask for. Better cosmetics as in exclusive cosmetics that cover a wider array of weapons, armor and so forth. Maybe even add early release on DLCs or beta test them. God knows that their team lacks on finding bugs.
---
&gt; I have put 150+ hours into it now. 
---
Filthy casual.  I have over 400 hours.  Some people tell me I've wasted my money and should buy a ~60 hour game like TOW.
---
I use the beams too!! So much more pleasing asteticly!!
---
True.  But then again, what do you consider the Hazmat Suit to be?
---
You have to admit, it kind of makes sense that it c*ould* protect against fire/explosive damage.  It's the type of small detail that wouldn't be surprising in a Bethesda game.
---
That's just it whatever the prices are I dont agree with it it's still a game not everyone has time to farm all that
---
Well they‚Äôve added increased camp budget to the 1st subscription, so they‚Äôve created the problem and given you the privilege of paying to fix it. Welcome to clown world ü§°
---
I mean for once I disagree with that I'd say at least on half instead
---
Yeah this is the 3rd problem on XBox I've heard about not getting atoms instantly.
---
Definitely worse considering it makes it unusable and the sellers toxic in my experience
---
Increased camp budget for 1st members is not a thing.
---
Ow,   Talk about no-life. :)
---
After a certain point you should start counting in days, not hours.
---
Not with that attitude....
---
My main weapons are all named!
---
‚ÄòWing Clipper‚Äô for my assault rifle
---
‚ÄòNo Witnesses‚Äô for my laser rifle
---
‚ÄòZeus‚Äô Fist‚Äô for my combat shotgun
---
No problems with it sense update
---
Pretty sure I heard about it, might be that they said it was a possibility. However, they also said increased storage wasn‚Äôt possible but released that for a price. So I wouldn‚Äôt put it past them.
---
Yeah, true lol There‚Äôs been so much going on, I actually forgot about those
---
Yeah i dont even fight. Ive let people walk past me because its not worth dying til the end. When i finally won it was a huge disappointment. No extra reward, no huge xp bonus. nothing. Winning NW is an ego boost. Get top 20 die start new match. Unless you kill like 15 players theres very little xp to be had which is why these rewards are bs. When did grinding in video games turn into the most unsatisfying part time job??
---
Time spent =/= worth of a game. It depends on whether you like it, at the end of the day.
---
Would replay Hellblade Senua's Sacrifice, Alan Wake, Control, Halo 3's campaign, Metro Exodus (stories being between 14-25 hours for these games) any day, but I surely didn't like or enjoy ACOdyssey and that crap was 100+ hours for me.
---
Oh well never mind the whole thing then. It‚Äôd be a huge benefit for avid camp builders but this guy needs his 2% chance of spawning a legendary, because god knows there aren‚Äôt plenty of places to farm for those.
---
&gt;  the fuck is wrong with you?
---
*de gustibus non disputandum est*
---
Pumpkin House - right next to a fissure site, and Monster Mash - confined interior instance. 
---
Thematically great choices, but probably considered and rejected for the reasons noted. Other locations mentioned also have potential issues once they become a destination for 20+ players at once.
---
Whitespring is centrally located, with large open areas. While almost everyone experiences some lag at WS, most of the crash comments I've read are from xBox users, and the blue screens seem to mostly affect PS4. 
---
Heat issues for xBox, and memory leaks for PS4 are two of the more well-reasoned causes I've seen suggested. xBox users can clean their console and ensure good ventilation, while PS4 owners can reboot their system about 10 minutes before the event starts.
---
Still doesnt justify a lot of the prices honestly at least not on ps4 some of these people are idiots I swear
---
As a prime ffr bloodied gatling plasma user, I prefer the extra 12% damage, I believe it stacks with perks too, noticed a substantial difference once removing my grounded mutation.
---
I did read about it as well i believe but for the time been it aint a thing. But i agree on the putting a price tag on it, it would be awkward having half camp disappear once your subscription expires...
---
I have 200 mps  net, and 76 is literally the only game I have issues with. Typically in events when more than  10 players show up. The Halloween event has been rough...
---
I like dark chocolate, how is that possible since I hate milk chocolate?
---
TY!

Well you have turrets to protect it. Its not hard to build camp that can solo defend itself.
---
Stop fucking up the game pls. Last time it was high levels in savage and divide.
---
When compared to other open world mmos, yes, it's quite small.
---
My camp is on the very northern border of the Toxic Valley, and my friend is somewhat close to me. Without fail, every time he goes to his camp, a radscorpion spawns and destroys his generator
---
The atoms, I usually bought $10 in atoms and this was a better deal
---
A few things... 
---
So what would you suggest Bethesda gives it paying customers who paid for 1st then? 
---
Technically giving anything included in the 1st package would make the subscription kind of pointless thus a business shooting itself in the foot... 
---
If anything you would have to suggest something that both 1st subscribers and non subscribers would like... 
---
What would that be?
---
üê∑
---
Theres gear going for upwards of 300k, and some poeple for some reason carry up to 1 mil in caps
---
Check your alt characters, there was a patch that ended up swapping the PA parts about. 
---
I've got 3 playable alts, one of them ended up with 4 of each ultracite PA parts.
---
I've spent a lot of ammo shooting the cars. Nice to know trick-or-treating is the fastest, just need to avoid the mines.
---
Yeah you might just need the perk cards.
---
How long you been gone? There was an update awhile ago that seperated power armor from its chasis so each piece will be in your inventory stash or your person inventory.
---
Lol, everyone knows you need to use the witch mask for that one. 
---
Owls are for + 200% crit damage at night ^/s
---
&gt; once you sink some hours in the world suddenly seems really small unfortunately.
---
Define "some".  OP has 150+, I have 400+, some people are reporting 2000+.
---
(Gotta say, 2000+ is scary, hope those guys are retired. :)
---
Somebody didn't put points into intelligence
---
Plain stupid imo
---
Only if the Fire Breather outfit did. I'm guessing hazmat and space suit don't either.
---
You checked both your inventory and stash for pieces?
---
Trade off is that with WoW you support a company that thinks Hong Kong shouldn't be free.
---
That would be awesome, in case I don't get one.
---
You can have a fun time with it, you can get the base game cheap and play through the story portion and get your money's worth for sure
---
They can't please anyone. Some people complain as "all they do is add items to the shop" others complain, "not enough items".
---
I have never seen such a pile on as in the Mischef night event.  Too late to stop it now - it is only a 1\* so not that important I suppose.
---
That sentry bot never has a chance.
---
HAHA, no
---
That's just an out and out lie.
---
&gt; I haven't played in over a week, even though I was really looking forward to the Halloween event. 
---
Seriously bad decision on your part.  You have a few days left, try it, it's a blast.
---
Except atoms are worth nothing to Bethesda, and it costs them nothing to give them to you. Saying it's a good deal is hilarious considering atoms are a horrific deal in the first place.
---
Yeah, so ESO is more pay to win, extra xp etc.
---
Either not charge out the ass for unstable servers or give 1st members more bonus Atoms for cosmetics. I'm just not at all okay with pay to win.
---
I fucking can't stand the entitled argument. People are only asking Bethesda honor their promises. They haven't. We aren't the ones who asked for Free DLC. They promised us free DLC. 
---
It's not up to the consumer to essentially bail out Bethesda for their bad choices by paying even more money.
---
It really depends on the item rarity in my view. For example those event plants are hard to get and are also limited time items meaning you wont be able to get them no more besides trading g to people who got lucky enough to find more that one.
---
It is just supply and demand really.
---
I bought the pirate for 10 k 5.56 and the fire man for 15 k cryo becouse of this and me really wanting them
---
Simply kill fucking everyone and everything. Bonus points if you win
---
Rip 76
---
No. No clothing offers any additional benefits that you would associate with armor, with the exception of the gas masks.
---
"There is no war in Ba Sing Se."
---
Can't wait to list my nocturnal explosive handmade in my camp, but rename it "bloodied prime automatic handmade"  
---
Or my nocturnal combat rifle, sorry I mean my Bloodied The Fixer. ;)
---
Chameleons are the champs of NW
---
Also wearing Grognak costume does not make female players flock to you. Pls dont spread misinformation
---
How about all you get is a private server :)
---
Dude this map is massive and way more detailed that other open world MMOS
---
I would wait for Wastelanders to launch and see if the game is fixed then. 
---
The current state of the game is terrible since Fallout 1st got introduced and the community is kind of mad for the paywall Bethesda brought. so waiting is your best bet. Unless you can find the game on sale it's not worth it as of right now, but maybe in a couple months
---
Well that's on you then honestly like again still a game really
---
&gt; That's not what fallout is made for.
---
Uh, why?
---
&gt; Nor what the fans want.
---
Ask Bethesda's accountants.
---
&gt; Some people of course don't care because they're blinded by the game. 
---
Or because they're not obsessed about how other people spend their money.
---
&gt; Don't support the micro-transactions is what I'm saying.
---
You don't like microtransactions?  Don't buy atoms, end of story,
---
My other characters are named Berry Berkman, Rod Swanson and Liz Lime. I‚Äôm a fan of well written comedy.
---
Hiding in a bush works good for about the 1st 10 levels but then it‚Äôs a slow grind. So basically yeah, kill everyone for that fast, easy xp.
---
You deserve it :)
---
"***Stranger*** in numbers" says it all. The more players with you the ***stranger*** the game play gets.
---
You don't have to do that. If you get your building finished, just use the 'replace' function to turn whatever floor you want the conduit to pass through into one of those mesh floors, then use the replace function to change it back. Presto, aesthetics achieved. You can do the same trick like if you want the wire to pass through a wall, change the wall into a doorway, run your wire, then change it back to a wall. You can use the same trick to push the piping for the cooking stove outside of your build.
---
Edit: The wires will also go through the windows of Steel building set, not sure about the brick, farm, and warehouse sets however.
---
Are you on xbox? Do u have bloodied revolver? Asking for a friend...I'm the friend
---
This is the best response to just about anything. "I read it on the internet."
---
Mr Sad clown raider. I'm mean.. probably a nice enough guy right? üòè
---
&gt; They know it's buggy yet use it for every fallout game they make. 
---
Because no other engine could run a Fallout game.
---
All engines have bugs.  Most games don't push them as hard as Bethesda's style of open world massively interactive games.  Want  game with smaller, limited connection cells with few items you can take?  Great, fewer bugs.
---
Exactly, just a game, everything comes and goes so i don‚Äôt mind spending lots of caps or ammo on things i really enjoy. It also help that i know how to efficiently farm and buy thing needed for ammo so i alway make lots of it. 
---
Like even if i don‚Äôt spend any caps, fast traveling still uses them, so why not invest in other thing instead?
---
I agree, tired of seeing good spots being ruined because enemies will always spawn there.

Yup its gone.
---
It's event only
---
I don‚Äôt agree with you sharing this. If you find a glitch, keep it to yourself and report it. Not for selfish reasons or for you to use it. Posting it doesn‚Äôt guarantee it will get patched... For all you know you have just boosted a glitching PvP players advantage over others!?!
---
I only had one character back then.
---
"I pay therefore I win" and "Praize Todd" on the flag. Yeah it's not very clear, here's the story behind it.  
---
Basically this friend of mine has a C.A.M.P. that's basically a giant dumpster, with random objects all over the places with little to no sense. We was having build adding more garbage to the mix that night and I had the idea to make a Scrapbox shrine as a joke (You can see it in the background, surrounded by lights pointing at it. What you can't see is what I wrote on it. "P2W GOD - BOW DOWN")  
---
Now, since it wasn't my C.A.M.P. I could only use those Greek letters. Zeta was the closest thing to a S I could find, for the Ds I used Phi and covered half of them using Mounted bloatfly heads. Yes, it's really dumb.
---
I hate Weepan breaky glithy.
---
Since pre legendary vendor patch.
---
Passing through yes I know that, if you mean the conduit can sunk into the floor then I did not know that.
---
Wait, u know a place that's giving free donuts? Jelly donuts is nasty, boston creme. Also, terrible example.
---
Is it self improving to watch a family member destroy themselves with an addiction?
---
I think you‚Äôre making the assumption that I wouldn‚Äôt pay for a jelly donut, and I absolutely would. 
---
The problem is charging way too much for a donut that should cost much, much less, and I don‚Äôt really have a comparable analogy for the scrap box but it should be free for everyone as a feature of the game not as a premium service.
---
Yup one of the many bugs we all get to enjoy. Happens mostly when event about to end and I die at that time.
---
The empty rack is unobtainable in the game due to Beths crappy coding/mistake.
---
Data miners confirmed it
---
It still seems risky... but I'm pretty close to giving it a try.. I'd obviously still have to try many times with things that I dont mind losing first.
---
You have all the pumpkin rack plans that can drop. There is no empty. Full, half full, half empty, and pumpkin rack. If you build all 4k they are different. I like that the half full and half empty have different numbers of pumpkins.
---
Maybe they want dogshit. If they enjoy it, that‚Äôs that. Just let it go, man. Find a game you like and play it.
---
If you're unsure about it just try first with some low level weapons that you can craft
---
Ok cool. Thanks.
---
Those who lie on the railroad tracks of history will be crushed by the oncoming train of progress, comrade.
---
who cares its a game pick up a football
---
This. If they enjoy it then it really doesn‚Äôt matter.
---
Cool, thank you.
---
Couldn't figure out if I finally hit the ring lottery with this game or not.
---
Because we just want to. If you don‚Äôt like the game, don‚Äôt play it
---
Yep. I did it last night when I moved my camp. The fusion generator on the third floor and my conduits run down through the interior on the back wall.
---
I wants my money back too, lets hope it happens in the UK.
---
Don‚Äôt suppose you‚Äôd swap yours for one with + endurance instead and 30k?
---
Thanks for the info!  Was hoping I finally got lucky with a rare drop...
---
I‚Äôm going to report this for reposting since it‚Äôs the same shit different day.
---
YW
---
Personally it frustrates me when they introduce camp items that are locked behind an unobtainable plan (looking at you; beer keg and mounted heads)
---
Either make the plan obtainable or dont add in the new items until the plan is available
---
I have a lot of fun playing and building my camp in 76.
---
Lots of good people to have fun with, I‚Äôd say like 95% of interactions with other players is positive.
---
I like the build diversity, I like the giant world and as far as 1st goes I like the game enough to spend 2 trips to Starbucks worth a month to get some nice QOL stuff in game.
---
To each there own op
---
It‚Äôs Bethesda. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they end up giving half the content and saying ‚ÄúOh hey you gotta wait 3 months for the other half. Sorry and here is 500 atoms for the inconvenience.‚Äù
---
Including urban/forest scout armor masks but those all also give -2 PER.
---
ZOS has over 250 employees and Bethesda has 400 across 3 studios, and I don't think Austin has the most of them.
---
Do the math for me.
---
So stop playing and leave the sub if you feel that way... The reddit, fb and discord community is a small portion of the player base and most players are unaware these are even here...
---
I preordered 76 for 60$ and I very much regret it. And I keep forgetting to uninstall it.
---
Nah
---
Log a case with Bethesda.. see what happens
---
You can contact support, have had nothing but good results doing so.
---
Had a head piece disappear the other day when putting in on while in power armor, wasn‚Äôt a big deal tho just made another. 
---
Gl
---
Hmm lemme try later, thanks!
---
What does thats a fully fledged game implying? Are you saying barely made game in Alpha isn't considered a full game that was made in less months then Fallout Las Vegas? Well yes this game is half finished by the fact I crashed twice while running this game while typing this reply.
---
I'm really nor sure what you're even saying.... sorry... all I want to do is give my pirate outfit to my rifle character so I can use black powder rifles and broadsiders. And  my firefighter suit for my melee guy to use swing speed fire axes.. I didnt realize that was so detrimental to the gaming community... sorry everyoneüòÖüòÇ
---
Good luck. It's still a bit wonky to get the conduits placed, but 'it just works'!
---
You got it üëçüèª
---
The game using a VOIP which is blocked in Egypt. so they closes the game ports (Whatever you do to open the ports in the router it will never be opened because it's closed from the source - this from a high level technical team from the ISP) and the game is blocked and can't be playable any more.
---
The normal solution:
---
\- The game developer must find a way to work around the VOIP and find a solution to make the game playable again. (This will never gonna happen).
---
\- Bethesda should contact the ISP (TE-data, orange, Etisalat, and Vodafone) and make them open the ports again. (This will never gonna happen).
---
The paid solution: ( $346 VPN):
---
VPN is blocked in Egypt (L2TP) and this makes it impossible to play the game via VPN specially we are using a console (if any one playing the game on PC it's easy to play via a VPN program but the consoles doesn't have a direct VPN app).
---
So for consoles you need to buy a specific router (4000 L.E.) and subscribe for a VPN service $13/month, $60/6 months or $96/year
---
after the subscription you will have the ability to install a custom firmware into that specific router and you can use a direct VPN connection from the router.
---
So you need to pay 4000 L.E + ($96 \* 16 L.E.)  = 5536 L.E. to play unstable and buggy game.
---
5536 L.E. = $346 (How many games you can buy it for $346).
---
i didn't try this solution because i will never pay this amount of money to play one game.
---
It's a line from the skit, but thanks for your help
---
I‚Äôm sorry. Maybe Google should be my friend instead..
---
Jealousy probably. 
---
Look at you with your "electricity" and your "plumbing".
---
It's we'll known that Super Mutants and Scorched are very Anti-Gentrification.
---
I want to do this. I have so much stuff that people who actually play would benefit from. I just can't. I want this game to improve. But for now it probably won't. It's a shame tho. Seems like all the cool people who stuck with the game are mostly gone now...
---
https://youtu.be/rS00xWnqwvI?t=99
---
I reported it months ago mate, they don't fix things in this game unless it's atom shop related. 
---
The more people that know the faster itll get patched.
---
Ugh, I can't find a way to do the graffiti. And what about the candy,where to find them? ü§î 
---
I only light the pyres,blow up the cars and shoot around. I wanna the whole fun!!!
---
Also im pretty sure eso originally charged a sub fee then went buy to play so them charging for that stuff wasnt surprising
---
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard, me urging someone to buy very cheap and widely available games isn't some kind of weird entitlement, but fuck it I'll buy him them on steam sure.
---
Yep i see that word on every forum people dont know what it means anymore
---
No point fixing a game with no playerbase.
---
How did you get your jetpack? Did you craft it, or did you use a loose mod?
---
Why would I stop playing a game that I enjoy playing?
---
A fool and his money are easily parted. Seriously though, the ultra-fanboy base that actually buys into all this "Fallout 1st" junk will downvote this to hell, flag the post to be deleted, and try to get you banned from the sub (you'd be banned within an hour on the Bethesda forums). The level of toxicity in Bethesda defenders is growing almost as much as Bethesda's greed, and I'm starting to think they just deserve each other. You want to shill out 15 bucks for pay to win? Go right ahead. Just know they're going to do it again, probably with ES6 or Doom and most definately Starfield (60-100 bucks a month is pocket change though, right?).
---
Nah not the same. People can/will come back for wastelanders. If their account is locked out for use they would have to start over on a new account. Have fun with your STD comparison.
---
Aright then dude.
---
You got a better chance of starting the ‚Äúhey let‚Äôs all stop doing heroine cuz it‚Äôs killing you‚Äù in a methadone clinic.

My buddy's syringer is named "Bill Cosby" and mine is "Cardi B"

I'm gonna pass.

I guess I have my answer then.
---
Idk if it candle ark i think fallout would be no problem
---
&gt;Time spent =/= worth of a game. It depends on whether you like it, at the end of the day.
---
If you don't like playing it why play it?  I could spend my time picking fluff from my belly button if I wanted,
---
&gt; but I surely didn't like or enjoy ACOdyssey and that crap was 100+ hours for me.
---
A level of masochism I have difficulty comprehending.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm already being reported lmao.
---
My thoughts exactly.
---
Pretty sure all you need is Science Expert.
---
It‚Äôs next to impossible for camp budget to be increased on console. They just couldn‚Äôt handle it.
---
Mine was the Thot Destroyer - TSE 90% reduced weight, beam splitter, hair trigger, full auto ultracite Laser Gun. Breaks my game when I held it longer than 10 seconds and sadly I sold it :(
---
You know what they say...
---
"What happens in Appalachia stays in Appalachia.  Except for Rad Herpes.  That's for life."
---
I did the same thing for a while. My camp was only feet from the normal Whitesprings blast zone.
---
I got an idea how about you just stop playing a game you don't like and stop trying to get people that enjoy a game to not enjoy it? if anyone wants to play on PS4 I still got a pretty good-sized group that plays regularly.
---
Not true. Ppl here have been playing since beta and posting about glitches and not explaining them and they still fixed aren‚Äôt... hell all the duping that happened wasn‚Äôt 1 person!!! It was caused by people posting vids on YT literally showing you how to do it....
---
Damn that is the very last one I needed. Sad panda.
---
Nothing, your not alone during the power armor "fix" they removed everyones armors and added them to stash but a few reported it wasn't there and looks like your part of that group. Welcome back to Fallout 76 friend.
---
Yeah, at least there's a tiny bit of variety in which ones you can choose to fill in the gaps.
---
Or you can leave the sub, not everyone want's to kiss Bethesda's ass and throw (more) money at them. If being critical of their greed and their inability to fix their game (after a whole year) is so offensive to you, then why don't you go back to the main Bethesda forums where ALL criticism of their games, bugs, and poor business practices are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN.
---
It's hard to ignore the quality of F76 at launch and the lack of quality in the updates since. The game continues to feel like playing Fallout 4, but something's wrong. Latency issues, hits not registering, etc..
---
If that was the only thing, I'd probably still be open to buying BGS games at full cost, but it's not. They've made a pile of bad decisions. Lack of content (thinking that players would fill the void never works), over priced and manipulative monetization, and poor communication with players. Then they follow that up with not keeping RMT as cosmetics only... and how they've also released Blades, which has the usual terrible mobile monetization schemes.
---
So, as far as "giving up" on Bethesda, I'll probably still pickup DOOM Eternal early on, but BGS games... nope. I'm done pre-ordering or paying full price. From now until they're back on track, I'll be waiting for a deep discount and even then, only if reviews or recommendations are good.
---
Then it must be true nobody lies on the internet lol
---
Try and submit  a Bethesda ticket about your case. See what happens mate
---
Garbage mostly. The occasional decent plan or weapons. But not often. It‚Äôs a dice roll.
---
I don‚Äôt have any advice for fallout, but I have some reddit advice if you‚Äôre new to reddit. Don‚Äôt use emojis in your posts or comments or else people will murder you
---
Some of them give rare or exclusive plans. I know you can get the plans to build the non quest related power armors. There‚Äôs also a rumor that you can get serum recipes from the cranberry bog and mire treasure maps
---
Fuck no. That's why we have turrets. Don't build next to scorchbeasts and you will be fine. I love the extra HP when I hear my turrets starting to blast some molemen.

---
I think that‚Äôs a fair point of view, Bethesda has made some poor decisions as of late. I just feel like it isn‚Äôt some barrier they‚Äôve crossed that they can‚Äôt pull out of. I think they have plenty of opportunity to redeem themselves and the quality of their games.
---
Like I said, I‚Äôm going to use wastelanders as the final judgement call from my point of view.
---
That dlc is their opportunity to strike it big again and cement fallout 76 as a real fallout title, not to mention a game worth playing.
---
From what I‚Äôve seen, I think the dlc is meant to symbolize them reconciling for the mistakes they‚Äôve made so far (using players as the enemies/content, poor communication, empty world, etc.)
---
If they can do that much, then I believe BGS has plenty of potential to rise to their former glory.
---
I mean with any game you‚Äôre purchasing a license to play it to be fair
---
I just went there and all that was there was a clown hat and fishing hat.
---
The hazmat suit specifically states and shows stats. It also replaces your armor when you put it on. So the hazmat suit would be under the armor category.
---
For scout armor it's on sale in the enclave military wing.
---
(edit: weird auto-correct for military).
---
It‚Äôs not there every time. Sometimes a batting helmet will be there sometimes other shit. Server hop and you will find it.
---
comparing hating on fallout 1st users to hating on white, black, asian, whatever people is... something
---
Every large purchase sounds small when you divide it by 365...
---
It doesn't make it, a microtransaction, or justify the cost.
---
Oof, that's amazing .
---
Hey its not that much, doing the math shows its 2000/24=83.33 so call it 84 days of gameplay. Heck thats 281 days he was doing other stuff besides Fallout 76 in one year.
---
Think about it.

Aha.  Now I understand, op was lying to try to increase the market price,  Time to call the SEC.

---
You needed a drunk dare to build your own set of power armor?  
---
If I had the money to get a 3d printer that is the main reason I want one
---
On PC or console?
---
Beautiful work of art
---
OP presumably, I guess that's why he's lying.
---
I, as a female, disagree...
---
Fat boy in a grognak suit?  Spa-looooosh!
---
Not selling ;)
---
Or give the effect.
---
What would be the specifics of your demands.
---
It's a new Bethesda tax. They probably weren't collecting enough from your vendor sales.
---
This is a great example of the "trick" portion of "trick or treat."
---
Nope, I've never been able to respawn at Vault 76 when that triggers, and have either had no respawn points, or a random point on the opposite end of the map!
---
If you to the whitesprings before the event, walk among the cottages on the first strip, leading to the tennis court. In between the houses you'll find little  wooden stairs leading to a small platform with pain cans. These are the spots where you'll paint. Also it you walk up the stairs on the porches of the cottages, you'll see little orange candy buckets with hands sticking out, this is where you'll pick candy.
---
Haha, I needed a drunk dare to make a second set of power armor (already had finished T-60 power armor when I was dared :P )
---
Thanks!
---
If you're on xbox and have a marine chest I have a couple dense mods.
---
LOLed
---
Why did you need a dare to make the first set???  
---
This is giving me more questions than answers, lol
---
Bwahahahaha hope it works üëçüèª
---
I agree it's not worth $100 a year. But shaming people for drinking coffee, which may genuinely help them get through the day, is shitty.
---
full auto or semi gun wise? currently have a bloodied explosive 90% weight reduction combat rifle semi.
---
I suppose buyers could just wait for Wastelanders, see if they like it, and then request their refund?
---
Neither. OP is full of scorchbeast guano.
---
I appreciate the offer but I have to decline.
---
I've not come across that in game.
---
I‚Äôm only level 26 looking for some people to play with can I add you?
---
I could get the video to play for me but have an upvote for the name GarlicWizard
---
Edit: couldn‚Äôt
---
Yeah, I'd still try a bunch of throw away stuff before I tried anything valuable for sure
---
lucky bastard i wish i would be able to get a refund 
---
guess i'll just throw my copy of fallout in a woodchipper or something 
---
hell at the very least that would be more fun than actually playing the game.
---
My buddy asked me to try out the game a while ago and then said not to. But they kept playing. All they did was just design houses in different places all the time. 
---
Then they mentioned they were still playing on and off a few months ago so I figure I'd give it a shot. Took a while to figure out everything but was pretty dope hearing all the tapes and stories, finding all the notes, and the humor was great. 
---
Based on everything everyone says it seems fall out 4 is the best or the one to try next.
---
Nah no dare needed for first set (but it was haaaaaard build) so dare and alcohol was needed for this second set to forget how hard the first build was lol.
---
Fallout NV always struck me as the magic that happens when a dead dream is brought back to life. Bethesda respected the original creators of Fallout enough to let them make their version of FO3. 
---
It seems strange to me that folks think that BGS doesn‚Äôt love Fallout and only sees it as a cash grab.
---
Garbage from Bethesda Games Studios, including Fallout, doesn't deserve a chance.
---
Ah right I get ya, have you built a power armour stand so you can display them?
---
I don't believe the serum recipes come from them, but the power armor plans definitely come from treasure maps in the savage divide, mire, and cranberry bog
---
You can get them through nuclear winter until the 13th or something
---
Private servers for farming legendaries and scrapbox for more stash space.
---
Question so is scrap box inventory shared by all your characters?
---
The big yellow frame? Not yet, mine are rigged to free stand in my house.
---
if did companion quests and all side quests thats an easy 35-40 hours. and thats if you played on normal which is easy. not even the super nova but one above normal is a good challenge. but also thats a game can easy play again with a diff build with 3 diff endings and numerous diff choices can make during the game, and hell even use new companions the next time around who will give new dialogue in convos when they travel with you. tons of content and all of it is better than anything 76 has ever done
---
Tata!
---
It just whoreks.
---
Yeah, do a bit of prep first and put them all in the same location. Good idea.
---
at this point if you still support garbage and havent talked bethesda a lesson as most have, yes shame on you
---
I've had the same spot for months now..up by the dirt track...nice spot on the waterfront edge...dont wanna move at all..though I get lil player traffic there sadly..but it a haven for lvl 5 scorchies and Super Mutants that sit just out of range and destroy my generators it seems
---
PC, and yes probably, I was bloodied heavy guns/PA, but kept a healthy stock of bloodied weapons.
---
I'm somewhat interested asking what the hell this "Spa-looooosh!" is supposed to represent.
---
üëã
---
I just first played about 30 minutes of Outer Worlds. I can see the appeal in the awesome passive min-maxing and enjoying the story but the gun play doesnt feel nearly as rewarding as Fo76. It just makes me sad that Fo76's weapon balance is shit.
---
Yup, even in real life, almost every conservative I know who plays video games loves Fallout.
---
i once said yes as a reply to someone on a critical thread...i then got 9 downvotes just from saying yes
---
Absolutely hilarious.
---
Ever played Oregon trail? #dysentery #spaloooosh
---
not really short. even if you play on normal mode which is pretty easy if you do companion quests and all side quests its 30 to 35 hours minimum. one level above normal is a good challenge. but with 3 diff endings and soooo many choices to make during it it has replay value as well, has exploring value. but yea I guess some clowns played on normal mode and just ran thru the main quest and complained it was short.
---
even if just do all the faction quests thats lots of content
---
What is FO76 but updated millenial Oregon trail if you really think about it
---
A fine choice too
---
Zow, downvoted by another humouless redditor,  thick on the ground around here.
---
The women, getting wet.
---
This is good to know, thank you! :D
---
Kill any AI you see for easy experience, otherwise try your best to win because player kills and wins give the most xp
---
&gt;I‚Äôve not tried the private server... I assumed you would still need a friend to tie you to that server.  
---
You don't. Unless the server itself crashes you have somewhere between 10-15 minutes to log out, switch characters, and log back into the same server. 
---
&gt;I would experiment with easy-to-replace junk or weapons first. 
---
I did that several times before trusting it enough to swap legendary stuff.
---
no one gives a fuck
---
Actually he never stated that private servers would be free. Pete Hines said that DLC would be free which is still accurate since Wastelanders will not require a subscription or any form of purchase so your false advertisements claim is not valid. While I do think that adding the unlimited Scrap to the subscription was a bad move, I knew from the start that the Private Servers would have a fee.
---
Fireproof, unless they nerfed it, is really the only thing that will protect you
---
Sleep, who needs sleep, there are scorched to kill!
---
Oh wow, how went that over my head....
---
Only gas mask that doesn't do - 2 perception is the new Ranger helmet. Because balance and consistency...
---
I really thought it would be clear and obvious that I mean don‚Äôt spawn enemies **inside the Green bubble**.  Like literally a Scorched materializing in your damn living room. It‚Äôs annoying and stupid. Camps block random encounters, so they should de-spawn a couple Scorched or mole rats too. 
---
I had no idea so many people lean on having a mirelurk spawn in their fucking bathroom to get XP and Legendaries!(?!?!?)
---
I‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôre trolling or not to be honest. 
---
Wow has a sub and you need to buy the game and expansion each time expansion comes out
---
Explain to me why karma on reddit matters? I've never understood.
---
OK, ive done the deal. The evil thing is the auto targeting. It always hits, as long as you look in the right direction. :)
---
I hid in a porta potty for the majority of a match once. I heard people come nearby, but they never thought to open the door. 
---
Nice to know that even during a Nuclear Winter, you can still have a shit in peace.
---
He's spot on. My QE harpoon is my standard "running around killing shit" gun outside of SBQ runs or nuke zones.
---
The person who sold him one for 30k caps, 40k 556, and his Bffr handmade.
---
Right reliable haha
---
If you dont like it then dont buy it and dont play the game. Pretty simple solution.  Leave those alone that enjoy the game as it is and those that want to pay 15 bucks a month for it!
---
Gaming companies have been going pay to win and microtransactions for years.   Drop a terrible game the  throw out 10 dollar dlc that should of been part of the original game.  People slurp it up!!!! So guess what?  People do vote with their wallets....and I guess most are fine with the state of gaming.
---
Abandon the sub? Would we be so lucky?
---
Welcome to any Bethesda game! Can you still refund it? What is the error code?
---
I‚Äôm sure all that works, but it‚Äôs not particularly helpful if you‚Äôre trying to build a creative/immersive/lore friendly camp.
---
Never should have come here...
---
Good. Quit. All that salt isn‚Äôt good for our health. Also leave this group. You‚Äôre gone. Your opinion doesn‚Äôt matter anymore. Same goes for the rest of you ppl that claim you don‚Äôt play.
---
Is that one of the fallout canvas bags in the background?
---
No refund available :( I really want to get to level 100 before I get rid of it! Error code is CE-34878-0
---
Yeah okay, see you when wastelanders comes out. Crybaby.
---
Don't try doing anything important when the big event is going on. It lags the whole fucking server, even if you're nowhere near it.
---
yeah im pretty satisfied with my purchase
---
Sounds like the servers can not keep up with player commands anymore and every action gets shoved into a queue. If they're still having these problems late-stage of this game, consider the game done.
---
I actually have one and love it, my question was to the OP as well as others. There has to be a give and take here. 
---
Bethesda isn‚Äôt going to charge less or take away what‚Äôs already in the subscription so really just giving something away wont work or would be unfair to those that paid. 
---
So I ask them, what do they think could be done. 
---
As for me... my friends and kids love the private server and we do events with consideration for everyone as well as doing quests and events.
---
Happy here.  I don‚Äôt use the private server but the quality of life upgrades and atoms are worth it.  I‚Äôve wasted more money on much worse stuff.
---
Poison damage was increased so could be that. Could also be your armor in general that‚Äôs weak or weak build maybe?
---
Is there a way I can fix that?
---
I am impressed you managed to see the 16x detail back there. ;)
---
Team up with a high level character. I've done it dozens of times for new players.
---
Doesn't even take 5 minutes for a toxic fanboy to show up to defend Bethesda.
---
Init , does OP mind sharing where he got this ‚Äúreliable leaked information‚Äù from?
---
I had the opposite reaction. Compared to 76,the fun play in TOW is great, presumably because it's built on the UE engine which was actually designed for FPS games.
---
Huh?
---
I just bought it for the Ranger outfit, so I‚Äôm not subscribing again after that until the Armoured Veteran Variant comes out and then I‚Äôm absolutely done with the subscription.. I‚Äôd like to assume that‚Äôs the same reasoning for a lot of other people too which could mean a major drop off in subscribers after that? But I‚Äôm not putting my money on it in the slightest.. and I have heard of the leaks, I haven‚Äôt actually seen them myself so I don‚Äôt want to jump about and agree that it‚Äôs fact just yet, incase their behaviour is a result of higher ups which it most likely is. But on a final note, I don‚Äôt think Bethesda would be the ones controlling who sees what, especially here since if they were to be caught doing that, they could be in a LOT of legal trouble, so it‚Äôs could very well be overzealous fans or moderators downvoting/doing that themselves? Not just but so far with everything going on that‚Äôs my 2 cents on the situation
---
Settlers and raiders
---
Um I get your position. Just wondering at the moment what actually works with Bethesda. I would think that with all the crap going on this comment would be the last thing people r saying. So I'm going to up vote you because I'm thinking that in the described situation your comments are appropriate - they 'just work'
---
I brought several radscorpions to someone's base because I was a low level, the radscorpions were almost twice my level, and the camp had Rocket turrets. I would do it again. 
---
Guy who owned the camp and some rando were very confused when things started popping off.
---
did they say about increasing that?
---

---
I will not claim these are 100% reliable but the person HAS correctly leaked info in the past on games such as Anthem.
---
Don't think I've ever seen a server that wasn't full and also haven't seen the same person twice. Not sure it has no playerbase.
---
How is he defending them?
---
Why does that make him a toxic fan boy if he doesn‚Äôt give a fuck about someone leaving the game. Do you give a fuck that he‚Äôs leaving?
---
Supply and demand. Only takes one person to pay it to make it worth the price.  I, however, agree and sell things pretty cheap all the time on purpose.
---
The Veil of Secrets provides protection with no PER penalty.
---
Idk. I can't even remember where I got that from.
---
I hope for PvP team deathmatch arenas/battlegrounds
---
I'm not buying a thing that was free in decade old games.
---
Original unedited post was about every single player leaving the game until it gets fixed. My comment was regarding that.
---
There seems to be a massive gap in your timeline. Did you play for the past year? Did you like it?
---
Same. No regrets.
---
No. And no indication that theres anyone else.
---
Ah. My mistake then. Definitely right in that case then
---
I just go to Grafton and spam events, complete one, disconnect from world, load back in, run back to Grafton, rinse and repeat
---
I understand that stance, but sadly it's always the first few months that a company looks at. Even if all the subscriptions fall off, they're gonna look at these first few months and go "Well it sold great let's push for more!"  
---
As for the controlling, I just heard that Bethesda is paying Youtubers to talk positively about Fallout 1st and such.
---
You need more Archer in your life
---
Seems the person you're replying to was making a different point to what you're making
---
Agreed but really whilst the leather coat etc are rare I'm thinking 30k is kinda a push. I'm mean they r only cosmetic
---
It doesnt matter in the eyes of God, hatred is hatred.
---
Unless you actually place it, nothing happens
---
No worries mate
---
The mothman cult has been confirmed
---
 16 TIMES THE DETAIL!
---
The flamer is a great touch
---
Your entire argument is calling people stupid. I guess you don't really care about being a hypocrite either?
---
You had me at "I understand it's your money...".
---
Moooo
---
Like it or not servers cost money to run(especially the ones that people actually want) and im fine with this. They never said that private servers will be free
---
Go to a location clear it and move to the next. When I say clear it I'm mean all of it every house shop etc. Takes a while but you will also find majority of the notes letters plans etc in the process
---
They can‚Äôt give scrap box and tent away to everyone now cause then the people who paid will want their money back.
---
Cannibals are a thing. They will mostly be uninteractive, and just act like normal raiders (attack on sight)
---
Thanks I originally printed a minigun but it ended up being about 35 lbs before I put the motor in so had to pivot fast to something big but light.
---
They're available on all servers.  Not sure why you could access them, but I haven't looked at one so I'm not sure if that's a bug or a glitch or something else.
---
Short answer: yes, I'm happy with what I spent my money on.  And that's all that matters.
---
Amazing
---
What's baffling / sad is that they don't realize their willingness to oblige shitty practices like this makes it worse for everyone in the long run, if they'd withdraw that money rather than give in to mediocrity and laziness, the devs would have to respect its playerbase.
---
I don't understand how they even justify it, supporting the devs? No metrics show a cash shop is necessary to maintain a game, and certainly not ones that involve clear cut advantages, all it does is encourage the devs to continue to implement purposely obnoxious designs in their games to then sell you the solution, rather than create a proper game and then be paid when new content is worth paying for.
---
Literally paying to encourage bad practices in the name of personal choice to make it shittier for everyone involved (including themselves), what a strange and selfish way to spend your money.
---
It's not always the rareness of the outfit. It's the time needed to grind for it. Some people don't want to server hop or do the Halloween event 14 times a day so they pay the price for it in caps. I sell my outfits at high end prices (everyday items and junk I actually under price) but if someone messaged me politely asking where I got the outfit from I am more than happy to show them how to get it for a lower cost or free.
---
Shhht maybe Bethesda is listening...
---
OH HEY TODD! What? No, no the scrapbox stills being for first subscribers, don't worry it just works.
---
Never got a serum recipe but lots of of plans etc. It's very rng though
---
i hope theres no clear leader cuz my friend rps as the cult leader
---
You too!?! I'm getting banged by simple level 30 mole miners, what just happened?
---
That is a very general PS4 crash error and while there are some things you can try, none of them are guaranteed to work. You can try deleting and reinstalling the game or rebuilding your database. 
---
However this just sounds like a server error making your game crash, perhaps try to modify internet settings, setup maybe different DNS's? Port-forward/UPnP in your router settings? Did you switch internet providers or settings recently?
---
Most ''CE-34878-0'' errors need a patch to fix. Best thing you can do is use the ingame report function and attach a videoclip. To be honest, this is just one of the many million bugs in this game so who knows IF and WHEN it will be fixed.
---
Zow.  Kudos.
---
Bethesda with the other ranger armor variants in the games files already: I'm about to end this man's whole career~
---
Cheers!
---
Eh.  I agree, but I'd pay 30k for a blue Mr. Fuzzy jumpsuit
---
So far there's just Settlers vs Raiders. But I won't be surprised if there's dozens of other minor factions. And of course there's still MODUS and the Enclave around here.
---
Personally, I'm hoping this can be a 3-way war and you can choose to support either the Raiders, the Settlers or the Enclave. Would be pretty cool being able to support the Enclave for the first time in a Fallout story and actually have them emerge victorious. (Granted, it's not *the* Enclave since they split off from the main group, but it's still the Enclave!)
---
The survival tent can be seen by any player and are put in the world the owner is in.  They stick with you in adventure mode.  So you can fast travel for free to em.
---
They conned people into getting it for the ranger outfit. And they'll continue to do it. You can tell by the datamined items. Whoever this bullshit marketing person is, they're smart, they know how to play the advertising game.
---
what youtubers? literally no youtuber who wants to make money will defend this, its more profitable to hate it
---
Do names on weapons stay when you sell them to other players?
---
Yeah especially those unarmed scorched got buffed a lot, i die unexpectedly often ü§Æ
---
Maybe they've have added new stuff? Cause there is a firemans outfit you can get, that's not on this list.
---
If you have a Legendary Railway Rifle and you named it "Choo Choo Motherfucker"  
---
You and I are now family.
---
Did you try to put something in it?
---
Same thing happens at Uranium Fever. Someone kills the supervisors before they fully morph. I've done it myself solo'ing the event a couple times in haste. I even seen the name change but killed them before glowing and they reverted.
---
It is but I see people selling them for 50k+ someone offered 75k for my Responders Fireman Uniform and told the the dude I don't have multiple characters lol
---
I see people seeing the black cowboy hat and other in world things you can find for free.  I always laugh thinking they must be having laugh.
---
There's no reasoning with madness. If the toxic fanboys want to pay Bethesda 100 bucks to f*** them over, they're going to do exactly that. They're also going to report and downvote your post, try to get you banned from the sub, and ultimately prove to Bethesda that they can get away with this kind of s**t. Fallout 76 is going to be pay to win, its still going to be garbage, and we can probably expect this to happen again with ES6 and Starfield.
---
I was going to uninstall/reinstall but I might leave it for a while if that‚Äôs the case, my internet hasn‚Äôt changed and it‚Äôs been working fine since I got the game! I think it might be a server issue because everything was working perfectly until they closed the servers to update them :/
---
Why encourage that in the first place? Would it not be better if the devs fixed the base game rather than purposely keep the inconveniences to make you pay for the solution? Would it not be better for everyone if devtime was spent (and rewarded) on actual content worth spending money on, rather than being satisfied that you're sold the rest of what you already purchased?
---
I use Xbox One X. I have a reasonably small camp in terms of footprint and overall floor space, however it is very highly decorated using all of the available budget. I have to stand and stare at a painting on the wall for it to render fully (if I don‚Äôt, it remains pixilated). Same when I approach a vending machine to stock it. 
---
These are just some examples. 
---
A larger budget on console would just make this problem worse. Sure we could get more into it, but we would just be faced with formless masses of pixels.
---
Hi - I was having the same exact problem recently.  The two things I've read are:
---
1) plug in your PS4 controller to USB and reboot your PS4 in safe mode and rebuild the database  (You turn PS4 totally off, then boot up using button on the PS4 itself (not controller)... Hold down that PS4 power button until it beeps a few times. (You can google this for exact procedure).  This should boot up in safe mode and there should be a menu to allow rebuild database.
---
2) completely delete and re-install the whole game.... (I'm trying this now but not sure it does anything).
---
I'm actually downloading the 70GB of game again in an attempt to keep playing it.   (I had a rocky first install, but then it was fine for like 10 days with no crashes, then it just crashed endlessly 5-6 times the day before Halloween and I just deleted the whole thing out of frustration).
---
I got my character to level 15 but then couldn't get into the game.  Same error code as you.
---
Good luck!
---
No had no junk and a damn SB arrived so I ran away as fast as my Lvl 36 legs could take me....
---
Get to a safe space, and try this:  unequip all armor, and perk cards.   Reequip, and put perk cards back.   I had a similar problem recently and it did the trick.
---
Cap'n occasionally sells it since before the event, so this isn't new info. However, it does decrease the value when you would get this helmet at Mischief Night instead. So indeed, don't waste your hard earned caps to buy it from players.
---
do you not know how an mmo works?
---
Remember people. Being naked will NOT make you invincible against Robots
---
Same thing happened to me, but afraid to lose mats,  by putting  them in there
---
I sell everything cheap and still can't get anyone to buy lol I have a Whitespring outfit for 850 caps and still no bites
---
So you paid $144 which is $24 above what Australian retail was for the game?
---
I've got a bridge to sell, interested?
---
&gt; Just because your views and understanding of FACTS are limited to your jurisdiction, and NOWHERE else, does not negate the truth.
---
No, you're just outright lying about the price by $24.
---
I like your syphilis analogy because just like this game, you got fucked by it and it works on everyone's nerves (neurosyphilis).
---
If you‚Äôre waiting on devs to fix things.  Give up now. Find a new game that isn‚Äôt broke as much for you.
---
I heard that they don‚Äôt stay, unfortunately
---
I was wondering the same thing...
---
I get it. I got my leather coat in a vendor for 4k
---
You can open Scrapboxes but you cannot deposit anything in them, it's normal.
---
I have enjoyed the game being that I love fallout games and don't get me wrong they have fixed a lot since launch but this whole fallout 1st thing just rubbed me the wrong way now with the outer worlds I just can't defend this company any longer.
---
it seems like the players are supposed to be the minor factions loke brotherhood and free states and such
---
At release WoW was a dumpster fire. A year later the vast majority of ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù in the game now were mods made by players.
---
You aren‚Äôt doing yourself any favors by using it as a comparison. Unless you thought people would ignore years of expansions and development?
---
fanboy!!
---
Dude, I am seriously impressed. If I could upvote you 50 times I would. That suit and flamer look awesome. Congrats.
---
Hey, I'm just glad someone else found the humor in that thought. It's not a 3* Gatling, but I'll take it all the same.
---
Shoulders so big you could pass off as a Titan
---
Good luck in your search!
---
I mean given this game‚Äôs stability record, I wholly expect Wastelanders to launch in a horrid mess that takes months to truly fix
---
Reference please or it's just more bs
---
Hey no judgement each to their own. I don't mind spending caps but prefer it on something that gives you a perk etc
---
This is no MMO, an always online requirement doesn't qualify.
---
And even if it did, monetizing gameplay features past the initial purchase is no justification. Doubly so when one of your selling gimmick was to make it a point to remain cosmetic only.
---
What pisses me off the most isn't that Bethesda is doing this subscription service; it's that it's apparently been a financial success for Bethesda. I'm doing my part and uninstalling the game, and hopefully they get at least one uninstall per person that actually spends $100 on this crap.
---
I got rid of everything myself and deleted my main, so in case I'm ever tempted to come back to Fallout 76 I'll be hit with the realization that I'll have to go through the boring grind again to get my character back to where he was at. Either way, I've since gone back to Fallout 4 and have been having a blast, so I see no reason to go back to 76 any time soon.
---
Yes... that is exactly what the post says. Thanks, I do like that sneaky edit so now it doesn‚Äôt sound so smug! Lol
---
no he said there would be no subscription service thats my beef
---
If I had an automatic rifle I'd call it  Stephen.
---
An SMG?  Phillip A.  Probably break too fast though.
---
A Fatman? Enola Gay.
---
My sniper rifle is Lee Harvey.
---
Thank you!! I‚Äôll try the rebuild thing now, never done it before, hopefully I won‚Äôt lose all my progress :( I‚Äôm level 90 and this is the first problem I‚Äôve had with the game (apart from the typical glitches and stuff)
---
*large open world with scattered players, trading and player store system and events*
---
yeah definitely not an mmo, not even a small scale one
---
What does that have to do with the question?
---
And how does throwing money at that do anything if you know they won't fix it anyway?
---
I got the game on xbox 3 or 4 days before 1st launched.
---
In that time I was consistantly harassed and griefed by players with triple digit level characters.
---
I got first just to get away from them.  Now 76 is an enjoyable experience and I find myself really liking the game - without first I would have quit.
---
Whoever comes to my camp is going to be shocked to see all of the Halloween event plans for a 100 caps while everyone else is selling for 2k and up
---
The problem is, that the people buying subscriptions and giving money to shitty dlc and microtransaction practices encourage companies to continue and double down on those practices, making games less enjoyable for all of us
---
Lol I'm 36 and loved me some Oregon Trail back in the early 90s
---
LAAAAAAANAAAAAAA
---
Definitely gotta try this!
---
I'm 240-something and all of a sudden get killed by soft things galore O.O
---
Alright, let's go with your definition just for the sake of it. Now how does that MMO tag justify what I typed earlier?
---
5.56 ammo sells like hot cakes in my camp
---
So much this.
---
For free, just as a feature. I say that as someone who supports the subscription too. This should have been a thing since day 1.
---
They very specifically said it was AA budget at best. They also said that because of that it wasn't meant to be a huge open 60-80 hour experience.
---
Drugs
---
You can open it up but you can't put anything inside unless you have a subscription
---
WHAT?!
---
I only put the plans. There is another more comprehensive list as well of everything that could drop from the event.
---
my justification is that the company needs money, therefore they make something that i need, which causes me to buy that at an affordable price per month
---
*‚ÄúI have enjoyed the game being that I love fallout games‚Äú*- mikenyc721
---
Does this make you a fanboy too?
---
I got 80 karma from saying a dad joke before üòÇ
---
No but it makes you invincible against clowns and fat skeletons.
---
Major Tom? That's sad. I bet the shots never land.
---
Different ammo types should sell when the right players come along. .45 and 5.56 are most popular for me. I price all ammo at 1 cap per. 
---
I sell serums often at 300 caps per. 
---
Acid goes fast, 4 caps per. 
---
If I have extra lead and steel and gunpowder they move well at 1 cap per. 
---
But my best tip for good sales: make it EASY for players to find your vending machines.
---
Ive noticed the same thing since the last patch...full unyielding sent, and suddenly everything is destroying me. My forest scout armor is also now all urban color.
---
And maybe im crazy, but my hunger and thirst meter goes down fast lately.
---
   Im gonna try clearing everything and requiping it as well...heres hoping
---
The same thing can happen with wearing Excavator PA too. The game takes away the +100lbs carry weight ability (bug) you get when loading the game.
---
I don't see why you feel the need to label yourself as 2nd class. It's an optional subscription with a few fringe benefits. It's not like they hand picked half the player base and said "here, these guys get more stuff". It's only $13 a month. If you're that envious of it, then get it for yourself.
---
Didn't answer the question I asked.
---
wow this seems like a good store setup, ill try this
---
also ill make pure water 3 caps instead of 10
---
I thought you were being sarcastic lol. It‚Äôs just for popularity I guess. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è does nothing really
---
So you're okay with the devs selling you the game intentionally broken / limited in order to sell you the workaround because you assume that would be their only way to get a paycheck post-launch?
---
Game purchases and cosmetics (proper ones, not throwaways) should be enough, especially considering their insistance on keeping it cosmetic only.
---
If the devs need to nickel and dime its playerbase in order to stay afloat, isn't it an indicator that it's simply not good enough and should be improved rather than milked?
---
MAWP.
---
The first M stands for massive. This is an MO. Or an MFPSO. Not an mmo.
---
It's all part of the scorched space program. It really makes the grade
---
You seem so against the game and the developers. Why do you even bother posting or playing ?   
---
There is a game here.  Like it or don‚Äôt.  Pay more or don‚Äôt.  Play it or don‚Äôt. 
---
Philosophical stupid questions like this are just beating a dead horse that‚Äôs been dead for a while now.  Move on already.  No one is making you continue your gaming life with this game and the company that makes it. Give it a rest.
---
That's my answer too
---
Jetpacks are common now. Just ask around someone can easily build you one for the scrap. The plans are plentiful as well.
---
Do you not understand that there are mmos that dont partake in such shitty practices and work better that fo76?
---
You don‚Äôt get xp for winning. You do get more the longer you survive though.
---
Winning doesn‚Äôt give xp, but you do get more the longer you survive.
---
Which ones?
---
Bethesda tweaked the damage from mirelurk kings in the vault raids, but in good ole Bethesda style tweaked all mirelurk kings in game by mistake
---
That's what I thought. It doesn't do anything... So why would anyone be posting for the purpose of "farming" karma? Makes no sense.
---
Also, let's say someone was actually doing this, then surely there must exist a more efficient way than posting shitty one liners in the Fallout 76 subreddit? Also, most of comments get voted down, so you'll more likely to *lose* karma to gain any from doing it.
---
There's nothing philosophical about what I asked, even if it was, why not just answer rather than deflect?
---
The known plans for Halloween event I sell for 5k.  They sell out pretty quick so I'm assuming people usually sell them for more
---
I buy every 5.56 I find if it‚Äôs 1 cap. I hit the mother lode at 1 camp last night. 12000 rounds. I‚Äôm good for a few days now!
---
Psycho tats, buff tats, stems, xcell
---
The last true survival game
---
1) they are selling me beneficial items that give me less things to worry about
---
2) nobody is buying the cosmetics, why do you think they‚Äôre adding utility?
---
3) it doesnt matter what they do everyones gonna shit on them
---
Yes i am voting with my wallet
---
Because SWTOR looks worse than 76.
---
Oh did I not answer?  I‚Äôm totally happy.  Even more now that it irritates people like you.  
---
::mothman dance in your face::
---
I just read both of those articles, and nowhere did they mention weapons, armor, or anything else like that.
---
Funny, you sure do like to throw around the word liar. You should change your username to M'aiq.
---
I can use Fusion Cores, all I can get.  On Xbox, Draftiest Drop1
---
The game has been losing money since launch. How do you expect them to pay anyone to fix it?
---
Good, screw Todd and his shitty games.
---
You are over analyzing this. People like recognition, it makes people feel good. Farming karma on here is the same as people posting pictures on Instagram for likes. That‚Äôs how social media works. They want attention it‚Äôs not complicated.
---
It took me 8 server hops for it to spawn. But its definitely the same exact one as the event. I know 100% because it dropped at the event and i also bought it from the toy store.
---
I'm on now - GT: Bratpack911

üòÇüëç
---
Serums, stimpak diffusers, stimpaks, grape mentats, antibiotics, meds at good prices sell well. 
---
Upgraded armor, or weapons. 
---
Purified Water 5caps each you can sell to vendors as well.
---
Can this please come to the US? Was wanting a refund for the game myself
---
Okay thanks for sharing.
---
No. This is how every game that stays active for longer than a year goes. CoD, Borderlands, Battlefield, Fortnite, hell even Minecraft. They ALL have ways to generate revenue after the initial purchase.
---
The fact that so many of you expect this ONE game to just hand you absolutely everything in it for free is ridiculous. There is no precedent for that, and nothing that should have caused you to think that way.
---
üëãüèº
---
Lol I‚Äôm glad you got it. Just glad you didn‚Äôt trade a pirate outfit for it or something! I‚Äôve collected outfits since I started so I found that early on but I rarely had seen it in people inventory. Then when I saw the event rewards I thought, wait wtf that‚Äôs the same one! I hope it can save someone some grief and caps maybe ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
But everyone else who never were and never wanted to be part of it will still have to deal with the consequences.
---
A bunch of games with huge followings had instead been designed from the ground up to be riddled with absurd ways to milk off money from players. Not with an intent to provide a worthwhile experience.
---
**Games that could've great** if making a buck weren't the only goal. That's the real rip-off.
---
I find it pretty easy to not care about things that don't affect me but Fallout means a lot to me so I can't simply ignore anything that can steer it into wherever it's headed.
---
Tolerating an absurdly monetized broken game is one.
---
Well no, you didn't, not the questions I asked you anyway: 
---
"Why encourage that in the first place? Would it not be better if the devs fixed the base game rather than purposely keep the inconveniences to make you pay for the solution? Would it not be better for everyone if devtime was spent (and rewarded) on actual content worth spending money on, rather than being satisfied that you're sold the rest of what you already purchased?"
---
I don't see what's wrong with asking simple questions in a subreddit, ain't that kinda the point? lol
---
Are there? Name one. Go ahead, name an online game that's better, that doesn't have MTX convenience items, a subscription, purchasable DLCs.
---
Xbox 1 i curse younger me for choosing it over a gaming pc
---
Whats that old saying?  "If something sounds too good to be true, it is."
---
If you got any left ill take a couple dextrouspick539
---
Well they're right though. You were asking about Fallout 76 so there was no purchase in Fallout Shelter. Didn't dolve your problem but... you know... they're right!
---
Is the suit rare?
---
OP severely misquoted the articles in question. Apparently you didn't bother to actually read them. 
---
The game is not pay to win. It has it's downsides, yes, but so does every game. Stop expecting everything for free, and stop belittling others who are able to manage their money better than you can, and as such can afford the $13 a month for the little quality of life the subscription gives.
---
Oh ok then you‚Äôre probably not doing it right. The internet never lies
---
Put them in the costume box at the starting point of the mischief event
---
My only argument against this line of thinking: they're paying a premium for content they want. In turn, this gives the devs more capital to add more features to the game. Which should, if implemented correctly, give the F2P base a more enjoyable experience due to there being more content.
---
Don't forget screws, everyone needs those.
---
Oh yea for sure! Just as rare as the other 4 or 5 good drops from the event. Easily worth 9-12 k as of right now with the event still happening. After it‚Äôs over I imagine it will bump up in price.
---
But then, like I said, if they're doing it only for karma then surely there must be a more efficient way to "farm" it. I've been using reddit for 10 years and I've never ever paid attention to karma except for when it's negative, so you have to click to expand someone's message.
---
Thank you.
---
¬£13 a month is a fair bit on top of everything else I have to pay out each month. I don't agree with it but not going to start a debate on it on this thread.
---
&gt;I understand it's your money you can spend it however you want.
---
No you don't. If you did you wouldn't waste peoples time writing this garbage
---
I level up at whitespring only, takes about three to four days of after work play to go from level 2 to 50. It‚Äôs the best spot because everywhere else you spend a lot of time on the road where you literally gain nothing.
---
THANK YOU! I was worried I would have to grind even more for the plans.
---
I'm on PC sadly
---
Yeah I know, I seen more than one person pay 5K plus for a helmet. And I bet they were mad when they seem these post. There was a guy who was commenting on post that had fireman helmets for sale telling people they could buy it for 28 caps at White Springs. Lol
---
What's strange and selfish is being that willfulky ignorant of how a business needs to conduct itself to stay profitable.
---
What are the metrics you're referring to? Do you have a source? Because maintaining a game and servers is expensive, and literally every other game put there has a way to generate revenue after the game releases. Stop expecting this ONE game to be different, just because it would help ease your inflamed sense of entitlement.
---
You're being played again. That's the guilt factor. Companies keep charging you for stuff because the more time and money invested by customers into the product or service, the more satisfied the customer will evidently become, regardless of how good or bad the product or service is. How could the customer possibly hate or ditch something into which they have put so much time and money?  Come on.  Surely you aren't all sheep.  Cut your losses and ditch this godawful garbage.
---
Stop.
---
CoD &amp; Battlefield generate money through annual releases.
---
Fortnite generates its revenue through cosmetics only (cosmetics that people enjoy, not throwaway fps banana tier reskins).
---
Borderlands generates its revenue by selling DLC content through packs
---
Minecraft is a massive success because of its uniqueness, I'm pretty sure they don't make you pay to teleport your diamonds to your chest.
---
Far as I'm aware none of the games you mentioned have done anything comparable to what fo76 does, nor are they creating paid solutions for inconveniences. Basically, these games make money because they're good enough to generate money.
---
Two Spoons of Blamite is my TSE double barrel, from back when they used to be good. I still hold onto it for old times sake.
---
Happened to me once before,  my inventory was suddenly completely empty, quit the game immediately and restarted it, everything came back üëå
---
you visit a low rank and drop them at their camp... they will think you‚Äôre a god and come on here the next day to mention the fact that a ‚Äúnice person‚Äù dropped off fusion cores galore
---

I 100% think the cost is justified. Private sessions are a service. It sucks Bethesda didn't take the time to convert the cost so everyone was paying more or less the same. And it sucks that they used game mechanics as an incentive to purchase the service. But at the end of the day 100 a year or 13.00 a month is absolutely worth it in my opinion.
---
Congratz, seeing as the game will get worse and worse, more and more monetized, getting your money back is definitely a win.
---
I said shitty practices, that does not automatically meab all dlc, mtx and subscription, to a point, all those things are acceptable, but selling a full price game, incomplete at launch and until now, and then locking much needed features that should be free (since its a full price game) behind a paywall, thats shitty.
---
Still, look at eve online, which has for my knowledge only a subscription and is otherwise free, without mtx and dlc
---
Or look at warframe, which has as far as i know it mtx but is free to play and has a lot of content.
---
My point being, somehow those games manage to find a level of monetization that isnt completely greedy and bs
---
I'm dyin' lmao
---
Curious, how do you "win" FO76?  In my experience, it's "play" to win; as those who commit the hours are the ones who are the highest level, with the best weapons, armor, etc.
---
Don't feel bad, I just bought one for my granddaughter, cause her dad has one. :)
---
Implying that players asking for storage solutions and scrap boxes are TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THINGS.
---
Implying that Wastelanders won't be a buggy mess delay or not.
---
and fallout sells utility items and has an atom store which people who actually play the game use and enjoy
---
Giant wall of text that I didn't read. Yup.
---
I'm dead lolol
---
Liar liar pants on fire
---
Damn you again tinnitus
---
1) They made the inconveniences you "worry about" in the first place
---
2) Because a majority of the cosmetics are throwaway fps banana tier reskins for items nobody uses, ontop of this they're overpriced, laziness and lack of knowledge of your playerbase's typical choice of gear is no excuse for adding tape for a leaky pipe.
---
3) People shit on them for the overwhelming amount of bad decisions taken in an incredibly short timespan, they're hardly recognizable compared to pre 76. That's still no reason to encourage crappy practices.
---
You have to pay for Fallout 76 before you're able to sub to it too.
---
Fallout 1st, i wish it was an accident lol
---
If that's so, it should have been less than $60.
---
I finished it in a few days.
---
The problem being, that fo75 has no f2p base, since it is a full price game.
---
The should have enough capital to add features and even if they dont, there has not been much content for the non subsciption players, in contrary, they took content which should have been free and monetized it
---
