As soon as I get near anyone with open mic and bullshit going on over it, I’m out. Especially smacking, chewing, yelling in background, etc.   Server hop.
---
---
---
I wanna do it but man that’s quest was so boring
---
Is it like fasnacht on the hour, every hour?
---
Why the fuck were they not part of the original Wastelanders release in the first place?
---
I'm trying ;) please help spread the word! Some people making this event a lot more difficult then it needs to be.
---
The 90% reduced weight will only apply to the weapon's base weight (not the mods) because reasons.
---
People need to accept that you aren't gonna be able to get all your MTXs for free anymore. That's not how they work and frankly Bethesda was nuts for ever setting them up that way.
---
Amen to CSS full health builds. Every bloody always standing around being more worried about one shotting everything.
---
I've been wearing the plague doctor mask with the Science Scribe outfit and Field Scribe hat. Full coverage for maximum protection from the new Scorched Plague!
---
That's usually my go to protocol as well but I wanted to TRY and do that event first. 
---

---
That was my mistake.
---
Stingwings and playing as a heavy gunner.  Nightmare.
---
I always join when I see it up.
---
You on pc?  I'll trade a mask for a costume :)
---
Enclave, more like Encringe
---
Could always do an ammo swap through the ammo converter if you have it, or another camp? I'd offer but am on PS4.
---
There's a spot where you place tent and it causes all the mobs to spawn on top of the generator. Ez 1-2k exp per wave if you manage to tag all the mobs. And it's easy to do with a tesla or grenade launcher, which by the way drops from said mobs.
---
The high level Mr Gutsys. I would not be surprised if 3 of them could take out a SBQ. If I’m not in Power Armor I get melted.
---
Not sure I've ever seen this
---
The event really isnt that great, trust me. It will not take over as the main event, Scorched Earth is still superior. 
---
I know its new and you console players want to try it out for yourself, but seriously its not amazing by any stretch. It will be farmed for a while, then once most players have the rewards they want from it, it will go the way of PP.
---
I already did that questline I'm just unlucky
---
Whenever i have to defend a workshop from molerats i just walk away and leave. Not worth it. Especially cus its ALWAYS like 3 waves.
---
Side note, why are deathclaws such wimps in this game? they're supposed to be one of the most dangerous creatures of the wasteland, but they're weak AF.
---
I think the black prospectors hat fits better big black rimmed hat
---
at this point I'd you're failing the event you deserve it
---
Nice tysm. What's the amount in dmg decrease doe?
---
People on this sub sure do like buicks huh
---
If you read the dialogue and listen to the holotapes it's actually one of the best imo, pretty messed up though. Plus way better putting time into vs SBQ once you have the drops. SBQ offers xp off of trash mobs, crap legendary, and all of your ammo poof.
---
No PA, Im using random normal Armor parts that fits my needs.
---
1 for weapon weight reduction, 1 for junk weight reduction, more resistance with mutations and 2 free falling armor so i can completely ignore fall damage.
---
Had chameleon but that disappeared so im looking out for it atm.
---
yeah well
---
Looks awesome! I thought they patched double walls though?
---
The good drops like plans and outfits trigger at 75 ore. If you hit 100 you get a bit more ammo aid etc but the stuff we care about happens after 75.
---
Mirelurk Hatchlings. Fuck those little sand flea assholes. I'm busy killing your mother, stop nibbling on my ankle in the grass that's taller than you are, you little shits.
---
At least you cna try to vats dogs or wolves. Mole rats are just impossible to hit no matter what.
---
That's what I thought.. Sorry bro. If you were on Xbox I'd hook you up.
---
A normal near-complete set of Vanguard armor the majority of the time. 
---
My Excavator power armor when I’m doing Lode Bearing or anytime I think there will be lots of charred beefy boyes. Also when in nuke zones.
---
Sbq is boring too. Every quest in this game is boring. Some just happen to be funny and boring like the dmv one lol
---
Huh I've only ever seen the barrel drop at teir 4.
---
So you're saying you're fine with people grinding out 100k atoms because they finished the Legendary Run in the first week since they can play 24/7 and Bethesda making everything on the atom shop costing 10x as much as they do now?
---
I'm not.  Bad idea.
---
Just buy the plan and save yourself the troubles
---
Dasguy25 shoot me a invite next time you see me on
---
Every radaway removes 1 random mutation. Another roll of the dice
---
you: has marsupial and speed demon
---
Glowing ones or some shit: *waves arms*
---
You: *dies of rads*
---
YEP
---
Are you sure those 'lows' are at least 21 years of age? I may have to call the police protectrons...
---
Buy it from where? Like a player?
---
I can't image how this would go over on my PS4. The game barely functions as is. It's fun finishing quests about viral inoculation, just wish there was some bug squashing going on too instead of shoveling garbage on top of garbage.
---
I know in some cases it's a Sony thing, not a Bethesda thing, they havent had the greatest relationship, but meh, we'll see.
---
Some of the repeat posts are bots, they're cut and paste of previous posts and they pop up every month or whatever.
---
It's easier to roll back on pc
---
Collecting all Plans, getting better Armor and weapons and tons of junk collecting.
---
Some random nukes and SBQ bc the Silo Runs are pretty fun and every event that appears.
---
And capturing all workshops i come by.
---
“Grahm? That... green... MEAT HEAD... could not even hold... my... oil pan. Boom. Got him.” — Insult Bot, probably
---
It needs to be separated from the open world. Too big, such bad lag.
---
That is the dumbest thing I've heard all day. It requires other people to complete. Go try it by yourself see how far you get.
---
Never seen it and it's not on SS
---
Genius coding.
---
"Californian sniper attempts to walk to the store..."
---
F
---
yep
---
I actually didn’t know they were rare. I kept getting them as often as I got the white fedora hats. I just dropped most of them on the floor or sold them at my vendor for 500 caps. 
---
I’ll keep an eye out for them now.
---
I must admit I once followed Grahm for a while on the road, just listening to his words as Chally and I walked the path of trade.
---
I mean its been out 4 days so maybe Consoles should have access.
---
As much hate as I see about the DMV quest I really enjoyed it. DMV is legit the worst customer support. "May I please have that pen for the one line I missed filling out?" "Go TO tHe bACk Of tHE lInE aND WaIt aNOtHeR 45 mInUTes biTcH!"
---
If they shower you with atoms everything on the store would have to be more expensive.  They are thinking business, you aren't.
---
&gt;	Just add Vaccine: [Mutation name]. Remove [mutation] and prevents you from getting that mutation again for 72 IRL hours.
---
Add them as new rare plans that drop from upcoming BoS content and you got yourself a winner.
---
Correct but pass/fail is 25. So take your lickings if you don't get to 75. I can often push hard enough with ore to get to almost 50 alone. More often than not there's another person running. I promise you, having played this a lot since beta, is one legendary board games are done, so are the events. Right now is a golden time for events. I've never seen so many people do these nor see the succeed so much. That's not going to last.
---
I would delete all my vendors
---
&gt; They will burrow up to impossible places- on top of roofs ect.
---
Oh come on, you don't think mole rats could theoretically burrow into the floor of an open-grate metal catwalk suspended in the air? ;)
---
[removed]
---
Mixed between charred feral ghouls and wendigoes. Both of them constantly stagger me and I use heavy energy guns. Not only do they take forever to charge up but there's a delay with shooting/stimpacking and movement with the weapons. Nightmare all round.
---
Stingwings... using my 50. They always strafe and just so hard to hit even with vats then swarm me and give me tons of radiation
---
You have to scrap handmades/lever actions to get 90% of the mods.
---
Edit: You have to scrap any weapon/armor to get the mods besides a few you buy from vendors.
---
Main Quests gives a decent amount plus its fun. Then Wastelanders.
---
Obviously killing things give great XP, some stronger creatures can reward you with up to 500 xp.
---
My friend got the backpack at less than 75. I'm sure being Bethesda it's not a perfect situation... But I rely on datamine information for my war plans.
---
You’ll join my luck team and you’ll enjoy it, buster!
---
I usually do it if I see it pop up and I'm in the mood to deal with all of the screaming. It's fun with a jetpack, especially if there's another person there without a jetpack:)
---
As far as i know yes.
---
The only times I do not go for the ore with my Chinese Stealth Armour equipped is when I can tell the group I’m working with can’t handle without the extra gun defending. Working with a group of three or four people that go down to the event now, it’s a challenge balance defending and grabbing, especially once the DCs and Floaters spawn in as well.
---
Mainly, I grab the ore from all of the areas then “tap” someone out to do the same. Then, we deposit at the same time and that’s enough to complete the event or close enough that one other person would need to grab a couple more ores.
---
We, your compadres in auto-completion hell, are here for you buddy.  Try reciting our serenity prayer:  
---
God, grant me the SERENITY to accept the challenges that auto-complete, the AMMO to finish the challenges I can, and the WISDOM to know the difference.  Also, Todd Howard sucks.  Amen.
---
Pretty sure it cant be furious and quad...
---
Mirelurk king rules them all.
---
I've just been going there around the top of the hour, so I'm not getting an event icon, just FT to Vault 76, and it's about 30 seconds to run over there.
---
More salt for meeeee.
---
I was killed by that a couple days ago. Like ratatat dead.that gun doesn't shoot this fast...
---
Some morons also use mouse and keyboard on consoles. On battlefield I had no problem trashing them,but this game's gunplay is too strange and they can easily dominate.
---
It cost money to update games through consoles. It has ro be scheduled. And they probably have a fix for ounce of prevention. And it is most likely will come Tuesday.

Two weekends back a player here organized a team to run it on XBox, and five of us played for hours.  Good times
---
Backpack? There isn't a backpack plan in radiation rumble is there?
---
I collect greens for Chally, clean up piles and add in Prime meat. But mainly the greens :). I love to do this event and progress towards the end. But, I dont like when some players dont do anything much :(.
---
Its just knowing I can just focus on stuff like collecting scrap again, in between meat week events. Its nice. Then knowing I can enjoy having a break. But im looking forward to season 2 as well! Especially with legendary perks and daily ops. Well unless its indefinitely delayed on console of course. It probably will be. Im sure Bethesda can find some way to fuck it up for console users.
---
Ah that one would have been good if the plague doctor mask didn’t clip through the top of it.

Reminds me of Path of Exile

Nah all we need is a single tribesman and he'll handle it

Rose’s quests were raider quests.
---
Edit: I misread. You meant events not quests. Ope.
---
Ward, no matter how many bullets i put into him, he just will not die!
---
but Stingwings for me, i never have poison resistance plus they are a pain to hit.
---
Lol. Bethesda is here to make money. The shift into Seasons and elimination of Atom rewards for dailies was literally to set people up to buy Atoms to finish the seasons. That's Atom store is pointless if people can earn Atoms in game and not spend real dollars. As if the 150 atoms per rank is not a giveaway for this tactic.
---
So creepy. I slap that jukebox anytime I enter lmao
---
I still feel like we're lacking inbred mutant mountain men. They got close with the swampfolk in Point Lookout for FO3, but I was honestly surprised that a Fallout game set in Appalachia doesn't have any mutated hillbillies in it..
---
That's the whole point of the end fight; you are given a timer with about 20-30 spare seconds to get out and do stuff. You can use that for randacking or when it's health is low, you start grabbing stuff. The whole point of the end is to grab whats important to you and get the hell out. I love the finale: explosions everywhere and the door at the end doesn't open but is blown the hell up and has a good amount of stuff to make up for the items you have to fix. I just wish that we escaped and were still inside a safe zone where we couldn't be killed from radiation.
---
Crosses fingers we'll get the carry capacity mods for secret service armor too...
---
Grahm is fucking adorable. I love him so much. He gets so excited and seems to just love everything... l just want to hug the crap outta him...

Once your camp is placed you can move it around freely wherever you want.

That's still possible. The others are prefixes though.
---
One million upvotes for this. They have crap loot, they explode so melee is a bad idea, and they hide underground so you can't snipe them either. On top of that, they replaced a bunch of spawns of enemies that are actually worth fighting with garbage floaters.
---
Since you are on PC, install the chat mod.
---
People tend to call it if it pops up on the server they are on.
---
Spoiled Brahmin milk for me. Gives 30 rads per unit, with 3% food and 8% water. And at 0.25lb it weighs less than toxic goo or dirty water. Just build a Brahmin pen at your camp and you have easy access to it whenever you return to your camp. Other easy locations to find Brahmin in are at Flatwoods, East/West Bend tunnel, during the Riding Shotgun event, and at the Wayward.
---
The only bummer is having to wait for the Brahmin milk to spoil, but having Brahmin milk on hand is pretty handy too for when you overshoot on ingesting rads. It removes 25 rads instead of the 150 from diluted radaway for more precise rad management.

I may be mixing this with shotgun for this drops. I think it may have been the barrel. I'm looking for datamine info right now to get my facts straight before I continue to open my mouth 😂
---
Those mother fucking bullet sponging charred ferral ghouls. Although I remember early when I first started playing, the scorched were the most despised due to their health pool and utter lack of loot.
---
Nope. Neither does energy resistance.
---
Did they change it at some point?
---
Even then sometimes you need a super. Usually theyre so fast that it's almost impossible to react in time with the animation.
---
Reload and try this;
---
Make sure you go through the doors down to the lab, not through the hole in the floor.
---
Then put the blood sample in the centrifuge, then analyze. Don’t put the T-fuse in until you do that. 
---
It’s a weird glitch but that usually works.
---
[Original post that helped me](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i3ypq7/stuck_on_analyzing_blood_sample_quest/g187woo/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)
---
I really want to avoid bloodied tbh. Just too game-y for me, would rather have other builds that worked decently or even function instead of one build that never varies
---
Just like the idiots getting pissy about dancing at the scorched queen
---
I think it comes down to 'if i see enough people I'll join too' thing.  If I'm on my bloodied i will almost always as i have one chameleon with my bloodied armor pieces and a bloddied fixer.  I can take out the minion bots without them noticing
---
Ghouls are worse. With the stupid lunge attack that makes them pass through my body.
---
It happens to all automatic weapons when there's a lot of players or NPCs around.
---
I don't have a SS chest piece, but do run this on my marine armor one.  This site shows it available, maybe go check Regs.  Can't login at the moment to confirm  [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Secret\_Service\_armor](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Secret_Service_armor)
---
Oh! Haha, I didnt even realized they said 40! 🤣
---
this.
---
I personally haven't got this myself, and I was online before and after the ticking over. 
---
It's a bug, and others have got the same thing. If you contact Bethesda about it, you'll be recommended to submit a ticket, but other than that, you've lost your score for the day... Sorry
---
Not true. If you have 6 people on spits and drums during the 2min timer, you will be at the 2nd reward at the start. And if 6 ppl stay on them for the duration, meater will not decrease, and event won’t fail. All you need is one extra person running around turning greens and critters in and you get top rewards.
---
why server hop? just mute them.
---
40 seems a bit off, right?
---
You're forgetting about the shit RNG. I've completed it successfully close to 30 times now, and I still haven't got the rad barrel plan or the rad suit. So I just kill ghouls for XP now.
---
You are possibly the most toxic and disgusting person I have encountered on this forum. Must be a lonely and sad existence. Good luck with that!
---
Just hop to a different server. It happened to me at least once already
---
You already have a backpack, right?
---
What you get is just a skin.
---
Pretty cool idea!
---
It doesn’t even prompt me to put the blood sample in the centrifuge
---
Handmade is nice. It's lowest level is 15. I'm using a bloodied lv 15 one.
---
Oh
---
Going to the official forums can be a quick way to see it was moved to at least Tuesday
---
Doing the ore is so easy, I usually get 52-54 ore per run but sometimes I get pissed because there will be 5 or more people protecting and they some how manage to let the ghouls kill the workers, like how tf
---
it doesnt last 100 days, it is 100 levels
---
I’ve got it purchased on steam , so I did know there was mods lol how do I acquire them ?
---
Works with ps4 too, I've been AFK on the drums for the last 7 hours
---
We should get an emote for it .
---
Because trading during an event instead of helping is freeloading. I’d honestly fail on purpose to teach you a lesson.
---
lol Too true!
---
Damn! This has happened twice since the double score weekend, leaving me with 2 days of double score. Not 4 😣.
---
Thanks for the info, though!
---
Really enjoyed a full health shotgun build. Used an instigating explosive combat shotgun. Full HP is nice because you can have whatever perks and armor you want!
---
Start drumming before the event even starts. Somebody did that and the event lasted about a minute. Oh, and tell people to do so through your group chat on your headset
---
It's so easy to die though.
---
I believe they're only found in that type of climate
---
But knowing Bethesda they'll find someway to add them in like they did with radscorpions being peoples pets.
---
And why are the boss Mole Rats skinned to look like Radscorpions?
---
There’s a semi truck near the main gate behind that truck is a telephone pole you place your fallout 1st tent by that pole and it causes them to spawn at the sonic generator in a big ball.
---
Excavators for the carry weight and 42% damage reduction.  Vampire's gauss minigun for immortality.

I forgot it’s been like 3 days since I played and I know for a fact I have no fusion cells 😭😭😭
---
Can I book a tour?
---
I'm leveling a Wyatt Earp Gunslinger now, that I will eventually transform into a John Wick Pistol Gorilla once someone kills his pet.  Definitely a change of pace with the pistols, it's actually a challenge at moments.
---
this is correct, several weapons will only drop with limb damage as a second star in the wild.
---
Public teams is one of the best newer features. I’ve met some great players and made some new friends because of this. 
---
One guy guided me through the Enclave quests and helped me become a general. Last week somebody here on reddit offered assistance for running silos. I took the offer, we met up online and I launched my very first nuke at level 101. 
---
Felt pretty awesome. Pretty much the whole server came together to battle the queen for our 1* Nocturnal Rolling Pin.
---
Have you guys fixed this? This is happening to me and showing that my friends list is all offline, but I can join their world still even tho it's grayed out. To them I appear to be offline as well.
---
Things I've tried: Reinstalling, moving to another SSD, relogging in and out of XGP, I'm not sure what to do other than to make a ticket with support.
---
The bloodied kit allows you to play any way you want to, there is some risk from poison but legendary effects on armor counteract that. For example if you want to play fast melee you use a vampire weapon, you get a 45% chance to avoid all damage so you'll be tanky and still kill stuff quickly. The same goes for any weapon or style, it just opens a lot of doors since it's not so heavily reliant on damage perk cards to out compete other builds.
---
Also, if you know the Challys Feed recipe, use that, the feed pile is in front of the greens
---
Absolutely. Man's gotta make a living out here and them scorchbeasts ain't gonna kill themselves.
---
True.  I should have said drop group on that. I was thinking of the poor performance of the event also.   I've had servers with hot fun events, and lousy ones.  I just hop when no one shows up to ones i can't solo or am just too lazy to, lol
---
You're right there is a low RNG to have a chance to get one of the items (still looking for datamine source). The point is right now everyone plays radiation rumble. Most for xp. Those who want to drops need to hustle the ore. Those people who are getting xp have either gotten all the drops or are part of communities where success is guaranteed if they do it. Solo players or casuals need to take advantage of the spike and run ore themselves. Its the best you can do and complaining about others not running ore is nothing more than a vent of frustration and will give no results. The RNG is shit only to keep you coming back. If it were higher the events would be under manned more often and this place would be filled with "no one does these events and I can't get the drops."
---
Hey now, Modus has a very trustworthy smile. Why would Modus just 'use' us?
---
Got it working, thank you!
---
Plus some silly costumes and a neat grill.  
---
As far as "something to do" goes, it's pretty good.
---
I have never played this event. Nor shall I ever. I’m high level and have played since the beginning. I seriously don’t want to deal with you people. That goes for both sides, you noobs and you elitist “do everything my way” shites. There is absolutely no reward worth it.
---
I think once you play the event for yourself, you'll understand.  There's a *lot* going on.
---
Had the same experience a few hours ago; one other player and I hopping on the pylons and killing bots, a whole bunch of people standing dead still on the outskirts of the event, and the guy that started it hiding in the cabin crouched in a corner. In any other event I couldn't care less about freeloaders, but if you aren't going to contribute in Encryptid then please don't bother coming.
---
Thanks! Totally reminded me I meant to look at the ingredients earlier 😂
---
I'd craft a fixer for you. Ign yiphix if you want.
---
That is the best way I've ever heard someone describe floaters. You made me crack up. Well done.
---
You’re welcome!  I ran into that about an hour ago myself and found a link to that solution.
---
Makes sense though
---
[deleted]
---
I would argue that the current perk system is broken enough to warrant the change OP has mentioned.
---
Wait till you meet an assaultron
---
Only if the dance includes a full out run through Watoga.
---
You can totally snipe buried floaters! If it looks like a [Snork](https://www.google.com/search?q=snorks&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en-us&amp;client=safari) is sticking out of the ground in the middle of a floater cloud (idk what the proper term for that is called) you can shoot the snorkel to get a hit. I’ll try to double check when I get on soon, but I’m pretty sure their name won’t pop up on your hud when you aim at it while it’s buried, but if your shot connects it will hit. Most of the time I’m lucky and I can one-shot them before they pop out of the ground. I also haven’t had the others pop out when I kill one in the group, so I can usually kill them all without having to fight them directly. Fighting ones out in the wild can still be a pain in the butt, but ever since I found this out it has made dealing with buried ones so much easier.
---
Edit: a word
---
This broken game.
---
Just pretend deathclaws dont exist?
---
Only in 5's.
---
I have Escape Artist as well.

u/Ladydevann plz

PUBG test server isn't exclusive to Insiders, can't say about Minecraft. As to why Bethesda hasn't added a PTS, one reason: $$$. Those asshats are too cheap to add it.
---
Cool plans
---
Did you happen to check the map? I'm asking because I've noticed a bug recently where players log out or get disconnected but their "ghost body" is still there and appears afk. I moved my camp to a location a bit south of Foundation and at first it seemed like a lot of players were afking in my camp. Then I began to wonder why a woman would've decided to afk on the stairs which lead up to my workbench shed. When I checked the map, I realized that she wasn't actually there. Ever since then, at least half of the "afk" players at my camp have not actually been connected to the server. I'm not sure whether other people also see their "ghost bodies" at my camp or not.   
---
It's possible that the event could have an issue where it would spawn additional enemies based on the number of players but then not recognize that some players had disconnected and/or left the event when the next round began... ;(
---
Fuck the exp grinders in a game about getting levels? 🤔 Seems like you have more of a problem with how Bethesda has implemented and executed certain systems and events in the game but you think the players are to blame. Interesting.
---
There are two different events, you doing the Prime Meat event which pops up. The grill event is just under the vault, no crazy creatures to kill, cute costumes to win. Even Grahm says humans love prizes which is funny. I am not clear the prime meat event actually does, I know you have to turn in the meat at the other event, for more rewards maybe ?
---
Really? I can't get their names to show and they don't show up in vats, so I didn't think they could be hit. I've tried grenades on them too with no luck.
---
I’m more excited to be able to scrap all my non used perk cards/packs and levels that way I can swap cards without the extra 2 steps!
---
Need to put a PSA out the for Radiation Rumble too.  Either people just collect ore or just kill mobs.  Neither at the same time.
---
No..stingwings, are the worst ever 😤
---
Yeah I encounter it last night but I figured I try again later, I had a fine time my first play through but I decided to start a new character cause I had been playing pre wastelanders and thought I’d have a more enjoyable story experience if I restarted so I’m glad it’s working cause I wouldn’t want to start over a third time
---
I used to do bloodied heavy gunner, now I have a vampire's.  I literally can't die.  I was standing under the falling debris in the wendigo event which pretty much instantly kills anyone, but shooting at earlier and I wasn't dying.  The true power of vampire's.

This is my first time doing the Event at all. I looked up a quick guide on it. I drop the meat, throw sticks on the fire, clean up, get the Grass, and then jump on a Spit or Drum for the rest of the time.
---
Yes.  Unless you are into NW, then no.  Hackers galore in NW
---
They died to the scorched plague that we created. Checkmate.
---
The Real TODD
---
Having FUN
---
Nah, the problem with having them tied to perk cards is threefold:
---
Some folks “lost” perk cards from packs (an issue with duplicate cards when you had all ranks) so they’d be disadvantaged.
---
Changing SPECIAL loses you perk cards. People who have changed SPECIAL to any degree would be punished for it under the current system. 
---
Some people keep multiple versions with different ranks of perks for different Loadouts. They would also be “punished” for this.
---
Just tie it to levels but NOT perk cards.
---
I have a legacy flamer stocked to the ceiling with fuel and no power armor. I'm going to keep mowing down ghouls by the hundreds and never touch a piece of ore. Why? Because of how this game is set up. You're rewarded less for doing the actual event. If I have all of the event rewards what's the point? Don't hate the player hate the game. 
---
It's like the people that complain about NW campers.. if that's how the mode was designed that's how people are going to play it.
---
Rad scorpions, all the issues of a Mole Rat plus the will hide underground until you step on the ground.
---
Pleaseeee no
---
Pick the armor that makes sense for you.  You can't even use an unarmed weapon in pa.
---
You are free to rejoin the union or die, that's 2 full choices.
---
It sucks, I just have to hope it doesn't happen to me. Happy grinding 😅
---
Same. I like to be able to wear outfits. I have the stealth suit in my favorite wheel. Also carry my Excavator Armor in my inventory for obvious reasons.
---
Time to put it down for a while.  Gaming should be fun, not a chore.
---
Xbox here, so communication isn't a problem. Bethesda excels at environmental storytelling and Fallout 76 is on par with fo4.
---
I'm one of the people who preferred the holotape and terminal aesthetic that we had to start with, I feel that the game is a bit too crowded right now. The desolate feeling is gone.
---
Bear Arm plan, Arktos Pharma backpack, Formula P recipe and stimpack diffuser recipe are the ones I can think of off the top of my head.
---
Preach.
---
Wall hanger.
---
I'm glad you are enjoying it, but I'm bored with it already.  I enjoyed Fasnacht a lot more.
---
It is, but all the ones I’ve attended finished very quickly. Like under a minute quickly. So you have to be punctual in a way you didn’t for fasnacht.
---
Go to fort defiance. Check the terminal to the right of the main entrance. It will give you free plans for the Brotherhood Recon Rifle which is a fully modded and scoped out sniper rifle. It doesn't cost a lot to make and it comes with all the mods when you craft it.
---
That perk is simply not worth it.
---
Lowest dmg i have everseen
---
So what I've started doing is dropping some Chally's Feed and wood on the ground a few minutes before the hour, and then hopping on drums or spit.
---
You get rewarded even if you don't get/turn in Prime Meat. That's for a buff. I've missed a lot of them and simply did as much as I could during the Cookout.    
---
I got the entire Chef's Bloodied outfit, the cow grill, stien, display, flag, Chally Recipe which gives +2 Luck. I got the Moo outfit and put it in my vendor b/c I'm not that big on cosmetics.    
---
I got two of the Tenderizer mods but no Tenderizer. This char isn't a melee build at all and my working melee/mule is level 13. The extra script is helpful should we get that bonus Purveyor sale.
---
My rule of thumb is to travel to V76 at x:58 or x:59, run past the liberators and hop on a spit or a drum. Easy way to guarantee you won't miss it and usually there's enough fellow players doing the same that the bar is progressed halfway as soon as it starts.
---
I believe it only drops if you get 100 ore in the hopper.  Anything less is wasted effort because you have 0% chance of getting it.
---
For fuck sake, you're LITERALLY in a thread  talking about people that have already finished the season and haven't needed to buy a single rank.  The only people buying ranks are idiots who were too lazy to grind and wanted everything immediately or people who got into this shit SUPER late.
---
No shit Bethesda is in this to make money either way, they're not a video game charity.
---
You can do all 3 of those quests for both factions.  I would recommend it.
---
It pings on the map at the beginning of every hour. Look at a clock and hop over to the area before it starts.
---
Scrip and something to do
---
I wish they would implement some mechanism to let you advertise what you have, better than the popup.  Maybe let you name your camp?  I would love to have "Serum Shack" listed along with my list of items for sale
---
Also if you're on PC add me HotMessMandy I will gift you some things
---
I think its moreso because everyone goes to these spots already so chances are someone farmed and area right before you joined/fasttraveled
---
Ahh thanks! So mid September, so assume the 15th of Sept, which makes the length 77. So on day 55, that is 71%, so need to be at level 81
---
Just a tad...
---
I've gotten over 2000 score still despite completing Seasons last night. I have no interest in doing them anymore so I shouldn't be getting score......unless they're banking it for Season 2, not telling us, and will tell is it's another 'glitch'.
---
bruh this hurts to read
---
Mole rats suck during primal cuts, because I keep VATSing them instead of the prime beasts.
---
Just almost twice as much.
---
Yeah and rank 4 is 100 Ore, I got 99 Ore today and it was only 3/4!
---
I feel so dead right now.
---
How much does it actually reduce stagger?
---
I have a low level character (30) I am working on and I dont have the firepower to compete with the endgamers who show up and literally nuke the wild animals. I dont have a fast connection so fires are usually put out before I get to them.
---
So I drum my little heart out until my hands get raw, in the hopes that I am helping the team.
---
Worst enemy is anything that poisons. 
---
Probably mirelurk king
---
You can mod a 50 receiver
---
I think it’s in the room with medical supplies before you exit the cave
---
That is fucking sexy
---
R.I.P
---
F em.  I have stealth melee and commando builds and I hold my own.  I keep those wendigos off those bastards so they can focus on Earl.
---
Dude was an asshole
---
use VATS, dummy. DUH!
---
*proceeds to miss mole rats 30 times in a row with a 94% chance to hit*
---
*dies from poison*
---
Id absolutely be ok with a paid card system like Encrypted has to trigger these events that need large teams. It would be an ok cap sink for those of us with nothing left to spend caps on and give us some control over the events. 
---
An elevator keycard to get to the basement of Arktos would be perfect.
---
You can either manually install the mods, or use the mod manager.
---
Google "FO76 Nexus Mods"
---
No, its the charred ghouls and you cannot change my mind. It wasnt until level 50 that i felt like i could effectively fight one, they run way too fucking fast so i cant run and heal, 70% of the time they cripple me on their first hit so running usually never works, they are usually in big groups, it takes them like 3 fucking hits to kill me, they destroy my armour so godamn quick i might as wear none so it doesnt get destroyed during the fight, and they piss me off so godamn much ide usually end up just saying fuck my loot im not coming back here. White springs pissed me off so much and i avoided every inch of it unless i seriously need to go there. Now im a higher level so i just pull out a minigun but they use so much ammo to kill i usually end up running out of ammo to fight. Also im sorry but mole rats are usually a one hit kill enemy so ill never have an issue with them like i have with those godamn charred ghouls. They have made me rage quit and i wish bethesda would change how fast they can fucking move, its ridiculous. One second its like 50 yards away, next thing you know its right in your face and you have barely damaged the mother fucker.
---
I try this and end up solo over and over.
---
Exactly.
---
Time to mail Todd Howard a box of Salt Shakers
---
Prime meat event gives you treasury notes and prime meat. Prime meat gets turned in for scrip. 1 for 1.
---
I see no one has really stepped up to help you. 
---
Hopefully you have the enforcers card. Equip that and a shotgun and take out their legs. 
---
Problem is that's an open area and their head is still active. Concentrate on that next, disable the head laaer fast, from cover where available. 
---
They still can kill you but they're significantly less mobile. Continue to shoot them or get around back and melee them.
---
Yeah absolutely dumb. Its so much better to complete the event than get a crap legendary. 
---
I always stay by the animal and try and friendly fire it to full health.
---
it’s a game about getting loot, so yes, the players who think it’s about something else are to blame since they’re actively going for something that doesn’t matter.
---
When I run low on disease cure I just equip Green Thumb and have a nice 15 minute frolic along the river in the forest region. Blood leaf and snaptail in the river, firecap all around. I usually come away with enough to make 25 cures if I craft them with Super Duper. I find it relaxing.
---
Its got a decent selection already. But im always down for more
---
Hemlock holes for acid. Icw escavator torso and lucky hole runs for 2k lead
---
I doubt they'd keep backups.  But this is why you back stuff up, although I don't know if you can with this game.
---
Indeed! Quite humorous!
---
Yeah ive goten it twice. And i used to grind like crazy when it first came out. Its ashame because its so much fun.
---
Nuked multiple bases?
---
If you have all the items loot doesn't matter either...
---
I have every event reward, and every weapon I want. I don't even loot enemies anymore. Exp is the only thing I can grind for and since it counts towards SCORE you're an actual {FUN LOVING BOY} 🤣👍
---
-Edited for Political Correctness-
---
Before you get to that, does everyone know you can access the map while sleeping, or playing instruments?  I was stoked when I figured that out
---
I was late to Seasons, I switched from XB1 to PC and started a new character, purely out of frustration for Xbox loading times lol
---
You're honestly doing more good doing that then a bunch of people chasing after the same exact objective. There are really only so many animals spawning and one good shot kills all the ones in that general area. Then trying to find the corpses 😂
---
ah thx
---
Just take an unowned one
---
Yeah their names don’t really show up at all but you can sometimes get it to flash if you get the right angle while aiming around over their head. They key is finding the Snork looking antenna thing that sticks out of the ground to know if there is really one in the ground, then you should be good to go!
---
I play on xbox, so I'm not sure its even possible on my end.
---
you have all items? 
---
good thing that that’s not possible in this game, thanks for trying a comeback.
---
Dont you have to type the charcters name in to delete them? This is on ps4 and I'm so greatful for that, sorry man and good luck
---
I posted elsewhere but an elevator keycard that is purchasable at vendors would work well. 
---
They have a cool down for encrypted of one hour, i wonder if they could somehow just make the scorched earth, encrypted, colossal problem and project paradise all need to be say 30 minutes apart before any others can be triggered to avoid overlaps
---
Yes! Rose is the only NPC besides Beckett that I actually like in this game.
---
How do you not die of hunger?
---
Yeah, I'm on pc so at least I have a chance.  Consoles scare me.
---
Theres also two bear arm mod plans apparently, and the arktos lab coat.
---
I agree and I thought that's how they originally said they were doing to do it, but that's never come to fruition in the PTS.
---
Yes a thousand times yes!
---
You're missing one of the best ones.  
---
"Grahm only eats meat.  Humans eat not meat.  Graham does not understand why.  But we cook green things for humans if you find some"  
---
Or something like that I may have the exact wording wrong but this one is legit important I think.
---
All the event items, sorry I forgot you're an {FALLOUT 76 PLAYER} 🤣🤣👍
---
When you delete a character the game asks you to write the name of the character to confirm. So you accidentally typed the wrong name? Or did you decide to make both characters have the same name?
---
If you do it again please let me know!!
---
Idk man.  I got a tse gauss rifle from the event so...
---
The legendary glowing Mirelurk deep king in the Wendigo cave is a miserable fucking bastard
---
What people don't mention about Molerats is that their AI is actually pretty smart when it comes to them attacking. I live right on a spawn of three molerats so they are pretty much my sworn enemy for that character. They constantly choose to attack only when you are crafting or in menus; sometimes burrowing in the same spot for 10 minutes just to come out of the blue when busy doing things. They also know the exact location and blind spots of all turrets and will always exploit them unless they are chasing someone specifically. Only way I can deal with them is placing punji boards in the turret blind spots so they rip themselves apart on them while trying to get at the turrets. I would say radscorpions are more dangerous but the small hitboxes on the mole rats make them more annoying by far.
---
I have 1 for 5k
---
Anything that lets us organize it, I’d be good with. I love Project Paradise and I think it’s such a shame to see it just go to waste.
---
Thanks, and you do, but I think it might be because of the similar name, lag and just bad luck.
---
and yet what’s being talked about is legendaries. 
---
there is certainly an idiot here and it’s definitely not me since i can read.
---
And something I think about occasionally.  Grahm is such a good being.  My understanding of the FEV is that it brings out all of your anger and rage and just keeps it at the top.  So imagine how good of a person Grahm must have been before he got turned.
---
PSA:  DO center the nuke on Monogah Mine.
---
Why you may ask?
---
So you can get some free junk loot from the people who do the mission without power armor when they come out, since they are most likely bloodied they don't last long.....
---
MUAHAHAHHAHAHA
---
Hadn’t thought of it that way and I can see the uproar it would cause you’re right.
---
hopefully they at least enable them in the two week break as you say.
---
Yeah I didn't notice either because i wear 5 pieces of WW reduction armor.
---
I guess Monday
---
Stingwings.
---
There's shenanigans afoot.
---
That's actually really great.
---
Prime Meat isn't worth doing imo. 
---
The true incentive for Meat Week are the outfits and plans from the cookout. Especially the ability to roll legendary tenderizers if you get the plan. 
---
Mama mumbles gave me an AASS+1STR and its a fantastic weapon
---
Don't feel bad, it's a mistake that quite a few make.
---
Oh I thought it was something to do with mechanics or something like that leading to the event failing. Something that actually matters.
---
Do you purposely fail the event for every afker you see standing around? Because I'd say that's more of a problem than somebody taking 30 seconds to sell stuff.
---
But thanks for your response, I now know it's fine to trade with grahm whenever I please.
---
Edit: it's 9:02 and I just sold grahm a bunch of meat. Grahm happy. Grahm like meat.
---
The characters had very similar names, but even then aside from lag, I can't find another reason why it deleted my main.
---
Pc mime is 5k
---
It was actually based off the original speak n spell
---
Ooof, hopefully bethesda has some sort of recovery method
---
That completely sucks man.  I’m sorry to hear that. I hope Bethesda can do something for you.
---
The post is about the event...
---
Now you're just trying to look {FRESHLY SCENTED} my dude.
---
I'd rather fight a deathclaw than a mirelurk king any day. Heck I'd rather fight a deathclaw than those stupid chonked feral ghouls. Those are my personal least favorites.
---
I thought it was still in since trees and rocks are disappearing like they should for me
---
There's a point where you have to weigh having that 'one weapon/gear piece' you might need vs going broke. I'm by no means rich and at most having 15000 caps now down to 9000-ish b/c I'm a cheap a\*\*.    
---
I'm on PC though so it would help if you also put what you play on.
---
You don't die of hunger anymore. It drains all of your AP and takes you down to 2-3 health but it doesn't kill you
---
I never would have imagined a map with a flickering arrow to be so laggy lol
---
and the comment thread is about legendaries. 
---
stay in school, kids.
---
The beauty of pc perk card manager mod. And  after the patch we now can have multiple 1 star cards
---
I have to say that does sound lovely this time of year.
---
If everything had worked right, consoles would’ve likely had it Thursday. They had reason to fear problems, and it has problems. Hence the further delay. They’ll likely hotfix PC and drop the patch at the same time for consoles next week.
---
Ok. I have been os the sleeping bag near the event. Now i will go to the drums
---
/s defeats the purpose of sarcastic whit in the first place...
---
Glowing blood is 15 rads with no disease chance.
---
Prepped two as my friend fought the individual who snuck into our public team. Have an alt account prep and nuke the other
---
Xbox has this shit down..  nvr failed one
---
I saw it once. How? I had to click the tip of an instrument to get in
---
On the drums now 😉
---
This is also a great way for anyone who hasn’t leveled up to Starched Genes to manage keeping a mutation that they like. In my case I didn’t want my second character to lose a free marsupial so I healed rads with this and Nuka Grape until I could keep it on my own.
---
Mmmmmmmmm....window chips...mmmmmmmhmmmm lol
---
Excellent.  Teach those raider scum whose boss, Fellow....Member.
---
There’s also the toxic goo you can easily acquire from west tek. It gives you like 25 or so rads and is really easy to stockpile hundreds in one trip. Not sure how much it weighs though in relation to milk.
---
Never had a problem. Pc/inet issues
---
God I hope not. They have a very clear origin point in the lore and Bethesda would have to mangle it to get them to make sense in West Virginia
---
Me too 😂 you rock my friend, literally!
---
There is no fix..... Your levels are gone I'm afraid. I've had it happen.
---
The plan you got is so you can change the way your backpack looks. 
---
So as long as you have the plan to build the small backpack (which you get in the overseer’s stash box at the Morgantown airport)
---
Or the large backpack (for doing the tadpole challenges)
---
Then once you have that book bag you can apply the skin to it. 
---
Now if you already have the backpack but you still don’t see it anywhere, you might have to go to the armor workbench and craft the new backpack instead of trying to modify one you already have to have the skin.
---
I barely fled the monongah power plant with my life from a pack of them only to have them spawn outside the door next to me and continue beating me. Somehow I didn't think enemies followed you out of instances. They do.
---
I've only had the glitch happen once and it was when I was online during reset. Could be a coincidence, but it might also be another cause of it.
---
Hmm. I would laugh. Alt f4 in the last 5 seconds. And just log back in
---
At least he’s finally in the same spot on every server 😭
---
 I Always get atleast one legendary enemy and prime meat boosts your chances of getting rarer plans and loot from meat week, it’s not worth doing by yourself because there’s too many enemies that spawn to far apart but with a couple people I almost never fail it .
---
True! It's also easy to farm during the Radiation Rumble event. It is marginally heavier though at 0.3lb, and offers only half the amount of rads. But definitely a good option nevertheless.
---
Place a foundation on an uneven point of ground....not difficult to find. Place stairs away from the entry point, then an instrument or terminal on the stairs. Pick up the stairs and move them so the item is just barely out of the ground. May take a few tries to get this part right. Use the item, get back up, you are underground and can start placing floors down.
---
Lead (II) Chloride is a little over twice the density of Sodium Chloride in addition to being immensely toxic to biological lifeforms.
---
Kinda like everything else in the wasteland...  and much of Reddit too, now that I think about it lol.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Edit:  if you are slow (as you stated), lead poisoning could be to blame.  You likely contracted it while digging through those abandoned ruins in search of material scrap to make more bullets.
---
I think it’s 1 scrip per meat
---
Scrip, notes, and unique plans mostly. Any tier of level can participate, so it does help fill in a gap of activity during a daily flow chart.
---
I feel like it's just not large enough of a sample size.
---
Plus any patch for consoles has to be vetted by Sony/Microsoft which takes time.
---
My mans
---
Partial removal works but they had improved "bulldozer" which removed grass and shrubs and other remnant world items by changing ground textures.
---
Bruh...
---
The Combat Rifle is usable at 20 and has a faster fire rate than the Hunter/Sniper Rifle. IMO, you should carry a Rifle for longest distances, and a Combat Rifle for medium to close distances. IMO, a high damage melee for low level mobs to save ammo.    
---
Sneak maxed helps with doing more damage. There's one Perk that does 2x damage if you're sneaking and not found yet.
---
Haha that's a solid theory
---
At some point my game went from "Oh no, a Scorchbeast, I better run away because they are so tough" to "Oh no, a Scorchbeast, I better run away because I've got things to do rather than waste the bullets on that thing" to "Oh good, a Scorchbeast. I wanted to test my Bloodied Gauss Minigun"
---
Use rad away. Try reading the effects of what things do and you may learn something
---
Yup, I mentioned in my post that toxic goo gives a bunch of rads (it actually provides +125) , but it weighs 0.75lb per unit and spoiled Brahmin milk is a good option for people who want more precise rad management. But it works well paired with regular Brahmin milk to adjust your rad levels to just the right amount!
---
{GOOD TALK, LET US BE CHUMS} 😹
---
Did this several times and always launch the meter at the halfway point.   It is very easy to complete at that point.   
---
The drawback is the event only last a few minutes at most.
---
Shut your filthy mouth
---
Lol that’s toxic did you not read the sub title lol
---
Turrets are near useless as is. They've got the worst AI in the game, we're in a lot of trouble if we actually have to rely on them
---
Assaultrons suck but I don't run into them enough to hate them. I feel like I bump into charred feral ghouls constantly. If I ran into Assaultrons as often they would about me more for sure.
---
Rad rats. So fast,so deadly,so much disease. Cave cricket are earning some hate right now cuz I can’t sneak in primal meat events
---
It'd get old quick and ruin the event for me
---
Rad rat.
---
Highest armor in the game for a lvl 26 rat..:
---
I’d also be up for that
---
Assaultrons especially the one in the Hornwright estate. I’m level 64 and my best weapons barely scratch it but it’s head laser is a one shot kill even in power armor
---
As the year slowly drifts into early fall, you'll find the Cranberry Bog to be an awe inspiring orgy of color due to the local flora. The deep crimson reds and playful violet hues will delight your eyes and tickle your nose, inviting you for a picnic and a Rad X at every turn. 
---
The native fauna is still as active as ever this time of year. Enjoy defending yourself from a yao guai attack from atop a railcar or stalking mirelurk Queens and snallygasters in the deep underbrush. 
---
Our meandering tour includes visiting several notable military installations in the area, scenes of hair raising bravery and defiance against an ever advancing foe. 
---
And what would this experience be without ending the tour at the magnificent Fissure Site Prime? You'll be amazed at the availability of death and destruction at your fingertips and are heartily encouraged to shoot on sight anything that moves. 
---
So come on down to Handsome Dan's Cranberry Bog Tours™
---
We Put The Slaughter In Everything ™
---
I feel kind of bad for him. Sometimes, I'll hear him talk about feeling like he can almost remember some of the people and places from before the bombs fell.
---
I've only played on XBox years ago and hated it so much. I've been a PS gamer since the PS1. I'm on PC and PS4 and never the same game on both.
---
What big monster? I have participated in Meat Week since it's first introduction. This disturbs me.
---
Unless you submit a ticket with bethesda to roll you back to a previous save but I highly doubt they care.
---
I’ll say Tuesday since that’s when they mostly drop updates
---
I got 3 flamer plans, which are as rare as tenderizer.
---
See that's the key though. If people aren't on the drums/spits it doesn't start with the meter up there and the chance of a fail from the drain is possible while people collect stuff. 
---
Hopefully this thread and others like it help make it quick and easy for all. I think it's a bonus if it's over quick, more time to do other things ;)
---
Yes, but you wouldn't after doing it for a solid week every month, you wouldn't enjoy it
---
That hat and mask combo is my personal favorite.  I wore it with the Elder' Battlecoat for the longesttime, but I now wear it with the Treasure Hunter Outfit, and I like that even better.
---
Thing is they don't care.... So its pointless
---
Caesium Chloride had a density about 1.8 times that of NaCl.
---
Lead (II) Chloride is a good 2.7 times the density of NaCl.
---
To be fair though, PbCl2 isn't actually a soluble salt, where CsCl is.
---
In the end, the fucking salt shaker is stupid heavy and they likely misplaced the decimal point.
---
F 
---
Very sorry to see this, makes my heart hurt
---
Missiles aren't too bad
---
How do you afk on the drums.  I went to eat and came back and was kicked playing the drums
---
You're supposed to use the water fountain by the tennis courts
---
Not true, I don’t enjoy this game because I’m already at a point where I’ve done everything, I don’t enjoy the game already lmao
---
Or I can take the one I am near or the one that requires no fast travel cost. It isn’t first come first serve.
---
For me the most annoying creatures to fight are Ghouls. Not only are Ghouls absurdly fast but my GOD do they hit hard even when I have over 280 DR.
---
Sorry for my quad explosive one then. D:
---
That just proves my point lol
---
That's really awesome! I totally forgot about Nuka Grape for my low level characters. I hope they add a Nuka cola plant or vending machine at some point so we can craft the unique variants for ourselves.
---
Get there 2 minutes before the top of the hour, find drums or grill to operate until the event starts. Event may be completed in &lt; 2 mins. Be quick and be on time!
---
This needs to be a sign for in game. If only there was the budget for it.
---
Doesn't Adamantium skeleton already do that?
---
It's OK to disengage and walk away for a bit. That's what I did when the legendary module grind really got me down. I'm not going to finish the legendary run but honestly that's fine. I'm not going to be coerced into playing something every day when that's not what I want to do.
---
Agreed. So I take a chance. This time it worked out
---
Just like project paradise.
---
You must hate bloodied builds.
---
Wait, having new content and things to do... will make me enjoy a game less because I already dislike the lack of content? Big brain takes
---
Thats what im saying. They have tools and the ability to fix it but like previously said i highly doubt they care
---
When they fixed this bug they accidentally changed it so that he pays out everytime you visited him on a Monday! Shame they hotfixed it before I could take advantage of that, and that said hotfix broke him again...
---
my second favorite headwear to accompny this mask is the Gladiator Helmet.   The fact that is clips through makes for a very convincing Angry Bird vibe...
---
Use the Top hat from colonial times  
---
  
---
Trust me on this
---
Seems like this has been going on a lot. I’ve faced something similar to where I travel to the event when it pops up, but it doesn’t register me for the event.
---
It happened to me twice at the main event and 6 times at primal cut events. Even if I try to re-travel to it it will just not count me on the event. 
---
I don’t know if it has to do with server lag or the amount of people at the event? Definitely gets a little annoying.

Playing said content will be just another grind that when your done or have done it for more than a few days, you will be bored af. We need good long content not dripfeed weekly events. Making an event once or twice a year makes it fun to play
---
This is not a PSA
---
I have a heavy gunner build. I found the best way to combat this is watch the hollow portion of the bar, if it gets to about half or more of the total size, its going to rubber band. I stop firing for a few and either focus on other enemies or simply entice the enemy to chase me in circles for a bit. Most often the damage is taken away after a couple seconds and I can return to whoopin that ass. 
---
Im also in PA and using primarily vampires weapons, so i dont use stimpacks except for the most harsh conditions.
---
It's because they are all synths. One day it was empty, the next day there was a town. 
---
Synths. They're synths.
---
Same problem for the Gattling plasma!
---
I hate when it doesn't work out, and then someone argues that you meant something completely different...
---
Reeeeealy makes me despondent about the ability of people to actually think nowadays.  Which makes me feel old.  Which makes me sad.  Which makes me binge on games.  Which makes me happy.  
---
Round and round it goes lol.
---
the notes are weightless. Just turn in your 20 a day and don't worry so much. We have events going that give tons, but it /will/ dry up eventually and you'll be glad you don't have to grind for more.
---
Make sure your controller is plugged into the console and put a rubber band on both sticks so the camera is spinning.
---
But, if they have a different event every month... they could I dunno.. add more stuff to do? I don’t see how you can’t comprehend it lol, also the downvote button isn’t a disagree button. Learn to reddit noob
---
I'm dumb lol thank you
---
What you want and the reality of the situation are two distinctly different things , there’s no sense in complaining about them here , imo.
---
This is what i was asking.
---
Got there before the hour turned over.
---
The meat cook never happened. 
---
A bunch of people showed up, milled around for 10 minutes then left.
---
No timer.
---
No rewards. 
---
Just Graham talking about his cow.
---
Lol. Ok. Never afk before.  Ty
---
glad i found this, so i know to do it there times ... so many broken parts in this crappy "game", and so much potential !  so very sad
---
If you are trading instead of helping the event success, then yes, it is leading to event failing and it is “something that actually matters”. 
---
But based on your responses and attitude it seems like you are a self centered selfish person who only cares about what you do regardless or any point for anything, so I’ll stop as we won’t get anywhere. People like you are not really worth my time and it’s not my job to punish or teach you. Life and karma will do that 🙂. 
---
Have a good one 👋🏻
---
There should be a recipe to create an antidote, specific for each mutation. Like:
---
1 marsupial serum + 1 radaway +1 rads yield + 1 cobalt flux: marsupial antidote
---
They will tell you they have no way of replacing characters, which is bs because they did it for people that lost their inventory in the vault raids and the people that had stuff stolen out of their stashes on pc.
---
If you take a melee weapon and slam it on top of the hole the second the burrow you can still kill them
---
You make great points and I completely agree with you. I was just offering a compromise if it was necessary
---
The tone of a conversation is lost with these letters. The internet is also a very divided place. People will fight to the death for their politics and even which game they like. It's sad. But us middle minded people have trouble cutting a joke and a point for that matter.
---
Says the person who began the downvoting. Anyways, if you have to stray from the current topic to a completely unrelated one, its a clear sign that you've already lost and are just looking for a new potential argument to win to repair your broken ego
---
Just do the cook out at the top of the hour. Unless you really need the scrip/treasury notes or scrap from mobs it's not worth chasing the Primal Meat events.
---
Mob scrap is decent though.
---
Am confused on one thing tho where do we find the special feed?
---
Oh thanks for answering! 
---
Bethesda Storytelling was pretty good with the first storyline the game had and contributed to the concept of being lonely and only other players as humans, however maybe is the crowd of npc's in some areas that make that feeling dissapear, but still is good to find like that sentiment of a group of only vault 76 dwellers being humans (except the overseer)
---
Um, one more question if u can help me with. Do you think the experience in the game can be improved or changed in some way to make it better? (not in a technical view)
---
Don't draw Bethesda's attention to this, it's probably a glitch that we can server hop for more!
---
One that they'll patch or ban over...
---
I’d say Tuesday but I’m counting on somewhere around August 2021
---
That's pretty much every patch note
---
Meat Week is the quintessential FO76 event.  It brings us together as a community.  You make friends, act like a fool, and earn some cool rewards. I love it. I embrace it. I truly love it.  Join me fellow dwellers and let’s feast!
---
You can buy the plan from Grahm and make it on a stove/fire. It uses some basic ingredients like tatos and two others. I'm sorry I wish I had the recipe in front of me now.
---
I think it is going to come out with fallout 5.
---
It was my favourite until people started to place their tents in order to cause the barrel effect.
---
Every hour, on the hour.
---
Also, I am more than a year old on reddit with more than 10k karma whereas you are 22 days old with only 2k karma.
---
The game's already easy enough, there is no point trying to optimize it so much. I stopped needing anything about 200 levels ago
---
Also sounds right
---
They thought the salt shaker was being held on by Bobby pins.
---
No
---
That’s been my experience too lately....
---
I feel like you've known me my whole life! &lt;3
---
You have a good evening too, or don't, makes no difference to me. :)
---
Simple and concise. I like it
---
If it weren't for the repeated auto complete bug I should be finished by now....
---
Yeah but the base is a .308. They should base the ammo count off the only gun in the game that used .50 rounds as a default
---
just dont be on when the daily scores reset.  It is 11 am my time (Central US) and I make sure I am off by 10:30 am and dont even look at the game until noon.  It will reduce the chance that it happens, but it still can happen.
---
Big tip:  You can FT to the event if it disappears.  If you do scorched and one of your team does colossus, you can FT to them and it will load you into the event.
---
Those that say is disappears.  It prob will do if your team member is in.  With public teams this happens a lot.
---
I buy stuff that I can build or use in my camp. Everything else is just something I avoid. I'm a builder and need everything buildable.
---
Could have sworn they said it was coming along with a Starfield trailer next year
---
That’s an event where Imo the end rewards are better than whatever legendary you can get from the imposquatch. I do something similar in project paradise. When everyone goes to kill the alpha I’ll stay behind to guard friendlies. Good man.
---
Nah, I heard that it was a preorder bonus
---
Scrap kits and repair kits can be useful.  The collection robots are mildly useful, I don’t use the robots anymore but there was a time where they were helpful.
---
Finally finished mine. It was really worth it. The Armco is already giving me a few hundred .45’s a day. I’m a melee build so that’s a perfect amount for someone with a fixer secondary
---
The sound of people gulping their drinks in a silent room irks me.
---
Gulpers. They flee into the wilderness if you’re out of reach of their attacks and they absorb bullets like sponges plus they travel in packs
---
Do you have the auto-join events function turned off in the settings? If that's the case sometimes you have to look for the event on the map and join it that way. Other than that it could maybe be the server your on
---
Manage your inventory better?
---
PSA: Radiation Rumble is the new One Violent Night. Get used to it.
---
I swear ive killed those wendigos before they reach me but it still triggers a stagger.
---
wow.
---
Of course it could be made better, nothing is ever perfect. :)
---
What I would like to see: more of the same. 
---
More hidden side quests like the nuka cola paints
---
More stories like Enola Walker 
---
More depth behind the NPCs like Rose
---
More environmental storytelling like the nukashine targets
---
the Shop always refreshes on Tuesdays, with occasional singular items added on other days.
---
I got lucky and found a troubleshooter's combat shotgun.  
---
I still stay the fuck away from assaultrons, especially the cloaking ones.
---
I'm on xbox and I'm not braindead, just a bimb o bambi..
---
Hilarious!  Thanks for the laugh.  I really needed that.
---
Didn't know there was function that would stop me from joining  
---
Have always joined an event from the map or been in the location when the event began and auto joined.
---
I wish consoles had that kind of support! That alone would make so much less hassle and I’d enjoy playing a lot more!
---
Right on, somehow missed the toxic goo line. Good info, thx.
---
I doubt it, if they didn’t leave the oil rig to set foot in California until 2242 they won’t be going to West Virginia 130 years before then lol
---
And if you get a legendary armor piece that reduces ammo a further percentage, much of it goes right to zero weight
---
“It just works”
---
The point being, now we can get LEGENDARY Tenderizers.  I've learned the plan and am thinking of burning Scrips to see if I get one.
---
Mole rats only exist to stop you from fast travelling.
---
It seems like they rotate on Todd’s whim. Some old items have come back, but it happens when it happens.
---
Such a stupid gesture, if you were afk you wouldn't see it, and it only helps, so, pointless. You are actively wasting time when you could be picking up critter chunks, and honestly 50 chunkc is not hard to solo in 6 minutes.
---
Beat me to it lol was gonna make a bloodborne reference myself
---
I failed one on Xbone.  But the bar hadn't reached zero.  Kinda confused.   Otherwise yeah, Xbone usually has players actually doing stuff.
---
Edit:  Gsmertag is the same but small s in Sin.   Didnt want to pay 1600 to fix that.  But I'm only a weekend warrior right now, low level.
---
And the BOS kicked your shit in twice lol, 3 times if you count the BOS in fo2
---
Need? 😕
---
Did you catch another disease recently? There is a timer between how many diseases you can catch in a certain amount of time.
---
MHW 4 life
---
Everything was nerfed damage wise but Bloodied is still going to out damage most builds. Youre fine man. Angry Turtle on Youtube always tests this stuff out and does a good job explaining it.
---
Honestly afk players are doing the heavy lifting this event.
---
Personally i don't care. If only everything stays unlocked
---
Ahh cool, I try not to be as it is 2am where I live in Aus lol.. thanks 👍
---
Same here. Thinking of prime cuts maybe?
---
I've had that thing land on me.
---
Trust me I know how big it is.
---
With 3 people on drums you gain 0.32% completion per second. 0.08% per second per person with an additional 0.08% with all three.
---
This is the same for the Spits(Interact with the handle).
---
If 6 people are on all 6 stations, you gain 0.64% completion per second.
---
You could probably complete the event immediately if 6 people are on all drums/spits for the two minutes before the event starts.
---
That was very helpful I was so confused I've been doing everything but the feed.
---
It only drops a one star and explosive gauss are legacies, so they don’t drop anymore.
---
I’ll take five Deathclaws and a total SPECIAL reset over a Mirelurk King.
---
You sound young and impulsive. Do yourself a favour and check your weapon. If you need free fusion cells, go kill robots and collect them from the junk they drop.
---
you think events are going to stop giving notes?
---
Was it after entering an instant area?
---
It does less damage than a super sledge and weighs 20 pounds so as much as I'd like to use one because it looks cool it just doesn't seem worth it.
---
Had one on ps this morning where all 3 drums and all 3 spots were used in the 2 minute timer. Not sure if it even took 30 seconds to finish that one!
---
Deathclaws are a joke in this game I get more trouble out of a low level group of scorched than Deathclaws. There is literally a location named Deathclaws Island when I first discovered it I was cautious and assumed it to be a huge Deathclaw breeding ground like Quarry Junction but what did I find? A single low level Deathclaw with glitched animations and absolutely no reward to even fight it. There's no reason a Deathclaw should be marginally easier to kill than a Mirelurk King, Gulper, Or Fog Crawler yet those are the creatures I actually fear running into in this game.
---
Support are liers, they do indeed have the tools to restore a character, but the restored character might be a few weeks old!
---
If Event teams gave you double XP with a full team for everything you do in the event (like all the enemies you kill), instead of just the final reward, then it would be worth it.
---
Now that I didn’t know. Big oof my guy I got flap limb.
---
Try again either on an alt, or later on.
---
But in order to unlock it you have to buy the in store only item now available for just 1750 atoms.
---
I fucking hate Radscorpions, I had to wait in a house for 25 minutes before a high level came and killed it for me when I was low level and out of ammo. The bastard followed me through servers, like it was my own personal super dedicated griefer on GTA Online, except on *that* the only way to kill me is either in a sniper duel, with rockets, by surprise or by actually being good.
---
The only beneficial thing they have in 76 is nuclear key card locator and serums. It's worth doing imho
---
Well its been a bit I should be able to acquire it now. Im just taking a break because I have nothing to do in fo76 lol
---
Remember, kill everything but the teeny tiny baby mirelurk, if you can, safely kill off the non diseased ones!
---
I’ll take Cazadors over mole rats
---
I'd like to know this as well. I've watched Captain Noob and Angry Turtle play this event a lot and I'm still not completely sure, but it looks like it's not radioactive inside the mine.
---
Oh yea that won’t be too hard
---
The main storyline goes through the Enclave. You have to complete their part if you want to launch a nuke. If that isn't something you're excited about, you can just stop.
---
Glad it helped :) I'm so glad this thread in general is helping people on this and hope it continues to do so.
---
Because that’s the way mutations currently work, right?
---
I’ve been crippled by those little cunts despite having rank 3 Adamantium Skeleton. Which by the way is broken.
---
The scrap collection certainly helps me out
---
Absolutely. Or possibly confusing it with Fasnacht? Never have I once seen a "monster" at the end of meat week.
---
Hopefully a fix and reperations for the auto complete bug too...
---
No shame in it for a change 😂 lol
---
Why Molerats? Radscorpions are deadly Molerats with armor...
---
Then drop little to no loot.
---
Bruh...my wife would enjoy it if I did this....sorry man.level 400+that's at least 600 hours I'm 250 400 hours
---
The Savage Divide one regularly glitches out, I suggest the Toxic Valley one or the mire one for the easiest most stable victories!
---
Pretty sure I’ve seen an autodoc in the datamines. Dunno what its function gonna be yet tho
---
From what I understand there will regional level brackets. No level ones in the Bog, no level 100s in the Forest. You're probably safe.
---
Honestly I completely understand this line of thought. My personal opinion is I'd like to see more of this type of 'special time' event however I completely agree that they would fall short, especially as time goes on and people collect all the rewards and become bored. On another note however I feel this is completely unavoidable for a game like 76, at this point in time it's reliant on daily logins and not so endgame 'endgame grinds', looking forward to the future though.  
---
I'm certainly not an expert in managing live service games, far from it and it'll certainly take more than a few events to fix 76's core issues.. This was simply a quick thought that'll get lost within the thousands of other suggestions on this sub. I's always fun to dream.
---
I mean could I join any other factions and have other storylines?
---
i think the camp personal terminal is, but it's free so there's that. helps you keep track of a few daily quests.
---
Radscorpions too. The burrow mechanic is crazy. They just do it too frequently.
---
Even doing that the savage divide still fails.
---
The only issue I've had with the Ash Heap location was a prime radscorpion getting stuck in limbo, where we could see it, but we couldn't attack it and it couldn't attack us.  I do get annoyed that some of the mobs spawn far away or don't spawn at all.
---
Also, I'm not sure if the mobs during this public event have their stats cranked or not.  Sneaking appears to be broken since I appear to be stuck in danger during the events.  At times it takes a while after the event to finish for the danger to go away.  I could fast travel to welch station, and I'd still show in danger for a bit.
---
I still just carry a gamma gun if in need of rads. But still a good tip
---
Shame Bethesda support refuses to help anyone with this either...
---
Is the Bog getting weak enemies?
---
Scrap it i say
---
The Enclave is the last faction of the main storyline. We're waiting to see what happens with the upcoming BoS stories.
---
its worth a lot less than previously but if you can craft it.. thats 20lbs less you have to manage around
---
Right and people call this a mmo
---
repair kits are a waste of money. you get free "improved" ones just for completing Scorched Earth.
---
So I use to save atoms up when we got them from challenges and when I started getting fallout 1st. I would randomly just buy some outfits when I had to many atoms. I bought repair kits for a while when they would go on sale. But I don’t waste money on them anymore. As most time there will be a few good nights where nukes are launched. Or I have enough scrap to repair myself. At first I hated the collectron it never gave anything good. But I ended up get the commie one and I had it set to pick up health items so it would give me a crap ton of blood packs and I would use my chemist and super duper maxed and I never had to search for tick blood or buy stims anymore. I also bought the raider one when it came out and I like that one being gives decent amount of ammo and guns that you can scrap. Everything else is not really important I have bought bundles here or there but 9 times out 10 I skip them. Like that junkyard one
---
If on xbox I'll pass you a pair of junkies guns I have...just 2 though
---
Handmade 
---
Guass rifle 
---
Combat shotgun
---
Pump shotgun
---
Have instigating pieces as well
---
B ball bat
---
Gotta check on the rest
---
Well I’ve got plenty of misc quests and daily quests to do until that time comes
---
Now if only we could turn in more than 20!
---
From what I've read here, there will be a minimum level in the Bog. Weak is relative.
---
The hole idea behind it is that it makes you salty about the weight increase XD
---
It’s nice seeing the whole server on the same area
---
Limb damage
---
Exit to main menu? I can't even do that! I have to close the game down entirely!
---
I suggest you buy them. I spent months, did maybe 200 Encryptid before a friend gave me the plan. I learned it and then, I started receiving copies. 
---
5K Is a great price. 10K Is still good if you have the money. 20K is expensive, but I would definitely buy them too if I had 22K on me. 
---
Take into account that, once you learn it, legendary fixers start dropping for you at events, Purveyor, etc. 
---
I got a Junkie's fixer which sold for 20K an hour after I put it for sale in the machine.
---
Did you rejoin the server. Could just be a visual glitch.
---
Everything that stacks damage
---
Yes but limbs crippling is the primary cause of player stagger in the game!
---
i prefer the smaller sizes. if i wanted huge groups i'd play an actual MMO
---
46 screws shouldnt be a problem to reup with primal cuts running
---
F, as in W T F Bethesda
---
I haven’t failed it once though.
---
Uh. Not lol
---
I love the scrap box and I use the tent as basically a scrap kit. Pop it down and send my junk to the scrap box.
---
Not that much enemy variety.
---
What's that?
---
I've hear reports of players not staggering so much with the perk equipped, its not an immunity but it helps.
---
Escavator torso (for mining) ultracite legs. 1 jetpack 1 calibrated. X-01 Arms and helmet
---
I wouldn’t say they are a waste of money.  They are good early game when you’re not doing the queen all the time.  The improved kits are obviously better and free, but the atom shop ones have their place.  I have one character that uses an explosive laser rifle and an explosive railway, and they break constantly, even with gunsmith 5 and weapon artisan/improved repair kits.  So it’s easy to burn through the free ones sometimes.
---
You lost me at the hat, but everything else is solid. I personally use the Green Hood.
---
Your use of the pole glitch looks great. I'd like to see more slanted roofs but that's just my own preference. 
---
Great work!
---
Im just saving my atoms for when something I absolutely fucking need comes along so far i have 1000
---
Use the ammo converter
---
Where the hell are these SPITS people keep talking about? All I ever see is the steel drum and the cages hanging in the air. I've yet to even see Graham.
---
And when it does release, youll get shovels as a reward
---
In terms of rewards its better than SE. You get a garunteed 3*** from the event, a 1*-3*** from Earle, and a chance at a 3*** cursed weapon, plus 8 treasury notes and 2 flux. Also enemies drop the ammo type you kill them with, you don't get rads since its indoors, and its not like the queen where she flies around half the time. Plus you get tons of screws. Overall I think its better than Scorched Earth.
---
Or the game crashing 10 minute before and the event completing in less than 2 minutes so I can't get back in time....
---
The time it takes to run from 76,the event has completed and you miss it!
---
My main wears a full set of Unyielding Marine Armor and Leaded backpack. That makes all my resistances around 200-300, which is good enough for survival + squishy enough to make me care about my character. 
---
My mule wears a full set of combat armor and DR perks, and he is always around 500-600. Which makes me feel like a tank, and it doesn't feel realistic. 
---
Also, I love leather armor and keep a full set because it screams FALLOUT when you wear the original blue jumpsuit as underarmor.
---
there’s a chart online, but you can look up most youtubers and they’ll have a breakdown. While all builds still rank the same in damage output as they did pre-nerf, optimized bloodied is half its damage output, and then it gets to be significantly smaller nerfs after that with junkies looking at like 15-20% reduction, and enemy slayer and furious weapons following that. All other weapon types are nerfed but it’s not enough to warrant exact numbers being posted at this time, since for some builds it can be as small as a 1-3% change. Especially since it’s all subject to change at any time. 
---
Basically, the more dmg you’re doing currently the worse it will be. Bloodied will be about twice as powerful as a food build with no damage skills now and everything else will be in between those 2 numbers. 
---
*Not sure why the others are downvoting that, but any numbers I listed were proven math using an auto handmade in the PTS by a source who tests BETA releases often. If photos were allowed I would post the original chart*
---
I'm sure a lot of people haven't had one fail, especially since more info is getting out there. 
---
Hopefully those who read this will hop on one of those 6 spots if they're not already filled and fails will be a thing of the past :)
---
Tick
---
Who is down voting this, and why?  
---
Is he wrong?
---
Are you using the future tec camp skin from the legendary run? Its bugged out, due to be fixed on consoles when the next hotfix comes through. Unfortunately, I'm not sure if the fix will be retroactive, currently the only way to fix it is to change back to the standard CAMP skin and place your CAMP again, whether that will change with the update (ie. your base will just start showing up without having to replace it) or not I'm not sure.
---
Im more interested in how certain mob spawns in one area and don’t move. Meaning you can farm the parts. Its hella weird.
---
When all I wanna do is sell him back the 3 meat cleavers I got and a Yahoo in front of me in line is studying every item in the inventory or goes afk while clicked on Grahm yeah I'm mad. There is usually I primal cuts still going right after the event and getting stuck waiting for 5 or 10 minutes just to use the vendor is annoying.
---
That's the Prime Cuts event I believe you're describing. This is about the one that pops next to Vault 76 on the hour. So in four minutes from now :)
---
With meat week going on right now every event that has to do with it is giving treasury notes. If you're on a pretty active server and you complete one primal meat event quick enough you can fast travel to another event before it ends if there are people doing it, so soon as you get the success pop up immediately go to the other event you don't have to wait for the awards to show you will still get them. I went from like 80 to over 200 by playing a bunch lol
---
Use a spotlight too
---
I know what you mean.  I've tried to spam radaway to be alive long enough to put on my power armor, before I rad myself to death after I exit the mine.  So far I've had enough time to put on my power armor before exiting the mine and that's after looting the chest.  I have the speed demon mutation, so I'm not sure if someone without the mutation would have enough time to do so.  Also, I've learned that if you are still in the mine after the timer, you're just forced out anyway.
---
I can't get the key card now. I go to top floor as indicated. Then I'm indicated back to ground floor, then back to top floor - ad infinitum. I kill and loot everywhere in case its just the indication bugged. No joy. Nothing. Do I just have to hope this gets patched?
---
No. With the current way it works you can swap out your cards at any time and choose which ones you get to level up. Some of them can apply to every character, like the ammo one. You don’t even need to level it up, but you can still swap it in for an extra 50% ammo whenever you need to craft it. With your idea, we wouldn’t have as much freedom with it, and having every legendary perk would be way too op. What they SHOULD do is just give us 3 perk coins per level
---
Good reason to get there ahead of time. Which is really easy since it's always at the exact same place at the top of every hour.
---
They fixed him not selling it sometimes a while ago
---
Shame crashes has occasionally been robbing me of that.
---
Fallout death music if the background but bro I feel so bad for you hope you can feel better bout it
---
And when the tool starts to use tools, you know AI has gone too far.
---
Usually it helps if the devs actually listen to the testers and fix the bugs
---
My two main structures are the blood eagle platform thing and the communist bunker. Also have kink fence parts
---
My friend actually missed out on the meat week hourly event today while he was participating in it because the event never triggered while he was there....
---
Are you referring to the wallpaper? I did put like two panels of it up
---
There are so many other vendors in the game bro. Getting mad because people got to him before you instead of just going somewhere else and back is silly. I try to hurry but the game fucking lags and frames drop to like 15.
---
If you don't do the Enclave quests then you won't be able to launch nukes, if that's not a problem for you then you're fine but doing them
---
No. It wouldn’t be the same if we got it all the time. What they should do is keep adding in new seasonal events so we have at least one a month
---
yep.  a camp skin glitch. get rid of the skin
---
Tried that already doesn’t work at all on my character. Soon as I try to go to add the sample it won’t let me the only thing that’s available is the t fuse it’s odd.
---
It's a door to the left next to a lantern that is locked. Afterwards the whole wall is blown off and the door is on the floor afterwards.
---
I'm just doing that myself. Someone said earlier you have to analyze the blood before replacing the fuse, but I already tried loading the blood first so now I've got to try and find another ghoul (I think?) and see if I can get another blood sample.
---
Same here, works like a charm
---
Then can I ask where the *fuck* you were when the Scorched Plague was destroying Appalachia? Oh yeah, you were too busy destroying yourselves. You rest in pieces, and you started trying to put yourselves together again.
---
They are taking about the optional skin for your CAMP module. The thing you have to place down to create your camp in the first place.
---
But that hasn’t happened yet.
---
It's not bloodied that's getting nerfed. It's a damage nerf across the board. Any build that stacks a lot of buffs will be nerfed harder than one that stacks a few but they all get nerfed. It's proportional.
---
Bloodied will still be the top meta build
---
Ah well i have 2300 screws left
---
Oh that. I should be able to change that in the atomic shop somewhere.
---
The rads from radiation rumble overpower power armor, only rad suits and Chinese stealth armor can withstand it!
---
It’s pretty easy I’d say if you don’t check online. They announce its coming on the game and then the game updates and it’s not and they don’t say it gets delayed on the game so I can see why
---
Favorite Chinese Stealth Armor and equip it quickly for fast acting rad relief!
---
Have you been living at the bottom of a fissure for the last two days?
---
You shouldn’t have to do that. Just reload. You should still have the sample.
---
Talking about the skin for C.A.M.P object, you unlock one during the legendary run, if that is equipped when you place down your CAMP then you will have the issues you mentioned. You need to go into the atomic shop and remove the skin and then re-place and rebuild your camp.
---
They read one too many WWII history text books.
---
Pretty sure we already knew this even before meat week came out, back when everything was datamined on the pts
---
Same here, many times its the 100+ doing the grunt work while the higher levels camp around (from what I have seen). Don’t blame the junior chaps they might be new.. but the old birds should get right on the task
---
lol i always have to turn down my volume when i see them.
---
But that stuff tastes horrible! It smells like rotten egg farts and tastes like, I don’t even know what!
---
That's why I have my Stealth Suit on the hotkey wheel
---
Oh i just didnt recognize the name. I play the game in french. Also i didnt know the event looted screws...
---
Annnnnnnddd yet another fucking Wendigo not looted because I was dead and had to wait 60 seconds to respawn . It’s fucking bullshit . I’m done with this event and I’m done wasting my ammo and stim packs . Like for fuck sakes I stab myself in chest , 2 times in a row . And still die . None of this make any fucking sense and I’m tired of asking for help or an explanation and getting nothing . I’m done with this fucking event . Fix it . Ouh and also I’m tired of getting 5 FPS everytime some else decides to use a fucking Tesla rifle . It’s bullshit , how can I stop my health from dropping , if I literally can’t even see it dropping ? I get one shot , or I’m lagging so fucking badly that I get hit 50 times and it registers as one big hit and then boom dead .
---
The sample is not there. I cannot interact with the centrifuge or whatever. I have reloaded several times.
---
Just stop playing or stop doing the grinds if you don’t like them
---
Guess I didnt notice the problem before because I changed it while at my old camp which had been there a few weeks already.
---
Bethesda: "choose one - a new raid or a good one."
---
I wish i was this wealthy...
---
1. Mirelurk Kings: how the hell can they be tougher than much bigger creatures. 
---
2. Charred Ghouls lvl62: quicker than most Olympic sprinters and deadlier than a scorchbeast. 
---
Special mention to Deathclaws, just because they went from being the absolute Fallout’s kings of fear to mow being a poor joke.
---
Confession time, once I got the rad barrel plan the experience points were worth more to me than success.
---
Us solo adventure gamers don't actually like playing with people. So the small server size is a good way to introduce the concept of online gaming to the typical antisocial fallout player.
---
Better for all if everyone trades with Grahm after the event finishes. Might even get extra stuff that others sell/offload on him
---
It's just baffling how specific some of the information usually is, but the rest is missing.
---
its under lightings :)
---
This is on the game not the players. If you are in the tunnel you won't get tags on the legendaries. If It automatically grouped everyone in the area, more people would be in the tunnel.
---
Only the Mr. Pebbles plush.
---
Are people standing on top of the tent? I'm seeing a lot of event fails when people are using the marsupial mutation to jump on top of objects where mobs can't hit them.
---
I just tried for like 4 hours to try and figure this out
---
It’s a lighting option. Check there.
---
Of course. Thanks.
---
Bone charms can help
---
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
---
Instead of a tenderiser, it's a cooked radstag thigh!
---
Took me 34 events to get the outfit.
---
Quantum-tunneling mole rats!
---
My friend has been begging that of me since he got the outfit!
---
I am almost like it it almost looks like the front of the hat has like a little brown emblem it almost doesn’t even look like it’s clipping through
---
How does this even happen? It shows your characters name, level, and picture right there on the screen, and then asks you to type in their name. Even if you went to the wrong character and they happened to have the same exact name, you should’ve still seen where it says the level and shows your profile picture for that character. At that point it’s not even Bethesda’s problem to try and help you
---
But you know what I’ll do in 185 years time? I’ll thaw out of my cryo chamber and kick your tin canned asses down out the sky, then I’ll wipe out the remaining scraps that managed to survive the onslaught.
---
Good to know! Thanks you!!
---
I wonder how many people don't realize there are TWO stages to this event. The animal hunts, and the cook-out.
---
First 2 gave me backpack plan and outfit. I've so far got 4 chally outfits 2 backpack plans 1 spicy mod plan 2 grill master hats 1 bloodied chef outfit
---
1 by 1 same way as usual
---
IS THAT SOMEBODY WHO NEEDS ME TO KICK THEIR ASS?
---
Weightless is a Legendary effect. The Spicy mod though does make it somewhat better I think.
---
I'm having a very different issue. If I get on the game a couple minutes after the hour the event is already completed on  every server I try to hop to
---
I have 4 extra backpacks, and all the outfits at this point and haven’t seen 1 drop of any of the weapon plans.
---
That would be fun for raider rp people for like a brotherhood squad to pop up somewhere and they would turn hostile due to them completing the quest against the brotherhood
---
Allright because the forager dusty pipe revolver wont take down a supermutan master
---
Yeah you unequip it from the atomic shop, but it doesn't change the skin back until you re-place the camp. If you wait for the hotfix, it may retroactively fix it, but I'm honestly not sure, I wasn't using it on PC when the hotfix came through, so you'd need to hear from someone who was about whether or not they needed to re-place the base.
---
Just do the wendigo colossus event, don't worry about Earl just go after the wendigos and you will be screwed for life.
---
Well they’re using it to go to hell, correct?
---
You can only turn in 5 at a time ?
---
I'm trying for the tenderizer sense I got the spicy mod.
---
3 stacks of 5
---
All I wanted was the tato salad recipe. Instead I got 4 grill master hats and 5 chally heads.
---
Grahm is what happens when they give FEV to Mr. Rogers.
---
It’s not a solo event. Did you even try the event?
---
It’s not the Enclave you need to worry about. It’s me in ~185 years time when I thaw out of Vault 111.
---
Scrap it, now that so many people have plans to make them they are now worthless.
---
They can only do so much to protect you from yourself. Making you manually type in the exact name of the character you want to delete *should be* idiot proof...yet here we are.
---
I once found an unkillable Mirelurk King during a mission. As a low level, I can definitely confirm they are the hardest basic enemy I’ve ever faced.
---
I think I've seen it fail with people on the tents and not on the tents. I remember last year the waves of creatures would attack towards the drum. That was with no tents. I will note that this go around I've seen the waves not attack even if there was not a tent, so that may not be the problem.
---
I almost always have the latter, but never the former. That sucks tho, how does that even manage to ha-...
---
-looks at the game in question-
---
...nevermind.
---
True, I just thought maybe it bugged the event or something somehow. This is my first time doing meat week so it's all new to me. I generally use the vendors at the train stations while I scrip the legendaries anyway.
---
Thanks i was worried about lvl99 molerat chewing my decontamination shower
---
Fascists? Define “fascism”, then explain how the Enclave of Appalachia are fascists.
---
I'd be happy with something along these lines. I thinks it's less of a "Give us meat week" and more of a "give us fresh events" type of post, meat week has just been a catalyst for me. I'd love to see a monthly/bi-monthly style of event that rewards people players for co-operation (may be difficult to implement but I feel a large portion of the community would enjoy it, I could well be very wrong however).   
---
In all I'm not completely sure what would be right for this game and I won't pretend to know, but I'm definitely enjoying the path it's taking.
---
Bloodied will still out damage most builds. All stacked damage as a whole is what was nerfed. Each additional buff will have diminishing returns.
---
The vampires way is the way.
---
I have done it successfully every time I have attempted it in the past 2 days
---
Update: going on private server works for whatever reason. It does still have the blood sample on the private server. 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
Scorchbeasts, floaters and level 62 chared feral ghouls. Floaters just nerf you if ypu are to close. The first time I saw one it was in the ground and I thought it was a plant. The ghouls are everywhere and really hard to beat. And the scorch beasts! I have a quest to do thats a higher level because I have a habit of spamming on quest line even when I am way to low of a level and the hardest part isn't even the quest but the scorchbeasts in the area. Can't hide, can't run, can't fight.
---
Really? I have way more problems with deathclaws. The dam resistance is way higher and they drain ammo.
---
Had the same thought as well, before starting the event midweek. No worries !
---
I had this myself a few days ago, you have to untrack the quest. 
---
Log in, untrack all of your quests (make sure you know your way to the terminal), quit to deaktop, log back in, analyze then insert the fuse
---
Yup, I just had one fail because I didn't notice before the event I was basically on a dead server, with only 2 people present at the start of the event and 4 at the end.
---
They would probably have a random encounter every now and then they probs will not be essential
---
MKs are faster and much more efficient in their attacks than a Deathclaw. They’re also smaller targets.
---
The bloodworms in Nuka-World are somehow even more disgusting and annoying
---
True, but that is what VATS is for.
---
Public servers is 24 players isn't it? Buddy can't join bc it's full...maybe offer 100 caps to a random to server hop? If I ever get a message and asked nicely I wouldn't mind be personally.
---
We don’t necessarily do this bc we often can’t communicate with our teammates and we don’t know if they’re shit or not.
---
When you haven’t even looked at your perk packs yet, you only get 80 AP. Maybe I should actually decide on what I want to do now I’m level 46. My SPECIAL stats are *still* 1,1,1,1,1,1,1. And I haven’t opened a single perk pack.
---
*insert world’s smallest violin here*
---
This was very thoughtful and encouraging. I love reading deeper and analyzing video games, and I do think there are some messages to the players from the devs, especially in the radio host's dialogue.
---
Also, all in favor of Grahm the Wise??
---
Same, I’m just AFK at the drums and spit after getting all the outfits. I just need one mod and the actual tenderizer plan.
---
I mean, the event tracker doesn’t have anything telling you what to _do_.  It doesn’t help that every event I’ve been in finishes almost immediately.
---
*It just works.*
---
I’m glad it did work for you, though.
---
People can hop ontop of scaffolding structure above the drum too. Certain mobs like ghouls if they can't reach their intended target will run and seek cover behind stuff.
---
So far I've gotten Chally Outfit set including the backpack, 4 Tenderizer Plan Mods, 2 Meat Week Flag Plans , 2 Meat Cleaver Plans and 1 Brahmin grill  so far im happy
---
I grinded Fasnacht and I don’t want to do it again with this event so I’ll take whatever I get but I honestly don’t know what I’m suppose to do with all these extras.
---
I’ve also had this happen at scorched earth
---
I went to one with 3 on drums and two on spits.  We finished in 30 seconds as we were 75% to steak when we started.
---
That spot is called the gillman lumber mill.
---
Hello, I am Saint Jiub and would like to discuss the Cliff Racer
---
I keep getting the grill. I just want the flag.
---
thank you! ill try this right now
---
edit: still says no sample and cant interact with the centrifuge
---
I'll trade you flag plan for grill plan. I got 3
---
This is why I always make sure I’ve got two pieces of fall reduction armor equipped. One of them is my chest with the jetpack, which is pretty convenient.
---
Been happening to me all the time.... it’s the lag on the server that causes it I’m sure
---
*Dettlaff is calling your name.*
---
There's almost always a new, random item listed every day for 24 hours under the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. tab of the store. Today it's a Manta Man outfit. I've gotten some great stuff off there, like emotes and wallpapers I've not seen for sale on any other occasion.
---
IMO ice are worse because they drain fusion cores so PA is a liability when fighting them.
---
I wish I could avoid the posts. Not because of spoliers, but because they are repetitive and pointless.
---
Yay new plushies!
---
I have the auto stim chest with fall damage reduction..... 2 bird 1 stone 😉
---
Booooo
---
the only reason I dont always do it is because for some reason, that area d e s t r o y s my fps
---
the downvote brigade on this sub rarely makes any sense.
---
Fate is fate
---
I've always seen this event pop up on the map, but always wrote it off as another failure similar to the burrows. What can you actually get from this event?
---
I find that even just a single turret can work well to get the attention of any random trash that spawns nearby so my tamed pet can tear it a new one. Deathclaws and yao guai are very effective.
---
Wouldn’t mind if Project Paradise was removed from public event rotation and become the same as Queen event and Encrypted where we start it and it’s a free travel point. Then we could have easy start event upon request.
---
That's true. I don't believe in spoilers (I enjoy something because it is good, not because it is unexpected) but, man... I feel I could speedrun that shit.
---
I can help but im off for the night and won't be on til tomorrow.
---
similar in some weird to to the cerberus from manhunt
---
Thank you for sharing your Survivor Story.
---
Fallout 76 isn't a survival crafting game, it's a logistics and inventory management simulator.
---
🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀
---
Here's some cheese to go with your w(h)ine sir
---
If you still need it I can mod it up for you on PS4 after I get home from work.  I know how much if a pain it can be trying to learn mod plans; I still don't know all of them.
---
Also a shout out to the Rad Rats who seem to be near as tough as a Super Mutant in health/armor, but with the hit box of the mole rat or wolf.
---
Colonel Gutsies can fuck right off, have multiple pieces of Vangaurd/troubleshooters SS armor and they always seem to wreck my shit with that stupid 3 round burst that eats my health, cripples my limbs, and staggers me.
---
Ahhh hell yess!!!!!
---
The more players around, the more the jetpack will go crazy
---
Lol
---
Ooh, that’s a good idea. Chally’s Feed seems to give a disproportionately high amount of progress - like prime meat - but I don’t have any numbers on it. Has anyone seen percentages anywhere for it? That adds material for the runners while we sit on the spits.
---
That's pretty fucked up. Support says they can't do a lot of stuff, but we all know there's *someone* in Bethesda who could do just about anything they wanted. They own the game and all the data in it, they just wont do it.
---
I miss Fallout 4 since I would hard every thing.
---
I’ve notice it happen to me if I get hit while I’m jumping or boosting upward. Sometimes I’ll just fly like a mile into the air
---
lol with VATS you can track them through their tunneling
---
A massive salt shaker filled with 8-9 lbs of salt does
---
Thanks for the info. And yeah I tend to skim read te patch notes aha.
---
According to the wiki, they do essentially the same damage, but the Mauser has a much higher rate of fire while the Browning has much higher ammo capacity.  You'll be reloading a lot more with the lmg, but with lock and load and the fireworks glitch, that might not be so bad.
---
I haven’t purchased it. But I thought it did? That’s why the deathclaw is inside a perfectly closed cage. Or was that bull
---
Sound like a bitch to me
---
U sound salty
---
Mine is a Hunter’s/AP/Fall piece. It’s been really useful. I try to have one piece for each main creature type on my full health build. 
---
Hunter’s, Mutant Slayer’s, Troubleshooter’s, Zealot’s and Ghoul Slayer’s. It gives me a good range of coverage, at least to me.
---
Aight, thank you. Would .50 Cal bullets be worth more than .308?
---
Doing the rubber bang trick might ruin your sticks though. Only downside.
---
That's what really bothers me about support saying they can't do something when we all know full well they could, but they're just too fucking lazy and don't give enough of a shit to do it. Just have the balls to say we wont help you, not make up lies about it being impossible.
---
Man even WoW got with the times and added AoE looting back in 2012.  C'mon, Zenimax.
---
I think OP means to foundations, because it does snap to itself
---
Cost more caps to buy?
---
I thought I heard Vance....
---
Agreed on them should be account wide. I have no idea why not as it should be something to help all your characters.
---
Yes, which one would be worth more? Like which one would be easier to get?
---
An oldie but a goodie.
---
This event makes me really miss fasnacht. Now *that* was a great community event (with great rewards, too). As much as I want to love meat week, it feels empty most of the time. A handful of people show up, it's over in a few minutes and I'm left with another 1* piece of junk to add to my scrip backlog. The new plans are cool, but once I get one of each I *shan't* be meat-weeking any more.
---
Equip blocker and hop in PA if your running heavy gun. Thats 68% reduction in melee damage withour DR bejng figured in.
---
Use fields surgeon perk + born survivor with your PA and you wont die. 
---
Only thing you need to avoid is poison untill the legendary perks drop
---
Are you planning on using ultracite?
---
I wish more people knew this.  
---
I had some clown actually kick me out of a public events group because I was on drums . . .
---
Im not sure yet. Would you reccomend it?
---
PC?
---
Wait they aren't account wide?
---
They've shown they're capable of resetting progression especially after the X-Mas inventory steal hack. They rolled everyone back 2 solid weeks before the hack went live.
---
Have they had much difficulty in mangling the lore yet? I thought they had a great time just splicing and piecing together whatever they wanted so far.
---
Pretty sure this is something to do with how close they are to you when you leave a building/room.  I've had a similar instance on other fallouts and even skyrim. Running inside Lakeview Manor to escape a giant and then I got f'ing wasted in my own damn living room.
---
And still a month later and no helmet gg..........
---
Never had it failed for me, Primal Cuts however......
---
Thanks for the offer! I’ll add but I probably won’t be on until tommorrow
---
I would say go regular first, if you don't feel like you're doing enough damage, try ultracite.
---
Why? Lmao
---
I got the shadow liberty prime, now I need the ultracite tesla coil plan just because of this comment.
---
Nah.guided meditation is my fav.i cannot stand that event you are talking about.same with the monster mash.just lame as hell.i want to do them solo.i could care less about teamwork.
---
Aight
---
Not on the PTS, which is pretty much what's going into the LIVE build for the next major update...
---
From what I've gathered from comments on this post, it seems that the Perk Slots themselves are account-wide once you unlock all 6 on a level 300 character, but Bethesda has somehow managed to not make the perks themselves account-wide, which seems like a HUGE oversight to me.
---
I'd appreciate it! I'm in no hurry. I just wanted to get word out so I could eventually have one at my base. :)
---
It has nothing of worth in it. A stimpack, 2 ores, and junk.
---
90% of this subreddit.
---
You no murder me. I no murder you.
---
Stupid question, but are you using an automatic Tesla? Someone posted earlier that an unmodded Tesla doesn't seem to cause FPS issues. I haven't checked for myself though. The telsa is my favorite gun but it's completely unusable at any events right now. Hoping for some sort of work around until they fix it.
---
It just works
---
So would .50 cal be cheaper to buy?
---
To answer your previous question, 50 cal ammo is much cheaper.
---
YES!
---
During Peak XP grinding last monthish I got 2 Puncturing Mods &amp; 1 bear arm plan which is a sign that people knew what what they were during the event. Sure, I've seen plenty of times 8 derps were in a room and still didn't get it too 60, but enough people are figuring it out that  all the event needs is 3 or 4 people who know what they are doing to show up to get it done right.
---
The XP is still great from solo running the A room so even if no one shows I'll still be doing it next season.
---
Yes, 50 cal is cheaper to craft.  If you plan on buying from vendors, they tend to be both 1 cap each.
---
Ok. Thank you so much. Have a nice day!
---
You know you don't have to run out right? Stay and loot the bodies you just made.  
---
The trunk near the entrance/exit has nothing good inside. Junk and a stimpack.  
---
If you stay in the mine, it just kicks you out when the timer ends. You keep your junk and dont die.
---
You could probably find someone to build you one on the FO76 Market Discord server.
---
https://discord.gg/JGtqur
---
Yeah. I’ll be on the drums watching high level power suit guys blasting everything and not helping.
---
If you need the shocks installed and are on Xbox, let me know. Its a +100 carry weight for them. Then the chest piece (forget the name) adds 1 to strength. I had the same issue until i finally got the plans for my ultracite PA.
---
If you’re on Xbox I’m pretty sure I have an extra tato salad recipe I’ll trade for a chally head lol
---
I’m level 60 and still get two shot by a 36 assaultron blade like what
---
Do you think WE can do anything about it? So why are you hassling US?
---
If you have any further questions, I would direct you towards the lovely wikipedia for the game.
---
After reading all the posts, I am already frustrated with it and I haven't even played it yet 😂
---
I inserted the fuse first , the the blood. Worked after relogging 1 time
---
3 days ago
---
thing is i dont have the blood sample given back to me
---
Usually what I do. I just don't understand why a private is only 8...
---
LOL! Bird Bones, my dude.
---
the 2 extra xp i got while in a building really wasnt worth it. I could eat a cranberry item and get a better result.
---
That shit is so tragic. I hope they flush out the supermutant history more, and Grahm's backstory specifically. I'm still wicked confused. huntersville was a prewar but the prison.. postwar by the Enclave?  Who and what and when is Smartie?
---
Random order
---
Allowing legendary perks would give this game so much replay value for those wanting to invest time in another character. This, along with the implementation of a form of account wide storage, would be on par with elder scrolls online and their system. 
---
This series has a television show coming which can attract some many new players, Bethesda has never had the bigger chance to cash out by fixing the game and maxing out replay value. Their change of the legendary perks is already huge progress &lt;3
---
Some enemys should be hard than others
---
Oh man, I really don’t wanna be a bother, but could you also help me do the same? 
---
I totally understand if not, but I’d be happy to spot you some caps and spare meat week items for the trouble! 
---
Gt is MyDudeBro, and once again man, I totally understand if it’s an inconvenience. Just thought  I’d ask :)
---
Yeah that's a good one
---
Damn, how annoying that is
---
Yes! Please! It’s actually challenging which is why no one does it.
---
Bloateds are the same as the meth addicts, just with a high infusion of radiation. Learn to pick off their heads properly and it will be less of an issue. My gatling gun does quite the service to their pea brains.
---
Dylan Rhodes disliked that. But shit man, he dislikes everything.
---
I had the same problem a few days ago.
---
Its the future tec C.A.M.P skin, thats causing the issue
---
I think you're going to have days you don't feel like playing and there will be stretches of time when there is nothing really going on. There are ups and downs to these things.
---
That is the worst, and you really don't know for sure until it's too late. With a few people on the spots even afk it isn't too bad to finish with a few but without it it's impossible :(
---
Any idea what that would go for? At this point in my character I'm just dumping caps for serum plans, so this could be a nice help in that area. Console PS4 if it makes a difference
---
I am a bloodied build xD
---
Myself, at close combat, forgetting I'm weilding an explosive handmade. The amount of times I've put myself down is too many.
---
Get some fall damage armor, it will become your best friend.
---
I am using an automatic Tesla. Hmm.
---
&gt;.&gt; &lt;.&lt; Plot twist.. most of the new NPCs are Synths trying to get their hands on that bouleon..
---
you dont say...
---
That's if you have the stealth armor.  I've been putting off completing the wastelands quest for a while.  I'm working towards that again.
---
I dont recall the event failing if you dont get ore. I know it fails if all the npcs die but then again I'm either killing ghouls for the xp or using my shishkebab to keep them alive to prevent it from failing XD
---
That's for the looted greens. The crafted greens go in a hay pile next to her
---
Just don't engage the trolls. Spend enough time here and you'll recognize them quickly enough.
---
I have bird bones - from that height it’s not helping. If I wasn’t dying from it I would think the shear height was hysterical.
---
It might be worth trying without the auto mod. I'm gonna do it tomorrow if I remember, just to see.
---
Looking like I’ll have to.. just got the jetpack after putting it off forever and it has not been a fun meat week. *sigh*
---
Do some quests then you lazy unimaginative squirrel bit.
---
Same here. I’m on PS4 so I’ve been wondering if all these failed events are happening on PC and XBox. All the meat cooks I’ve been too have finished rather quickly, and I haven’t seen anyone trying to fail it intentionally like I did Fasnacht.
---
Oh man, that hurts
---
I only start it if I'm going to solo it.
---
I wish you luck and clear skies! LOL
---
Can i still do foundation missions after finishing waste landers with the raiders? Because it told me i couldn’t complete missions from them anymore
---
Whaaa?this for real
---
50 cal easy to feed!
---
https://fed76.info/
---
I'm lowhealth in PA too. I just leave my pipboy open to the status tab that has the hotkey for radaway. open it up and pop a couple when things are getting sketchy. It's not like it's hard to get your rads back again after you get your ore.
---
I swear to christ I'm the only one that ever grabs ore.. while my dingus allies still let the npcs die
---
That is massively stupid. Who the fuck is going to level each toon up to level 900?!?
---
60% of the time, it works every time
---
FUCK colonel gutsies, it is a mystery as to why the lasers do next to no damage but that three round burst tears through anything
---
On the other side, if squishy me is helping to kill things, don’t like...leave me dead on the ground so the 5% chance I had to actually shoot the fake sheepsquatch disappears into the aether. If I miss out over and over, I’m going to get salty about contributing and hide until it’s safe.

I prefer the plague mask with the civil war era suit and top hat
---
I just got an Instigating Marksman 10mm the other day  (with explosive) and it’s been a real blast.
---
Agreed.....peasant
---
sucks having to zoom in or head to the event spot early. damn those other players for not making life easy for you
---
Yeah Bethesda isn't very transparent with how any of the events work. It's one of the reasons so many of the more difficult ones are rarely ever done. Thankfully we have an active community here to help spread info learned.
---
Just have an assault tron head. Easy rads on demand
---
Oh god no, no no no, no.
---
Why not just buy the serums?
---
I wonder what will come first, cyberpunk 2077 or the colossal problem event
---
Ouch! I'm hurting for you. I'd be pissed!
---
I take 4 precautions every day to avoid the auto complete bug. Got hit last time there was a double SCORE weekend.
---
1. Play adventure and get all dailies
---
2. Go to NW, get that daily
---
3. Log into adventure and log off
---
4. Never ever under any circumstance play the game anywhere close to daily reset. I leave a good 1 hour buffer before and after for good measure.
---
That is terrible, I have sent a few messages to folks in game trying to help educate but more often then not it's meet with hostility.
---
I've done them all...
---
Done the daily quests about 100 times each
---
.....Yes.
---
if bullet time was a thing I would be all for cazadors because their venom was used to make turbo but you cant really do it in mp
---
Wait, there are serum for mutations? You get to choose which ones you get? I'm lvl 116 and there's still things I don't know about this game lmao
---
This is relevant advice, and I thank you for it :)
---
If you're on PS4, I'll hook you up. No charge.
---
Wait wtf, they aren't account wide? I thought that was like one of the main point of it...
---
This.
---
Yep having that problem alot latley, best solution is if you catch it early is to 1) stop firing for a sec then resume shooting, this tends to finish the clip. 2) swap weapons real quick with the wheel/hot key so it doesnt reload. Ive yet to figure out the root cause of this issue but it sure is annoying for those who use them.
---
It removes mutations randomly (and it's really frustrating) it's much easier to buy mutation serums from players of the mutations you want. You can usually find them for around 500 caps
---
Oh so this is why I see people sort of just chilling in the same spot for an entire hour lol. I thought they were going going idle until the event and it was a way to keep them from getting disconnected lol. Thanks for the info!
---
The legs man. As soon as you get a bead on their legs it's all over.
---
Ill never forget the day I found out about shooting the legs out. They became a very little threat after that.
---
Yes. I find them at player vendors. Im on xbox one. I think they are craftable but I have no idea how. They under listed used the aid tab in player vendors.
---
Much thanks!
---
You can purchase them from a vendor in the Enclave bunker, but you will be better off purchasing from a player vendor. A typical (decent) price from player vendor is between 200-500 caps, and you will find them at that price frequently. Dont buy if it's over 650 caps, unless you are desperate.
---
Lmao wtf it all depends on your build. Heavy gunner, yes. But many high-levels, including myself (level 350) run stealth commando, and that build should hardly ever use power armor. Now that I think about it, heavy gunners are really the only ones that should even consider doing that, solely because of the stabilized perk. For everyone else unyielding or vanguard’s armor is superior.
---
Dangit, I'm on PC
---
I would consider the LMG better than the 50 Cal but the other's who have said that the 50 Cal is better ammo wise are correct. Unless you prime the LMG it will be far to costly to run as a regular gun to use compared to the 50 Cal however if you have a tonne of Fluorescent Flux or can get your hands on a good amount in my opinion it's the better option.
---
Totally random
---
Youre right. its a national security announcement.
---
Assaultrons... I especially hate how some of them have an infinite charged head laser. It's happened so many times, I don't know if it's a big or part of the game
---
They're actually under the Misc section when you look at a players vender.
---
Imagine sbq with a shit load of scorched Cazadores.
---
Thank you
---
The first legendary one I found had 90% reduced weight. It's definitely the best effect for that weapon.
---
Do they still zap your fusion cores dry? That's the only reason I hate fighting Floaters. If a Icy fucker shows up and I'm in power armor, those cores are *dead.*
---
You really want to get there a few minutes early for a few reasons. If all of the servers are full from people joining at that time you may be put on a brand new or very low populated server. Another reason is if people see no one there around the time it starts they might try to find a new server.
---
Oh yeah well your mom hasn’t happened yet! NOOB! AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
---
I really would do at least 1 pylon, but I'm a bloodied build so thats a no go for me
---
try the blackwater mine! spawns vary but it isn’t under lock. i feel like i’ve seen raider more often than not though.
---
You know what most of you are just asshats . I’m going to see Garhm and I’m gunna cry about my problems to him . Atleast he sings me songs 😭😭 you pricks
---
This is why I’m deliberate about anything permanent that I do.  Grinding up gear for scrip, selling, throwing away, whatever.  I’d rather waste an extra two seconds than shoot myself in the foot.
---
It's because Rad Damage counts as actual damage
---
So you can get a disease just from being *near* a Diseased Glowing creature
---
Just went to Enclave and one serum costs around 20k, wtf lol
---
She happened back in 1982 and I’ve been regretting it since 2001 buddy.
---
Or, you know, just add text chat.
---
There's a lot of similar posts so it may help to do some searching on this sub..
---
The long and short is: try not to perk for carry weight. You want balance of mostly damage perks, with a few utility.
---
Shotguns and pistols are the two weakest gun classes. Many would argue melee outperforms both.
---
Meta is auto rifles and heavy guns, often running with bloodied or junkies builds (please look up terms you don't understand)
---
I still don’t have tato salad after many, many events. RNG is real and annoying.
---
Sunnyside Ski resort is pretty reliably raider PA
---
I run this event with a junkie stealth commando and a heavy PA gunner.
---
Now  these are just my observation so please don’t expect perfection. its gonna be a bit of a long post I apologize for that. But When i run commando i also play a huge support role.ex: reviving people who go down, thinning the wendigo herd so the group doesn’t get overwhelmed. So it does gives me time to see what people are doing. 
---
For tesla users just stay completely away from them as much as possible. they eventually get themselves swarmed and go down. I personally refuse to revive anyone wielding a tesla rifle during this event because they add nothing to the team and murder my frame rate. 
---
As for the stagger in the fight you need to be aware of your surroundings. Destroy the wendigos as soon as you see them. Even if you have to take pressure off earl. the problem i notice is that everyone wants to unload on earl and ignore most of the wendigo spawns until they are right up in your face. 
---
Do not ever and mean ever let your health get below 75% Slam those stimpaks like its your job. Between wendigos, earl and the environmental hazards it is very easy for your health to get nuked. That stimpak you may see as a waste because your at 65% health very well may be the one that saves your life. On average i carry around 40 stimpaks and leave with less then 10. 
---
I see a lot of heavy gunners do this and it’s probably because you can get away with it during the queen fight. But for the love of everything Don’t get up in earls face. Act like he has the covid and stay six feet away. not only does it leave you in proximity to his fear attack but it leaves you vulnerable. You can’t see what is behind you if your attention is all on earl. Plus when i keep my distance I rarely get hit by his fear attack. 
---
Next  Don’t bring your minigun to this fight. The massively slow charge up when firing is going to leave you wide open. At the very least get something a little faster. The final word is pretty decent. 
---
Get to the event as soon as it spawns. It raises your chances of getting with a decent team. Otherwise you risk getting stuck with low levels and screw farmers. And yes i am fully aware the mass amount of screws this event gives but they are not the main objective. The event has a chance at giving much better rewards including giving weapons like the fixer and bear arms. Granted you know the plans. 
---
As for teams. for this fight it helps to have at least one person who can take out wendigo spawns and revive other players.  If your playing that role. do not hesitate to drop wendigos as soon as they spawn. People can whine about screws all they want but it is very easy to get overran. These things are worse then feral ghouls in packs. 
---
When earl dies. One simple word. RUN!!!!! the ending gets so chaotic it is very very easy to get overwhelmed.  I constantly see people attempting to fight the wendigo that spawn along the escape route. Do not stop for anything. just get out of there. You will get staggered but do not fight back unless absolutely necessary. Slam a stimpak and keep running. 
---
Finally this event can get really frustrating. This isn’t the queen where half the server shows up and melts the queen and her mobs. It does require a little more attention. Between playing defense and offense. To be honest I allmost gave up because it is just so chaotic. Then i started watching others. Finding my own role and what works for me. practice makes perfect. keep trying. Work on learning to juggle between the wendigos and earl first. Then worry about being the best in the fight.
---
It is. One post spins on its axis and that the one that snaps.
---
The bear arm plan and two mod plans for it. Formula p and stimpack diffuser plans. Artos lab coat and arktos backpack skins.
---
I smell cap
---
If you want a tenderizer, I have the plan and mods for it. I can make one for you. Assuming you’re ps4. If you’re trying to get the plans and mods for yourself then it’s completely random.
---
Armorer rank 3 reduces the cost to ten vault steel.
---
I’d be happy if they just increased the limit to ten, but 50-100 would be amazing.
---
Thats the recipe. Serums are like 3 to 4k
---
No one buys serums from enclave unless it's the recipe. 
---
Vendor hop peoples camps and find them for 500 or less.
---
do we time out while afking on drums/spits? everytime ive tried it, the server disconnects so idk if its server problems or timing out
---
Hear that .. I am dead in seconds, I can however put it down quick. I usually focus on bots to let everyone get a shot on it then put the hurt on. I assume most low health ers are the same so I can imagine there is often not many that can hold pylons.  We should get a raise of hands on how many don't die instantly went they hit that pylon button.
---
You need to get to level fucking 900 to max out 6 cards. There are people who have been playing since beta who aren't level 900. Instead of people not maxing them the first week people are never going to max them.
---
New torso mod: Ink Defense
---
The Plasma ***WHAT***
---
That sounds so fucking sick I would immediately stop using my Super Sledge and start using that
---
Well salt is heavier than ground pepper or hot spices
---
I got all 3 mods too, just use peppered anyway, it’s the highest increase in damage. Salted is nice with cripple, but not worth the weight. I have no clue why I would ever use spicy, that energy games gain was so low it’s a joke.
---
Where do you normally get wasted?
---
This is the answer you seek OP. Same thing happens in all high player events.
---
Same happened to me.
---
In Fritzl's basement but he's closed it now...
---
Challenge Invented.
---
You forgot death.. I bet death beats both .. lol
---
The upcoming "Daily Ops" is a very challenging mini-raid.
---
I suppose your right, it must be difficult with all your SPECIAL at 1!
---
More lag=more jetpack jump tings for some reason.
---
Standing in water will just get you parasites before you catch whoopsie.

Back in 4, stomping was one of the possible cinematic kills. I miss it.
---
Yo u/Nekrosias apparently it ain't just you, babe.
---
RIP buddy, sorry to hear.
---
I always name my leveling character "G" 'cause it's the first letter that pops up and then I won't accidentally delete a character I care about.
---
Im unironically really excited. This looks like such a fuckin great event
---
The worst thing is that it will still be broken when it releases for us console players. It so bullshit that they give it to them early so they can test it and stuff and since they can’t hotfix on Xbox and PS4 as quick, yet it’s still gonna be a buggy mess when it comes out. Sick of all the shit bethesda pulls
---
The 2 minute timer doesn’t start before the hour, it’s part of the event and starts on the hour
---
Probably not gonna be a popular opinion but o well🤷🏻‍♂️Id rather see the bloated ghouls move faster and hit harder. Maybe lower the hitbox a little. Shouldn’t be able to hit me while i fly 6ft in the air. I mean what is this the NBA? Honestly it’s pretty easy for me to steam roll through a group of them. I’d like to occasionally be caught off guard. Maybe even adding in one of the glowing ones from earlier fallouts that could revive their friend's.
---
I’m trying to find that plan again now that I have more caps.  Where did you find it?
---
No way in hell anyone would trade legacies for a 10% drop chance plan from an event happening every hour for a week straight
---
Aren't servers down for maintenance
---
No joke, Bethesda has delayed literally every single new thing at least once.  They can never meet their original release dates.  It sucks even more when they hype something up and it gets delayed for so long where you just aren’t as excited anymore.
---
Efficiency?  It would be great to ding 50, open all those packs, then fill in a build accordingly but the lack of level cap makes that feel like a waste for me.  Especially now that it seems we'll be able to trade in those extra cards soon.
---
Oof. So I got it but it's level 45
---
I don’t use power armor very often so I’m not sure
---
What I normally do is my vampires flamer when I see a horde coming my way , so I can get the health regen to fight through them . I’ve got a “magic” shotgun , and I’m going to get a few perk cards to get a little higher damage because it takes 3 shots for the little brats , and that’s my full ap bar , and I have to wait for a bit of ap to vats magic shot the rest . it’s a slow process and i die . I normally switch between either the flamer and a my mini gun or the shotty and my mini gun . Mini gun on earl so I can actually get some hits in before he dies . I try to play the support like you say . But it dosnt work when I can’t tell someone’s using a Tesla , and I go to get their horde of them and then I’m magically at 5 FPS and literally can’t see my health drop . So  when that happens I stab myself with a stim. My problem is that I die soooooo many times I get the full 60 second count down . And at first it was Ouhkay , then it was because of some magic one shot , I stream so I have proof of it , I was full health then just dead . Not even on the ground waiting to be revived , just dead . And there’s 7 people standing in a circle around my body ? Now my absolute biggest issue is the Tesla people .  Between the staggering and and everything else going on , and thennnnn the Tesla I top of that , I just can’t see . It’s unplayable. And the fact I’m shooting a mini gun makes it ten times worse because I’m trying to then force my game to keep up and shoot . There’s been times where my games flat out crashed because of it . And that time didn’t upset me anywhere near as bad as just flat out losing the loot . And that’s what makes me so mad . There’s 7 other people down there , and not one of the people I get in groups with EVER revived me . So i wait 10 seconds and if nothing then I force die and respawn . And that’s the start of the cycle . And because I keep on going down ,still no one gets me and then I inevitably lose out on the loot because I’m stuck in a respawn screen . And I KNOW im not the only person going through this . And if by some miracle I am the only person . Then dosnt that say I clearly know nothing about the game and could use some help ? (Which yes you are providing I’m just being snarky towards the others)
---
Uncle Roger sad now
---
Wow, you are truly a humble and benevolent man. You are just like those kids on tiktok that take a plate of food to a homeless person and make sure they record it for the world to see just how caring they are. Would hate to have your barely noticeable act of charity go unnoticed by reddit.
---
You need the plan for your pa's jetpack

The Vault-Tec Skin from the Legendary Run on PS4 still causing glitch.  I had to remove skin and move my CAMP, to get my camp to display again.  But if you want the true Fallout experience, keep it on!

Muting your baby is definitely a PSA.

First hand you gotta set the baby up right if you're gonna get a meaningful play session.

Also a PSA- don't have full family discussions over mic. We don't need to hear that shit while I'm *dodge-duck-dive-dip... and dodge* 'n with the ISS.

Same

Already got a explosive Gatling for a back pack plan and the stove.
---
When I participate in the event I usually just become a conduit and/or just kill other bots. Every time I try to fight him I die, doesn't help that I'm bloody build. I may miss out on exp from him, but I get a  decent amount for completing the event.
---
The level of the PA changes depending on who has been in the area. It can range from lv 15 to 45.
---
Server hop until you get what you need! Could take a while though :)
---
And Mr. Farmhands near Wayward, and Radstags, foxes, etc...yep, they all do the same during primal cuts.

Welcome to mmos. Maybe they need to do like destiny here past the cap you start earning prior seasons cosmetics. But this is the first season so hard to tell what they gonna do with future seasons.

Fixed an exploit that made it so a player didn't have to log in every day for a week to buy an item. HWID banned all the hackers that used the exploit.

a better comparison would be how Islam still can't accept that women aren't property to be subject to death by stoning because they were raped.

If you don’t complete the enclave quest line you do not beat the main quest.
---
You can and will time out, there ways around it but the only reliable one I have seen involves a rubber band to turn the camera. Plug in your controller also.
---
Okay. Thank you!😉
---
Ignore anything related to mutations/serums there until you have run out of ideas for spending caps.  They're just a gold sink.
---
Players used to be able to get the recipes from the scorchbeast queen, others (like me) have them because I ran out of other things to spend caps on.  MANY people can make the serums for you for much less than investing in the recipes or buying them from a vendor.
---
As someone else mentioned, you'll run across them *VERY* frequently in player vendors, anywhere from sub-300 to thousands of caps.  400-500 is a pretty typical price if you shop around.
---
Don't bother too much with them until you're a bit higher level, as you can lose the mutations (as you know).  Once you've gotten the perks in luck that will allow you to keep the mutations more or less permanently, (called Starched Genes, available starting at level 30), and prevent you from picking up random mutations, it will be a little frustrating.  But if you have the caps, feel free.
---
There's also a perk card that reduces the 'bad' effects like the reduced strength, so instead of (for instance) Egg Head giving you -3 str, it reduces the penalty down to -1.  It's called Class Freak, available starting at level 46.
---
whenever i do that it spins me out and off the drums aghh
---
My least favorite is feral ghouls honestly. I swear, that stupid leaping thing they do must be like homing or something cause they almost never fail to hit me.
---
Mountain side cabin always has one too
---
I love the look and sound, but rng on the mods is terrible. I only need the silencer now, but at 10 adhesive, 13 springs, and 15 screws each I have depleted my resources. I've scrapped around 50 rifles so far.
---
I found her much better after I romanced her lol.
---
And I got to feel loved for once
---
Random, I got it idling on the drums.
---
I’m not telling you which drum though, just in case!
---
I have a 2 shot rifle with 50% limb damage that works wonders on their legs
---
I think it’d be easier to list the ones that aren’t the worst. This is a short list of the ones that are the worst at the moment I run into them:
---
Mole rats yes they suck
---
Floaters, those things are the worst. 
---
Radscorpions, I hate them, they are the worst, especially the scorched variety that pop up out of nowhere while I’m focused on the SBQ.
---
Mirelurk spawn, just the worst because of the sheer annoyance factor. Imagine one of those killing you.
---
Level 52 Col. Gutsy I hate him he’s the worst.
---
Awesome tip. I wish I'd thought of that.
---
Tbh, I’d be rank 100 as soon as the next board hits if that happened
---
Knowing how rng works, i'll be seeing those enemies once a day and giving me nocturnal/40 power attack/+1 agility lead pipes.
---
But I like your idea anyway =)
---
What's your build? Can you make it on nukes and dragons? I'm going shotgun, most dmg in vats,, so using commando effectively is possible together?
---
Us at the beelzebilly gang give our sympathy.
---
Yeah those mods are live, in the pc version at least cuz I’m not sure about console
---
I agree they should do *something* with the extra score after completion, but rolling over is not the right answer.
---
Doing so would directly make me want to play the game less in the future, knowing I have already finished X of the next season.
---
I think the Legendary Run is far more interesting than old weekly challenges, where the Atoms were nice, but it was not as *interesting*.
---
Level ups and ranks are often associated with gamification for a reason. At its core, all this past update did was provide us a visually interesting counter as incentive to those old weekly challenges. 
---
It's a number to signify progress, and the key to all these games is to give us a reason to count numbers over and over again, watching those numbers grow, as that growth is reflective of our game's progress.
---
On the topic of FOMO, Beth has stated you can buy some of this run's items (maybe even all of them) in the gold bullion shop.
---
Everytime there's been Grahm's cook in the past,it gives me a chance to groove on the drums. This one's been no exception. Lol.
---
Any in specific?
---
Kings seemed much easier in FO4.
---
They burrow right to ur feet, which isn’t great if you have an explosive weapon as you end up damaging yourself
---
So true. I’m almost annoyed that I can’t try the event and get screwed over too.
---
I use a gauss rifle for single shot kills at range, I use a lever for more close quarters killing.
---
That might be a good thing. Sounds like it stresses the PC's hard. So I am assuming it will just crash the consoles.  But we are missing out on screws. And I heard a rumour that if you just ignore Earle and focus on the windagos you go net positive on ammo looting the minions.
---
I’m almost certain many players forget or straight up don’t know intelligence increases xp gain. Almost always Building Teams contain 200+ level players that are experienced and know.
---
Get a nice flamer. I have a furious, 90% lighter, 40% bashing flamer. It’s modded out and will melt a mirelurk king in under 4 seconds. It will do the same to wendigo and level 62 bloated glowing ones.
---
Tbh the fixer or the handmade with the hardened semi auto would be better than any sniper but besides that it probably would be the gauss rifle with a suppressor on it, the thing is auto rifles are so much better than semi automatic ones in this game
---
It's guys those little A holes
---
you need to find the Pinochet NPC. He'll help you out, commie.
---
I apologize it’s Middle mountain cabins next to Black water mine.
---
Well, FO4. The first time I encountered an Assaultron Dominator in that game, I had no idea what happened. I just insta died.
---
[Picture of a bloated ghoul](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/2/20/Fo4-bloated-glowing-one.png/revision/latest?cb=20170422230238)
---
I don't think a Bloated weighs in at 150kg. More like 105-115kg, judging by size and muscularity. Even in reality, a person with comparable phisiques would be a fucking meat train if ran towards you. Look at its thighs, arms and back, he's built more like a football player than a morbidly obese person (take in consideration that its bulges are filled with watery pus, not fat).
---
In other words, he's gonna fucking decimate you IRL.
---
She’s so much more tolerable than the raider punk.   If I hear ‘how NOW brown cow’ one more fkin time....
---
Yeah totally random with between 2 and 3% chance to drop for the weapon plan and mods for the weapon
---
God I hope you were drunk
---
No way lol
---
Fashionable raider hat with the plague mask is my go to.
---
Yes, but only when we go on the Expeditions. I’d like Appalachia to not be a mish-mosh of every Fallout creature that ever existed. Having specific enemies be tied to certain expeditions would add a little adventure to it, I think.
---
Ok I get you want to get the point across about horrible UI, Bethesda garbo, and all that which I agree. But how do you miss the entire event? I honestly can’t imagine you just sitting there for a few minutes trying to click on the event.
---
I have a TSE Troubleshooter’s LMG converted to ultracite. I take that thing with me on silo runs. It’s sweet the way it cuts down assaultrons nothing flat.
---
Also they have sprite effects but the are barely noticeable. What a crime
---
I just relegated myself to a walking, typing peanut gallery.  As long as I stay amused I stopped giving a damn lol.
---
And they're fast.
---
Oh okay! Thank you!😄
---
Fallout 76 is not an MMO
---
I'm on xbox and didn't see them there.
---
That's what I'm saying though, the way the level up and SPECIAL system work makes this pretty pointless IMO. Yeah it would be nice to have all the points you need to set your build up the minute you hit lv50, but you can keep your build going past lv50 anyway, so I'd rather chose cards I might not use later on that will be useful to me now?
---
The absolute *best* single shot weapon?
---
You'd be hardpressed to find something that can beat my magic combat shotgun. I can one tap Wendigo spawn with ease without having any perks invested in shotguns.
---
Realistically, since you're looking at rifles, lever action is probably your best bet. But that's not really the important part. What matters is your build, perks, and the legendary effects on the gun. 
---
If you can be positive you'll always get the first shot, instigating is hard to beat. More often then not, you won't get the first shot off of you're in a populated area or are playing with friends. 
---
Anti Armor is a great effect that doesn't require any perk changes on you're part, but it loses its effectiveness on certain enemies that don't really have armor to pierce.
---
Bloodied is fantastic if you don't mind running low health all the time (most of us do that), and junkies is a good 2nd choice if you don't mind being strung out (but at full health) all the time. 
---
Tl;dr
---
Lever Action is a good start, but you need to focus more on your build and legendary effects to get a good "One shot, one kill" vibe going on.
---
That’s why I usually keep her around.   Her and I work together to annoy my customers with ceaseless guitar/banjo duets
---
Well my option for it is to maybe make it too 200 instead of 100 and once you earn all the rewards from 1 to 100 you earn atoms, perk packs, script, gold, caps, lunch boxes and maybe perk coins too from 101 to 200
---
It is not a single player game either. It’s a shooter looter at best. If you wanna get technical. 🤷🏽‍♂️
---
I always rush to revive people without even taking a second to assess the danger, which has lead to me kissing the dirt next to them on a few occasions. I really hate when people die near me without even getting incapacitated; I know there's nothing I can do for them, but I still feel like I failed them. This guy was hiding from the beginning, though; I showed up during the recall countdown and I never once saw him leave the cabin.
---
After you been married for a while, you learn to ignore it.
---
Yes he is. I died like 10 times one afternoon, and I was over 200 at that point.
---
Angry Turtle said that both Pocketed mods are on PC but he is waiting on the Ultra-Light mods. I'm  on Xbox and went to check for the Pocketed mods, they not there yet but the Ultra-Light mods ARE there. Bethesda is BS'ing around
---
Teammates are also helpful.
---
Most ammo is still overpriced at 1 cap per. Bundling ammo would do wonders for the player vending economy.
---
I mainly hate how they instantly know where you are even in full stealth. As soon as caution pops up its then Danger and they're biting your ass.
---
I can have a Windingo walk right through me and not detect or a scortchbeast right in my face looking for me as I unload my shotgun in its face..... but a mole rat halfway across the map?
---
Dont forget to pick up the rotten leftover meat piles, poo piles, and put out the fires. Those take away progress per sec. Deposit the greens too. Dont be lazy.
---
It's not a skin but a different Jetpack so you have to craft it to replace the old one.
---
Oh how the posts are real nice.
---
I thought you could just walk out and walk back in and her legendary modules and vault steel where back?
---
Not sure why, but I read this at least three times as ‘tiddy’ profit.
---
ARE THEY RATS OR ARE THEY MOLES
---
I've literally never seen it, despite looking.
---
I'm starting to think it's a myth.
---
Ok how do I do that? I do want to actually help.
---
Edit : oh nvm we can't. I see.
---
I've been learning from this seasons double xp weekend for next season. 
---
I've been loading up on berry mentats, leader bobbleheads, sugar bombs etc in preparation to just grind out exp so I don't have to log in every day
---
The value it shows on the item is what it costs for you to buy it from a vendor, not how much you get for it. How much you get is increased with higher charisma, but never to 500 caps.
---
Ain't no one stopping me from rocking that chemical drum 😜
---
You can't. That's what I meant, it's not something available in game. 
---
The most you could do is advertise bulk ammo deals on a market sub, or stand at your camp all day and try to advertise verbally to everyone that comes to visit
---
I got a mid just doing drums, I don't even have the actual plan yet.
---
Did you mean: Walk there yourself, you cheap ass p.o.s.
---
The only thing I've ever seen go that high selling to a vendorbot is a serum, but that's with full unyielding maxing out charisma
---
Work around: Go to Vault 76 and run your ass to it.
---
Is it ffr?
---
Hey kid, pull my finger!
---
These are all excellent tips and extremely vital if the event doesn't have a lot of people working it. Spent a good 3 or 4 minutes on one where it was just a sliver away from completion and slowly drained back down while everyone ran around looking for critters.
---
Yeah. Is that the problem?
---
Speaking of fast enemies, let's be glad they don't decide to buff yao guai to run as fast as bears can in real life.  Because in case y'all didn't know, that's a foot race you're not likely to win.
---
I believe so.   I had the same issue with mine.
---
The worst thing about this event is that the imposter corpse seems to re-activate its cloaking ability after it dies.
---
Or at least, that's the only way I can explain it.
---
It's ***so*** difficult finding that stupid assaultron body at the end of the event. I can look and look and look, and most of the time I never find it.  
---
I see where the death explosion happens, but the body's not there. I use my camera, but it finds nothing. Does the explosion blast it into outer space? Or does it roll down the bank? I always check the lower areas too but can't find it there either.
---
Not sure if other people at the event have this same problem or not, because unlike the OP here, nobody in my games ever uses their mic.
---
I used to grind Charleston Capital building all the time for XP as a mid/low level stealth rifleman. All the ghouls except those motherfuckers I could take out in one shot.  I learned never to waste disease cure while in the building becuase the next hit would just infect me again immediately.
---
Ah. I mean FFR isn’t really good on a non quad harpoon gun anyway. Hahaha
---
So I opened a ticket on this.
---
The response at first was "send us screen shots."
---
So I screen shotted every page of Regs inventory.
---
Reply came back "Delete your save data."
---
How does deleting my console side data change what the server side show me?
---
Also experiencing the same problem with my QE Harpoon
---
Bandolier and Batteries Included are personal favorites of ming
---
When someone types /s it means the post they wrote was sarcastic
---
If u play on Xbox, I have serums but I'm at max caps at the moment. I normally sell mine for no more than 250c each.
---
Never hated molerats more that during meatweek. I am trying to kill the prime beasts. RON STOPPABLE GET YOUR PET RIGHT NOW! GET OUT OF THE WAY OR DIE RUFUS!
---
No sauce for you
---
Pneumatic torso mod and adamantium skeleton perk can help
---
The Wanderer's perky chatter annoyed me.  Now I have Beckett and I don't mind his lines that much.  I have met the raider punk but it was a while ago, do you have a time limit to out the radio in your camp? I haven't done it yet because I've been working on Beckett's quests.
---
PC players are playing a different game. Not just based on situations like this but from time of launch until current we've been plagued with much more hacking/exploiting. From the aimbot/.exe players in NW to software duping it's been insane.
---
So yes I agree. Much different game. But for once it has been a benefit to us. I hope Colossus comes soon to console however. It's a lot of fun.
---
Primal cuts yes, cook out no
---
And then you have the one guy that makes a camp of only pictures placed at a hotspot.
---
And since it’s not something like a universal texture you can store in the game files it needs to be sent to the server and loaded/sent to other players to display.
---
Hello fucking lagfest.
---
And then there’s the issue of how a picture is marked to be displayed, can that be abused? Can a player mark a pornographic image as valid and be displayed in their camp?
---
Sure this shit is fine if it’s only player centered (such as the loading screen screenshots), but once it becomes public facing that’s more of an issue.
---
我不會中文！謝謝翻譯！！！
---
It's always super populated on pc. Every one I start is finished within 2 minutes and I rarely get to server hop into another one
---
What you were told is correct.
---
I've had a reverse situation from yours. I've had a decent amount of people come to Primal Cuts.
---
If the US just slammed Assualtrons in the sino-American war they easily would’ve won
---
I have a quad ffr one, and in events like radiation rumble, it drops the frame rate down to like 2-3 fps.  I cant even aim with it, or loot afterwards.  It's like playing AVP from 25 years ago on a shitty computer and dial up.  Utter shite...
---
So shame on them for using a weapon in the game?
---
Me and my bud have that problem too.
---
Plastic drum is best drum.
---
I mainly use the civil war top hat
---
should be the brotherhood vendor at whitespring mall or the one at sutton station (think he is raider? doesnt matter :)
---
Are you PC because I picked up some chally feed I found for me and my husband we found after it was over and it was amazing.  Really helped the next two rounds.
---
Exactly. I stopped doing build teams after hitting score 100. Between events im doing nothing more than inventory management or camp building. That's the beauty of public teams. Make or join what works for your play style.
---
Items stick with characters through thick and thin.
---
Yessir
---
dont got 1st but im very sure that yes.
---
Thank you!
---
"Bethesda sucks!  They keep rushing out broken shit instead of fixing bugs!"
---
"Bethesda sucks!  They keep fixing bugs instead of rushing out broken shit!"
---
The entire fucking point of them delaying it is so  that they can find and fix all the remaining bugs hitting the PC version and make sure the console version should work.  Hotfixing a game for consoles fucking sucks because of console certs.  If they hadn't delayed it at all and pushed it out  the same day as console you'd be waiting weeks to actually play it without crashing or god knows what else.
---
yep they really was sold as account-wide. I think he's words were something like "a incentive to play different playstyles on different characters", and this system does in fact do the opposite of that.
---
i have 5 characters ranging from 70 to 150, and this system does just screw that investment over.
---
Don't trust u/masonite616
---
Why'd you erase all your pathetic comments little guy? You were doing so well(LOL) until you knew you couldn't continue the banter and ended up looking into my history. What a useless speck.
---
Being racist and hoping others get denied their ability to emigrate.
---
Dragging others not involved in your arguments.
---
What a damned loser.
---
From what I noticed, it doesn't seem like many people actually do Chally's Feed... I pretty much run in a triangle between Feed pile, wood pile, and brush fires since it feels like I'm not good at running fast or targetting the small animal corpses really quickly.  Maybe it's because I'm usually in third person mode, I dunno! But yeah, Chally's Feed is easy to do and I've done about 20 successful cookouts now doing it and the Tenderizer hasn't dropped.
---
It would be unbearable if it wasn't the case.
---
Drunken unarmed/melee build.
---
Well I’ve definitely missed the notification of the event starting - sorry if I misread you there. I make it a point to get there early so I don’t forget and can contribute to some early points. I’ve had pretty good luck so far (Xbox). Even though I don’t see the event sometimes I’ve always got the rewards.
---
Why is Bethesda so shit at making a proper MMO back end ....
---
Is it normal for primal cuts event to occur twice at the same time?
---
Happened yesterday I am in PS4
---
*confused*
---
Op compared to? What? The "hard" pve content?
---
Less freedom compared to the shit system now? Yeesh, buddy. 
---
The entire stat and card system needs a rework for it to give any bit of freedom. 
---
Also, leveling up gets harder as you go, getting 50 levels isn't an easy task. If we were given a choice to rank a card every 50 levels that would still take people a long time.
---
You don't even play this mode.
---
Yeah I think it got added with the new event that isn’t live on consoles yet
---
It’s really not. Whenever my 1st expires I’m taking another two year break. I don’t even want to know how bad storage is without 1st.
---
Stingwings were supposed to be Bethesda's answer to Obsidian's Cazadores.
---
I say they take a page from SLIDERS and make some Spiderwasps.
---
i agree i still need to get the bear arm so i have one handed melee options
---
Great minds think alike, I rock my plague look with a green hood.
---
I don't think you understand this event at all. You don't have to find anything. Feeding critter cuts to the shopping trolley \*helps\* to progression but it doesn't depend on it.
---
Removing refuse piles, Chally poo, collecting greens, adding firewood. That's your focus.
---
I did romance her. I even found two wedding rings lol But...I'm considering a divorce.
---
Yes it happens throughout the map and it happens very often. The Grahm Meat event is only once per hour at the same spot each time.
---
Nice avoidance
---
When I used to Rumble I would go in and grab ore but everytime I played it no one would guard the damn workers. So when I switched builds I decided I wouldn't let the workers die and it has been great ever since.
---
got a chance of 2,2% to drop (mods also), so you'll have to grind or be very lucky.
---
Does he have a whole quest line like Beckett and Daguerre? Cause I finished the other two but I haven't invited the punk to my camp.
---
I can 2 shot the wendigos with my flamer and they appear to have about a 20% chance to drop ammo. When they drop fuel for me, it's usually in the range of 25-40. That means if I focus exclusively on wendigos I'll make my ammo back, but this efficiency isn't necessarily true with every build and every weapon and Earle IS a tank.
---
feel like so many other snots have done this before. talk about beating a dead horse
---
I like to take the Gorge workshop and make a Chally feed farm complete with a turbo fertilizer. I dispense feed in bundles of 5 to random event participants.
---
Yea i just learned about spits and greens when watching juice heads youtube updates on the game.
---
I've got the Chally outfit and mask, butchers outfit and both hats, the beer stein and the display case, and the meat week flag. Got multiples of the outfits now but I just want the grill now.  
---
Will people put multiple copies of the plans in their Vendors or do they just trash them?
---
I'm wearing almost the exact same outfit! But try it with the old fisherman's hat. Looks perfect and doesn't clip.
---
I think he just does dailies.   I did one mission for him and he got so annoying that I scrapped his radio setup and brought the wanderer back.
---
You know when you get into the event and you’re by a tinker’s workbench? It’s by that but on the opposite wall
---
Stingwings and their damn poison damage. I can one shot a scorchbeast but a stringwing horde kills me every time.
---
If you have very few people in the event, jump on the drums right before it starts and play them until the pre event timer expires. The progress bar will be at least half filled and you can complete the event easily from there.
---
Yes, I'm on PC. That might have been me. I did it about 4 times today.
---
I also moved my camp near to the event and planted tatos, carrots and razorgrain, so if anyone sees it, feel free to help yourself.
---
Sorry, just saw this. Yes if you still want. I'm on PS4
---
What is it called in French?  Does it translate to something different in English?
---
Hm, maybe remove his bar from your camp then replace it to resummon a non-busted Beckett?
---
Thats a good idea! There is a workshop above the Nukacola factory in the western Forest region which is a farm full of wild razorgrain.  I already grew tatoes at my camp for adhesive so I just needed to plant carrots and I have the Green Thumb on so I get doubles of everything.
---
Exploders isn't a problem.  If you melee from VATS, your location is where you stated from, and you are never next to them.  You can be standing next to a suicide when he blows and not die...
---
I haven't played at all since the day before meat week launched and I am not sure when or if I am coming back. This is not some angry "boycott."  No.   The endless barrage of time gated content is just sucking all the fun out of the game for me. It has become  a real chore for  me to even play it.
---
Same. By the time the timer it’s done you reached 2 levels and hardly have to do much to finish the event
---
An Instigating Lever with a hardened receiver and stealth perk cards will 1-shot a lot of things, including Deathclaws. But since it only has a 5-shot capacity and mediocre reload speed, you should carry something like a Handmade or Fixer for crowd control. You’ll want something better than the Lever if you run into a pack of Mirelurk Kings and your stealth gets broken.
---
I've found a couple at Pleasant Valley station.
---
railway rifle!
---
Hahahaha
---
Thanks for the laugh
---
I didn't know it would help before the event timer ended. Thanks for the tip!
---
Without much real direction in these events that is really the only way to learn it. Thankfully the FO76 community here is for the most part very helpful. Really glad this has helped so many and hopefully the trend continues. 🤞
---
This is why I have a troubleshooters set and vampire guns, so I can solo it, since I often have to, since most people can't even sit on a toilet properly or hit a urinal.
---
Either way, thank you.  It is really helpful.
---
This is exactly why I can never get a Jangles the Moon Monkey to display at my camp.  I pick them up but I forgot to put them in my stash and then I either die in a horrible position and can't retrieve my loot or I forget and "scrap all junk". 🤣
---
They are all dreadfully repetitive, deleted all of them for a quiet life.
---
Interesting
---
Nice
---
Imagining being downvoted because you exposed the truth lol
---
Traveled pharmacy and thru-hiker 90% reduction on food , drink , chems and stimpaks 
---
No more weight problem
---
he looks smashed
---
Thorn scout armor, it works well with my semi-stealth build and allows me to not use some stealth perk cards, which then frees up those points to use for quality of life perks , plus my Mutations complement this by giving me exceedingly high perception and agility while not noticeably effecting  my my other stats (strength,intelligence, endurance, luck, charisma ), also I don’t use power armor, instead I use the Chinese stealth suit .  My weapon perks are commando centered . I used to run rifleman but it’s gonna be nerfed with one wasteland so i switched .
---
I've only done 3....1 mask and 1 backback plan.
---
Can't say that's been my experience. I've run at least 20, and they've all been very active.
---
Clothed mole rats, I can handle.
---
Sorry for your loss.  I have an alt that I have been afraid to delete for this exact reason.
---
You might have a slow load issue or something, I have ample time to put on power armor after exiting without using radaway in spite of being a bloody build.
---
You can always use a Radshield before exiting too...
---
I can also run out of the mine without using all my AP and having plenty of time left, but again, bloody build, although Marathoner would probably work too.
---
I haven’t had the cookoff fail but man i am getting tired of failing the Primal meat events. I just played one where the Prime FogCrawler i was supposed to be hunting ran so far out of the event that i left the event a good 10 seconds before i caught up to it. Those things need to be more aggressive in attacking or spawn right up close to the lure
---
Ive seen that once, never knew how! It was amazing to just grind them up!
---
You also need the jetpack plan for your pa
---
I think instigating gauss rifle would be best.
---
I've been curious about server sizes... So it's capped at 24 players? That makes sense given that the map itself is a bit limited and I guess if there were 50 people all on looting the same areas and doing the same quest it would get a bit hectic.  I think of Fallout as a hybrid between a single player RPG and a full-on MMO.
---
This worked.  Thank you!
---
Don't read reddit posts then, no one is forcing you. See Colossus in title skip.
---
The loot list from Line in the Sand could be something like a thousand items.  I don't any situation in WoW comes close.
---
Excellent! Glad to hear!!
---
They are not. They're coming with next week's update.
---
Their going to keep them and trade them after the event is over.
---
Cave cricket for runner up
---
By following the mod creators suggestion.
---
I got an outfit to go with that mask
---
It’s a tricky one but player vendors sometimes sell them. The plans are a rarer drop
---
There is a difference between carry weight, and weight reduction.
---
You may or may not want some weight reduction perks, as some thing are just plain heavy.
---
Melee is a perfectly viable build, but you will want a backup ranged weapon for fights against flying enemies or at times when you want to tag something, but can't get in close, quickly enough.
---
We're watching you goats... y'all always jealous of our cows
---
That could slow them down a bit. I never bothered with concentrated fire, but then again vats doesnt do well with heavy gunners.
---
The Railway Rifle hits the hardest, the Lever Action is next.  The lever is probably easier to keep fed.  Gauss Rifles get an honorable mention but lose points for having to be charged.
---
THe railway can't be suppressed.
---
But..  Choo Choo!!
---
Edit because tired.
---
That's cool, I've only really got time to play this weekend so it's good to know I have a chance to buy what I missed... Hopefully at a reasonable price 😸
---
Thanks I’ll try those as well!
---
Go on girl, shake those udders, show me whatcha working with!!
---
It literally looks like a short plasma dagger on a stick, super badass, there's also the mini shishkebab on a stick and a bigger frozen blade for the cryo option.
---
That would negate their entire purpose for creating seasons, which was to nerf earned atoms, shunt you past the atom store daily, and create an atoms sink on top of it all, while distracting you from the fact that grinds are their new content and marketing strategy.  They don't give a shit if you play all the time if you're not spending additional cash on subs or atoms on a recurring basis.  They're not here to reward you, they're here to milk you, and their daily caps and limits actually encourage you to stop playing after a time to make room for the next people in their ad space.
---
There's that PA station outside of blackwater mine, really close to whitesprings train station.
---
I see it with raider PA a fair amount when leaving uranium fever.
---
Other than there, I've seen raider PA at the place near Mama Dolce, at Camden park, and at Point Pleasant.
---
I was running a junkies stealth rifleman and the instigating ffr lever action was pretty hard to beat, could pop headshots for 1600-2000 damage, more with VATS crits active and the faster fire rate meant you could accelerate through targets. I ran a junkies explosive lever for a while too and its nice, but damage was a bit lower (1200-1600 headshots) While its true it only has a 5 round capacity, it loads it round by round (and at a decent speed too I might add) so its possible to fire and load 1 shot per time at a lower fire rate too. I'd keep a handmade or fixer on me for when things get really overwhelming, but I used to do westtek runs, one shotting all the mutants with my lever rifle without an issue.   
---
The gauss rifle is capable of more damage, but its debatable of whether its got better DPS as you need to charge shots and the reload animation can be fairly slow.
---
Bloodied builds with "End Game" weapons easily do. My bloodied sniper does over 2k per headshot with a lever action, and that's not even entirely min-max. The Damage nerf is specifically for damage multipliers, so people like me aren't becoming gods by stacking a couple effects.
---
Adrenaline perk and something else in combo?  I use an Instigating Explosive Lever Action and definitely notice the drop after the first shot(if there is a 2nd shot).
---
Private server doesn’t mean custom lobby. 
---
It’s not like you can activate cheats and unlock hidden things etc. 
---
It’s basically multiplayer but without the other people. So yes everything you find is yours to keep.
---
I've heard nothing but bad things about the Prime Cuts event and have only done a few. Since the meat only adds some script I skip them completely now. It's unfortunate it's so buggy.
---
Pneumatic isnt for SS and adamantium skeleton is for limp crippling.
---
It's one reason I'm level 50 and still haven't gone back to the Overseer to find out what she wanted, lol. I'm having fun with the dailies and exploring the map right now, because I don't want to do the main quest and have the fun end, haha. but even after I finish the main quest I reckon I'll still stick around and do camp building... maybe I'll open a clothing Emporium just outside the wayward for all these crazy outfits I've been collecting. 😁
---
Maybe I've just been lucky, but all the cookouts have been great.  Primal Cuts on the other hand is total shit and fails at least 50% of the time.  I've totally stopped even doing it.
---
Thanks I’ll try there too
---
Sounds like a bug, it's definitely been buggy
---
It'd be stuck in the up position for the first month, but yes.
---
Most likely legacy's has that's what I've seen past event items go for.
---
I can't for the life of me remember which vendor had it. I must have gone to 5 or 6 stations looking for it myself.
---
Pictures, man! Somebody get me pictures of ~~Manta Man~~ the Plasma Blade! (And the other new melees and any other new weapons)
---
She can't blab with her mouth full.
---
When a defend a workshop event is molerats...I just leave...fuck that.
---
Yep. Make sure you're using the "Good with salt" perk if you've got it to keep leftover prime meat from spoiling.
---
I mean, the rewards themselves are not that bad. It's the time and effort that it takes compared to the rewards what makes no sense. 
---
Creating the 3 frindly animals and then protecting them is probably the hardest content to do currently in the game because of the amount of players and coordination needed to achieve. If Bethesda could give us the stats of how many Proyect Paradise events have reached max rewards I'm sure it would be the lowest % of success of all the events in the game.
---
Being randomly triggered is bad, or course, and fixing than would help but the rewards are still a problem. If the rewards were generous, and I mean *actually generous* like 100 gold bullion (or maybe scrip) for 1 animal alive, 250 bullion for 2 and 700 for all 3, or anything like that, people would farm the shit out of it. But right now it's a beutiful ghost town, which is bad because it's endgame content probably made for like 6 people at least.
---
You can have 3 at every workshop you own if you want to go that rout, you also used to be able to build a ton of them at your camp, but it was causing issues(it was so long ago I don't recall what they were) so they patched it.
---
all robots,
---
assaultrons lazier me wile invisible 
---
protections will swarm you and are slightly tanky
---
mr gutsys will armor pirersng your as to hell
---
liberators are hard to hit
---
eye-bots exist
---
I've been in a couple failed events. Usually like 2/3 afks and then 2/3 people trying to do everything. I don't understand why it's not just collect a certain amount of things, clean a certain amount of things, then 1/3 people could get it done.
---
I had one fail 3 minutes in, two of us running around doing crap, one on the drums, one on the spits, that should be enough but it's not.
---
When it starts the count down to the event, it starts counting
---
I agree. No skill. I was once killed with 2 hits from it.
---
Pleasant valley station wins!  Thank you very much!
---
No, he hasn't got a quest line. You just have had to have met the raiders before he agrees to go to your camp.
---
Oh, I know. Still is obnoxious.
---
I got rid of Daguerre because she won't shut up. I wince when I go to a camp that has her and hear her lines.
---
Beckett, so much better.
---
The Raider Punk, Wanderer, and Old Guy Author are okay, and far better than Daguerre, but no storylines with them so, I never feel bad if I kick them to the curb on a whim.
---
EDIT, YES Sorry misunderstood MISC when looking at camp but in the AID tab in vendor.
---
What someone else had said before, if you can get close enough to the loot bag, drop an item, anything that doesn't destroy on drop, it might move that loot back to where you just dropped something.
---
Not sure what the max range for the paper bags to combine is, but it couldn't hurt, except for the rads.
---
Seconding this. Mine gets 2000 a headshot.
---
I seriously want a dlc quest wherein a female super mutant comes to appalachia and romances Graham and they settle down on a farm with Chally and it becomes a permanent Graham vendor spot. Graham is awesome and I see him so rarely outside of Meat Week...
---
SIXTEEN TIMES THE DETAIL
---
Great work, I'd love to see what you'll be able to make once the dataminered greenhouse plans come out. Should work well with the modern aesthetic.
---
Oh dang. Well the week isn’t over yet. Good luck!
---
Do you think if we used area chat to ask them to wait for more people, they'd do it or will we get the, "you can't tell me how to play my game" response of people who don't realize they're not playing alone?
---
When you are playing in 1st person POV, and face tanking it, you kind of lose perspective when the face fills your entire screen.
---
Yeah I youtubed bloodied builds and gathered info and made a list of what I wanted and basically shopped vendors for a while to get what I wanted. Just make sure u have starched genes level 2 and class freak level 3 to reduce negative effects that come with mutations.
---
That sounds very odd.
---
Does this happen if your controller is not plugged in?
---
Its really disappointing that this is still an issue every year
---
I had one too.  Granted, I don't think it's worth it for large groups of enemies.
---
Just a shame when the OP asked what was being nerfed and to what degree and people chose to downvote the facts. I guess it’s cause I didn’t hate on bloodieds
---
well, they seem to be doing server maintenance this evening ... maybe it IS on their end.
---
Have you already unlocked them? Some, like the prime receiver, won't be learned from scrapping
---
Or put a timer on it. Bethesda loves timers.
---
Good points.  Something about recent events in the game has been extremely off putting to me though. "The game desperately needs new endgame content, but instead we are going to delay colossal problem and bring back a time gated event (called Meat Week) that you have already played hundreds of times!" 
---
That's just... ugh.  I can't do it. I just can't.
---
I love the old dude. But mainly for his ridiculous - 'Hey, pull my finger... Too late' line.
---
I have her permanently wearing a prisoner collar. I keep hoping she'll try to run way and I'll find her head blown off like thirty feet from my camp one day. Alas, no luck.
---
Nope, only have the base barrels and automatic variants. Literally nothing else
---
I've done about eight.  One failed.   There were plenty of people there, but--based on the zero progress of the status bar--they weren't doing anything once another player and I got it to halfway with the drums.   Yesterday's four were finished so completely, so quickly that if you weren't there when it started, it would have been over by the time you FT'd there.   My conclusion was that if I'm on a server with players like those in the failed event, I need to server hop and find a better group of people.

Raid focused on grahms story pre war when
---
the worst enemy are those 4 waves of rats, molerats or mongrel that spam in workshop and most of the times there is one that get stuck underground, fuck all of them
---
Just tested it. 
---
If your controller is ENABLED, the mouse cursor is DISABLED.
---
Had to use the keyboard to disable the controller (was too lazy to reach for the controller).
---
Wait a minute, is this a dirty thing, it sounds like a dirty thing
---
While I agree everyone should wait till the last minute at least or till a good group comes, yikes. It’s just an event, and at this point the rewards are easier to get through trade than playing it. At least if they’re new I still get good xp and loot off the kills while they just tag and have fun. Have had plenty of 200+’s wearing PA join late and just look for tags and legendaries while I do all the work.
---
Yeah, you'd think it would complete easily from there.   Until you run into a group of ten people who can't lift one finger to do ANYTHING to progress the event.

I found this, best I can do.
---
the glowing one in fo4 was chad AF. He could call other ghouls and summon some rad explosion i wish we have those lol
---
I've noticed they LOVE to kite you over a fissure.
---
I drop around 20 feed on the ground before each event starts. But I don’t know that anyone knows what to do - someone always picks the full stack up :/ I put it right next to the area you click on to turn it in... SMH
---
Just sit in the conversation so nobody starts the event early. I do the same on the Project Paradise terminal
---
So you tell me, there are no other player ob the map and it does not need internet?
---
Maybe he's trying to see what happens to himself if he has no pumpkins to carve.
---
When I get belted by two or three Yao Gaui I call it getting DiCaprio'd. Him and that bear in the Revenant is the first thing I think of.
---
Colossal Problem is a very good start. But a group moving through an instance fighting their way through to a final boss that requires healing and tanking...that would be something. I'm thinking total clusterfuck. But that's something.
---
Wow everytime I've gone to the cookup half the server is waiting around twiddling thumbs while every rotisserie and drum is taken up, it completes a minute in because we're on them for most of the countdown time so been getting past the first objective before it even "starts."
---
In my experience, it’s entirely based on the server. Some are full of people who just like playing with others and others couldn’t care less about primal or cookout or both. It seems somethings up with the RNG too as some people are getting tons of the same reward item/plan over a days worth of cookout events. People may just be done trying that day once you’re on
---
I threw them on the ground.  Maybe he'll carve them later when he finishes "Alone Time".
---
All and every build, as they chamge the damage bonus calculation, from "×" to "+".
---
I think I may have a extra chally head for that tato recipe, if ya would still
---
She's a dirty girl.
---
I've managed to get all but one of the tenderizer mods. The plan has dropped a couple times. Got 2 backpacks in a row. But lots of chef outfits and hats. 
---
Leave the game running, jump on the drums and go do something else making sure ya dont get afk kicked. 
---
Can be a good way to farm the event while still contributing progress
---
To quote Ace... “Nukashine is a real trip”.
---
I've got almost all serums but for some melee for 340 :) morganl
---
I just want more than one at my camp. I play on private servers and my camp is over sunshine meadows workshop, the place on the river with the junk pile. Im wanting to build a new base in that location and set it up like a concrete bunker artillery base. I would prefer 4 cannons instead of just one.
---
Oh my...
---
Not 100% sure, but I think they’re making a joke about the real thing lol. If not, it *is* a great challenge at selective hearing
---
Came here to say this. F'n assaultrons man, f'n assaultrons..
---
It's the game's default method of, "screw you, players".   Or maybe it was just their way of encouraging player vending, which would make it a good thing actually.  Thank heavens for player vending because if we had to buy everything through vendorbots, the game would be unplayable in any enjoyable way (for me).  I wish it were fair too, but....
---
As for ammo, now I convert everything I don't use personally, except plasma and fusion cores, which can't be converted.   However, before the converter, I would just drop the ammo that wouldn't sell (.38, .44 and .10).   Everything else will sell eventually, particularly 5.56, .308, 2 mm ec,  and shotgun shells.   Fusion and plasma cells are more iffy.   Oh yeah.  I also dropped mini-nukes, grenade rounds and missiles because of weight.    They rarely sold fast enough to justify their weight in stash.
---
I spend the 2 minute wait drumming or meat turning and then the rest running around cleaning killing and picking up.
---
What type is it? Because if its ultracite you have to scrap ultracite laser rifles to get the mods for it. Scraping normal laser rifles only gives you mods for them. Ultracite has its own mods.
---
Edit: also forgot to say sometime its a pain to scrap them. If you get three in a row that don’t give mods. Try changing servers
---
I've done 19 I think - 15 successful and 4 fails. I played all day Saturday but I noticed after midnight (my time) there were no players on and that was when I got my fails.  Are the servers not global? I'm on Xbox in Australia.
---
It’s normal not ultracite.
---
Sure thing! I’m at work right now but I can be on tomorrow during the day about noon to 4 EST.
---
Did an RR The other day, got 50 of the ore... we only got 50 the whole event... there were 7 participants
---
Awesome dude! Yeah, message me on live if ya can (reddit doesnt always notify me) GT: Daddy Cizin and just mention reddit👍
---
you: i have all kind of mutations i can jump 90 inch vertical!
---
chad ghoul: my slap goes *bzap *bzap
---
Will do!
---
yea I edited my post to also mention try changing servers sometimes this game like to crap out. I don’t know why they didn’t just keep it like 4 where each rank of gunsmith or scientist unlocks new mods
---
I really don't know what to do during event so i an always at drums

Most of my servers I'd say 80% go to the cook out and the very few go to the prime cut so I've had good experience so far
---
THIS
---
Just mail him one, and have the post office put that the weight of the package is 11 lbs.
---
Though that will jack up the shipping cost.
---
There's lots of people doing this sh!t. Even with the easiest events. The other day un the mothman one. Bunch of people running around killing fireflies but no one wanted to go up to the light. Or even just standing there waiting to commute. That's total bs. I think if a player don't participate it shouldn't have any reward.
---
You can rename items 'for yourself'.
---
Everyone else will still see the original name. 
---
So if you name your weapon 'Ghoul Smasher' and then give it to your friend they will see the name as 'Sledge Hammer'.
---
For me it’s either lvl 62 charred Ferals or those deceptively tanky level 21 rad rats who don’t fucking die in one shot but yeah that is annoying about mole rats lol
---
Free backpack skin
---
it was free last week so you might have took it.  
---
should be craftable as skin for your exsisting backpack at a armorbench.  
---
and it looks awesome. love the glowing red eyes :D
---
For robot day it's off to Garrahan Mining Company to lob grenades into the parking lot.
---
BUY THE MUTATIONS
---
Had a level 200 stand in front of her last week and the quest timed out ....
---
Not my answer but do you guys notice that when you fight scorchbeasts they don’t even have to face you for them to perfect aim their sonic boom attack that seems to be heat seeking if you get what I mean! It’s like they fart out sonic booms at me haha
---
My guess is expeditions will be when we get true raids, as it sounds like a semi-scripted event. Until then, daily ops and colossal will be a good filler. At the least, there’s a clear challenge in them even if they aren’t some massive adventure like a Destiny raid
---
The legendary run has really sucked the fun out of the game for me. It's not that hard or challenging but loging in every day to do the same dailies overs and over is very boring. They really should cut back on the dailies and add more to the weakly for some variety. Doubt I'll put much effort into the next run.
---
Nothing wrong with that my friend :) the rest of it isn't so bad it's just a mad scramble to pick piles up, extinguish brush fires, kill critters to collect the chunks.
---
It’s ok... this coming from the Bloody Chefs Hatrack. I just need one of those outfits tho for real
---
as a spaniard reading "cazadores" makes me feel weird like if enter in the wrong subredit lmao
---
If your on mobile just click the 3 dots at the top of the page and click change user flair
---
You forgot my favorite:
---
 - They burrow up behind you and immediately give you a disease, even though you can kill them in .03 seconds and they do .00001% damage to you.
---
A few vendors like watoga Phoenix bot has the plans also.like add burn damage
---
Yes, dataminers determined its .08% per second per drum or spit PLUS .08% bonus if all 3 of one set are going. Math says 6 people on drums/spits gets you over 75% in 2 minutes of wait time
---
Those are the recipes to make serums, not the serums themselves.   The serums themselves are much cheaper.  Two or four K, iirc.
---
You're right, I just checked my armour bench and I can see the skin in there.  Thanks!!  I actually have all the Mr Fuzzies in a display case in my camp, lol... Too bad there's not a plushie version of this one!
---
Radrats are worse imo
---
Just... Why...
---
Okay thank you!
---
I dont think anything should be account wide. If you come out of the vault you are supposed to be weak/broke/slow and not know anything about the wasteland. Why would you start a new character if there is no need to better the character? Where he/she has all the cool shit your lvl 200-300 has? No, it is not immersive at all.
---
Sent a request. My ign is the same, librious
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
I'm playing a similar build and shotguns are amazing, especially with VATS perks.
---
Why not?
---
 
---
What would prevent an if statement from solving it?
---
I play on console and don’t understand how text chat would be practical if implemented but i’m sure you’re referring to PC, right?
---
Just a suggestion with all the PTS combat mechanics going on. Unless you have plenty of rss to easily switch builds you may want to wait for the dmg calf changes, as whatever Bethesda decides to do with them could end up crippling one build and making another the new meta.
---
Duct tape rolls and clipboards irl stop me in my tracks everytime.
---
Old ass post ik but what was bethesdas response?
---
The ss armor is really good. I suggest starting with those.
---
~~Don't know the drop chances but~~ fancy shotgun is fixed 3\* (same effects on it always) and fancy revolver is always a 1\* with random prefix. There are the only fancy weapons one can get.
---

---
EDIT: Wikipages say that the dropchance is 1.5% when turning in claim tickets.
---
Radation rumble is nothing more then a glorified xp farm now. It took me forever to get the nicer rewards from it because people don’t run the event. They come to grind xp. 
---
And anyone that runs a tesla during these events is selfish person. completely ruins the event for everyone else. thats if we can even finish it since framerates tend to nosedive when teslas come out.
---
Pretty positive my chest piece has this one. I have a reduce stagger mod for sure. Doesn’t stop it, but I do feel like I’m having an easier time with things like SBQ. Think it’s reducing the stagger time.
---
Its 76% (rounded) so not quite but darn close
---
In true Bethesda fashion, it looks amazing at first then continually goes downhill. Their better suited at managing a ski slope than a video game.
---
Was there another way to get the fixer plans? I have them to craft but definitely don’t play encryptid much
---
I have the jetpack plan
---
I also have the jetpack equipped
---
Ah ok. Thanks I have gotten like 8 revolvers with 1* and finally got the shotgun with 3* thought I was super lucky
---
Certain events have enemies that have much higher perception and basically instantly detect you, no matter how high your sneak is. Primal cuts is a good example, but also the legendary mole miners in Uranium Fever.
---
If you notice, your hidden status will immediately change to danger when these creatures spawn, which means you will no longer get any sneak damage bonuses because you are detected.
---
Grounded dose effect energy weapons negatively.
---
I was in one today where one person was firing a Tesla and another was shooting mini nukes constantly.  It was so ridiculous I just had to laugh.  The fps was just all kinds of messed up.
---
For me, the Bloodied Explosive Gatling Gun.
---
Play mutation roulette!
---
Drink dirty water and get all the mutations, then start to remove them.. if it’s one you want that goes drink dirty water again.
---
Rinse and repeat.. or do what I did and run with all of them since level 2, and collect the serums you want as you find them. Then when you have what you need remove everything and muti up
---
Oh man.   I feel for you.

1220 central: I just did the most petty thing I've ever done in this game. A dude (i won't post his tag but it was on ps4) had just rubberbanded his controller in the middle of the event area. I noticed if I bumped him a little it would alter the circle. I spent 20 minutes to drop him off the south cliff and out of the event radius. Good luck fuckass. I mean, just hit a spit or a drum. It ain't hard to idle and still help.
---
Fans! 
---
Even on TV get me every time ...
---
I always go in with a team. They kill, which means I get goodies. 3 tunnels of ore gets you lvl 1. If you don't care about lvl 4 just do three and start Killin. Enforcer with an explosive shotty at the back is verrry effective as long as the turrets are active.
---
i have an Hybrit build based on bloodied but not bond to it , cost me a ton of perkpoints to figure out the stats ,   
---
now i can use my PA , one RADaway to 40-50% health and my  
---
Lovely Vamp minnigun FFR to take all 3 pylons AND tank the Imposter.  
---
with this build i cant do it solo but i hold them perm of his stealthmode...   
---
But after doing this event 300+ times i have learned to see . in the first 1-2 min id its worth to try hard ore leave it!   
---
at last - u have to be lucky to get some randome players they now what they have to do!  
---
\*sory for my poor english, its not my native language\*

Yeah that person was just asking for that to happen LOL. If you wouldn't have someone else would have for sure. They just had to get on one of those 6 things and been fine.
---
i have it
---
I finally had to ditch her on one of my characters, not worth the headaches about headaches.
---
It’s just gotta be luck of the server. On Xbox I am yet to fail a cooking event and there seems to be a fair few players adding to the event. But when it comes to the prime meat events, the success rate is about 50% normally there is myself and maybe one other player at these.
---
I agree, but since I am married I've learned how to tune that out.
---
not alone. happened to me also today. They really need to fix this.
---
Yeah, it's one of my favorites....as long as it's a day I'm up to dealing with three SB's.  (Sometimes, I'm just not.)
---
Vending machines.
---
It’s worth finishing it sooner than later, there are real cool rewards you could be accumulating/working towards. 🤙
---
I keep the guitarist at the farthest possible end of my camp. next step is just to wall her up  with no doors or windows.
---
Right? Two drums and zero spits were manned. Just hit one and idle. One dude been hittin a drum in this server for 3 hours now...
---
Ah, that’s good to know. I have found that to the case with primal cuts. I do find that I hit danger mode much more often and quicker, and of course that’s when I become toast. Thanks for the info.
---
I can see using them on the arms and legs but not on a chest piece because I want my jetpack.
---
I need to find me a decent one soon myself to give it a shot LOL. At least for a couple hours sleep 🤣
---
They are harmless in to76 ( before one Appalachia update atleast)
---
It is bugged right now, they should to be craftable. Hopefully, it will be fixed soon.
---
Go with SS armor if you dont run power armor. Of you run power armor go for a weapon your built for (plasma caster, gauss minigun/shotgun).
---
I have vampire gatling laser and 50 cal mainly for those fuckers.
---
Usually, I'm just walking around in unyielding secret service, but I love the CS and PA in specific situations.   (Before Secret Service, it was Vanguard, and that I went to Unyielding.)  I might stay in the CS if it didn't reduce my carryweight so much and if it looked better.   Really ugly.
---
Wack but thank you.
---
The main discord has searching for teams channels specific to each platform
---
*Death to ming!*
---
Most annoying are mole rats, most damaging and hard to kill are max lvl gutsys
---
Yeah me too, they need to make the loot scalable one to there people on animal max rewards. Over that two animals, loads of people all 3 animals. All events should scale to how many people are there.
---
The diluted rad reduction and radix do not really affect your specials. It is also very wise to have a two-star starched jeans per card always always active.
---
Unfortunately for me I did not realize what the event was until I started it, and well since I'm not a super high level (Just started playing last week) I got destroyed by the pylons. Now I'm just hoping somebody else will start the event so I can help since I have nowhere near the 1800 caps it costs to build another card. Someone did join my quest though and when they saw me try to take all 3 pylons they called me an idiot over mic and left the area lol.
---
How the hell do you delete a character accidentially?  You literally have to type your characters name to confirm deletion.  So unless you named all your characters the same thing and selected the wrong one, this is total bullshit.
---
Agreed, it isn't hearsay. Testimony of direct experience is exactly the opposite of hearsay. Several members in the community have had this happen to them, myself included.
---
It also isn't conjecture. The circumstances around the bug have been reproduced by several members of the community. At this point it is a very strong and verifiable hypothesis.  It is something that everyone should be submitting to the support team so they can test it and get a working fix in.
---
It is ONLINE game, it us suppose to be like that. No one give you more rewards after you receive all rewards planned for that season/battle pass/etc. If you complete it before it official end than cool. It doesn't mean you must receive something more.
---
I'm so glad you asked.   I was afraid that was the case too.   Very happy to hear it isn't!
---
I'd really love a rad barrel too. I know the plans come from radiation marble but I can't find them for sale in any vendors and would really like. Xbox one x. My gamertag is: Me6505.just PM me out here to let me know when you're on and I'll join up with you. Of course compensation for your services would be available.

I think Assaultron that explodes is the absolute worst and have killed me more often than scorch beast queen.
---
I stopped playing for a while and got back into the game around December? And I missed a few events and cool stuff but I'm enjoying everything so far except for a few things here and there but it's alright for what it is . And I'm satisfied.
---
Embrace the love of Slaanesh!
---
In Excavator Power Armor, I pop a Rad-X Diluted and go clear one of the ore sections which fills my health bar with rads about ~70% of the way. Then I go to the decontamination shower and remove them all. Rinse and repeat.
---
Everyone using it, we know your name. You instantly lose any kind of street cred.
---
Whoa. You really need to write for some satire pages. That's creative and genius.
---
I am quite sure one of our game geniuses will come up with a work around I'm seeing it coming already.
---
I thought she'd finally stop saying the same two lines when I finished her quest. I was wrong.
---
Ive been trying to get a stimpak diffuser for months, im going nuts 😭 finishing the event with all 3 creatures alive is damn near impossible.
---
Not really. It really all depends on one's taste, I look to see how much time is left on an item that's up for sale and then I take my time and I think about it and I look into reviews and comments.
---
It’s the last Time I take anybody’s word for granted before I play a game because I could’ve been doing this shit for the past year instead of grinding some other dumb ass shooter when this is like the true grit of what a shooter survival should be
---
I'm not sure why you were downvoted. Bethesda should have made grabbing ore more rewarding.
---
Can't blame players for doing the more rewarding option.
---
Follow up, how many notes can I turn in per day?
---
I have a 2 star suppressor magic combat shot gun I randomly got from some drop and I love it.  But I don't understand it.  It is so over-powered in VATs but for the life of me I can't figure out why.  And I have no shotgun perks assigned.  This game confuses me sometimes.  Don't get me wrong - you'll have to pry that gun out of my cold, dead hands, but I just don't get why it works.  I'm afraid to mod it or change my perk build in fear of losing its magic.  Without it I'm a weak little puppy.
---
As soon as Bethesda realizes it's not going to be the way they think it's going to work out their dreams never do we will adjust as always.
---
Either the official discord or checkout r/FO76FilthyCasuals for more casual play.

20 notes per day which pays out 200 bullion.

So whenever I go in my wheel it pops up for a second then disappears and I cant place it any were
---
How very abelist of you.
---
Yes, there is also a sound for nuke cases.
---
Thanks!
---
Would highly recommend you keep raising the issue via the ticket you have now, and put in multiple more. I do not believe they cannot, I believe it would take time and effort to reach out to those who can and there is no automated way to do it so they default to that. I put in around ~900 hours on my main and spent at least 100 dollars in atoms aside from 1st. Not saying it is not your fault, but I would be raising hell for at least a couple of weeks until someone responded with more than that and even go as far as social media and reaching out to the cms. 
---
Just suggestions but just don't roll over and give up cause you got a no.
---
My only complaint is the fact that some of the creatures never show. Then everyone fails
---
I read that title in benders voice lol

“Old Guy Author”

---
A whole salt lick.
---
I noticed this a few times as well, and once or twice no Grahm at all either lol. Figured it was from a nuke sorta like the Fasnacht issue but I've never seen nor think it's possible to nuke that area.
---
This is a fair point I hadn't thought of, especially for people pointing out it would potentially put some players halfway-if-not-entirely through the next board on day 1. I suppose mostly it just feels a little useless for the game to keep notifying me of points earned when they're just flitting off into the void.
---
I suppose really it's more the realization that Fallout 76 is going to become the way most perpetually updating, online multiplayer games are for me (e.g. Minecraft or Grand Theft Auto: Online), where I take a break for awhile until enough updated content has accrued, and then come back to play around with the new stuff until it runs its course again. My friends and I have discussed the fact that, now that we've largely made it through most of the storyline quests, and grinding for gold bullion is essentially the only worthwhile thing left, we largely won't play for awhile until the Brotherhood of Steel storyline/quests get added in the winter update.
---
Tbh its the floaters for me. Mole rats for me
---
Frickin thing is huge compared to us, even when we're in Power Armor.  Snapped a nice pic next to her head the first time I killed her.
---
It's not just encrypted, for example instead of people activating the terminal at mama dulches, they just look around for the best spot to sit in and steal kills
---
thanks for this, couldn't figure out how the heck to get the steins in my camp to display in the display. didn't realize they were craftable.
---
Yeah, though it only plays if it hasn't been looted.  So if anyone touched it, its stops.  
---
It's also not too crazy.  Just some light beeping, so if you either run low volume or have difficulty in certain hearing ranges you might miss it.  Gunfights especially cover it up well if you dont have such issues.
---
Does the tenderizer have a blueprint yet?
---
Yah saw to downvotes from a mile away -- enjoy when the game breaks, it's not gonna be fun for anyone
---
I usually tank all 3 pylons, though to often I miss out on tagging the imposter because someone fucking yeets her away and I dont get a hit. =[
---
No trust me lol, the game has been in a way worst state. 
---
The Wastelanders dlc put the game in the good dirrection and now devs really start to add meaningful content to put the community together and enjoy the game together. Everybody is grinding together and devs really start to manage to add stuff to grind for. As i told you it started with Wastelanders.
---
You jumped in the game in a really great moment !

Can't say why they aren't captioned, other than maybe laziness.  But in the meantime, you can use the following link to get transcripts of every holotape in the game if you are having trouble hearing them:

---
I don't know that the second claim holds much water.  Even when things are delayed, they are still buggy. I agree that the fixes for consoles are a huge pain, but the massive lack in steady content coupled with set dates for new content to go live is pulled back will have upset folks no matter what. 
---
So I'm with you on the technical end, but come on. Events like the treasure hunts, BoS junk delivery, etc are duds. No substantial updates/additions to NW (no bug fixes, no new maps, etc.) PvP is pretty much dead. Plus QoL fixes that are still a long way away from addressed.
---
Let alone the ambition to set a road map and put dates to it means we, as consumers, look at those dates as the time it happens and prep for those dates, only to have it pulled. You've got to at least understand the frustration without have to curse at folks, right?

Well, there's the minigun, but not technically fancy, still rare though.

Any time I'm in a team and it pops I go to it and take my team with me then the rest of the server jumps there when they see 4 players over 100 at the event

Mostly people don't know how to run it properly though. I really wish players would look up how to complete each event properly and honestly that could be a good short series for a youtuber just showing how to do the events properly
---
The day I was no longer severely overencumbered and could actually sprint felt like freedom.
---
They aren’t important to the game and have a bunch of weird noises to so Bethesda didn’t bother with captions they may add them if they get enough people asking them or they get some time when they’re done with some bug fixes
---
Do you sell the herd mentality one btw?
---
Have you tried the mirror?  
---
...  
---
sorry xD
---
They can ignore sneak meter and always detect me
---
i had a good laugh just now. Picturing someone trying to kill a ghoul with a mini nuke. Only to get pimp slapped at super sonic speed by one of them.
---
The worst enemy?.. the stash limit.
---
That would be gilded, not fancy.
---
Exactly why I want them.
---
Might have been one of the Super Mutant body parts you can get from the Emmett Mountain disposal site : https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Emmett_Mountain_disposal_site
---
Tell me about it. At least the crafting reflects the .50cal MG.
---
Had the spicy plan drop...which happened to be the one plan I got during last year's meat week. My RNG luck hadn't been good to me.
---
It's gonna be another Party Snax situation should any Faction deny Grahm.
---
I agree with all comments, and I would like to add that the speed of the deathclaws are pretty accurate with real life.
---
Yep, like I said, not fancy, but similar
---
There even worse during the Prim Meat event!
---
Only reason I have a ally at any time is for the longer xp boost I’ve just become used to the constant talking and the same lines
---
It snaps. My question is "can we get a gate?"
---
Haven’t checked to see if these are still in the game as I am still fairly new, but it’s a super mutant body part that is found in the radiation when you take the left hand turn at Emmitt Mountain Disposal. You will need power armor or a hazmat suit to survive and pick the parts up.
---
The secret to the event is getting 3 people that have full health builds to stand beside the pylons and have the damage players and a full health build shoot the shit out of it for 5 seconds then while it is getting shredded activate the pylons all at the same time. 
---
Having 1 or 2 pylons active is pointless
---
That's it thanks!!
---
I totally agree. They are almost always plagued or diseased, witch makes every 2nd ambush bite, which is pretty much unavoidable, infect you with disease. Sometimes they will start burrowing and you actually hit them during the animation, but the shot would not register.
---
Annoying little gits they are.
---
I’m loyal to the vault, fo76 was just fine back in beta before all you newts showed up, if you got a problem with that, me and the overseer with throw hands no problem
---
The Yao Guai in groups. I hate those bastards at high level. I get so disorientated as melee when they group maul me.
---
My thanks to you all! Your responses are much appreciated!
---
I've watched a friends stream and I hear it beeping for them, but I never hear it in my game. I don't think I changed any of the audio settings either. It's really strange.
---
I don’t think that’s the best excuse. Importance to the game is relative. I personally enjoy having them because it helps set the tone and atmosphere of the game. I’m a sucker for good lore. And other holotapes have weird noises - that’s so easy to get past. Just say (weird noises) or whatever. I know that devs see posts here sometimes, so I’m just shouting into the void here hoping that they will.
---
Could be some of that bethesda charm that causes all the stupid issues that plague the eveyday experience.
---
That's down to personality my friend. If you're a type who needs completion then the game would probably take its toll.
---
If you don't give a shit, like me, then there's always something to do and I'm loving Seasons and Meat Week. It's single handedly letting me re roll my gear and purchase all the mods I need.
---
Logs and paper bags lol
---
&gt;If you come out of the vault you are supposed to be weak/broke/slow and not know anything about the wasteland.
---
Since you're approaching this from a lore perspective, I could just as easily say that my main character was waiting outside of the vault for his new buddy and took him underneath his wing and taught him everything he knew about his lengthy time scouring and looting the wastes, imparting knowledge that some would call **legendary**.
---
Happy?
---
&gt;Why would you start a new character if there is no need to better the character?
---
There is a need. You need to earn regular perk cards for a build and level all the way up to 50 to distribute all your S.P.E.C.I.A.L. points. Without doing even that, one cannot be considered to be even remotely competitive. 
---
A level 1 with 6 maxed legendary perks straight out of the vault isn't going to be capable of anything extraordinary, based on the current pool of legendary perks available.
---
&gt;Where he/she has all the cool shit your lvl 200-300 has?
---
Some of my "cool shit" would be transferred to the new character, as I would be doing a whole new build and would therefore be transferring items that I probably wouldn't have been using on my main character in the first place.
---
&gt;No, it is not immersive at all.
---
From the ways I've described it, it can be *very* immersive. It just seems that you lack the imagination.
---
The value of a weapon you see in pipboy is base value. Value is adjusted based on whether it is being bought or sold, and the degree is based upon your charisma stat.
---
Selling is capped out at 1/5th base value.
---
I don't mean to be dick about this but how exactly is it similar? :D Different name, no legendary effects, no special build in effects, different weapon types and completely different skin. There is literally nothing in common with gilded minigun and fancy weapons other than all the weapons happen to have gold color in them.
---
Walk through the snack with the workbench and take a picture looking up at the tower
---
or make them a different shape
---
Prolly.
---
I've had very populated events on PS4. Not all primal cuts are populated but each cookout is packed.
---
I guess I think of fancy weapons as being wall hangers and the gilded minigun is too.
---
Yeah I have a shotgun that can 1 hit everything
---
There's others players all the time anywhere. You can leave the world to find other people. Lots of perks. Lots of build. As for events really depends but when you get to 50 you'll be game for anything most likely . Just find guns you like . And make builds around them. Melee is very good. Since your new I'm guessing vets will drop you lots of loot soon
---
&gt; Have you been ~~living~~ **dying** at the bottom of a fissure for the last two days?
---
what's it's prefix? bloodied im guessing? I run a mixed bag of Junkies and Bloodied weapons.
---
If you still need it I can make it for ya free of charge
---
Amazing, how many tickets have you submitted for those 9 fancy weapons?
---
I have a workaround for this. 
---
I put her guitar chair on top of one of my water purifiers, right on the edge. So the only time she plays the damn tune is when I spawn in at my camp. Then she gets off and can't get to it anymore.
---
Ok the cemetery has a few bags and the east end of the big bend tunnel under the platform the crafting tables are on theres a few bags
---
pun intended??
---
I wish I could server hop to one of these failing events. The servers I'm on obliterate this challenge. If I feed wood to the fire twice, that's a LONG event.
---
I got mine in Fasnacht, and it was doing the same thing there. When that event first started, I died frequently until I scrounged up some fall damage armor.
---
Revolver is crap, but fancy shotgun is really good weapon. Far from wallhanger with it's build in unlisted special effects. Those would be increased ammo capacity and reload speed on top of the legendary effects anti-armor, crippling and steadfast.
---
The npc lootbags were unoptimized in the latest patch. The ash/goo/etc piles are bigger resource hogs than the animated meat piles, and won't disappear when looted either. These show for all players, regardless of whether or not they actually were able to loot that corpse. This adds up super quick.
---
My advice: shelve energy weapons until they actually fix the death effects.
---
Then don’t read them. If you want to be surprised if you see those works keep scrolling. Not too hard.
---
yep 90rw is definitely superior to +1s on this!
---
Totally legit. I forget to listen to my wife. I have to have her repeat like 3 times before I actually listen. As for the commander, I'm not at camp enough to listen.
---
The deleted over a 1000. They saw all your duped stuff. Sorry
---
I just usually take out the legs then the head then the arms then wait for them to explode
---
I think you're underestimating how much I suck.
---
I 100% agree with this and it was my very first thought when he said it. The way the voice actor emphasized “perhaps the Northeast” was noteworthy
---
Oh trust me you do not want to be at a failing one. I ran around killing everything doing all the piles fires etc for the entire 8 minutes and it trickled down the whole time with no way to stop it. I'd bump it up a bit and it just kept getting lower and lower. 
---
Super frustrating! Next time I know not to even bother at that point.
---
1. It will be different people each time. Yes, new people show up if there is space in the world. If you find a player that you like, you can add them as a friend. They will also need to do the same. Once they are in your friends list, you can actually join whatever world they are playing on any time you want as well as send them group invites. 
---
2. Each event has a level requirement, so just watch out for that otherwise you might end up fighting higher level enemies. Some events are better than others as far as rewards go so it is up to you if you want to do them or not.
---
3. Currently the meta is bloodied or junkies. However, in the public test servers, Bethesda has implemented a damage nerf along with a rebalance of enemy levels. People are saying that these two metas are still the strongest, however, it is also possible that the meta might change as a result of this. I would not worry about trying to be in the meta until level 50 (guns and armor levels max out at level 50 so that is when endgame starts)
---
4. You get 50 perk points, one for each level. After level 50, everytime you gain a level, you will have the option to either move one point from one stat to another or to select a new perk card. For example, you can move one point from strength to luck. What I would do is to try to figure out what weapons you like to use. 
---
5. The only way to move points around is what I mention above. There is no full reset. 
---
The following is a rough guide:
---
\- Strength for melee weapons, shotguns, and heavy weapons
---
\- Perception for rifles and automatic rifles
---
\- Agility for pistols, sneaking abilities, bow, and crossbows
---
\- Endurance - some random defensive stuff
---
\- Science - crafting stuff and power armor perks
---
\- Charisma - Group support abilities
---
\- Luck - a little bit of everything.

---
Take a radaway. That’s a big help. Make sure you do it right after you load into the server. There’s a great spot just east of foundation, a little lake. 
---
By the way, enjoy trying to get your other one (which I get the feeling it’s heat flashes). It sucks. Honey Beasts are rare.
---
Tbf Bethesda said this is experimental and of course this could very well change when this is implemented to the rest of the game
---
Pneumatic is available for SS. I have it equipped and getting staggered still sucks.
---
I had this bug for a couple days, and ended up giving in and buying a private server. Works but you shouldnt have to pay extra just to progress in a game youve already bought
---
I don't know why it looks like a punk frog, but *nice*!
---
I think only ones tied to quests can’t be dropped.  Could be wrong.  Would like to know too as the ocd in me wants to clean out my inventory
---
You can safely drop them. Although they don't have any carry weight so you could just stuff them in your stash and forget about them.
---
How is it even possible to fail??? I solo the event in under 2 minutes
---
Actually it’s sludge lung super easy to get
---
I’ve had it before but I think that’s before they made the challenge system.
---
Oh, glad it’s an easy one lol. Heat Flashes were the bane of my existence.
---
Pc user. My internet speed can be absolutely trash. So I head to Vault 76 on the 5 min to the hour mark. Hit a drum or spit and stay there till count down. Sometimes I run about other times I stay put.
---
Wasn't there supposed to be a couple weeks between seasons initially? Has there been word that that's changed?
---
You can't solo the Grahm one, you must be talking about Prime Cuts.
---
Good luck finding the gilded minigun
---
Yea I’ve had a lot of challenges that were uncomplete because I played it before the challenge system existed so I had go back through and do a lot of things again 😂
---
I will log on and give you three that I have. ID is Eldyrus3
---
YES!! Does it bother you when you picked up two or more of the same key and you can’t delete it? 😭
---
If you have 6 people afk on drums and spits you could solo the rest maybe, without it impossible.
---
My stash is becoming slow
---
I dropped all mine except for missile silo holotape and command center password.
---
Nice one. 
---
I'm looking for outfit that would complete my Rocketeer/Steam punk look. I currently have the reclaimed mask from Colossal Problem and a hardcase backpack with a jetpack torso.
---
I was a bit stressed, cause i started in late and doing it on two accounts. Now i still need 7-8 levels on both accs. Do we have time until start- or mid september?
---
Any of the event only ones could be considered “rare”.  But people duped a lot of them, so that’s debatable at this point.  
---
Fixer plan still holds a lot of value 
---
Camo jumpsuit is a really rare drop 
---
Event ones like Insurgent and Treasure.  Fasnacht deathclaw mask.  Asylum clean outfits ect 
---
This topic pops up frequently too.  So there are some lists out there
---
Okay thank you. Have you had any trouble getting into anywhere else??
---
I enjoy the bloodied fancy revolver in the forest region and low level events. Saves on my rifle ammo too.
---
Do you need the diffuser or the plan. I can craft you some if you just need the item for the possum badge.
---
My hero
---
The game does...
---
Peace was never an option.
---
All enclave loyalists end up dead or super mutants. I'll see you out there, greenies!
---
Have full damage perks and bloody mess?  Also get damage increase legendary effects for weapons, also any other perks that help with dps outside of raw damage.
---
Yo this is an awesome combo
---
Ouch
---
Check floor decor or stash
---
The gilded minigun,fancy revolver and shotgun and camp jumpsuits.
---
I think the treasure hunter and insurgent outfits are quite rare too,same as certain asylum worker outfits.
---
None whatsoever. Also both of what I kept can be replaced, but you'll be paying 1k caps for the holotape and the command centre p/w is pretty close to the terminal, which can be hacked anyway.

You need to take every single damage related perk for weapons to be really effective. If you don't have them then of course your damage will be lacking. And on top of that legendary effects matter alot, as there are really bad ones and really good ones. This is why it is not adviced to try and use different types of weapons at the same time / build. Like shotguns and rifles for instance. Since getting all the perks for each weapon would restrict you from other useful and important perks.
---
Allies, Collectrons... All of it needs to be toned down.
---
That's not quite how it works, the violent shift is just a side effect of the virus itself.
---
Also, Grahm has said that he used to be a normal super mutant before a human told him he could get stuff he wants without getting shot at by offering other stuff in exchange.
---
I was sure it's the acid ones not ice.
---
\^ This. Take your time into looting (beware of the wendigos and the ceiling falling), even the minions you killed to get back some ammo, then simply die in the mine. Since the instance is still on, you will die with a respawn timer without loosing anything. This should be an SGA level advice imho.
---
So I still need 3 of them, sadly Eldyrus3 didn't have any :(
---
You can, 15 prime meat, alternate adding chally’s feed and wood, and collect critters and greens and once you have a large enough amount turn it all in and it will complete.
---
The damage you do past lvl 50 is based on gear, which is what they are "Nerfing" by making damage multipliers not stack funny, which is currently used by popular builds to get high numbers.
---
currently working on clearing her questline so it's done and I can immediately replace her... due to how irritating she is. I feel this post. 
---
 Sometimes it's tempting just to ditch it
---
Thank you for your swift response, and for the link, I'll check it out :)
---
Specialy with the "Meat Week" event 😅 !  We are rushing those events, getting our loots and xp. It really feels like this lol. It's cool, i like it lol
---
Coming from a community manager that actually means a lot. :D
---
Danke schön!
---
Sorry, I've only got Speed Demon and Marsupial. I'm working toward buying all the recipes eventually.
---
You should enforce social distancing and masks with PVP.
---
The rad barrel plan is rarer than the Fixer plan, and imo much more difficult to get.
---
If that works more power to you but that is way more work then necessary if people just do these simple steps. With how the brush fires piles spits etc drain the meter it's impossible without farming all that stuff ahead of time.
---
Okay I found some :) thanks
---
Bwa ha ha kinda like the same mindset as Nightingale from FGO.
---
“Look you can allow me to heal you, or I can kill you so you don’t get others sick. Take your pick.”
---
Maybe have a highlight player function if you want to speak to a certain olayer.
---
I play super casually, overall maybe 3 weeks worth of daily stuff out of the 8 weeks it's been going. I have no desire to grind this shit, so I only play when there's something worthwhile going on. Fasnacht, Meat week or double XP/SCORE events.
---
Between 8 daily challenges (because fuck NW) and two double S.C.O.R.E events I've made it to about the halfway mark on the board. I expect I'll make it just shy of the last third of the board before the season is over, which is perfectly acceptable to me. When seasons were first announced I didn't even expect to get this far, but the bonus stuff has made it go much smoother. I hope it sticks around for season 2 so casual players can complete an acceptable chunk of the board as well.
---
Play the game to have fun, not to grind the ever lasting shit out of it. There's better ways to spend your time.
---
I went screw and fiber hunting today, last stop was the Monorail.
---
My tent was right below the monorail, and since I was over encumbered and on a private server...
---
I decided a swan dive off the top would be the most efficient way down. I'd spawn at my camp and make a quick trip for retrieval.
---
Then I messed up and landed on the bottom of one of the 'O' rings. My poor brown bag full of Ballistic Fiber and screws sitting entirely unreachable. :(
---
*Everything?*
---
I only didn’t it once using a guide from last year to test myself. I would not recommend it for anyone not hyper focused on personal achievement.
---
Here,🏆this is the best I can do.
---
50%?  damn lemme on your servers!
---
It has bourbon in it.
---
oh my god, I was close to having a mental breakdown last night doing a particularly hard primal cuts event. it was the one in the ash heap and in addition to getting fucked up by all the rad scorpions the fucking mole rats kept coming. so annoying! THEN! the boss was a level 80 sheepsquatch that absolutely refused to die. I burned through 300 gauss rounds and almost 1000 rounds of 5mm trying to kill it, all the while I'm being assulted by a seeming endless stream of fucking goddamn punk ass mole rats!!
---
I just turned it off after that and crawled under the blankets.

I’ll load into a server to see 5 event teams and no one doing the events other thank meat week
---
They're harder for sure, but they're also hard to come by, mole rats are *everywhere* and usually in massive groups that then hide and wait so you can't kill them or fast travel.
---
Mole Rats aren't dangerous, they're just super annoying.
---
I once hid in the cabin in an encryptid event.
---
I was level 5.
---
What your excuse?
---
Mole Rats, no matter how much disease resistance you have, you will get a disease.
---
Probably tents.
---
I’m just throwing stuff off the top of my head.  
---
Encryptid isn’t an event that happens that often.  I see it like once a week.  Could classify uncommon vs rare if we wanted to.  Like Formula P recipe.
---
I prefer... WEASELLLL
---
If you stay in the mine, dont you lose the event xp reward?
---
Giggity :)
---
Radscorpions burrowing into the ground is annoying too
---
Maybe, never thought of that, seems to only be at that one place though
---
I'm one.  Using a Quad Tactical DB with my strength maxed out so I can use all the perk cards.   Also got bloodied mess maxed, DMG is insane and I can one shot just about anything in the game.  Trick is you have to use VATS or the gun is meh.
---
Amen my guy, amen.
---
I solo them quite easily. I like the one at the top as it’s nice and flat and I can get them from a
---
Long way out.

That's genius, thanks for the idea 😂

Not going to lie, when Graham talks about remembering having cookouts in the before time with good friends and good meat, and how much he missed that because he loved his friends and meat...
---
...well, that hit a little too close to home these days.
---
So why post "how can anyone fail this?!" when you know it isn't feasible to do it that way every single time and you know it's easy to fail it unless you're prepared like that. Shrug, seemed like an unnecessary post to me.
---
Most people are new and have no clue how the event even works to begin with let alone look up a guide from last year on how to solo it 🤣 congrats tho!
---
If I'm the only one collecting when others are there in PA, I will collect all 4 tunnels, not deposit any until the end, and then not deposit at all. I'm petty enough that I'm cool with not getting a reward if it makes those assholes angry.
---
Wha- who is this? I should kick your fucking ass!
---
Literally could care less
---
It's even better when you get the landmine ones.
---
&gt; Or am I wrong? 
---
Unfortunately, yes you are. You can start equipping legendary perks as soon as you get your pip-boy inside vault 76, and you can scrap your first perk card at level 2 (just tested this on the PTS).
---
&gt; Even so, I'm not saying perk coins should be account-wide, just the perks themselves.
---
This only changes things a little bit. Under a system where *coins* are shared, players would create a new character, scrap their first perk card, and then delete their character (or perhaps quickly grind to level 4 to unlock a perk pack - someone would do a time trial to see which is more efficient). Under a system where *legendary perk cards* are shared, players would grind a new character to a point where they could upgrade a single legendary perk card. Some quick math tells me you get 25 perk cards by level 10, enough to level up a legendary perk card to level 2 at the current rate, and you hit 50 perk cards by level 25, enough to get a legendary card from level 2 to level 3. And it's a heck of a lot easier to get a character from level 1 to level 25 than it is to get from, say, level 200 to level 225 (particularly if you put some effort into stocking up on the right gear, xp buffing consumables, and focus on killing as many enemies as quickly as possible).
---
The only thing I've been able to come up with to not create these perverse incentives is to make all perks obtained before level 50 unscrapable - but that seems to defeat the purpose of having a perk scrapping system in the first place. Of course, they could also just ditch perk scrapping altogether and tie legendary perks to XP (as in ESO), but now that people have paid atoms for perk card packs in the legendary run, I don't think they'll go down that path.
---
On another note, if you’re in the same team with someone who is in an instance of the event, and you’re not, you can fast travel to them to join their instance.
---
Atom shop isn't free, if you want atom shop items, pay.
---
I read your post and I could just hear "Valves" Guitar Riff haha
---
Good point :)
---
Nightkin were exclusive to the master and his army, super mutants that had their skin changed due too over use of stealth boys. I really don’t ever see them coming to 76
---
You're late to the party. Been discussed and argued and it is what it is. Next legendary run is already on the test server.
---
May Ward lead to us to ultimate victory over Appalachia lol
---
It’s the model of the frogs in 76, not a wanamingo.
---
All of the NPC's chat endlessly if you're too close. I have to turn off my speakers if I'm crafting or shopping when an NPC is nearby.
---
I was wondering if it was due to people chasing/heading to were they spawn instead of waiting by the drum. 
---
Every one I go to that passes easily, we're all huddled around the drum or perched on top of the pole just waiting for them to come to us. 
---
Every one I go to that fails, we've got players charging around like mad, determined to be at the exact spot the next swarm appears at. Then inevitably that spawn will get spread out as some go towards the player over there and some go towards us at the pole while others stay in place confused.
---
I got a BE combat shotgun, but replaced it with a Quad Gauss Shotgun.
---
Gauss is just way better.
---
The Leather Coat.
---
But if you use vats then sometimes the shooter doesnt work.
---
Rarest thing in the game is the mire healing salve plan.
---
I have a lot of issues with the current implementation of the legendary perk system, but for the sake of playing Devil's Advocate I'll try to provide an alternative point of view.
---
Firstly, the video you linked is from over a year ago, and Jeff clearly states that things will probably change literally 83 seconds before the time code you linked to (https://youtu.be/gLbWx61Xo6A?t=1880). So it's true they did indicate things would be account-wide, but they also clearly stated that was a preliminary plan subject to change.
---
Secondly, let's clarify that perk card *slots* do unlock account-wide. So, for instance, by having a level 200 character you have 4 slots available on your level 200 character but also on your level 75 character. So there is an element of account-wide progression.
---
Let's also clarify something: legendary perk slots don't unlock at level 50. They unlock at level 1. I just checked this - a brand new character can start equipping legendary perks as soon as they have their pipboy, before they've even exited the vault. And you can equip perks right away, because the first level of each perk is free.
---
And some of these perks are *extremely* powerful for a level 1 character. For instance:
---
- Master Infiltrator: you can now unlock every lock and terminal in the game.
---
- Survival Shortcut: you get a chem that heals you, removes all hunger and thirst, and cures diseases. Basically this turns off all survival elements in the game.
---
- What Rads: you no longer need to worry about rads.
---
Think about the difference between having level 1 and level 4 of these perks. Level 1 makes the game substantially easier: you won't need so much food and water or radaway, and all containers are now available to you without needing to use up perception and intelligence slots. Level 4 of these perks means never having to play a hacking or lockpicking minigame ever again (on that character), never needing to pick up food or water ever again, and being able to walk around naked in a nuke zone (well, not quite, but every source of rads short of that becomes a non-issue).
---
So the best argument I can come up with for the current system is that they wanted to make starting a level 1 character with legendary perks interesting and easier than playing without them, but not to the point of trivializing things.
---
Of course, there are other potential explanations that are more cynical. One is that allowing perks to be shared across an account creates perverse incentives to repeatedly create and level up low level characters jut to get perk coins - there's a comment thread about this elsewhere in this post. Another one is that Bethesda just seems to like having lots of grind in this game, presumably because they think by having people play the game longer they will make more money from the Atom store.
---
It sure would be nice for Bethesda to explain their thought process instead of us having to try and divine it ourselves!
---
That's the best part!
---
No that was a lie it can’t one hit the dragons or most bosses
---
By the time the 26th rolls around, we'll be getting posts about people complaining that they can' get enough players to show up for completion. 
---
The vast majority will farm the event until they get all the unique plans and then ignore it, going about their normal routines. 
---
Having them be constant is a surefire way of removing the interest in them entirely.
---
Not to mention the main story. I'm level 90 with op gear and a fixer and am just doing the enclave questline so I can launch nukes. I like the enclave and it's probably the best questline in the game (in my *humble* opinion) but jesus christ...
---
Yes, it's Meet Week as you said, we just meet, nothing else.
---
So ungodly frustrating. I managed to hit all the tunnels for ore AND friendly fired 3 of the npcs to keep them alive. I managed to snag 19 ore... there were FIVE other people there killing ghouls and not a single one could grab one piece of ore so the event didnt fail. Its awful.
---
Those are actually considered two different cards. Ultimately you will have 3 cards (with 3 ranks each) that boost your weapon damage. So plan on investing at least 9 cards simply to boost damage with a specific weapons. So, if you are going 1h melee, you will need 3 points into gladiator, 3 points into expert gladiator, and 3 points into master gladiator

Perfectly preserved pie "FROM THE MACHINE"
---
I... I’m sorry... I almost did the same thing and could barely sleep all night... I don’t really have anything else to say other than... that fucking sucks.
---
You have to have the wood scraps in your inventory already to donate them to the pit. :) (Same with the critter bits and greens, as bythepoole said.) If you have them in your inventory and activate the container, it'll put them in automatically. You don't have to put them in manually.
---
If you'd rather not do those things, please at least play the steel drums or turn the cooking pits! Those things help keep the progress meter going.
---
Raider Punk has his uses, though
---
I have to second this.
---
My group has taken to calling them “Swolebois” because they look more like Brian Urlacher, rather than a bloated corpse. The regular ferals look more bloated than the “bloated” version.
---
I also want to be able to sleep with them like in fallout 4
---
Actually, there’s another way without meeting the raiders but I forgot how I did it.
---
They seem to spawn far away from the actual point, like 50-70+ paces away. Definitely far enough away you wouldn't notice if they weren't marked.
---
I've also noticed the only ones I've participated in that have failed were the ones where assholes had their camps plopped down right on top of the trigger area...
---
I think molerats and some other small creatures that burrow break your stealth as well.
---
Not if you're Lucky. ;)
---
Yet the Gauss shotgun can't  hit a barn door in VATS every time as it's bugged. So yes a lot better when VATS pulls all the shots into a tight cone not so great when firing out of VATS.
---
I gave up on it as I was sick and tired of having to do the double VATS trick to get it to be consistent.
---
Better off with a Vampire pump with any prefix or major/minor that will make it " Magic" 
---
I dont run any shotgun perks at all and still one shot everything
---
Their rewards allow me to progress in my season pass, i'm cool with that...
---
Do we get enough Atoms ? Aboslutly not and it's getting worst as we keep progressing in our season pass.
---
Bethesda need to rework this for sure ! It's a crazy downgrade, in this reguard, compared to what we had before.
---
If it’s 30 min server has to little ppl so join another
---
I don't rely on those 'magic' damage most of the time, it's just easier to hit out of VATS, and fires much faster.
---
ah okay thats what i did, kinda odd they have a minimum
---
Yeah, i'm like a hobo in this game picking up everything I find on the ground. Adds up fast lol. Wish I could make some kind of armor that adds more carry besides the backpack. Like pockets on my jacket etc.
---
This was brought up a few weeks ago IIRC; u/Ladydevann said she'd "raise it with the team", but it's uncertain when we can expect captions to be added for the radio dramas.
---
I *believe* those are the only holotapes I've come across that don't have proper captioning, but it's still bad those were just left at the wayside.
---
Hey, don’t underestimate consoles. They’re pretty beefy.
---
This is false, Sony/Microsoft no longer charge for updates and patches, that practice ended last gen.
---
Pretty much everything I wanted dropped within my first 10 events. I'm just waiting on a tenderizer now.
---
Another thing if you want more variety of perks.. it's better to have 1 star on all three cards for +30% rather than 3 stars on one card which is only +20%
---
Probably the screaming eagle skin
---
Had it a few times best 1 was after dropping a queen and 2 min before she spawned in
---
Your right just more shit for grinder.
---
Aw, shit, I keep forgetting about that guy and spent thousands on plans today to get my cap count down. :( Thanks for the reminder regardless!
---
The tesla rifle seems to chain underground. Once one breaches I murder the bunch
---
Should be biv's bar. Could have been a quest to decorate and move biv.
---
I only play the drums haha
---
Did you play Oblivion 🤨?
---
Saw it being done today
---
Charred ghouls are super annoying. Radiation plus running in your face constantly.
---
Human, do t tell chally what meat we cook
---
But human feces can’t really be used for fertilizer. ..at least not for your lawn.
---
About 70% of cases are reduced. It’s pretty useful with gatling weapons.
---
I just let myself die in there. No mad dash out, loot nearly everything. Die, get returned to the entrance outside. Pop on something for the rads, event complete.
---
at least with a handmade you dont have a nearly empty fusion core stuck in your ass.
---
For me I don’t really care about completing it because I’m more focused on getting the experience from the ghouls for as long as possible
---
🤦 such a shame.
---
Feel like their getting more great greedy?
---
‘So you’ve been to school for a week or two’
---
300 screws *after* making a full set of lvl 45 excavator pa.
---
How you get?
---
How do you get it?
---
Oh, they listen. They just do the opposite of what we ask.
---
Wonder if it's the same dude who filled the entire lobby with support pillars a few weeks back.  Didn't see who was doing it, just walked back into the main room and PILLARS EVERYWHERE
---
Brotherhood? Disgusting...
---
The only time this problem has been severe is when someone has built their damn camp right on top of the drums (okay technically beside the drums but none the less). I suspect tents and camps might be the cause of this issue.
---
lol OP is going to love the new damage update /s
---
One Enclave, One America 🇺🇸
---
Even on console it would be better then
---
*yes
---
Confused
---
Sorry
---
Dance
---
More dance
---
Etc*
---
Gotta buy it.  Probably isn't in the atom store at the moment so you'll need to wait until it rotates through again.
---
Must be PC...I only “see” the invisible guys.
---
Thankfully my character is specced to where if I were to put on Chinese armor I wouldnt be overencumbered.
---
Carnivore with foods like Pep Rolls, Grilled Radstag, Deathclaw Steak/Wellington etc. Increase carry weight.
---
Charred feral ghouls.
---
They hit like a truck,  they’re able to break the sound barrier,  they have tactical withdrawal and concealment skills,  oh and they can hit you when your 30 feet in the air.
---
It's just that before, we had the chance to farm between 50-75 atoms per day, plus the weeklies ( about 300 atoms ) we were always reaching 500 atoms per week.
---
Now jesus...it is definitely getting better ! As our season pass ranks always require more and more xp...bro...it's raining atoms over here lol.
---
It's not avoidance. He's implying the gun is simply broken (overpowered), and it is.
---
I hate those bloody cave crickets
---
I'm so glad I don't suffer from FOMO.
---
I just reached the last section, claimed the future tec camp module (but won't use it as it's glitched)
---
But I haven't felt pressured to bother with challenges at all. I've checked to see what they were a total of 6 or 7 times in the last month, mainly when I only had 10 min or so to kill and could easily eat some gum or something. 
---
The rewards weren't anything worth chasing (to me) so I just kept playing and shockingly enough, kept climbing the board at a pretty steady pace. 
---
It helped that I started a new alt and just hit level 80. So most of my progress came simply from playing. 
---
I did spend 900 ATOMS when I noticed I was a few blocks away from the Blood Eagle Super Sledge paint. Since I was using a 2 star SS at the time I went ahead and 'purchased' it from the store for 900 atoms. 
---
Aside from that, it's just been something in the back ground periodically pinging with a new rank or unlock. 
---
I'm not an endgame min/maxer though. More a casual player.
---
In my adopted kids room where I confess I was the werewolf that slaughtered their orphanage matron.
---
Fucking hate loot moochers dude, like if youre that lazy you might as well chop a tree on Runescape for days on end.
---
I was once one-pumped from it. That's not to say even if you do survive the first or second  shot, it staggers and shakes your whole screen.
---
I'd say I get one about every tenth click on a machine.  Not all that hard to get.
---
Mod away friend. The magic comes from either it's 2nd or 3rd effect. Look up a guy named AngryTurtle on YouTube if you wanna an in-depth analysis at magic weapons
---
Thanks all. I grabbed the SS chest first.
---
Or run unyielding haha
---
I think every pellet deals critical damage in vats no matter if your meters full or not thats why it 1 shots most everything in vats.
---
So THATS what it’s for!
---
You mean the sniperlurks?
---
Had one of those fuckers hit me and I didn’t know what it was until I pulled out a scoped weapon and looked around.  Apparently I’d aggroed it as I was running through the bog and instead of chasing me he proceeded to yell constantly in my direction.
---
After the horrors I went through with getting this game to work and got on legendary run really late (We begun about 3 weeks ago) this bug came up just yesterday during reset.
---
I actually stuck it out. Sadly my GPU is too weak for things like shadowplay and fo76 in tandem, but the dude would down me and immediately encase me in a pillar so my friend couldn't res me. It was funny. I wasn't even mad. I mean I hate these cheaters, but the extent of these cheats is just hilarious.
---
Nah, it's the stingwing.
---
I'll give it to Bethesda no game(not even any Quake, Counter Strike, Apex Legends, PubgG) has the ability to tilt me the way NW does, I'm at Level 65ish and it will take triple XP weekends to waste anymore time in it.
---
Nah,  they’d never do that.
---
Wasps though,  those are sure to have mutated.
---
Ignore the fact that they’re recolored Cazadorz.
---
And you wonder why nw is shit on pc.......
---
They’re also faster than light and far more intelligent than a creature with a “radiation melted brain” should be.
---
The bug is not new and Junkies is one of them.  You are a magician when you run those.  Magic shotguns are annoying, because it defeats the purpose of the shotgun damage perks.  I’m a heavy build and can one tap anything with a magic shotgun
---
They should just take away the atoms from the season pass and just add more daily and weekly challenges.
---
Ok this is like that South Park episode  
---
### [The Poop That Took a Pee by Leopold Butters Stotch](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/8070631)
---
another day of reading the same complaints from players who think reddit is the official Bethesda support site for the game.
---
But for some reason not miniguns
---
I was thinking this just last night, they are more dangerous than a deathclaw!
---
That’s usually what I do, yes I could go down and get ore but I’m often the only heavy hitter stopping them from getting to the main room at C &amp; D
---
Cook up some cranberry relish for +10%XP for an hour, and take a nap with your companion around for another +10%XP...the two stack. AdditionallyThe Path To Enlightenment Event which gives another +5%XP stacked on the previous two.
---
you'll be able to get a camo version next season, its one of the later rewards.
---
Hey Bethesda, remember how you gave us 2 weeks of Faschnacht because it was broken? Can we also have 2 weeks of Meat Week?
---
Conversely, the slogan could also be "Fallout 76, where there's a stash limit the players are too stupid to meet."
---
Christ. I know they want to make more money pandering to dumb dumbs but I wish the stash limit went back to 400 so you crybabies would go back to Minecraft or whatever.
---
Who peed in your Cheerios today?
---
Thank you. They reverted that change when the Colossus Event dropped.
---
It’s not allowing me to. I have the skin, plans and all the materials. I’ve noticed this problem a lot
---
Thanks. Yeah, will give you more options looking forward to it
---
I would say the scorch. So unorginal and a ghoul ripoff
---
I've been playing the game off and on since launch. Your post has to be, oh, the two thousandth of its kind since inception. They've doubled the storage and you still can't figure out how to stop picking up miniguns. 
---
So, to answer your question, you did.
---
Ah, very nice. I hope something comes of it!
---
I smell a Darkest Dungeon crossover!
---
Now we just need some dank Blight Grenades to complete the process.
---
I tried to start the event after grinding and it didn't even open. So many pop spammed there after the nuke just to see the doors closed. Fix your shot Bethesda common already. Not just this game but the crashing and bugs in all FO games like damn we had enough.
---
I haven’t been playing since the start. I’ve been playing roughly a month. My bad for the repeated post. I typed it up last night after several hours of frustration with my stash and a few missed events due to it. 
---
I’m not stupid, despite your insistence that I am. And I don’t have random heavy weapons cluttering my stash, not random heavy ammo.
---
I tend to hoard as I’m used to previous single-player fallouts. There’s no reason to be as sour and aggressive as you’re being currently.
---
You hang out near him during meat week long enough and he talks about the memory,  or dream, or memory of a dream of him and people that made him happy long ago having meat cooks all the time.
---
Poor lug is remembering pre-mutation.
---
Twice tonight the spawns took so long we failed on wave 3. We had a whole team, I was lowest at 170, and we failed because once you killed one wave it would take almost a minute to register. I’m getting tired of this game. With the continual grinds I have started to lose my passion for fallout.
---
I avoid pack rat.... It's nice but first class citizens get hungry when they know you're carrying junk... Had a team chase me across the map with explosive bait once.
---
I try not carry anything to serious now xD
---
Hunters long coat, scout armor masks, traveling leather coat, blue ridge caravan outfit and mask, camo jumpsuit, white powder jumpsuit, whitesprings jumpsuit, tattered field jacket.
---
Hey dm me :)
---
Awww, it's a torso mod, can't wear it with Dense or Jetpack mods.
---
But thanks for the tip!
---
"Pull my finger,Kid."
---
Find a partner that talks about you the way Grahm talks about Chally. #relationshipgoals
---
All the salt from the players that have given up.
---
I am bloodied power armor and heavy build! I can tank all 3pylons kill encrypted robot and still alive and never have problems with that event so enjoying it
---
Um - I don't know, I don't speak any dialects of the language myself: Could be I was falsely informed. 
---
So, yes, I shouldn't be stating shite I subjects I have No authority in. Sorry.
---
They should make it easier and cheaper to complete the legendary run. There's no way in hell I'm completing it legit as it is now, and there's no way I'm paying $150 for it.
---
Yeah I feel that man, been kinda hit or miss with it lately too, just been grinding out gold bullion and waiting for the BOS stuff to come out, maybe they’ll have some new stuff then. Hopefully the colossus event isn’t too bad when it gets on console too, but yeah primal cuts has been kinda meh so far imo, and meat cook on a public server didn’t even last five minutes and it didn’t really feel, worthwhile I guess
---
Apparently they just love it when we server hop given the number of different ways they encourage it.
---
"downvoting negative posts on Reddit"
---
When do I get my Primal points?
---
you litteraly destroyed Appalachia with the plague though, not just the Brotherhood
---
My wife and I both play and we were driving through our town. We drove past a carwash and she saw the dryers. She told me she had to do a double take bc she thought it was a raider power armor station
---
FFFFFFFFFFFF
---
FFFFFFF
---
It can bug out anywhere. I've had it happen in every region.
---
What I mean is that I wish I could find a failing event on a server hop. So far I've only been able to complete the event twice on the hour only two times. After 4 server hops or when the clock strikes 5 after, I just give up.
---
I'm willing to believe that it's all Ward's fault.
---
It does! I was excited to play it 3 months ago when it was supposed to drop, then last update, then last week, then this week — now next week I’m still pumped!
---
It definitely happens with no tents as well.
---
You need hazmat or stealth suit to run for ore, you will die in seconds in any set of power armor even with strangler heart PA I'm down in 7 seconds far to fast to manage my rads dodge enemies and hunt for ore.
---
Yeah honestly I can’t think of the last thing they released that “just worked”. Mole miners? Idk. Just part of this game I suppose. It does kinda hurt how excited you can get for stuff. 
---
I’m hopeful for daily ops. But I’m realistic in that we probably won’t be playing them for 3-4 months.
---
r/unexpectedskyrim
---
Any Diseased enemy I can't one-shot, man I go through a lot of disease cures.
---
Story of my Reddit life lol 😔
---
I tried to do the same. I'm 'only' level 80 but a level 24 was hopping around with the trade emote, going from person to person. 
---
I was overloaded and had a level 25 2 star ski sword I was going to just give him. So the trade window pulls up and before I could even react he'd requested every scrap of adhesive and screws I had AND then had the nerve to start requesting every starred weapon in my inventory!
---
I just emoted No and teleported away.
---
This is the most common bug for me as well. Everything dead including the boss, but timer is still running.
---
That's quite the property friendo. The water side patios are fuckin' fire.
---
Hey, if it releases in working order on console early next week, I’ll eat my shoes. 
---
But it won’t.
---
I'm on Xbox :)
---
Mole rates in general are ridiculous they burrow in half a second and pop up out at you at any point in time. Feral Ghouls scares the shit out of me every time I play, like these things have the exact same color palette as some bush and they dive bomb into your legs at mach 40, and they also just appear out of thin air.  Scotched just keep respawning behind you by the dozen and the are all chucking grenades and power slamming you with pickaxes they are the most infuriating.
---
I really dont get how people can fail this event. As soon as critters spawn, hit em with an explosive weapon to kill them all off and loot the critter chunks.
---
It also helps to pick up loads of veg before the event so you can put it in the veggie cooler.
---
Same for me, but more extreme: I’ve done Savage Divide 3 times and failed every time, and Toxic Valley 4 or 5 times, with no failures yet. Just a couple other players, and no tents or camps very close by.
---
Anything with poison damage can go suck a fat one. I'm talking Mirelurk kings and queens, radscorpions and sting wings, especially during SBQ.
---
On the other hand though, assaultrons that shoot laser beams without charge or remorse are my worst enemy.
---
I need to revive an ally too haha
---
Damn dude awesome job, can only imagine the amount of work put into it.
---
It's the children who are wrong.
---
Yeah me. My Fancy Pump Action is my main weapon. If they ever change how damage works with that thing then I am utterly fucked.
---
Agree
---
Yeah I agree its pretty cool, I like it
---
I didn't think there was a wrong way as long as it gets done.
---
KingMacabre13 add me lets meet up
---
When the legendary race will be over, I will get the Ores again, until then, I need the XP and you can only get it by killing mobs....
---
Ask bethesda to give xp for Ore. It' s poor design the way it is now.
---
Because I'm an idiot and hadn't considered that
---
I do like Grahm, but Aries in riding Shotgun has some of the best lines in the game no doubt. The banter between him and Rudy is too good
---
I received the plan yesterday, all I did was start playing the drums the moment the warm up timer started (doing that gets the bar half full when the event starts), then some of the others must have dumped a ton of prime meat onto the grill because it completed in under 1 minute, I had no time to contribute anything other than the drums and a few greens so it’s totally random in terms of what you contribute but I don’t know if speed of completion means anything or not.
---
But then you could remove a perk card and just exploit the whole thing, load your stash up with a thousand items then take your cards off.
---
Because what's red is not the overall structure, but something on the inside.
---
I'm not saying it isn't a stupid mechanic that needs to be removed, but I experimented quite a bit with this, and basically the game checks every single item.
---
To prove it I built a very simple structure with a foundation, four walls, a roof and a few floor decorations inside, and everything placed perfectly when building from a blueprint.
---
Then put a single poster on one of the walls, turned the solid wall into a window, and suddenly the whole structure couldn't be placed because "item is floating".
---
It's extremely easy to end up with this situation and one might not even notice while it happens, and it'll still screw up the whole build forever.
---
the number if slots are account wide., the leveled card are not.
---
WHich seems logical: if it's possible to level a single card with multiple chars  this will be massively unbalanced
---
I don't know if this bothers me more, or the hitbox on our character. Leaping ten feet over a ghoul, thinking your safe. Only to find out it has telekinesis as it proceeds to stunlock you to death.
---
The black prospectors hat works just as well too
---
You just have to keep joining new sessions and eventually it should work.
---
i hope you don't dislike my wordy and complex answer ;-P
---
short answer, it depends.
---
long answer&gt;  
---
the scrap collectron station, or for that matter any station, is invaluable if you bounce back to your camp often, have fallout 1st, or find yourself lacking in vendor trash.  i have mine kinda centrally located and use it as a travel hub.  the time i lose in having two loading screens vs one, is well worth the caps i save and the scrap i can keep emptying out.
---
the rainwater barrel is great as well.  my primary liquid sustenance is melon water (long story) and my current camp is nowhere near a quick dirty water source.  but with the barrels, i'm able to pop back, grab my melons, grab the dirty water, and bounce out.  haven't had to actually stop and collect water for a while.
---
finally, if you like camp building, some of the items are straight up must haves in my opinion.   
---
 some good examples are the seedy shed and log cabins.  i have the two of them set up as my crafting hub and my ally hub.  when i move my camp i can just plop down the auto generated blueprint, and focus on the rest of my camp.
---
like you said, the atom shop is VERY subjective.  i'd avoid the power armor skins like the plague, seriously laughable are their prices.  most of the outfits are laughably overpriced too.  a few, are solid.  like the more recent quack outfit.  i'd never pay full price for it on its own, but as part of the blood eagle bundle, it was well worth it.
---
the weapon skins are a big solid MEH from me too.  in fact, such a "meh" i haven't even looked at the prices, ditto on the furniture skins.
---
the fridges are grade A useless, but the cola vending machine feels right.  most of my camp builds are bars/pubs/trading posts so it feels good to have SOMETHING that isn't a proper vending unit.  speaking of vending, screw the vending machine skins.  severely overpriced.  i suppose the slocum joe's one was cool... for being different, but only really fits in with a handful of camp building styles.
---
Though it was a flag style paint
---
Hell, even if you don’t
---
Are you xbox or ps4?
---
Common dude... you don't know the reason for this? Level up daily challenge...
---
I hit a server where (I'm guessing) a team of 4 were AFK for hours. I searched up on YouTube, found out you can AFK the Drums and Spits for at least 8 hours and still get full rewards. You can also, move your camp nearby, build a box, then rubberband your analog, so you can still stay AFK if the Drums and Spits are taken, while still collecting full rewards without the fear of getting kicked. 
---
It's lazy as hell, and I hope it gets patched.
---
Yes, it’s quite frustrating. And the legendary prime beast not giving a legendary weapon.
---
Anything worthwhile in the end chest gets sent to you once the event finishes if you didn't loot the chest.  For instance, on my first run ever I got the Cursed Shovel at the end, didn't even make it out of the mine.  
---
Just take your time and loot everything, and when the timer runs out you get teleported outside with absolutely no consequences.
---
I worked at a hardware store, and I can understand your struggle. Walk by the power tools...sweet plastic and screws. Only to remember this is the real world.
---
Ps4
---
I'd they aren't going to help it doesn't make a difference if they are at the event or at their camp with their thumb up their ass. 
---
What's your point? The event sucks anyway.
---
Im xbox. Sorry :(
---
I shall NEVER support the deep state!!!
---
What platform are you on?Can you check your PS4 saved data files to see if you still have previous saves there , or on PC what about the trash bin , you can restore deleted files from there.
---
Gott make the shaker out of depleted uranium, really adds to the *flavour*
---
It's called mute function you can activate it from the social menu
---
That's a PSA
---
All good. Its the thought that counts. Good luck 👍🏽
---
At least it could say which item is floating and we should be able to edit blueprints by removing items from it. It took me hours to make this building and now I have to do it from scratch. It is nerve breaking :/
---
Sometimes a building cannot be placed if it has doors or power connectors connected to each other. I figured this out while trying to move my seedy shed
---
You too! 🤘
---
Itll have the same audio as the red rocket garage
---
There isn't any valid logic behind "rifles need to be compensated" but yea a good perk to be added.
---
Nice idea. 
---
They could also just weight reduction to the rifleman and commando card or tank killer
---
The lighting of this game has always been terrible.
---
For me its those damn crickets. Little fuckers jump up in your face and hide in the grass.
---
YOU’ve doomed us all!
---
i have a nice quad 10% while aiming and 25% less vats cost =0
---
YOU HAVE DOOMED US ALL!
---
Taking over a workshop but you can't because some molerat somewhere is alive but it never attacks you = #$$@#$#@$@#%@#
---
=)
---
Aside from the entire questline of the game, it just feels like a chore to me with all of the grind for everything, not to mention, after wastelanders... you are back to grinding. But overall, it's been quite a fun ride and will probably (and hopefully) get better and better.
---
The best one is:
---
-I can’t stop this nightmares.
---
-Hello, I was thinking about You.

If it wasn’t that, you’d be bitching about the next most powerful weapon. Yes they’re kinda broken, yes they wreck everybody, yes they suck to get hit with. Everyone has a chance to find one though, it’s not like they’re unattainable and only give a select few an advantage. Whoever finds one has advantage over someone who doesn’t, but that could be said for a lot of items. I’d prefer a handmade over a board, doesn’t mean the handmade is magic.
---
Not toxic bro. Salty.
---
Am I the only one who thinks that this is reversed? Bags of cement should MAKE concrete so the concrete should be the cement should be the scrap.
---
Lies! Deception!
---
It's the "as long as it gets done" bit that's important, though.
---
A lot of posts I see about events like Radiation Rumble, Primal Cuts, Project Paradise, etc. are the instances where the events fail.
---
I don't really like it, it's very chaotic and has no real strategy. I did it yesterday with only two others and the Wendigos just became very annoying. I just kept ignoring them because they were just too much to even try to destroy. I mean imagine 20 of those making that sound. But for each their own, it does give a lot of xp and some new variation
---
It's 900 perk cards, not levels. You get on a average 1.8 perk cards per level factoring in perk cards. So by level 500 you have enough cards, but due to lost cards, moving special and equipped cards it'll be more like level 700. That's still a lot for most people but I'll hit that grinding out armor ace.
---
Help I Can't Keep My Caps Below 30k
---
Jeez I’ve done this before for people but I’m away right now
---
Completely agree.
---
Those Scorched Snipers that can hit you from a mile away consistently with them pipe rifles even if you are mid air have to be up there as well
---
I guess before the fall out they were trained by Spetsnaz, IDF Sayeret and SEALs.
---
It’s a harpoon gun?
---
Ticks..... go to pumpkin house, go for pumpkins, get bitten, get disease EVERY TIME even in power armour!! Much hatred!!
---
I’ve gotten 70-80 before, if you hit all the ore deposits at the start of the event you get 40, after ~5-6 minutes you can collect again, it’s a scramble the first 2 minutes and last 2 minutes because of the tight margins but you can atleast get tier 3 solo ore running sometimes.
---
Getting at least 40 though from first run (And depositing!) will encourage others to gather as well, i’ve found, until someone deposits, the xp farmers will scramble around.
---
Its all good, ive been trying to do it for about a month now so im sure i can wait awhile longer. Just lemme know once u hop on and ill let u know if i still need help
---
Trust me, it has strategy. I've shared revenant and used the pit you need to fall down at the beginning with 3 bloodied randoms in my team several times. Let's just say that Early boi didn't live long enough to tell the tale. And if my teammates finally died again, despite all the team medic procs, we'd just repeat the cycle.
---
95% hits will miss 4x in a row at point blank range. Lots of aiming over the heads of targets when focused on their torso.
---
If the Ore gave XP and loot rolls I'd do it loads moire, but as is being a the ore mule is taking one for the "team".
---
and bog
---
What's your strategy for that? The health drain is pretty crazy, and even if you can spam your stims or healing items, when the impostor hits it still take off a fair chunk initially.
---
...and some of us still need Stimpack Diffuser plans for that damn Medic badge!
---
This tip really came in handy. Got me nearly 900 caps.
---
I’m a full health heavy gun build. I always try to tank all 3 pylons. Once I have all 3 I get on the roof of the shack tag that imposter a couple of times and then try to hide between the yellow metal tank thing and the slope of the roof. Then I just pray that level 52 Col. Gutsy doesn’t see me and that someone on the ground has a weapon that can damage the imposter. Because it sucks to tank the pylons and have to go toe to toe with that bloody assultron.
---
Check the metal scrap piles, few times i’ve been searching for the body, before giving up and check scrap piles for lead and boom found him that way.
---
Also check the hill behind the trees opposite the cabin, it sometimes rolls down that way
---
You can do that.
---
Just go to bed and you get lovers embrace after a while.
---
I failed because no one stayed on drums or spit during the event except me so the progress kept ticking down and there was LOADS of people at the event. I hopped on my mic to say someone needs to turn spit or do drums and no one did so we failed :( its really not hard.....
---
Scorchbeasts for me. All the do is hover and fly away.theyre supposed to be the biggest and baddest enemy in the game, but they're just irritating cowards
---
I wish we got lunch boxes for the event, would give a different reason in the future to do either fight depending on what you want. The loss in flux sucks too but good god are the hundreds of screws worth it and a guarnateed 3 star is nice.
---
What do you mean
---
Even low levels tanking one pylon helps, don’t try all 3 and only do 2 if you have the right perk set up.
---
Doing one though will definitely help :)
---
It has already accepted the blood sample. Can only t fuse then analysis
---
She tells me my camp (in the Toxic Valley) smells like lemons and dog armpits.
---
Is free somewhere world spawn Google it
---
Sure it does!Right I am use first thing is cranberry meat grinder and I use scorchbeast meats all they give good amounts of hp ,cola nut perk and nuka quantum and you are TANK
---
No problem
---
And why does anyone still have the Fasnacht collectron up and running?
---
Where is he, I’ve completed the quest, but I can’t find him anywhere in the interior. I just wanna take his picture :(
---
The difference is I don't use a Gauss shotgun unless its my only weapon to start off in a crowd. I have more self respect than to use it.
---
Totally agree. I remember facing off against a Queen and 2 kings at the same time and I assumed that tge Queen would be the challenging one to kill, but nah. (Plus the Kings are always so loud and I have to turn my volume down, especially when there's multiple and it's just constant bwahhhhh)
---
Reminds me of a weird encounter I had today. 
---
Came across 3 Mothman cultist who where glowing a strange purple with a familiar pulsing sound. 
---
I snuck around expecting a Flat Woods monster must be in the area and sure enough found one hiding on the other side of their totem.
---
Managed to sneak up and take him out at which point the cultists stopped glowing. 
---
I do recall another time in lucky hole mine where all the cultists were spawning in nekkid. 
---
They were glitched in that they weren't moving at all  but allowed me to appreciate the level of detail they put into the bodies of some of these NPCs.
---
The ghoulish and diseased female models are fully modeled with creepy pock marks, bloodied lips, and radiation burns. 
---
Makes me wonder why they don't have those as options for player or companion visuals. 
---
Snapped a photo with my character,  I need to figure out how to transfer that photo here for peeps to check out.  (XBOX1)
---
Sorry about that, mate. Sounds lame.
---
I had the exact opposite experience. I started it last weekend at level 35, and the entire server showed up to do it: I counted 12 people. They killed it after one pylon--I think--or it glitched. It finished the mission for me, though, and I got the quest rewards in my inventory without ever seeing the boss.
---
I didn't even know what the heck was going on. I just thought I was finishing a side mission. I don't think there was a warning or anything that I was triggering a high level event.
---
the clean version is an atomic shop outfit and the tattered version can be found at dolly sods lookout.
---
i really hope he missclicked
---
Half of the people playing Fallout 76 finished the legendary run after one or two weeks... if they counted SCORE towards future seasons then most people will have completed many MANY seasons to come... that wouldnt be fair to...... basically everyone.
---
Thanks to the repeatable weekly I was able to finish the run in 3 weeks just by grinding high volume enemy areas and doing regular dailies. Just stick to doing dailies, look for the double xp weekend, and use your lunchboxes when your grinding out xp for a while. You'll finish way early.
---
If you're having trouble dying, maybe your build needs tweaking?
---
This is my scavenger build, which relies on mutations for damage, along with her instigating deathclaw, and shrouded wood armour. Sneak attacks all the way. She can clear West Tek and Charleston Building with ease. The only time I die is at the Colossal Problem and sometimes at SBQ. Though my SBQ deaths are usually because I never look at my rads.
---
Level 700 is just as bad. That is an absurd level to expect you to get a character too. Nevermind if you for some reason what to equip your alt with legendary perks. Most sane people will see level 700 and say fuck that. Especially if their a newer player who has barely reached 100. I'm level 300 on my main and I've been playing since beta. Not everyone wants to have a massive long and stupid grind for every goddamn aspect of this game.
---
It is on SS, I have a Jetpack and a Spare Chest piece with pneumatic just for those occasions. You still get stagger but You recover like 50% faster.
---
Praise the Sun!
---
The wendigo spawns are useful for getting some of your ammo back, also useful for maxing out Adrenaline, and since I don't have a -25AP weapon I also use the spawns for getting my AP back with Grim Reaper's Sprint.
---
On the flip-side, I adore the Wanderers constant chirpy comments and guitar twanging.
---
It’s a door. It’s always a door.
---
When you get to late game it turns into a grind fest. Also you do not regret not buying it day one. All the bad stuff you heard was absolutely true for the first couple of months and was still somewhat broken until wastlelanders
---
Ok I figured the clean one was an Atom shop item but I wanted to clarify.
---
Liberator bots are my kryptonite.
---
Flying lil tictacs that dodge so much. I can run through westtek or sbq without dying but libs will fucking swarm me and melt me.
---
&gt;Armorer rank 3 reduces the cost to ten vault steel.
---
I noticed that when I went into the crafting menu. Still, I had to hop 4 times to make 2 pieces of armor, and now I have a couple pieces left.
---
"GoOgLe iT" I did, you ignoramus. Which lead me only to the Tattered Mole Suit. Which I was already aware of. Thanks for your wondrous contribution.
---
Mirelurk king for me I've no idea why but I'd rather fight the whole map then cope with one of them soon as I hear that scream I'm done
---
The mayor for the day part where you have to fight like 10 on a roof top. I finally had to hid and lure one down one by one.
---
Tip for shotguns; make sure you have the True Barrel, long. It says "Superior Hip fire" but what it actually does is tightens up the spread of your pellets, even while aiming done sights. This will improve you damage vastly if you have it on your gun. That tied with scattershot and it will tighten up your spread even more. Its all about making every single pellet hit.
---
Hope this helps.
---
floaters and high level feral ghouls, unless I'm on my bloodied character, I only have so many plasma cores
---
ahh, yes that makes sense now. Thanks for explaining it. That would be super helpful.
---
If u need ammo come to my camp im on xbox cecce999
---
What ammo do you have?
---
Oh. My. GOD!!! YES!! I fucking LOATHE Mole Rats. Everytime I go somewhere, there's always a small pack of those filthy fucking dirt rodents! I have to use VATS to take care of them with my Shotgun. God, I hate the fact that they burrow &amp; can somehow pop up from ROCKS! I keep doing it cause I forget that 76 doesn't have ANY logic.
---
Yup. It used to be a reward from the vault raid. Now you can buy it and craft those pieces. The good part is that they're guaranteed 3 stars, but you need 10 vault steel and a module for each piece.
---
The bad part is that you burn 150 scrip and only get 24 back when you get a shitty 3 star nocturnal or whatever.
---
Well, there's Gail with the Raiders. It's hard to tell which of them are female, though. Both women and men become the same when turned into super mutants by FEV.
---
&gt;There is a feature that you can blueprint Ammunition Factory from the Workshop... Why do I say "feature"? Well, you dont have to use any exploits or hacks to blueprint it. And I doubt that AAA company would leave such thing for such a long period of time unattended if it was an exploit.
---
you don't have to do any exploit.  you just go into blue print mode, select it, and make blueprint.   takes like 1o seconds or so.   I think they should leave it in the game.  it makes it kinda fun and think we'll see fights over the workshops and substations.  lord knows we could use a little excitement in the game.
---
I always have to remove doors.
---
I have 6 Chally Moo outfits, 3 Peppered Tenderizer mod plans, god knows how many outfits but still no Tenderizer plan. That's my goal!
---
the slots at least are account wide so a player with 1 lvl 300+ character will have 6 slots available to all other characters on that account including freshly made characters.  The first rank of each perk is free so new characters can potentially get 6 legendary perks on day 1.
---
 But yeah as a fellow altaholic with all 5 slots on my account in use I feel your pain.
---
You'll still get stun locked. Needs to be resistance
---
I always remove doors. It just works.
---
5.56, 45, fusion core, plasma, ecc
---
looks like the  Reclaimed Deep Mining Gas Mask from colossal problem
---
No.
---
How much those fusion cores going for 😂 
---
Any 5mm in there?
---
Did you switch between any weapons with high amount of ammo in a mag
---
Most live service games make conscious decisions to shift meta about, for bethesda, it’s just the next batch of bugs
---
It's a real shame when high level players stop on your parade just because they think they can.
---
Pvp should stay in its own world where you expect it.
---
Ooooh thank you so much, so i just have to partipicate in   colossal problem for a chance of it to drop it seems c:
---
Add me on ps4 I’m 200 looking for a group to run events with pm
---
Bug-It deletes your character in rare instances. The fix will be implemented in patch 69
---
If you don’t attack the mobs in the tunnel they will ignore you. So just squeeze through those snallygasters. Now if it’s deathclaws then run as fast as you can as they will chase you and trample you to death.
---
They can teleport and have wall hacks underground.
---
He shot at my friend who was on the keypad putting in the code. The gauss minigun shots start raining upon us. Thank good I had my furious .50 cal equipped and showed him what for
---
So You practically want a Adamantium Skeleton lv3 Perk car but for Stagger, I am a melee too and honestly I think that would be to Op.
---
Ferals always jump scare me, they win for me.
---
Angry post about angry posts is still an angry post though.
---
If you don't wanna run around for the codes, google Nukacrypt :)
---
Nope i need the 5mm but i can give u the cores
---
It Is really toxic people downvote if they dont have what u want or u say no cuz ur not interested I'll get downvoted for saying this it's toxic
---
I'm on xbox and primal cuts are super busy but the cookout seems to be ignored most of the time.
---
We have perks that negotiate all types of shit and you think that would be op? Ok bud lol
---
Ah? I went and tried it and it did tho. Top of the mask was through the top of the hat.
---
Gonna next time but it’s just all the prep so we could finish pre-wastelander quests was a kick in the teeth
---
I had an encryptid yesterday where I was the 2nd person to show up after the player with the keycard. I assumed they'd wait for a few more people before starting it, but nope, they just started the event then immediately marsupialled up onto the roof, leaving me as the only possible pylon taker.
---
That sure was fun.
---
(More people did eventually turn up anyway, making it possible to finish. I did my best but pylons + every colonel gutsy shooting only at me + assaultron eyebeam was just too much.)
---
Hacking and lock picking are not needed skills. I havnt picked a lock out side of challenges in like 300 levels
---
Yes
---
That is pretty awesome! Im just sad your not on ps4!
---
Ah? I went and tried it and it did tho. Top of the mask was through the top of the hat. Tis unfortunate, it would have been a cool combo.
---
Who could resist those sweet little faces, and that cute way they shuffle around on all those hands they have!
---
Mirelurk kings take the cake for me. They're so horribly overpowered it hurts. Attacking with their ranged when not even looking at you? Being able to range attack and pounce? Knocking you into walls so bad it clips you? Horrid. No boss, legendary, scorchbeast, or deathclaw has even come close to doing as much damage to me as those guys. I took down my first scorchbeast at level 30 something with 0 help, but a level 14 mirelurk king ruins me at my current level 50~
---
When do you go on fo76 I can jump on whenever you’re free dude
---
I share your concern
---
Im online now add me
---
I usually see them as needed to progress fully through dungeons and for the lore aspect to gain knowledge or a better way through areas. That, and easy caps/ammo
---
I got you, bud. Donated a star for ya lol
---
It’s not bad luck. It’s user being stupid.
---
For me its the lvl 62 charred feral ghouls as I’m constantly getting ganged by like 7 at a time
---
First off, yes PC &amp; consoles players are nearly playing a different game, without mods it is very likely I would've stopped playing a long time ago.
---
Secondly, there is no PC vs Console conflict as 95% of people have better things to do than pride themselves on what hardware they play video games on ,  the vast majority of PC players want you to have mods &amp; A Colossal Problem ASAP. 
---
thirdly , we are seven years into a console hardware generation &amp; console patch updating is almost as obsolete.  This isn't a burn, it's almost a compliment as to how well power is being squeezed out of consoles(this game would take a GIANT dump on a PC of similar performance to a current console). On top  of patches needing more optimization for console there is also the fact that console patches must be certified by said console maker which adds more time/cost, a non issue on PC.
---
Lastly as someone who has had no notable problems with the 6ish times I've done the event, but at the same time haven't been super wowed by it(that happens when something is hyped for 5 months) there isn't a lot to say about it, so if you're on reddit there is a good chance you will hear from people with issues with it as the delays killed a lot of the enthusiasm/mystery surrounding the event.
---
game is easy enough as it is without adding more perk points though 
---
it is a bit of a jimmy rustler when you have to swap in lockpicking and hacking cards though. i only ever swapped them in when it was a challenge.
---
Can’t find you my gt is dizzydeaths
---
How? By not paying attention to anything. 100% OPs fault and he’s trying to pass the blame on lag.
---
You just blew my mind.
---
How? By not paying attention to anything. 100% OPs fault and he’s trying to pass the blame on lag. You’re 100% right it’s total bullshit.
---
Come
---
use a different gun LOLS!11!11! this is why i use the gauss shotgun and not the minigun tbh. 
---
easiest way is sell the ammo you don't use and buy the ammo you need
---
Maybe You should change your build a little bit .I do the queen with the pneumatic piece and it works just perfect ( instead of being staggered for 4 seconds is just 2), even with the “bears” if they aren’t dead by the first punch. I can show You my build if You need any help with your melee build.
---
100% that. Build is extremely important. And so are weapons effects. Without a solid build you're really screwing yourself over
---
Use a pneumatic chest.
---
it's been around for a while now. happened twice in about 6 months. also it unassigned your displayed items
---
That seems to be the pattern, is that a good idea for me as a lower level player though? I might end up doing that If so. Just worried that I'll change my perk points around and wont be able to add a card to do that stuff when I need to. I'm probobly just overthinking it though
---
the sound they make is just ugly and disgusting.
---
And be in photomode! Thats important!
---
Anyone know how to make this glitch happen?
---
Nah you can, got one the other day for my raider character base. Gonna fill up a thanksgiving display case with 6 of them.
---
Its not the player level cap, its the number of SPECIAL points you're allowed to have in the game that limit you.  You're limited to 56 points total to split among the 7 categories as you see fit with a set max of 15 points in any one category. Although you can use different items to boost some of these stats, the number and rank of cards your allowed to have is a hard limit. Its a pain to have to swap cards, but it does have its uses since it allows to you set up your character for situational activities (crafting, combat, etc.) Some cars like Lone Wanderer cost you an extra point (never understood that one) so a maxed out card will cost you 1 point more to equip than the face value of the card.
---
If Bethesda delivers on the promise of "Perk Loadouts" &amp; doesn't screw it up it will make moving cards around easier (I hope).
---
I'm good. Im just not gonna use melee anymore
---
Happy cake day
---
I am! That could be awesome if you could help me out :D
---
r/evenwithcontext and r/brandnewsentence welcome you
---
Isnt the rad scorpion worse for lower lvls cuz they have more health but easier for higher lvls cuz they are larger
---
Refuse piles are the bighest priority. They wont respawn once picked up and they will drain the progress bar faster then the spits and drums can raise it.
---
Anything that does DOT for me. The bane of bloodied builds
---
I am trying to figure out how this could happen considering you have to type in the name of the character to be deleted.
---
Fingers crossed when they reopen Vault 94 for Daily Ops we can somehow get Vault Steel in there because yes it is utterly ridiculous having to server hop repeatedly just to craft a decent amount of armour.
---
Fuckin bastard following you to the missile turret until they lose aggro and you fuckin fall into a fissure while running to get em again.
---
Also never landing. What a buncha chickens.
---
Oh no that's not what I meant, I know it's not the cap, I'm level 57 something now and seen my fair share of 300+ players lol. Thank you for that breakdown though, that really helps :) I guess I just gotta sit down and setup my own perk build sometime soon, and hope Bethesda keeps their word for once, thanks again!
---
Depends on type... I use mainly 50 cal and I just build a camp on lead deposit and farm steel from Uranium Fever event. Ammocrafter and Superduper perks help.
---
I’d like to buy some punctuation. 
---
Regardless of importance, hard of hearing or deaf people would probably be interested in what they say.
---
after reading this the term "meat grinder" becomes a whole new meaning...
---
To those of you saying that radscorpions are worse: they're not
---
Radscorpions are easier to  hit, they let you run away, they almost never burrow and never really attack your camp unless you put it in a place where radscorpions spawn.
---
Also, any humanoid with a melee weapon. 
---
They hit you while you're preparing a power attack? geuss what, fucko: no power attack for you. You hit them while they prepare a melee attack? They'll shrug it off and do the power attack anyway.
---
You block their attack 0.00001 second too early or too late? you're taking a hit. But they block 5 seconds before you even attack, they will block your attack entirely.
---
sorry, just a melee player being really agitated here.
---
Ouch... i feel your pain friend- 
---
Now i try to always use a power armor because fall damage is a pain-
---
All the enemies mentioned here suck in some Cliff Racer way but it's sort of a shame we aren't complaining about what traditionally is the toughest enemy in the wastes - Deathclaws. We should be afraid of them, at any level. But in 76 they're just a run of the mill enemy; fast and tough but not guaranteed death on legs.
---
Me too
---
Difficult when you play solo isn't it 👍
---
no point in having 3 in perception just for lockpicking or 3 in intelligence just for hacking. I happen to have enough points in both. I used to swap in my cards for every level 3 safe and computer i found but then i got tired of doing it. You probably will eventually. 
---
When perk loadouts arrive you will probably be able to make one with your lockpicking and hacking cards in and swapping will be much easier and quicker. Same goes for a crafting loadout. Depends on how many loadouts we can have.
---
It happens to me at the Queen on occasions. I swap between .50 Machine and my handmade and handmade gets a 250 round mag.
---
yikes
---
it‘s not radioactive inside the mine, no. you‘re gonna have to deal with a lot more different environmental dangers, rads on top would be cruel.
---
Get to level 50.
---
Have the Ammosmith and Super Duper cards, maxed if you can.
---
Equip them.
---
Craft your own ammo.
---
I know it sounds obvious, but with those cards, you'll never run out of ammo again.
---
shucks, sorry!
---
Alright, I'll try my hand at making a build that fits my playstyle then, thanks :)
---
It's probally one server, leave and try to rejoin.
---
Uncle roger cook egg fried rice now
---
Sneaky commie liberators 😖😖
---
you're free, enjoy your life now
---
It could not let you remove the card while the stash would be overweight.
---
It is
---
Fantastic 😁😷😁
---
don't blame bethesda, blame all of these players without fallout 1st. you can't expect a multi million dollar company to add subs if only a few million people have fallout 1st subs
---
 Yea it was
---
A question should I have sold the chally backpack plan for 15.5 k?
---
if the FEV in any way affects and lowers intelligence in the subject than grahm must have been very intelligent in the beginning. maybe even genius... other super mutants seem to be rather average to lower in intelligence compared with him.
---
can you explain to me why a company like bethesda would EVER give you something you have to pay for, for free?
---
By any chance, did you turn down the music vokume? For whatever reason, if you try do disable all the music, you'll disable the sounds of the crates as well.
---
pretty much all unlockable stuff should be account-wide, especially the stuff that requires arseloads of grind.
---
For stuff like that.. yep
---
Still salty about it though at least I got his 200+ lead
---
I don’t think that’s a good idea , if u have a duper/hacker that has one of those mini guns that fires mini nukes and gives it to their Ally , the server would struggle , now multiply that possibly by how many people could be in a server , it’s just a recipe for disaster .
---
you know what would cheer you up? getting a fallout 1st subscription for yourself or for your family and friends as a cheering up present. try it! it just works!
---
Ah, so that's what it is. I was in ACP earlier and two people were using them. FPS was a slideshow the whole time until the end when they stopped firing.
---
I’m pretty sure there was a wave goodbye emote.
---
You can find it in Carleton Mine
---
It's from the raider questline. The location is  Carleton Mine slightly to the north west of Colonel Kelley Monument.
---
Bugs too, not enough 1st  players to hire a single internal tester.
---
To be fair, when I started Encrypted for the first time I had no idea what was starting. I knew I’d be fighting the boss but no idea it would be so difficult and would require multiple people and that I wasn’t ready. Maybe this person didn’t know either?
---
Funnily enough, in my opinion this sub has more than it's share of people who will unquestioningly accept everything Bethesda (fails) to put out, and will jump at you if you do offer criticism.
---
I agree, there should be a place to just have chill posts enjoying the game, and /r/fo76FilthyCasuals luckily exists.
---
But for crying out loud, grow some pro-consumer spine, /r/f076 . You know who you are.
---
Sadly... the event aint available on consoles yet.
---
She was so interesting to listen to for all of five minutes then it got annoying... they could of spaced out her lines more or added more dialog.
---
Same thing happened to me! I was too low level and wasn’t prepared to be fucking destroyed lol
---
I actually go Exploration for endurance.
---
I absolutely LOVE this event. I always get 3-4 legendaries doing it, meat for my carnivore buffs, springs, acid, as well as more scraps. But I've never completed it with more than 1 animal alive even with 3 groups, nobody really knows what to do.
---
Thanks
---
i did just this and it worked, woke up in the morning and found a ton of meat cleavers and 4 brahmin grill plans in my inventory
---
Also share this concern. Sometimes my camp gets levelled by level 5 liberators because I fast travel back and my turrets are just turning their little heads back and forth ignoring the things shooting the shit out the wall.
---
1st players are the testers
---
You wanna try staked Unyielding, 4 lunchboxes, food buffs... Just wow. 🤣
---
Ticks fuckin suck
---
Sorry to disagree but it IS just my opinion as yours is yours.
---
We will just have to "agree to disagree" I suppose. We all have a choice and yours is to not like Fallout 76.
---
That's not a problem for me... But it is for you.
---
Don't worry, I'm sure you will find new games to play and some will meet your "Gamer criteria" and some clearly won't.
---
Can't please all of the people all of the time and maybe I'm a little complacent with Fallout 76 and just looking for "light game play" and not an overall "experience".
---
Don't think I'm knocking your views at all, I appreciate that we all want/expect something different but end up with what we get. Kinda take it or leave it really.. Eh.
---
👍
---
Can't you make your fallowers take the gun if you drop it next to them and there's enemy nearby, I swear I've seen it before. 🤔
---
I once stumbled upon him in a town. I followed him trying to see if he would talk or do anything. 76 was a lonely place before wastelanders.
---
If there's a teammate there, it's easier to click on them and Fast Travel. I had to do that earlier today.
---

hmmm, my first thought was uranium salt... googled and got  **Uranyl nitrate** ([U](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium)[O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen)2([N](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen)O3)2)  .... but your solution has double the density... seems legit :D
---
Let's pick up critter chunks 20 of us :D
---
I'm still trying to get that bloody backpack too. Haven't even done the swimming test mainly because of the revive a player thing!!!!!
---
take this time to stock up on ammo, god roll weapons, god roll armour, and optimise your build
---
I have a love/hate relationship with Radscorpions. I love how intimidating they are and how they actually have somewhat of a presence in the game (unlike in FO4), but they are just big snippy mole rats when it comes to the adament burrowing everytime you move more than a feet away from them.
---
BY THE WAY, has anyone else noticed that somehow radscorpions and mole rats have a weird ability to ALWAYS detect you. I run a lvl 160 stealth ranged character with 22 Agility and yet a lvl 10 mole rat knows precisely where I am - its not so much of a problem with the rat bois but the scorps can quite easily one-shot me when I'm running max bloodied.
---
Its NOT account wide and it costs that much  points for 1 perk? Holy shit.
---
Didn't really have a problem with this until last night. 2 primal cuts by top of the world failed. Not sure if it's related but both times the hermit crab spawned on the other side of the lake. Ash heap is where it's at for me, hasn't failed once and the acid from the crickets is great.
---
I'm surprised they didn't come back to challenge you
---
I wish you could just select an event and Fast Travel from your Pip-Boy quest journal.
---
I tried that but sadly, the method didnt work ;-;
---
This pisses me off tho people choose to have kids(I have a kid myself) so why moan if someone who has choose to not have a kid has more time to game and get better and more rewards.
---
So what is the strategy?
---
&gt;It seems somethings up with the RNG too as some people are getting tons of the same reward item/plan over a days worth of cookout events.
---
I have 3 chally heads and 3 butcher outfits, duplicate tenderiser plans but no chally outfit. The RNG is killing my will to play it.
---
Remind me to not comment on any of your posts again. No need to insult me. Poes.
---
Honestly so am I but after seeing him die at the sqb four times I can see why he didn’t. Considering I’m a level 79 that just spanked him for messing with my friend
---
A game being fundamentally poorly made (i.e., having tons of technical issues all the time) isn't an opinion bud
---
well, a salt shaker the size of lower arm made from marble or even granite WILL pack its weight to the punch...
---
I'm not saying they shouldn't be "harder". Take more damage, deal more damage, have a higher stun chance on hit, keep the overall stealth element the smaller ones do, sure. That would be terrifying and fair enough.
---
They should not be as fast, though. That's too much.
---
Seems like a pretty good deal for you considering there is some days left to pull more and aesthetically it’s not too pleasing
---
tungsten carbide... wouldnt that make it armor piercing!?
---
Well if ur on ps4 lets do this thing. My camp we can jump off
---
You using tv Netflix or Xbox Netflix? If it’s on your tv (meaning you switch the input or source) then it will be unaffected. Just make sure your controller doesn’t die. You can afk for 40 minutes without it I believe (don’t quote me on that)
---
the reason for the rubber band is to simulate a constant activity on the game, and if the game does not receive any input, it kicks you off.
---
I highly doubt that a process in the background would receive any input at all.
---
Its not to much if you kill them fast
---
Yes, I switched from a Gatling plasma.
---
Personally for me it’s assaultrons. That fucking laser got a HUUUUGE upgrade from Fallout 4’s version. It also happens much more frequently than I remember.
---
I don’t know if it is the same problem that you have had, but I have definitely had a few events go south because one or two creatures wandered really far away. I wouldn’t have known except my camp is just over the hill from the ash heap spawn location and afterward have found some prime creatures at my camp or further out.
---
K. Thx
---
Are you my english teacher ??
---
Yes it is "Bud"
---
It's your opinion.
---
It may well be shared by many or by few but in this conversation it's definitely "your opinion".
---
Get over yourself and just move on.
---
All right thanks alot
---
I propose a “damnit Bethesda” emote
---
Ill be on this afternoon GT: Couratious
---
Make sure to send me a message saying you are from reddit for rad barrel etc.
---
Yeah idk why it bothers me when people use it as “hello” instead because I get confused like they’re leaving lmao
---
It definetly exists already it's like the hello emote but just the hand
---
You need 1 tank and 2 or preferably 3 bloodied builds. The bloodied builds drop down the shaft to die but get resurrected by you. Revenant procs and it's basically gg if the bloodied builds know what they're doing. You, as the medic and tank, engage Earle head on, tanking his hits and attracting the wendigos to you, so that the bloodied builds can sneak around wendigo-free. Works like a charm most ot the time.
---
Yeah, the reach on the melee-only ghouls is insane. Why have Marsupial as a defensive mechanism when the Ghouls can still hit you at the near-peak of your jump? 
---
And oh god, the Glowing Ones reviving packs of fallen ghouls would be a 'log off and take a break' moment in some cases, the way things are. I'm sure some people would love it but idk, idk...
---
I'm pleased you did. I hate those players too. Knobs!
---
If a car can only make it 15 feet down the road before breaking down, is it a good car?
---
What do you play fo76 on?
---
I'm at work now but will be on later
---
Uk wats funny? I got the pabmmlab again after he bought it
---
My main is a full strength build and I flip between junkies heavy/melee and shotguns. I have an instigating explosive combat shotgun - it's fantastic, hope if they ever fix "magic" weapons they give shotguns a buff because outside of magic variants they're extremely weak.
---
Plan again
---
Is hazard a guess by raising your reputation with them by helping them in random encounters? Any time i tried prior to meeting them he always refused because he didn't know me.
---
Can I say players? If not, fucken mirelurk king
---
I have had this problem a lot over the past week on ps4, not really sure if its the beast not spawning correctly or if they just spawn to far away and can't find them. Its super annoying and I hope they fix it for next meat week.
---
If the car is what you wanted then yes. If not. No
---
Choice... Everytime
---
Oh yeah I just equipped it now and checked. It's only a small amount though and looks like a badge on the front
---
The trading community on this game is awesome, I started trading literally 2 days ago and the players I meet have been really helpful, also managed to get almost all the plans from past events I missed (xmas event, fasnatch, mole miner treasure hunter) only missing the radstag hunting knife plan.
---
Same as u
---
Add this to the ‘why are you ignoring this, it would take two minutes to fix!’ pile that the devs have been stacking up. Surely the frequency at which NPCs say their lines is a literal number in the code. So where’s the delay in tweaking it for NPCs and collectrons?
---
Just disable legendary slots before level 50? Doesn't this solve everything?
---
can you put a screenshot?
---
I havent messed with that set in a bit but u think you automatically know it. Try modifying it at bench.
---
Blood bugs mainly because they tend to do a lot of damage wether I’m in power armor or not and since I’m a bloodied build I’m most likely going to die from them.
---
Sadly I can't. I'm just making a dumb post lol. 
---
She does look cool though.
---
I have no problem with those mole rats. But man, I hate those bloodbugs!
---
It removes diseases.
---
MEAT GOOD
---
Well this go around I stuffed in about 60 and got the shotgun but before that was like 200 or so. 
---
I thought the drop rates waa actually pretty hogh
---
Do you still need help? I'll be getting on in just a minute if so. Feel free to send me a friend request: ToxicFluffle
---
The worst is when Emerson comes round and sits on the workbench you want to use
---
‘Half of the people playing Fallout 76 finished the legendary run after one or two weeks.’ 
---
Citation needed. I highly doubt half of the player base was up for that insane a level of grinding. It also would’ve meant I was seeing a lot more legendary run items at player camps, which wasn’t the case early on. I will grant you that a lot of people progressed faster than they usually would due to lockdown, just not *that* fast.
---
I did 5 primal cut events yesterday and each and every one if them failed on the final incoming prime beast not showing up. Time just ticked away while me and others ran around.
---
I have everything ready to start the event but I'm not sure when to start for the same reasons
---
Starvation and thirst.
---
They should also add a radio station that plays 'Fleetwood Mac- Little lies' on repeat.
---
Will only take you down to 1 health, you won't die from either anymore.
---
I don’t see the motivation to shoot someone entering the code....unless they believed that you were stealing their launch. 
---
That’s possible I guess if you were doing it properly and they used the shortcuts and/or they had already prepped it ready to launch. A good indicator might be whether you had to initiate the final launch prep or it was already in progress / complete (room silent and dark). Them having 200 lead is in line with them looting the weights room on their way through the silo either way.
---
That's not a solid strategie. I mean everything can be done by bloody builds, Im glad they get nerfed. It's quite obvious that the bloody build was never meant to be as powerful as they are so Bethesda never made that event with that strategy in mind.
---
I have never been able to play it all the way through. Either no one would show up, people would show up then AFK immediately upon entering, or the game would crash/ auto fail the event at a random point costing the run.
---
Not sure if it's still a thing but I know you could bypass pacifist using nuke mines. The blast doesn't hurt but maybe you got killed by the rads? Otherwise you shouldn't have any problems. I AFKed the barrel for over 10 hours yesterday with no issues.
---
How does she know what dog armpits smell like?
---
Actually I don’t think I want to know.
---
I do know that 'succette' (which means lollipop) is Québécois slang for blowjob, but until I just went a-googling I was unaware of 'pipe' being slang for a beej. It's common slang in France.
---
Im willing to buy the tenderizer plan on pc.
---
They weren’t there the full time though me and my friend went in got our keycards fought the whole way into the room that has the reactor before going to the room that leads to the control room then initiated launch prep. Got the bar halfway full then two high level players show up from nowhere. My lvl 60 friend had died to an assultron and spawned behind them in the bunker.
---
So what I'm getting from this is that I should just hop in a vat of liquid radiation to get swole? 🤣
---
But to my point, I've not seen a big buff wrestler-type dude run quite as fast as a crackhead. It's still quite a bit of extra flesh to move around in comparison. Maybe don't have their charge be mach ten, but mach five? They move at 75% normal speed when walking?
---
I'm down for a trade-off of strength for speed, that would make sense. That's how life works. But, at least for the ghouls, this is not the case and it makes no sense and makes Bloateds really OP for no good reason.
---
You get a pack of seven of them, and you better hope you're in Power Armor bc you're definitely getting Rad Worms, you're definitely getting stunlovked, and you're definitely dying if you didn't notice them when they were a good 100 yards away.
---
This happens often to my sniper, as a crossbow is not a very fast weapon. You can only manage to shoot them about three times before they close the 100 yard gap, and it's not guaranteed that you will cripple their speed if they dodged any of those shots. And that's if you're only working with one of them.
---
More than two is a "run for your life if you can manage to outrun them" situation. And that's if they haven't already snuck up behind you, or fuck, just spawned right on top of you.
---
When I read this, my heart ached a bit for you. If that EVER happened to me, I would cry. If you cried, I don't blame you. Hell, I'll cry for you. I'm so sorry. :(
---
I used gunsmith mainly as an example since it's a level 5 card just to use a drastic example for my suggestion. But yes, with full modded weapons, specially when they are explosive they break in a few mags, so I always try to fit in gunsmith if I can (although I have like 300 repairs kits from queen haha) . It just feels really shitty to sometimes repair your weapon at least twice during queen or Earle fights
---
The whole point of the perk card system is you can swap cards in and out at any point. There is no need to keep hacking, etc active at all times.
---
Take some responsibility though - if you’re playing a game where the official sub is full of criticism, you’re probably playing a fairly divisive game and also choosing to read the posts?
---
Yes i do. Request sent
---
I don’t care at this point tbh. If they were trying to get something new and innovative working then I’d have a bit more empathy for the struggle, but from all accounts this is just killing a wendigo colossus in a mine. Considering that, the number of delays seems ridiculous and disheartening. 
---
The more I follow the progress of FO76, the more I feel like the devs are learning to use the creation engine on our time.
---
K thx
---
Weren't Wanamingoes tough to kill? I've never played FO2 for I wasn't born then &amp;/or I was too young for a computer.
---
Pacifist mode...
---
Just like you could have kept scrolling instead of being a douchè
---
Oh didnt think about that. Well damnit. :( But all this perk switching is so frustrating. :/
---
Ohhh. I used to play very high charisma characters in the other Fallouts. That makes sense. Thank you!
---
pc ?
---
They used one of the shortcuts for sure then. 
---
You had initiated launch prep already as well, and two wouldn’t show up if the silo had already been made ready (you can insert the key card and return later), so it seems unequivocal that they were attempting to grief you.
---
Wait is there a new display case?
---
Exactly. I only do the event for XP. In fact, I love doing it alone when I spot it on my private server. I never did the event once before the Legendary Chore. And now that I've finished the season, I've gone back to ignoring the event. What is my bloodied character going to do with that stupid radiation barrel? I need rads in the field when I die, not in my CAMP.
---
 **BONUS CHALLENGE WEEK** 
---
So probably just extra challenges.
---
While it isn't truly that big of a deal...still...you are a rightful cunt for doing this.
---
You probably don’t. If you camp in the Ash Pit, she complains about how the air is like breathing oil covered glass.
---
Not true. I do this in PA all the time
---
Do you have to just keep doing the meat week events or do I need to do more? Only gotten the suit, head and stein set and I’ve been grinding this shit HARD lmao
---
Why would we need to when this is the first guy to actually attack us? I don’t have a problem with pvp. I have a problem with wasting my time to have someone else take my nuke launch away making my time up until it happened feel worthless.
---
You need to remove all extrernal stairs before moving location. Even then it will still pull this crap at times but that fixes a lot of issues.
---
Wait, that drink is alcohol?? What?? I mean, I've seen the Pip-Boy showing me that there was an addiction but I always thought it was an error that Bethesda didn't fix.
---
You used to be able to get a much better return for selling assault rifles and the like to vendors, but it was heavily nerfed early on. I think they went too far as now you need to be waddling to a vendor with around fifty combat rifles to make an exchange even remotely worthwhile.
---
I mean, it does work with junkies and other builds as well, it just has the best synergy with bloodied
---
RIP
---
If you're that concerned then just travel near the event a few minutes before the start of the hour each hour??? It isn't that hard.
---
Because his attacks won’t do anything. You also won’t accidentally shoot someone first and start combat.
---
They nerfed the values some months before player vending finally arrived. I think people were just amassing caps too quickly and close to hitting that low 30,000 ceiling so they panicked a bit.
---
Get the underarmor, and the shielded upgrade first. Cheap to get, and gives a total of +10 special (4 STR, 4 END, 2 PER)
---
Apart from random encounters I'm afraid not
---
Really? So my friend spawning on them as they came in just standing around while we finished up the bar for them to rush into the control room doesn’t seem like griefing? Especially when he started blasting my friend who was putting in the code and me who was on my pip boy dealing with thirst and hunger at the time?
---
The mole rat is seconed only to the feral ghouls.
---
Yes please. I beleive new vegas saw a female as well. Could make it lore for that time.
---
Stingwings..... They are pure evil. Imagine collosal problem but stingwings....
---
I'll have a look later and see if I can find them.
---
Yep, and random encounters. Though I am putting something to the test. I've completed ward's daily, but have not handed it in. I did this before and noticed I got a bit more rep than usual when I handed it in. I'm wondering if the rep gained builds up with each day and is rewarded when you finally hand it in.
---
They stated shooting my lower level team mate who was putting In the code then at me who was dealing with thirst and hunger. Once I finished drinking I came out my pip boy and blasted him as he launched the nuke because I still had the team member under attack displaying at the bottom of my screen
---
Unequivocal means “leaving no doubt”, so I’m actually agreeing with your friend.....it’s good that they have you in their side but necessary in this case!
---
Tbf you do get more items from season than you would be able to acquire with same amount of atoms
---
Just hop on a spit or barrel. No need for a rubber band.
---
The whole event sucks and is poorly thought out. Melee builds get utterly destroyed. Earl is a bullet sponge. The spawn points for Earl are buggy. The death spawn points outside are a nightmare. There is a lot which could be right made with a few fixes.
---
I agree but they would be making the game fun.
---
But their bullets do no damage....
---
I wanted to do that when she was my companion, but almost every time I would sit down to another instrument, she would put down the guitar. It was maddening.
---
I only got lucky in my opinion and sorry for misunderstanding I took it as you saying “then I don’t think there’s a link to them griefing you”
---
Mole rat? Are you on crack? The worse is assaultrons.
---
With that bullshit 1hit beam.
---
I think I didn't explain myself well, what I mean with strategy is that the event itself is a little bit more than just kill the end boss. For example in surface to air you supposed to protect the turret so it can shoot the scorchbeast. Or with Encrypted there is a little extra element where you have to work together to turn on the pylons. The game sometimes feel like one of those funfair games where you shoot a huge water canon on something and that's the game. People just turn their Gatling lasers on and keep firing until it dies.
---
Nope. The express purpose of a car is movement; it's the base purpose of it. A car that barely runs is a bad car, and a game that barely runs is a bad game.
---
If you disagree, feel free to have a mechanic yank the engine out of whatever vehicle you own and you can "drive" that for a little bit.
---
make sure you ALWAYS donate the reward
---
But that doesn’t matter, they initiated the fight by shooting me and my team. It doesn’t matter if he doesn’t do damage. If you gonna try and bully two lower level players don’t be surprised when you get shot up
---
Yes, welcome to the grind
---
Of course there are certain glitches that can help you...
---
Ooooh, now I get it. Yeah, the event isn't much more than pumping out enough damage to kill Earle asap. But I mean, that's kinda fair considering he will eat your soul just by lookong at you
---
Hey, listen!
---
You're scum, but very informative
---
Mate I know, me and my buddy are level 30 ish and have been consistently ganged on by multiple level 62 charred ghouls for the last 20 levels, it's insane
---
Something doesn’t add up though. How did he steal your launch?
---
We need a....put your exploding plasma gat away at meat week when your level 52 and take 3 shots to kill the critters scattering them everywhere you fucking halfwit.....emoji
---
This sub is finicky with screen shots
---
That’s ok - this is a reminder that using unusual words, when there are plenty of other popular options, is usually a bad thing. I don’t use it normally either.....it just popped into my head...
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed and your post has been removed.
---
I often use the word anal when referring to strict person so that understandable I get some weird looks sometimes
---
What are they? I’d take anything that helps me level up faster
---
Yup, been doing that
---
Characters and progression are not saved locally, it's all on the server.
---
Thanks for the info! So you’re saying to hold on into the item long before delivering it?
---
I dunno I'm a good boy who doesn't glitch, but maybe Google could help you
---
Wrong analagy when your talking to a guy who spends his life with cars, trucks, bikes etc.
---
I'm always looking for that "bad vehicle" especially the ones that no-one can fix.
---
Some people will buy a vehicle to get from A to B and back... But not all. I have vehicles that I don't run, I just like to admire them and collect them.
---
So again, I repeat.. Its personal choice.
---
I would guess that most of your previous games don't meet your current expectations?
---
Maybe you might want to lower those expectations a little and cut the game makers some slack.
---
Nothing... Nothing is perfect. Everything will continue to be perfected.
---
Your living on a very tall statue.. Be careful you don't fall cos its a very long way down.
---
Stop this now before you really do make a fool of yourself too.. Its getting silly.
---
And random encounters
---
He waited until we finished prep then accessed the control consoles before we finished the launch
---
[perception 12+] I know you’re not, but I’m going to keep it a secret between us ;)
---
And then shot you after he launched the nuke?
---
Yeah I thought it was my friend that had launched until he started complaining. I came out my pimp boy-3000 notice I had the team under attack displaying so I shot him in the back
---
There will be a legendary perk card, that will work with PA (if full matching set), and gives poison resist.
---
Yeah, exactly. I've had it for a few days now, might give it another day or 2 before I hand it in and see if i get all the rep i should have for those days. I'm not in a huge rush to max out rep so may as well try this out.
---
Wait, there are lobbys that fail that event? I have done it now 11 or 12 times and not once it failed. I honestly thought they actually managed to make the event almost not able fail (unless you have like 2 people on the whole server doing the event)
---
Correction I read what you said wrong. No he shot my homie imputing launch codes then launched the nuke.
---
It's fixed on the PTS.
---
I did not know that, thanks. 
---
A chem still would have been nice to have over the last 18 months or so, lol.
---
I'm guessing its because it comes under the "Hello" menu in the emote wheel. I understand what its meant to be used for but at this point it seems interchangeable for most people.
---
Happened to me just after patch 21. Vendor and display emptied. I was actually relieved to see all the stuff was in my stash instead of being glitched out or somehow stolen by an exploit. Silver linings, and all that.
---
Thats good news! Thank you very much for the info.
---
Another player in stealth could simply have entered the code previously that week and only need wait for another player to enter a nuke card then jump on the aiming system machine to steal the launch, no need to shoot anyone.
---
I tried that sub but just couldn't deal with the dumb name, so came back to this one.
---
I wasn't even aware that people *USED* the reduce weapon weight perks.
---
The worst is when you’re using the Vox data stringer and you can’t kill it until it’s talked for a minute 😆
---
This\^\^
---
Lmao you have me dying
---
I don't see how, as I'm actively contributing to the event, not just a leech like some people who are actually at their computers but just stand in the middle doing nothing as I have seen.
---
The problem are the beast that run away, once they are out of the event zone they wont come back and if you kill them they wont count for the event. Lose-lose.
---
Lmao, you're projecting quite a bit there. The vast majority of titles don't literally crash on opening a pause menu. It's not a "tall statue" to expect a game to be able to run for an hpur without going "not responding". That's literally what a QA test is for, and as with all of Bethesda's titles, they barely even bother with QA.
---
And unlike your car claim, you can't even fix Bethesda's shitty programming this time, since the game isn't moddable for online play. Every one of their releases for the last decade has required a community patch to fix the literal thousands of bugs they never bother to fix. That's not quality, no matter how hard you suck Todd Howard's shriveled dick.
---
You need flux for it though.
---
Doesn't surprise me with this game, it's always when I'm 1 or 2 away from another 5 Prime Meat it happens
---
Wait, so you're aware of Magic Armor pieces, but not what they result in?
---
Really? I have loads of those.
---
I only thought they made it so I can kill like scorchbeast in one shot but not that they could kill literally every thing in ~10 seconds.
---
Ok. Sell me one then
---
Lever or pipe bolt.
---
Thanks for the info I did not know that
---
Yeah. 
---
I am doing the cuts just for the xp, not for the meat anymore. That way I am not aggravated when it fails
---
yo don't need to test it. You know exactly what it does.
---
Good point maybe I just wanted to kill big things.
---
How do you get raider punk ?
---
That's oddly specific and probably unnecessarily complicated, I work for a fashion company and I'm not even sure what Rosco purple is. I'd be happy if known plans went to the top of the list.
---
“Well not literally”
---
Now I've looked in the stash on my current toon I might be mistaken and thinking of disease cure recipes.
---
Yep. Thought as much. Rarer than rocking horse shit
---
What’s a magic Armour piece?
---
you guys are using turrets? XD
---
Never seen it fail.  It's finished in about a minute every time I've done it.
---
Can't be true. Trying to move single foundation pieces I see this happen-- piece is green, looks like it will work, but says it is floating when I try it.
---
It was the shooting bit that didn’t make sense to me. 
---
That's probably one of the ingredients.
---
They make multishot weapons extremely powerful
---
Ok
---
Now you are getting into base level conversation and I no not why.
---
I haven't said you were wrong I just haven't agreed with you.
---
This is just my choice and clearly, you have yours.
---
I don't have these issues playing Fallout 76 that you seem to and I don't know why nor am I prepared to speculate. I am also not saying the game is perfect because it isn't and most games aren't.
---
I don't know what you expect from me because I'm not changing my stance on this game because I enjoy it.
---
I'm certainly not trying to change your opinion either.
---
My suggestion, for what it's worth would be to try and find another game, sell Fallout 76 to recoup some of your loses and try not to get to uptight about it.
---
Have a nice life 🙄
---
Easy out here.
---
You're stumbling into the ruins of the Enclave, discovering it to still be semi functional and decide to gather intel while acting as a double agent just waiting for your chance to dismantle them from within.
---
I legit got mad when we failed one, and he cried. Douches. Making Graham cry. Wtf
---
There haven't been Tracie of Excavator headlamps for a while: most of the post-Fallout 4 content is unfinished
---
Nope never ruined my sticks I do it all the time in gta v
---
Yep that and unicorn tears and a kiss from a 17 year old virgin from Leeds
---
PM’d you
---
I remember those days, when you did find someone, they were another player and either shoot at you, pantomime, or if your lucky, they have a mic and tell you all about raping your mom in a shreiky voice.  Give me NPCs anyday
---
This week seems to be Unstoppable week with regards to the daily offering. 
---
We've had;
---
Grognak
---
Silver Shroud 
---
Manta Man
---
Who's left?
---
Is it specific pieces or prefixes or what?
---
*shakes fist*
---
Just like you also could have skipped this post
---
Although that is very true, you dont need 3 lcokpicking or hacking cards equipped when your killing mole miners, what I like to do is never have any of these cards equipped until I'm actually picking or hacking, saves 3 points in perception and intelligence respectively which can be used on perks that increase my damage or survivability
---
They do go to the top?
---
I think it can be any pice but it needs to be “reduced Damege while blocking by 15%”
---
I've been joining the event team simply because this is the first I've heard that the INT boost is actually better and I'm too stupid to work it out myself 😅
---
thanks for quick bash idea quicker than putting it away
---
I've been getting this annoying as hell bug reccently: they've been showing up randomly and there will be like 20 or more of them. I was in Charleston and then just kept showing up over and over again. Got a ton of meat though
---
On xbox I have seen ppl build there camp over the drum to start prim cuts in the forest area. Then event starts and they just do whatever they want and no participation at all just farming others work. WTF
---
I don't think so, because I met him and then stopped playing for a while before moving my CAMP and placing his radio.
---
I've raised issue with bethedsa awaiting bot response :)
---
Use this for an idea on price  [https://fed76.info/pricing/](https://fed76.info/pricing/) 
---
This could be worth 20k+ to the right person
---
Use a gun display stand a chair of choice.
---
I ran into him just north of the bed and breakfast place, by happenstance.
---
..... You know... If you spawn next to fissure and keep jumping in... On the 4th-6th attempt you'll fall down and not die,  think the kill spot doesn't register if you rush it. Ps4 BTW have fallen down a few.. Getting out the hard part XD
---
Ghouls. I'm sorry, those fuckers aren't designed to be shot at without fallout 4 vats. They just move around too much and dive and roll and it's impossible to land a shot when they get close up to you. You just have to tank the damage and then land a hit
---
His voice lines are nicer than Santatron or Raider Rollectron. He adds a touch of whimsy, I think.
---
Exactly no need to shot anyone. But coming off of a few days grind for ammo supply’s and grabbing nuke codes from officers only fair to blast the guy who stole all that effort from underneath us. Wouldn’t you be salty wasting all that time?
---
Griefers who go into god mode .. I don't care about the floaters, the mole rats .. I don't even care about the charred feral ghouls.. it's the fecking arseholes who exploit the glitches and cheat. They are truly the worst enemy in the game.
---
'massively multiplayer online role-playing game'
---
Literally the definition of fallout 76.
---
On my current camp in Toxic Valley I decided to skip defenses entirely. The only thing that ever gets destroyed is my brahmin. I do have to kill a pair of radscorpions every time I fast travel, but skipping defenses has made my camp much more secure somehow.
---
he wanders around all over. sometimes i see him on one of the catwalks, sometimes hes down by the water, etc. just gotta keep looking
---
The shooting doesn’t need to make sense not everyone has the same mind set when playing fallout.
---
And brag about it
---
Santatron’s horror at what humanity has done is funny in a macabre kind of way.
---
It’s not massive by any stretch of the imagination...
---
And by its own definition it’s a multiplayer action rpg.
---
Prob also that lol.
---
Tato Soup gives +10, it is non craftable but the communist collectron gets it sometimes as well it spawning in the world, I don't know if it's marked to benefit from herbivoire
---
What the fuck are the woopsies lol
---
It is. Fasnacht Collectron's insistence on burning old man winter is kind of funny too. But it's the music that I find endearing.
---
Yeah i bought 5 keycards (that’s half of my total caps) from grahm and I’ve activated it 3 times so far. Two times, people don’t even have the decency to activate the pylons so I had to activate 3 of them myself before dying and repeating.
---
I don’t have fallout 1st and none of my friends play the game. Why did I even bother to spend my own hard earned caps for these people
---
I keep finding people with aquaboy hiding on the bottom of the pond just below the little cliff. 
---
They seem to think they are sneaky and nobody will see them but YOU HAVE YELLOW ARROWS HOVERING ABOVE YOUR HEAD!!  Just afk on something that adds to the meter for crying out loud.
---
to start the "A colossal problem" event
---
Me personally, its ticks, it's the worst since I'm a melee build and they move at mach 5 speeds and most of the time they are diseased so by the time they're dead I have flap limb, snot ear and parasites.
---
I wish people didn't hurl fifteen tons of explosives at me like they're shitty that I'm 'AFK-ing', I was literally just at the same SBQ fight they were two seconds ago.... I literally just started bangin' away cool your jets sheesh!
---
Meanwhile, I want all six drums and spits taken by AFK kids as the event just pisses by if they're all occupied. I don't care who does what as this event has been maxxed within the first minute all weekend. 
---
My beef is with the primal cuts though... God I've lost more than a few to missing critters and timers running out. Shits me right off.
---
I play the game on mute... but how do you know it’s PS4 players?
---
Downvote because straight up I ain’t have 70+ weight took up from my weapons that suit my character
---
Ohio river has 2 small rep rewards for raiders you can do but only randoms for the rest.
---
Neither do I?
---
My weapons take up maybe 20 lbs?
---
Dont you have to type in the name of the character you want to delete? Unless they almost have the same name I dont see how this can happen.
---
I'm a shotgunner. 1 shot to the legs with my +50% to limbs shotgun and they go to robot hell.
---
Are you attempting to say that every game that has other players and needs internet is an mmo? Because if not you don’t have an argument. I suppose gta online and red dead online are mmo’s in your mind as well...
---
Other than the fact everything else has a weight reduction perk, except that one type of weapon. Especially when you look at a hunting rifle weighing more than a gauss rifle it’s just bewildering
---
Another way to look at it  - animals do have predictable patterns of behavior.
---
Because 76 isn't cross platform
---
My weapons takes downwards of 10kg of my carry if not less while using bear arms 3. That’s 90% weight reduction
---
Beckett is so much better. He talks about how happy he is having his own bar, how grateful he is for his new life out of the raiders and tells me he likes my camp. 
---
And he shotguns critters who come into my camp.
---
He’s a keeper.
---
Same.
---
A lot better saving that carry weight than have strong back take up 5 points for 50+ carry weight
---
Dude is full of shit. He knows exactly what's going on. Just wanted to humblebrag but is obviously insincere with the humble part.
---
My main characters camp never gets attacked no matter where I build. My new character however, gets attacked constantly at camp.
---
I'd like to see a giant Dobson fly or helgramite, those things are the stuff of nightmares
---
Cause then when I load in 5 mins from the event start and try to join my spot is taken my some rubberband boy
---
Why does there need to be a direct counter for every attack type? There should be some things in the game that people are vulnerable to or is difficult or you need to make a mutually exclusive choice to not be affected by it.
---
I haven't run out of honey since I originally took that quest.  It's a simple talk to Sweetwater, accept, then turn around and give him his honey - every day.  Easiest quest ever.
---
Same.  Soon as I see event and get there the event is over.  No chance to do anything and I feel like a tool for showing up and getting unearned rewards.  Some of the fun of the event  is getting the stuff, actually doing things.  Why the rush when there are enough people?
---
I place rugs down on the floor of the bunker and they don’t seem to float. Then I can place whatever above them and it’s fine but understandable statement
---
Uranium fever collect everything scrap for steel and excavator PA farm lucky hole mine for lead ore then acid and cloth to make gun powder all set. I always have plenty of ammo.
---
I agree this is needed and it's a basic and **expected** feature for this kind of online game. It should be possible to select items, not just caps for an item, on both sides, lock the trade, then both approve the trade. Systems like that have been used for well over a decade in MMOs so there is no excuse not to have it in FO 76.
---
Yeah, Kings are really tough, which is nice. Tougher than a  bunch of legendary baddies.
---
you trade in 20 per day for 200 gold and buy everything all gold vendors sell
---
Pisses me off. I buy shit from the atom shop, like that bundle with the garage door and it turns out that I need to buy that stupid prefab garage for 500 atoms to even use my first purchase. We should’ve gotten it for free given the fact some of us bought the bundle just for the garage door. I can’t put in a ticket every time they mess up cause this isn’t the first time they’ve made me waste my atoms.
---
End of rant, sorry
---
this is the correct answer. many times, there are things within our structures we "finagle" in to place, which only work in that instance BEFORE we stack other things on top. when trying to place the whole thing at once, its too much. get over having to rebuild, its what you have to do.
---
I'm just here to rep the Order if Mysteries.
---
I do AFK on the spits, too, so I'm contributing. But I think the leeches are not only not contributing, but they are the ones causing the event to fail if there are more than a few of them. My impression of the event mechanics (please correct me if I'm wrong) is that the bar deteriorates the faster, the more people are at the event. So if four or five people are doing **nothing** it may fail even if all the others work their asses off, AFK or not.
---
TL;DR: Don't just stand (or hide) there, AFK on drums or spits. If all seats are taken, find another server to AFK on, please.
---
I don't have Strong Back Either.
---
I have 330+ Carry Weight in or out of Power Armor, and my 4 weapons and set of armor weigh about 52 lbs total.
---
It's only massive because everything is online. There's no option for single player offline gameplay.
---
You forgot about the scorpions
---
Wait, were they not account wide? Ffs
---
I always feel like a really angry farmer whenever mole rats attack my camp, going after with them with a shotgun as they always seem to go for my crops and I'm swearing at them profusely.
---
Also fuck Mirelurk Kings.
---
I figured part of the fun is finding those things out on our own.  Can't have everything handed to you.  Why play if it's all laid out?
---
Okay 👌
---
That doesn’t make it massive that makes it online only...
---
Try looking up the genre of Fallout 76 then get back to me.
---
Huh how 🤔 when you delete a character you have to put the characters name in before you can do it
---
Wait for purveyor sale 10-15 September, 50% off
---
I gave up on the Primal Cuts after I had to chase down a fog crawler in the Bog tearing ass away from the event.
---
It's going to take you 240 days to cash them in.
---
If you have 6 people AFKing all the pits and drums then you should never fail the event even with minimal effort, so that sounds like a plus to me.
---
That’s rough I have 225/275 without my excavator maybe more weight I just filled my ass up with fusion cores. But they’re need if you’re a constant pack rat like myself who take everything that isn’t nailed down to sell and scrap. You’ll need weight reduction cards except travailing pharmacy(because who’s really filling their inventory with Chems other than medics and junkie builds)
---
Right. I hope they tell him to fuck right off everytime or block him from inputting support tickets if he starts spamming the support with an issue that isn't an issue, and wasting their time while they could be helping someone who actually has technical issues or lost his char due to a bug (im sure theres plenty of people like that). OP fucked up by his own will because there is no way lag made him input a different char name than what he intended to delete. He in no way deserves to get his character back after willfully deleting it. End of story.
---
Not true, the game will kick you for inactivity even if you are drumming or roasting (at least on console it does).
---
the numbers (assuming they aren't a lie or bugged) are right there you just mouse over the mod at the work bench and see how the numbers change (damage,range, accuracy, weight)
---
the main issue is there is almost always a best mod for what you want to max out (usually damage and range) there are no good choices to be made with lesser mods  
---
would be nice if bleeding and some of the side effects played a bigger role in the game, the engine is 10 years old, hoping they make something completely new for later games
---
If you want to be a heavy gunner, you're going to need a lead farming route.
---
You'll need to restock on lead at least twice a week, depending on activity level.
---
Straight up if there was a rifle reduction perk I’d be ripping my two shot gauss rifle off the wall with my furious/33 vats crit handmade but too heavy
---
This.  Got lucky &amp; a public teammate showed up.  He dropped me 8 diffusers when no one else showed up.  On PC.  Lemme know if you need 3 to just get it done.
---
You can only keep 5,000 gold though. Take your time. Don't waste your gold. Research what's going on with that stuff some of it is absolutely worthless.
---
Exactly, I couldn’t put it better myself, it’s a win win, iv known for people to get scammed hard and just quit the game and cancel there subscriptions and refuse to play the game, if they implement it people will be happy and get what they want and will be happy with what they get and continue to play the game and Bethesda will have more people playing
---
Wait til the next patch and buy huge stacks of lunchboxes. Then bask in the glory of extra xp while you grind your life away for legendary perk cards.
---
I guess so. Completing the event and getting rewards for nothing is the motto of the afker... Just takes the spirit out of it ya know? Like why even play?
---
I don't rush into buying anything out of there. I do my research I watch reviews on YouTube I put an ear here and a discord or two.
---
Same happend to me with my Vampires explosive 50 cal
---
They haven’t even fixed the red rocket garage door when it appears to be closed but actually isn’t
---
I like to think of the Mole Rat as the descendant of the early MMO favorite from Anarchy Online, the Rollerrat. There were everywhere, had a loud distinctive cry when they aggro and could be made into a jaunty hat.
---
To be fair, it could be a lot worse
---
Maybe a robot to make the trades happen. Both parties put in what they want, that way one can't break out of trade and run off.
---
So that's why I solo the first 3 waves, then people start showing up right as the final wave starts... then gets mad that the event failed.  Show up early, so I don't spend so damn long finding and killing every enemy alone.
---
on PC i have seen it complete within a few seconds. people need to afk at least once an hour. lol
---
P.P.P.S. If you were not the one who used the recall card do not start the event early. Wait for enough people to join first so you gave a chance to complete it then let the guy who had the recall card start it.
---
I have no idea if it more people make the bar degrade faster but it degrades pretty fast even if you solo the event which I ended up doing several times last year.  Afk or not, if there are enough people to run all 3 drums and all 3 spits it makes it super easy for just one person to run around and finish the event in like 30-60 seconds.
---
 Not sure why anyone cares if people want to afk on drums or spits.  All it does is make the event quicker and easier.
---
👽
---
Tabitha. But that's a couple hundred years in the future.
---
Mindset? I was talking about the way you wrote the narrative. It didn’t make sense.
---
Did you solve the problem somehow ?
---
I think they stopped that because the NPCs were picking up people's guns especially at radiation rumble.
---
🤦‍♂️🤷‍♂️
---
I've never understood the point of the endgame grind.
---
When this game starts to become a grind, I'll just move on. 
---
What's the goal anyways? You're chasing a legendary weapon by farming an event. Why do you want the legendary weapon? So you can farm the event easier...
---
You're chasing legendary armor, so you can farm more armor more efficiently...
---
There is no point aside from FOMO. Zero need for God tier weapons, when you've been able to beat her just fine in order to get said God tier. 
---
Is it nice to have? Sure. But I fail to see the point in grinding for it, just so I can have an easier time grinding for something else. 
---
If these weapons and armor were required for true endgame content (content that could only be done by those decked out in the best gear) then I could understand the chase, the grind. 
---
But since we don't have that, since you're only grinding so you can put down the Queen or Earle quicker (which just pisses everyone off, instead of impressing them) then yea... I don't bother.
---
That... That is horrible. If I were high level I would offer to speed run you a new guy to get an enjoyable end game character level but me at level 20, I can hook you up with a kick ass bed frame plan, maybe some shiny new 10mm ammo? Some dirty water?
---
Seriously, I would help if I could.
---
Max ammosmith, max super duper, craft gun powder from Acid and cloth, get lead from Charleston fire department, the green lodge in Flatwoods, Silos, monorail elevator. Steel is everywhere. Equip said perks and craft away.
---
Absolutely and it's infuriating. Gatling lasers and plasmas for me. I refuse to do PVP until it's fixed since I'm a big guns build and I get fucked over in fights when my gun decides to stop shooting and reload.
---
Not to mention you then have to scramble to put your weapon away so you dont have a fusion/plasma core in your inventory that's only 1/3 full
---
She was my favorite until I realized that she doesnt stop complaining....EVER. I havent had her in my camp since.
---
Interesting!   Thanks for lmk.
---
What didn’t make sense the fact that I was sitting on my pip boy eating/drinking? He got aggro on my friend by shooting him? I just don’t see what doesn’t make sense to you
---
Can you emote the YMCA?
---
Been using this with the civil war top hat, looks amazing as well.
---
I'll be sure to tell the team to add more of them into the game
---
(this was a joke don't tell at me plz)
---
You dropped it on a public server?
---
I have put about 250 hours in solo and I'm still enjoying it so thats a yes from me.

There’s a hidden entrance next to the manor in the preservation shelters
---
Oh, no chally. No moo moos in this meat cook! ^(human, no tell chally what in meat cook!)
---
 I have a bloodied melee/heavy guns character. When not in PA  I do happen to have 2 pieces of poison resist gear and when in  PA  I simply die if I'm not careful. I don't  have a problem with that. I guess I'm  just curious as to why it was changed
---
I agree, it Is just really frustrating they need to sort it out and people need to nag them otherwise they just won’t do it
---
That is correct those numbers are all there I.E. (Damage, Range, Accuracy, and weight)(sometimes even electricity or radiation damage for the Tesla and the radium rifle). However the things that are not present in either a percentage or a flat rate are armor pen, separate accuracy variants for either hip fire or ADS. and to add onto that there are some modification that are just plain worse even if they are from the same gunsmith, licensed plumber or Makeshift Warrior level requirement. Hense my explanation of the inferior stats still showing better accuracy in some cases than a superior.
---
Solo played for 1000 hours so far. You join teams still and work in events with other players. But not on mics or whatever. Just turn up do it and leave. Perfectly fine to solo the game
---
Gotta get that 7600 hours achievement somehow
---
I feel like people don't even know what to do.  I feel like people don't know what to do in a lot of events.
---
It won’t let me through the gates, I’ve got the veil on but it’s still crossed out
---
The pvp System is pretty much non existent and with the recent patch Wastelanders it is totally enjoyable even when playing alone.  You can achive almost everything solo. The only downside without having Fallout 1st is the junkbox but with some management it will be ok tho. You should go for it.
---
Well... The only way to play it absolutely solo is in your private world, which requires f1st. Else you share the world with several other players.
---
Private worlds are also the only way to completely avoid PvP.
---
thank you for replying to the thread however.
---
(Known) Plans **do** go to the top of the list in regular sort.
---
I forgot to mention I'm on the East coast Eastern standard Time USA.
---
Enemies can wear armor, have resistances, and dr, just like you.
---
And the next week after that... and the next week. Lol Thanks Todd consoles really appreciate this. Oh how about next next next week?
---
Not sure what to suggest first time going in the  wall wouldn’t open to the laser area for me maybe change server or try again later on if you wanted to
---
Does she get any new dialogue lines?
---
Yeah I google most things before I buy them now, just disappointing that they can’t do their due diligence and test things before the sell them/put the right items up for sale at the same time.
---
I think it's worth doing by yourself, but it's going to be difficult without player vending and taking on really difficult enemies.  
---
PVP isn't too much to worry about except when you take workshops.  Even then, there are ways to deal with it.   If you keep the game setting for pvp on "passive", you can still be killed but in 1800 hours, it's only happened to me twice.   It makes you very aware that you shouldn't be carrying more junk than what you can lose.   Besides losing junk, there's really no consequence to dying.  I've also been harassed twice and had to jump servers.   It happens, but pretty rarely.   You're much more apt to run into someone who helps you.  
---
Lately, I've been having a really serious problem with lag.   I don't know if that's true for everyone or not.
---
I mainly play solo, and sometimes i have to remind myself im in a multiplayer game. Unless im going to an event, I'll never see anyone
---
You and remove and use items after you cancel but you cannot add to it
---
No. You keep the scrapbox and everything in it you just can't add any more after fo1st runs out
---
I play solo.
---
The new group system is cool
---
The true jerks are the people who do nothing productive during the 2 minute event warmup. They thumbs down emote and shoot the people drumming or turning the meat. Not realizing that these people are doing half the event work before it even really starts.
---
They would need to fix the regular door bug that has been doing that forever too, so don't get your hopes up.
---
That’s dumb, they made the garage door forever ago
---
You can still build scrapbox and takę scrao from it.
---
But you cant put anything in it when 1st is over.
---
Crafting items and building normalny uses scrap from scrapbox when 1st is over so you dont have to takę stuff out.
---
Oh? That really works?? Ill try that next time ^^
---
I’ve tried restarting to see if that’ll help but it’s not the first time it’s done this, since the patch update it just doesn’t want to work 🤔
---
Well you just created yourself a real level up challenge and now you're giving up? Tasked failed successfully
---
From a weight perspective Easier to have huge stack of 50 cal bullets than extra guns.
---
Are you on Xbox? I could let you into my private and see if it works for you?
---
I mostly play solo, but teaming up with people is so easy and beneficial now that's it's hard not to team up.
---
Yeah, I’ve just loaded back in I’ll see if it works now first if not would you mind? Cause if it’s a patch problem I’d rather let them know ☺️
---
I did this a while back, so it's possible that it changed. I bought a year membership recently so I can't say for sure. But when my membership ended I was still able to build/craft all the 1st items (outfits, scrapbox, etc). I couldn't put more junk in the scrapbox after the membership expired, but any junk that was already in it stays in it (it's not moved to your stash or deleted, and I could still use it while crafting and building).
---
As I understand it there are still level ceilings depending on region, just as there are now - a camp in the Forrest / ah heap or toxic valley will still get level 20ish enemies. Level 75 appears to be a new high in areas without level limits though.
---
I just won't trade if I don't know them and they won't drop first.   I'd use the FB courier system, but I'm finished with FB.   Plus, there have been people known to steal courier identities.   I really wish they had a two-factor approval system!
---
That's why you use the trade system for high value items. You are taking that risk if not. I lost a bunch of scrap and flux like that because the server crashed about a year ago, it sucks but it can be avoided too.
---
Think about all the time you wasted lmao!
---
Perhaps, I remember seeing a video of a person's ally wrecking havoc with minigun tho, it was pretty good. Too bad you can't do it anymore then 😔
---
🥧
---
No problem happy to help out someone know how frustrating it can be when I first picked this up on gamepass I decided to just buy fo1st for a month and I couldn’t get into the taxidermy in lewisburg for ages
---
I hope they fix it in a hotfix prior to the patch 22. Sorry it stops your progression :/ It must suck being locked out of all there treasury notes you could earn
---
First thing I do at the meat cook is always give Chally her special feed since I have all the ingredients sitting at my camp. I'd do it anyway, but hearing how happy it makes Grahm when you feed Chally makes it even more worth it.
---
Because many enemies have amazing explosive damage resistance, rendering missile and grenade launchers next to useless.
---
You can take away but can't add more until you pay again.
---
Bit of an exaggeration there.  I highly doubt half the population is made up of grind bots.  What you just described sounds worse that a job I had digging holes.  I hope they'll listen to the literally hundreds of posts asking to soften the grind.  Turn it off.  Put on your mask &amp; go outside.  It's time.
---
Well that sucks, i thought i finally had a proper legendary gun
---
why not include the entire quote?

„set to appear AS PLUSHIE FORM ...“

Let me help you:
---
MMO = Massive Multiplayer Online.
---
Fallout 76 is a Multiplayer game, so second M is checked. We can agrue how many people needs to be online in the same time to be Massive...
---
Also, it is an Online game, so the O part is checked...
---
Yeah, RDD online, and GTA online are MMO games to. Not MMORPG, like WoW, SWTOR, etc, they are different gender.
---
Tell us, what is the meaning of MMO in your head.
---
it says they‘re to appear as plushie form.
---
Yup. I gave up trying to solo the event this time around. Have you had any luck with that?
---
You guys are being attacked??
---
Muh exp
---
Strong Back is among the worst carry weight Perks. 3 points of Bear Arms or Travelling Pharmacy can save you several hundred points of weight
---
Damn right this man right here knows it. Except that travelling pharmacy need to lean off the chems ;)
---
Once I've got enough for all the SS mods I'll ever use I'll stop doing them too. But heck between the notes and the XP, if they'll let me finish even 75% of the cuts events I go to- I'll take it.
---
Beats doing Ward's bogus ass quests....
---
Okay bethdrone

It's the universe saying...

I heard Outer Worlds is good

It’s not my head you have to convince it’s the game’s creators, the video game industry that set a standard for what game is in each genre, and the other creators that make online only games that aren’t mmo’s either. Red dead and gta online are not mmo’s and the fact that you think they are shows you have no business in this conversation. So in reality you need to help yourself because I’m your mind quite a few games have been added to the mmo category.
---
Beth ain’t here. Just us degenerate complainers.
---
One of my characters uses a Vampire's ffr double barrel as their main weapon, and another keeps a Gauss shotgun for crowd control. They're better for support builds using Enforcer, and these kinds of builds are still uncommon
---
It's okay man, happens to the best of us. Nothing to be ashamed of
---
I feel so bad for you after all that time you put in
---
Maybe try reinstalling.
---
People never trade anymore because not a lot of people need Caps anymore, and there's no way to safely trade an item for an item.
---
Oooooh boy, you're at THAT part of the game, get ready for your new part time job
---
Lol, people actually AFK this shit over night? That's kinda pathetic, right there.
---
I always redo my camp. Its like moving to a new house, gotta keep it fresh.
---
Ha ha. Salty duper downvoted you lmao
---
Lemme just fix that...
---
Health bar rubber banding has been terrible for many months with shotguns making them basically unplayable. Apparently the BoS update will fix the problem.
---
hahah I heard that too! im just too broke to buy It sadly
---
I’ve already explained. You left out an important part in your timeline when he stole the launch. 
---
Relax. 
---
Move on.
---
How are they not timing out and disconnecting?
---
How does bashing help w a flame attack? Have I been completely misunderstanding the bash characteristic?!
---
I actually love the quirkiness of the mode with all the hackers. I’ve regularly won against hackers simply because hackers are generally all that survive to the end and in their attempt to win by hacking better against the other remaining hackers, they make dumb mistakes like failing to avoid grenades or tops of buildings.
---
I'll definitely do that if the problem isn't fixed later. I just uploaded all my data to the online storage just in case
---
Yeah I guess you’re right. I mean nothing is safe being I got scammed of 2 guns a month back on market. But damn I just want plan and idc I’ll do courier if I have to. I know as soon as I get plan tho it would drop
---
God, dude, I hate the mosquitoes. My aim sucks so the fact it's a flying stick figure makes my life hell
---
Oh no I don’t like the sound of that
---
It feels weird to be a PC player and see all those posts, use the search functionality for fuck's sake
---
For real definitely try it solo and you'll like it.
---
I feel I can speak for the PS4 community anyways when I say you'll have way more fun on public server. 
---
I did the quest lines solo of course, as they're easy.
---
But don't be afraid to team up! It's WAY more rewarding when you find a group and run some stuff, especially the harder events.
---
This is very true
---
I don’t think downvoting is the toxic part. I don’t mind a downvote. Some people are just super defensive and/or rude about this game. I had one dude attack me cause I said it would be nice to have double sided wallpaper and he said I need to play a different game cause there’s more important stuff to fix rather than adding stuff to the atom shop.
---
I feel like you are equating MMO to MMORPG (World of Warcraft-esque), which this obviously is not. It is, however, a multiplayer/online game. Massive, maybe, maybe not. It is an MMO.
---
radscorpions are worse
---
It's rough, but try to be patient. There's still 3 more days left for this Meat Week, and we'll be getting another "serving" at the end of September.
---
Only my magic heavies don't work apparently.
---
Enter 3rd person and wrap a rubber band around the right analogue stick to keep the camera spinning and the game thinks your playing.
---
My camp is always attacked when I TP in. The enemies that spawn are legendary sheepsquatch, sentrybot, , liberators, super mutants, ghouls, giant sloth, and goddamn floaters. The legendary sheepsquatch is what usually spawns the most frequent, and HMG turrets doesn’t do enough damage, so I had to use the rocket turret for defense. 
---
Haven’t had any problems in base defense aside of those goddamn floaters which somehow always destroys all my turrets.
---
Yeah let's just hang on till september's patch.
---
Still can't hang shit in the Backwoods camper either. Edging closer to my first ever refund request. 
---
When I bought it you could mount stuff to the walls inside around the stairs and near the door. Now it all just melts and sinks onto the wall you're trying to place it on. 
---
Breaks my heart. I love the ATX prefabs but goddam do they fuck them up sometimes. It's worse with backwoods as it was *released* working, and since been completely cocked.
---
Huh, would have never thought of that.
---
This happens occasionally, it was an issue last year too. If you hit 2 mins past the hour and it hasn’t started, it isn’t going to. You can try and server hop and get into one where it worked.
---
Definitely. I can blow out the kneecap of that level 91 Deathclaw in hopewell cave with a few shotgun blasts and run circles around it laughing before I just swipe it to death with my 3-star mole minor gauntlet. But run into a mirelurk king in the mire and I annihilate half my ammo and armor, break 2 or 3 guns, and get an irl assailt to my eardrums.
---
dude i work at a “pre packaged concrete mix” plant and i felt this hard during the concrete phase. we had truck after truck leaving the factory loaded and i’m like “the brotherhood fucking needs this”
---
It would need to be massive in order to be an mmo not maybe massive... however it is classified as an rpg so you’re off on two fronts. 
---
And no I’m not the one confused with the game’s genre so you should take it up with Bethesda if you still don’t agree because they do not consider this an mmo.
---
*muffled grunts*
---
How is it possible? Bethesda, that's how.
---
You came to my post acting like a douche saying “pacifist mode” but Not at one point did I moan about pvp or fighting another player. Even if I had pacifist mode on he would have still been able to launch the nuke. You insisted on bullets not doing the damage ignoring the point of the my nuke being stole and focused on the shooting and combat.
---
you literally asked how did he steal my launch on the last question to me that someone else answered.
---
Lol. My intelligence decrease is proportional to the amount of lead I use to make .45 ammo. Lol.
---
Hmmm just checked mine and it’s still 50. Maybe submit a ticket
---
Thank you all for answers!
---
Why?
---
I get 6-10 meat weeks completed with zero effort plus I'm contributing to each event.
---
Yea I got a Bloodied 1\* and decided it was just too heavy to carry around even without upgrading the 5 salt shakers.
---
Partly because a full Heath furious heavy gunner build and a Bloodied commando build require *totally* different builds and play styles, and partly because it’s a good challenge to complete the entirety of the main game, including launching a nuke then doing enough damage to get Queen loot is a good challenge.
---
I think you need nuked flora. The stable stuff.
---
Be cool if you get like a 100 atoms per level. Nightwave from Warframe does something similar to that.
---
The game's still not ready to be out of BETA, no matter what they say
---
Upset bcs I discovered that in the worst way possible. And yeah, no more dropping items 4 me
---
OK thanks, I better start 😊
---
FRITZL'S BASEMENT. 😲
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritzl_case
---
I'm thinking about it now and feel sad 😭
---
I like Beckett, I just wish his bar wasnt so big
---
Its bugged right now, the quest is supposedly working on the PTS but no word on a hotfix as of yet.
---
As someone who played the first 70 levels solo, it can absolutely be played mostly solo.  But I do recommend joining Public Build teams.  The added XP helps and doing things in a group (even though you're playing solo) helps with team objectives.  Most public building teams don't expect you to do things as a team, so you can still play solo and use the benefits of playing on a team, like having more free fast travel points across the map.
---
i’m still somewhere in the mid 80’s lol
---
&gt; I thought salt was NaCl.
---
It is table salt, indeed. However, in chemistry, there are many different salts.
---
My favorite salt, being Finnish, is of course NH4Cl (ammonium chloride).
---
That flying jump rush is a real dick move
---
I had 300 shots loaded into my automatic tesla rifle. krakakakakakakakakakakakakakakakakakakakakakakakakakakakakakakaka!
---
Just don't think it's god mode... Once you leave it, can't go back in xD
---
I have the SS jet pack on my three characters, I tried the gauss stuff but prefer my hand made, I have the dirt tiles but honestly I wish I could sell treasury notes and bullion to vendors or players, just don't want any of that other stuff.
---
How have you put in 1k hours and not gotten bored? Once I explored the whole map and did every quest I only get on for my daily challenges.
---
I'd rather see Bethesda get more creative like they did with the cryptids, and not just add creatures from previous games. 
---
If they are going to though...
---
I'd love to see  a explaination for it be implemented in-game. A sizeable pre-war military facility and/or a hidden West Tek facility inserted into one of the empty parts of the map could serve as the origin point for new and returning creatures going forward. Parts of the facility could open up whenever something new has been added, with some accompanying lore. It could retroactively explain why floaters appeared and perhaps even provide give an origin point for Deathclaws and (Naked) Molerats being present on the East Coast. This could be applied to the Wanamingo as well.
---
i was trying to craft unyielding thorn after 20 server hops for steel and not a single unyielding I gave up on this idea 😂
---
If your camp is on the side of a cliff, build a basic cooking stove with the cement blocks facing the edge of the floor. When she gets up from it she’ll fall and take 45 minutes to walk up the side of the mountain again. Keeps her quiet.
---
you get points for the bar, for the full 2 mins on drums/spits, While " the waiting for the cookout start" if 6 people are on them it will be half complete when the actual cookout stars.
---
Grafton: Sold by vendor bot Greg.
---
Harpers Ferry: Sold by vendor bot Wallace.
---
Watoga station: Sold by Watoga vendor bot.
---
The Whitespring Resort: Sold by some of the faction vendors: the Free States vendor and the shopping mall vendor.
---
I found that it doesn't allow me to drop certain items.  I assume those are required for later.  Storing/dropping the notes made it so much easier to find plans/recipes in my inventory.
---
 Graham sells them on the regular.
---
I’ll see you in 2021
---
Well that’s not nice...
---
Rep grinding, SCORE grinding, Scrip grinding, Bullion grinding, BoS material grinding. Yeah I hear the OP it's getting silly. There should be a weekly not daily cap on bullion and Scrip too, I don't want/have time to play every day, I want to grind it all out on a Saturday morning when I do. I dislike being compelled to play every single day in the hope you will buy overpriced crap from the Atom store. Not that I can play since Patch 21 which seems to have broken the game, loads of lag and loading screens taking 5 minutes +
---
Alright cool I'll take a look.
---
No they don’t. They’re bullshitting you.
---
if it's not for caps from my vendor or another vendor I just pretend it doesn't exist unless I just get it from the purveyor. No faith in anyone around trading in this game.
---
The Quack looks similarly awesome with the "Umpire of the Apocalypse" (totally not diamond city security)
---
Does he wander or is there a set location for him?
---
&gt; How is it okay for Bethesda to continue selling broken and incomplete products? 
---
Because some people are insistent on giving Bethesda money regardless of the quality they get in return and defend their 'right' to ~~spend~~ waste their money till the end. A bit like simps....but for a big company.
---
This too. I’ve seen it from Grahm a bunch during the cookouts.
---
i've been running a shotgun build since i started playing, around four months ago? and i do experience the rubberbanding health bar issue but to be honest it isn't as bad as people make out. i still do plenty of damage and the build is far from unplayable. i say go for it, if you're interested!
---
Dealing with the same thing on my alt
---
Changing my build. Running events. Meat week right now. Trading. Helping bother players.
---
Absolutely I'd be salty but it's a game mechanic so like many things in this online game we are interacting with other real people, and the world of gaming has its fair share of dicks.
---
Props for running the silo the proper way though, inc the code pieces. I now just glitch through a wall and cut out everything except the final launch prep, lost interest in running the whole thing a while ago.
---
server hop the mega sloth spawn in the mire south of mosstown i think it’s called. i have over 1k screws from grinding that for a few hours.
---
Sweet. I'll let him know, we've been farming that even for a bit but I never thought about talking to him lmao.
---
He’s SW of Vault 76 for Meat Week until Wednesday
---
Definitely asshole players. Nothing ruins my day more than some griefer piece of shit eslecially all these jack wads who are booby trapping their vendors lately.
---
Thanks for your help, both of you.
---
True, but I'm not upset by such posts and enjoy leaving my thoughts, you did get a upvote from me though, so there's that 👍
---
My apologies but it’s hella annoying having to run the silo again I don’t want to fight enemy’s that give me Bs loot and exp just to finish the mission I should have already finished that and I don’t want to have to take another 2 levels of hacking just to make it faster
---
This game was advertised as having survival-lite elements (and these are survival lite elements) 
---
Why did you buy/play a game that was advertised with these systems?
---
why would you subject yourself to something you dont enjoy?
---
I turned off voices entirely between my ally and Zax.
---
lol fake
---
All those downvoting this really just need to understand the logic. If you see something in the title of a post that you don't want to pursue, ignore it, simple really.
---
Yeah this happens to me sometimes. Once inhad a 180 round mag for my combat shotgun haha. Once you use the 180 bullets it should just go back to normal
---
You sound pretty salty
---
 I would humble brag on reddit personally! =)
---
Lost interest isn’t how I’d put it my interest is dead in the water after it honestly feels like someone killed my puppy...
---
What?
---
Not gonna lie, I adore mole minors. Theyre pretty easy to kill with a good shotgun or cannibalistic mole minor gauntlet and theyre just hilarious, grumpy fucks all the time. GTFO of their mine space if you don't like 'em! 😜
---
have u checked npc vendor near sbq fissure site, at the train station, found mine there, and always was there even after many server hopps
---
Take it up with the ratings board and Bethesda itself if you still disagree with the official genre of this game.
---
Yeah, but I don’t think anybody get it. It’s possible , sure but the probability is low since all of the players was doing the Grahm event and nobody was in that area.
---
Both of my characters have the exact same name. Luckily I'm not planning on deleting either any time soon
---
As said above a robot or drop locker. Both have a terminal. Item goes in. You put your handle in and to whom it is for and how long it holds till it goes back to you.  You are given a receipt number. And say a 3 digital code. That code goes to the other trader. Win win.
---
They can barely get their patches right or fix day one bugs and you want them to color code shit? Come on now lol
---
If you were on PS4 I'd make sure you had backup. Sorry to hear this, mate.
---
Available in the Atom store buried in a Bundle at some point for 1200 atoms.
---
i still haven’t maxed my rep with either faction yet. i’m a flake. rocksy is not impressed.
---
One of the vendors at the whitespring sells the plan regardless of level.
---
I'll take a look
---
My ammo sells like hotcakes, even .38 rounds, for some reason.  Every time I restock, it gets bought out - and I'm talking 1000+ rounds.  Maybe it's because I'm located in Helvetia?
---
Happy cake day and you weren’t negative about it you gave a suggestion don’t know why so many downvoted not as bad as the other guy
---
I know scammers just ruin the game for everyone
---
Happy cake day. 🤸 Yeah the setup does leave us between a rock and a hard place when we have what we want.
---
I was joining one event and the area still hadn't loaded for me, and I was far away, but I could see FOUR downed players and I was wondering what the fuck is over there man.
---
Prime Scorpions, like 5 of them. Those poor 76ers didn't stand a chance.
---
FWIW, I tried to put a porcelain one in a standard display case (along with the wood and metal one).  
---
Fail.  Did not even show up as an option, even though I had at least 4 in my inventory.
---
🍆🍑🤪
---
I hope they do do something about it
---
i have a mixed bag of unyielding pieces but will eventually start the secret service grind.
---
It doesn’t help. It’s really a useless 3rd Star. Unless you have the  friendly fire perk equipped. Friendly Fire is glitched (shocking I know) so the actual flame doesn’t heal allies or friendly mobs like the shishkebab does. You have to bash with your flamer to heal with the friendly fire perk so then the 40% bashing damage actually increases the healing effect. So if you saw someone hitting the robots at Fasnacht or the cows in Home Range they’re healing them to increase rewards or survivability.
---
So is that our character’s goal?
---
I have hearing issues and this was annoying
---
When you go into crafting ultracite ammo and highlight 2mm Ec it should display what you need.
---
Not exactly. When a limb does get crippled you do get staggered, however a  high endurance stat will significantly reduce the chance of this occuring outside of fights with other players. I can't remember the last time my character had a crippled limb.
---
Several other things will stagger the player character though. The most common culprits are heavy hitting enemy melee attacks. A Colossal Problem highlights this, as the Wendigo Spawn will constantly stagger you whenever they get up close. Yao Guai and Feral Ghouls also come to mind as big offenders.
---
You need to learn the prime plan for the Gauss rifle first for some reason. It's kinda weird about it.
---
but excavator armor looks so badass.
---
It's seemingly a 20% chance to get a "Rare" drop, with an equal chance of it being any of the following:
---
* Blue Ridge Caravan outfit
---
* Blueridge Caravan gas mask
---
* Plan: Blue Ridge Caravan backpack 
---
* Plan: Blue Ridge Caravan flag
---
I was already not a fan of making alts before Wastelanders, that update basically guaranteed I never will.
---
The on,y thing that *maybe might possibly make me think about considering* changing my mind is if they make plan knowledge account wide rather than character based. I have too many event and limited time plans learned on my main to ever consider making an alt.
---
You need the learn the plan for the guass rifle prime capacitor before you can make 2mm emc rounds.
---
Thanks! It's weird people pay 10k caps for the flag, when it's not even that rare
---
I have the Electrically Charged mutation. Molerats may get a couple bites but it's highly satisfying when my mutation triggers
---
I switched to shotgun a few weeks ago and it was the best decision I have made. I have almost never seen the rubberbanding health,  not as common as I expected. 
---
However there are other issues,  for example my gun will often get "stuck" and I have to fire an extra shot or I can't do anything else,  like can't heal,  can't reload etc.  Also when I first log on I have to switch to another weapon and then back to my shotgun or the gun won't fire. 
---
The have to fire an extra shot to be able to do anything else is the most annoying since it can happen any time and wastes a bullet.
---
Even if you don't agree, Fallout 76 is an MMO. While the massive part is debatable because I don't know the exact playerbase numbers, it is both multiplayer and online. It is an RPG because you make a character and you role-play that character's choices in the world.
---
You have made two separate comments about this now. Why?
---
Rads scorpions are worse, so are plague rats because they are hard to shoot and end up giving you a disease before you out them down, provided you saw them coming.
---
The only problem I have with food is that it spoiks too quickly.
---
I'm fine with having to eat and deink, but cooked foods shouldn't spoil. Grinding consumables is what isn't fun, not eating itself. I want to craft a hundred cranbelly relish and have them last me all week, but can't because cooked food spoils just as quickly as prime ingredients, that's what's stupid with the survival aspect of the game.
---
This game is worth any cap you spend on it.
---
Try just removing defenses all together. I have my camp built right next to a floater spawn. When I had turrets, they would Argo the mobs and I’d be repairing constantly. I removed them ( camp in same spot, no other changes) and I haven’t repaired in weeks.
---
It would be cool if we had a reading post that we could put down at our camp. The trade wouldn't go through without both sides agreeing.
---
There is a bye emote and it costs money in the atom shop
---
One wasn’t showing up for me so it didn’t look like it posted.
---
Back to the point it’s not me who disagrees with the official genre of the game it’s you people. Again take it up with Bethesda and the ratings board if you’re upset about being wrong.
---
Unless my life spins apart, and I all of a sudden have a shit load of free time on my hands, I won’t either. I will start any other Bethesda game over a thousand times over, but for the grind in this game it’s just easier to respec my current character and still keep all my plans. It was actually a LOT of fun in the beginning when the game released, but I just don’t see me having the time I had then with that passion to want to 100% an online game
---
BuT tExT cHAt WouLd Be In UnImMeRsIVe
---
Bug-thes-duh hasn't fixed this visual glitch.
---
 I've heard server hopping helps but I don't quite know, i saw the glitch and have avoided CAMP skins since then. Best of luck out there Wastelander!
---
I wish you could somehow bank the S.C.O.R.E. you earn after the run is complete and you could choose to spend it on Atoms or spaces on future boards. 
---
That way if there were some kind of banking system they could also potentially retroactively add autocompleted S.C.O.R.E. to it for people who have lost it. I dunno, just an idea.
---
If it is a “magic” shotgun,  no problem use vats.  If it is not, then it rubbers band almost all the health.
---
Because Bethesda hates deaf people
---
It's totally solo friendly.
---
Switch to pacifist mode in options and PVP will be a thing of the past.
---
There's Nuclear Winter which is a Battle Royale basically if you want to scratch that PVP hitch, otherwise is all adventure and good times.
---
Keep your mic at hand since there's alot of high level players (myself included, but on PC) that usually helps low level players and sometimes they do ask you if you want/need something.
---
Have fun!
---
It's a great event.  Though like everything with the game it's plagued by bugs.  I once died and respawned in the forest.  Another guy did too and we both looked at eachother like wtf XD
---
I agree with the scrap box being for everyone now. They could do/give something else to the 1st members and lift a burden for everyone else with the scrap box. I also think the NV combine system would be pretty cool again.
---
The rest...not so much.
---
Survival elements were in previous titles on harder difficulties. They even tuned it down from the previous titles, unless you have parasites. 
---
The weight management in this game has gotten better. Bobbypins used to weigh .1 so you'd constantly have to be selling or dropping them to shave weight. Not to mention there are either perk cards, armor, or backpacks that can reduce the weight of every single category in the game. Furthermore, at launch we had 400 stash weight with no tweaks, no backpacks, and no scrap box yet...that was fun. 
---
I also think they have said they will be reducing or removing the hunger and thirst part of the game. I dont know why this change is coming over 2 years into its life but it is (at least it was) supposed to happen. 
---
I know some of the things I mentioned are "food build" but isn't that what this game is about? If you want to run a pure build you have to give up some QOL elements like reduced overall weight that other builds may enjoy. The other builds give up the last few drops of damage and usually some of the survivability.
---
I agree. I get the “rubber banding” with the shotgun less frequently than I get the “first hit doesn’t register” with other weapons. All weapons have their quirks.
---
Considering it's 25% of 20% to get it, meaning 5% chance of getting the Flag, that's pretty rare.
---
With the vault dweller is a mutually beneficial relationship.
---
lead from lucky hole mine.  (Run it in excavator )  If you find all the nodes, you'll come out with about 600 lead ore. 
---
ammosmith2 when crafting gets you 180 rounds per.
---
Months ago they release wastelanders, which i will say i enjoyed and thought was pretty good. But wastelanders also introduced multiple, deeply unsatisfying grinds. Then they drop SCORE as well, and set everything up so if you really want to make meaningful progress you need to log on every day but only for like half an hour. 
---
It's all so cynical and gross. I went from really rooting hard for this game to become good to realizing what Bethesda's vision for 76 actually is. 
---
Very disappointing but I still do have some fun with it, so I'm not going away completely
---
finished it and scrapped that shit, better with a private bar stand hehe
---
All the free states players income across are the most friendly.
---
And as a commie DIE
---
Using a shotgun build is like playing the game on “easy mode”. Not to mention you can max out the build at level 55.
---
*President Richardson.
---
What makes you say this ? Did this happen last year ?
---
OK I'll do that, although most people now have thousands of these things unless you hardly play at all.
---
Where can you get that hat I’m trying to get a pirate adthetic
---
marsupial laughs in their faces on the daily
---
🥺🐶
---
I use 1 piece of chameleon armor and one piece with H2D...
---
I plod along in this game but have been looking recently at trading some stuff now that I have caps to buy better weapons and armour etc...
---
But oit if interest, how is it that you get scammed in trades? Sorry if its a stupid question... just need to know before I become the next victim!
---
Rad Barrel can be placed in your camp. Someone with the plan can place it in your camp. If you’re on Xbox I can get you one tomorrow, just make sure to not scrap it until you can build your own. 
---
It gets you 30 rads per use and can be used until you get to where you need to be.
---
Theyre pretty good compared to other things
---
😭 miss you rover
---
Yeah. It should be more clear...you need the original Gauss Rifle prime receiver
---
If you’re anything like me, I bought FO1 for a month and stockpiled like crazy. The scrapper perk card is your best friend for a month and you’ll realise how quickly steel, plastic and wood can accumulate, without worrying about forever bulking, selling and managing your stash again. Even stable flux can go in there. 
---
I wasn’t particularly interested in a private server or even the survival tent, but be warned... you will probably miss those 2 more than you think if you cancel!! I know I did.
---
She'll drop all vanilla weapons regardless of knowing the plans or not.
---
No, it's ANY base game weapon (with a few exceptions like the Drill or Alien Blaster), plus any learned plans from updates.
---
Yeah it was "Meat Week, the Second Helping" or something like that
---
I don’t even think that event worked perfectly either.  I remember reports of  people killing those unique Mole Miners and they didn’t drop pails for some reason.  I know I had it happen a few times.
---
When every piece of new content gets delayed it’s honestly hard to ever get excited for anything anymore.  I also find it difficult to even believe Bethesda when they give an initial date for something given their track record.  It sucks to always expect for something to get delayed.
---
I’m optimistically hopeful about Daily Ops.  There’s a lot of potential, just like the game entirely.  I just fear it’ll become a pointless activity once you get the valuable plans.  Correct me if I’m wrong but it looks like they can reward the old Survival Mode weapons.  I saw something with the Assault Rifle (Whistle in the Darkness I think it’s called?).  Bottom line is it’s a Nocturnal Assault Rifle - a weapon no one wants.  And most of the weapons were pretty meh.
---
No. The base weapons can be obtained even if you haven’t learned them. 
---
It’s just the ‘new’ DLC weapons.
---
Pretty sure that’s a no. I’ve gotten a good number of weapons I doubt I’ve had plans for. The only reason fixer and bear arms are different is because they were add-ons to the base game. 
---
So if you only learned the fixer on a new account you would theoretically have a better chance(albeit still pretty small) of getting one vs if you load up on rare plans you don’t want!
---
its fine im on PC :) thnx tho guess i just have to grind Rad Rumble to get it
---
My boss has an old school desk top fan, it's even got that blueish/green color, I wanna grab it every time I see it, lol
---
If all plans and rep was account wide, I would definitely start another character, but I’m not doing the rep grind again and I honestly can’t be bothered learning all the plans again either, especially when camp building is such a big part of why I play.
---
heya. feeling generous after getting the plan just now. if you don't get it when the event ends and i get an extra one, i don't mind just giving it to you. i'm on PC tho, so i don't know if that's the platform you play on as well
---
This is pretty much my only beef with the system. It’s hard to have those perks with food and meals when, even after making a bunch and storing them in a fridge and saying “this should fix my hunger for a few days” when after a few real life hours they are all spoiled. A lot of the time it just makes me say fuck it when I’m hungry and eating whatever it is just to not be hungry instead of going out of my way even alittle to cook something. Because I just grinded a lot to get a full fridge of good food. That will spoil in 2 hrs. Great😭
---
What are theses plans ?
---
The only thing that could make me make a new character is if we can make a cure for scortched one day and save Crane, because he would become the most legendary trader in the wasteland with the most exclusive items.
---
Is that a thing?
---
lolwut?
---
I still time out after a while of that (Xbox)
---
Frag mines say “what mole rat?”. Worst enemy for me has gotta be either bloodbugs or sting wings. I hardly ever use vats so by the time I think to use it I’m already poisoned with blurred vision limping away trying to spam stims before I die
---
Appreciate it but I’m on Xbox
---
I’ve got like 3 or 4 levels left to do, so I’m glad I’ll finish. I just realised today that once I reach 100, there’s not really anything left for me to do in the game that I can be bothered with.
---
Fixer, Bow, Compound Bow, Bullion Weapons/Armor, Bear Arm, and Tenderizer need Plans. Everything else is obtainable AFAIK.
---
Most annoying def: liberators
---
Hardest: Mirelurk King, Gutsy, Assaultron
---
I’ve personally only ever used my secondary account to build design concepts before using them on my main account, since this game guarantees you will never be able to rebuild your camp the moment you move it. I think Bethesda wants to remove the need for multiple builds with legendary perks and loadouts though. Possible we will see future content reflect this
---
I’m sure there’s someone on PC who’d be willing to place it for you. Sure beats standing in water.
---
For some reason it's been bugged for weeks and they haven't done anything about it as yet but they do claim to be working on it, so fingers crossed it is fixed soon

Question has mostly been answered, but wanted to add to the assurance
---
F. Three out of four of us found that our score had been auto completed yesterday, first time for me and yes it really sucked on a double score weekend.
---
Yeah, now that I've reached 100.. tf do I do? Lol
---
I just got a plan for a meat week Stein.
---
Yup I think it's the Free States vendor. Also the one in Harpers ferry has it.
---
Explosives are terrible in 76 which is really stupid. So many enemies have high explosive resistance when in reality explosives should be able to take down just about anything more efficiently than any other method
---
I'm too busy contributing to notice what other people are doing

If it was in Grandma's house the Salty Tenderizer would have rice in it.

Where do you camp?
---
Mine is on the lead node in southern divide.  I rarely get attack but when I do, it's always a lone vengeful mothman
---
There is one for completing the season one board.
---
I only have one character, and I don't understand people who have multiple
---
They downvote you but deep doen they know your right
---
thankfully Cazadors wont exist in 76 because they came from the big empty in fallout new vegas
---
Oh... it hadn't even crossed my mind that higher level enemies will now attack my Camp.
---
Just wait until One Wasteland. It will get better. Level 50 mole rats will follow you forever. :P BUT those little ankle biting effers will at least give you over 100+ XP per kill depending on buffs.
---
" tedious annoying tasks I have to do every couple minutes just to not lose AP "
---
100% neah! there's exaggerating and then there's *exaggerating.* Even with speed demon on and not using class freak 3 it's not this bad. I'm not sure how long it takes to start losing ap from hunger and thirst for me but i reckon it's at **LEAST** 10 minutes. 
---
Stop carrying around everything. i usually carry 10 stimpacks, some overdrive and psychobuff (which i always forget to use). Some inert flux (or purified water), corn soup and a few rad-x diluted and a few radaways. I did used to carry silly amounts of chems and food. And then i stopped. Get healing factor. That'll help a LOT with healing.

I have three characters and I won't ever use one of them because of this. I will use my first and second characters only and the second is only for playing with my friend who plays the game very rarely. Of course after One Appalachia it may be that I will ditch the second character too.
---
The rubber banding varies for different people and weapons. For me it's bad with my combat shotgun and happens often so consider yourself lucky.
---
I've played it 6 times so far. Not one problem. I don't like the very short time between Earl's death and the need to escape. I'd like at least a minute longer so I can try to loot the Wendigos that I was killing for crowd control, but beyond that.. I think it's a fun intense experience.
---
someone else recently said they had the same problem. don't know what the outcome was though
---
Well I was wondering about that. I feel by removing the willingness to start new characters, the entire burden of keeping players is on the end game content, which is not as good as the early game content in my opinion. 
---
Thanks why I wonder if this angle is going to ultimately hurt the game.
---
I'll come back for the BOS dlc, and any other content dlc, but the grinds are definitely not something I will do twice or multiple times.
---
Start at Sutton, do photo opportunity, do both faction dailies, then give mirelurk meat to the raiders at Ohio River Adventures. Do this every day for about 2 months and you'll be all done hahaha
---
Yep  its bugged.  You need to server hop to get it done or complete it on a private.  It may take a few or several hops but you need a server where someone hasnt done it recently.  Who knows when they will fix it.  get hopping bunny
---
Once you fail you get nothing. That's enough.
---
I’m sick of being the one that runs down to get all the ore as everyone else is kill xp hunters! I’d like to be to but I don’t want to fail the event....
---
i don't play bloodied because it's GG EZ mode and would spoil the game for me. 
---
Bloodied builds are the demonhunters of fallout 76
---
Nah tell them to remove them. Say the scorched plague made them migrate up or something lol.
---
You're absolutely right. If 76 is an MMO, then suddenly so are lots of other games that are multiplayer, online, and have decently sized playerbases. However, 76 doesn't allow for large numbers of players in a single game world, so it can't really be called 'massive'. It also lacks many essential social elements, such as guild functions and proper communication.
---
As an example, Planetside 2 is an MMOFPS because it's a first person shooter that involves battles with hundreds of people all interacting in one large, continuous world. It's not an MMORPG (although it does have some basic RPG elements), but it is certainly massive in scale.
---
I think it's one continuous stream of audio, and not individual lines of dialogue, so traditional subtitles won't work. It's quite lame, but I can't think of how to work around it. I'm far from an expert though.
---
i wish packing light would just combine the pack rat perk and through hiker.
---
then replace pack rat with a rifle+pistol weight reduction and through hiker with a new perk that extends food buff durations by double/triple/quadruple duration.
---
I've just made a full health character. My armour consists of different prefixes like ghoulslayers, troubleshooters etc so I have decent defence against all enemy types. I'm currently using furious and vamp weapons. 
---
Sure the damage output isn't as good as bloodied, but I already have 2 builds that way. 
---
What I have trouble with now is that there's not a lot left for me in the game as a whole.
---
Grinding is about all that's left and I'm bored of it.
---
I don’t know about the public build teams but I guess I’ll find out when playing, it seems a lot more solo friendly than what I expected. Thank you
---
I have the opposite. It says item is floating but will still let me place it.
---
I guess AFKers assume other people don't wanna get nothing, then sit idly by.
---
I know that one faush whatever event gave them.  The legendary run has one, this meetweek has one. Am I missing any?
---
I want it just to sell it. Who wants to further dilute their legendary drop pool with that junk.
---
My favorite is Biv, but I definitely have a soft spot for Rose.
---
man i would sell it to you.  but im on ps4. I dont even know what it is.  I am a heavy gun PA.  I assume its a melee weapon
---
First time I came across that guy I wasn’t ready. It killed me at least 10 times but I finally got it. Walked about 5 steps further into the cave and it respawned...
---
Just wanted to thank everyone for the replies ! I think I’ll buy it as it seems really enjoyable even in solo. Stay safe in the Wastelands everyone !
---
Did it for 8 hours during Faschnatch (I know it’s not spelled correctly.) I’m on PS4
---
Not the same one, the one op is/was after is not a world drop
---
In my experience, auto grenade launchers work just fine, although they are basically the only explosive heavy weapon that is worth using. But at least they show that whatever is wrong with the missile launcher and fatman, this mythical high explosive damage resistance is very much not the problem.
---
Yeah melee. Appreciate it tho
---
Try Junkies heavy guns build if you want a full health build with good damage. 
---
They didn't nerf TSE, they gutted it. BGS needs to fix two shoot, it's absurd that TS is 60% x 2, 20% over single shot with more miss potential. It should be over 150% not 120%.
---
Even though it is not a creature, I have a hate relationships with Laser Turrets. Its like sometimes you get good damage, and sometimes you don't hit them at all. If at any point in a new area they decide to put a whole narrow hallway of them like in Jamaica Plains, I will scream. 
---
I will admit that even though Mole rats are annoying, Mirelurk Queens can snipe people at a considerable distance and Assaultrons can sometimes kill in one to two hits, I will always hate the laser turret for its high rate of fire, weird hit box, and decreasing my lifespan by a couple of minutes every time it somehow hits me on my last ditch of health.
---
We are playing a different game, and with the PTS it's WAY different. But we're also the guinea pigs. Hopefully they can fix things a bit before they get to you.
---
By "After Completion" do you mean when the Meat-Cook event ends? Because you can only turn them in DURING the Event.
---
Otherwise, there is a cooldown on how much Meat you can turn in, check your Pip-Boy Effects for "Meat Sweats."
---
You need to turn them in during the event, not after.
---
Nice, glad it worked. I'm
---
more impressed you didn't ctd or disconnect. But I'm glad that worked.
---
If your first reaction was "this can't possibly be intended to take over a month?"
---
Yes. Yes it is.
---
You can only hand them in while the event is running. Not before and not after.
---
Just drop all of them, you're fine without them
---
Thinking of making either a new furious heavy gunner in PA or a furious commando - or both maybe if there is another double exp weekend. have been running both bloodied and junkies witch are both good at blowing shit up. they both have their uses, full health is pretty nice in some events.
---
I was going to trade a Tenderizer plan for a be minigun and he just left
---
Yes, I have no defenses besides Beckett and I get attacked Infrequently in the Mire.
---
I'm running 2 full sets of secret services armors but unyelding. One is full vanguard with heavy armored backpack hitting around 800 armor. Armor up to around 600 don't really make a big difference but past that it does. Any weapon would do here ..you have time to get hit.
---
The second one is a full weightless build , leaving you invisible in vombats with the caméléon mutation . Fun . Here I use instigating bear arm .
---
Ooh I like this idea
---
I’m tired of the fast travel bug only kicking in when I try to travel to Graham’s Meat-Cook.  Nothing like trying to fast travel 19 times and then on the 20th time finally fast traveling only to find everyone thumbs up each other as the event was completed right before you got there.  I’ve only completed the event twice so far and that’s only cause I AFK on the fir pit spit
---
One more thing, if you afk on a meat spike or barrel, eat and drink first and maybe chew some gum. Eventually you will die from dehydration and starvation. That's when you will time out and can be kicked from server.
---
I can't really disagree, except to share that I started over when I got some friends to join the game after Wastelanders came out, so I started at 1, and found that the lower levels are a lot of fun. 
---
I probably would have been better off sticking with my first character, but there is some excitement in having to play differently when you are more vulnerable and have fewer resources.
---
With my first high-level character, I could play for days or weeks without ever dying. That was less exciting for me.
---
After the coming rebalance, I might have tried to start over again, but realized that I will never give up the ridiculous number of hours I have put into reputation and gold.
---
I’m on PS4 and would like to buy this plan from you. How much would you be willing to sell it for? My PS4 name is same as reddit name and I’m getting ready to log on right now.
---
They’re largely following the gta format. There’s no cross-account bank or skill tree either and that game can take actual years to grind. Secondary characters are more to relive experiences than to create entirely new characters.
---
Think the same goes for this game. They don’t want you fully replaying every bit of the game so you have 3 OP accounts. They’re wanting you to enjoy the storyline they created multiple times and then have a single account you use for grinding and endgame content.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
I'm camped at the lead deposit on the mountainside west of Top of the World, which she seems to like. She says something like "the view from these mountains is the next best thing to space."
---
Yup, run Line in the Sand a few times, collect and scrap all off the weapons with Scrapper equipped, and you'll be rolling in steel and wood.
---
Do you have a link where I could see the bunker?
---
Yeah these perks are way too strong
---
Yes, it's something like 20 atoms for 7,600 hours in game
---
Unlocking the card slots is account wide.  Each card's level is not.  I think they should be though.  It rewards players who have put in the effort and the stupid Perk coins to do so.
---
Not like this. The whole trope of sitting around waiting for moles to surface is true but it usually takes a lot of patience and hours of your time sitting there.
---
Right above ripper’s alley on the cliff, forgot to mention there’s also a mothman and flatwoods monster spawn in the woods sometimes if I walk a bit from my camp.
---
I think I hit the jackpot in terms of enemy spawns lmao
---
my main is a Non Addicted Full Health Rifleman &amp; Ive got another toon that is the same but Commando..
---
I see this. As a game it’s easy to start off and say “I’m going to do most everything” but when you’ve done it, unless the reward is THAT good, people will just compensate the worth of doing it. But if I were to start again I would have to say at some point what is worth doing and what isn’t worth doing for a play through and unfortunately for the way this game is there is a lot of “I’d rather just not do that again”
---
The card slots are unlocked account wide. The card levels aren't. So you can get a character to level 300, then that unlocks all 7 card slots. So any other characters after that automatically can start with 7 available slots, but all the cards are level 1. It's not horrible, but could be better with what's involved.
---
Wasn't Fawkes from 3 female initially?
---
They have to be diseased, so kill all the healthy ones first.
---
&gt;i don't play bloodied because it's GG EZ mode and would spoil the game for me.
---
haha what game r u referencing
---
I wish the AFKers would at least operate the drums and spits - costs them nothing and helps everyone including themselves. But other than that, since they do not actively make the event harder for those who are contributing, I don't really see the problem, I guess.
---
The wasteland is a harsh place indeed... lol
---
any junkies weapons?  If not maybe . Some caps. I've been lucky so far in this game. I got the ultracite calibrated shocks after like my 7th SBQ.  Having said that I've been having trouble adding friends and meeting up. I tried to do that a couple nights ago and Bethesda doesn't seem to recognize my new PS4 friends. We can try though. I added this one dude Wednesday twice and he still is not showing up on my friends list on Fallout. Even though we message on PS4 and he's my friend in PS4.
---
oh! whens the 2 xp
---
Ah this hat was part of an atom bundle that gave you the minutemen general uniform awhile ago, but I think the pirate hat is the same thing.
---
If this works let us know! Itd be awesome to just turn it in a week later and get a huge chukc as opposed to the meager slice they usually give for completion
---
battletoads obviously
---
Oh shut up crybaby. If its only snorring  I can live with that. Not like with the one dude who forgot to mute his microphone when he decided to .. ah.... how to put this reddit-friendly….. 'show his girlfriend a good time with the bees and the flowers'.

And the frickin duncehat parked his butt right next to my CAMP &gt;&lt;

---
haha ya rip tse. do you need to keep re consuming chems to stay addicted?
---
lol I heard that guy too!!! How do you afk without dying of starvation tho? I can barely make a full hour of drumming and then I’ve gotta re sustain or my health starts dropping
---
Reinstalling worked for me when this kind of crash started happening to me.  Weirdly the game ran smoother for a while afterward too.  But warning - reinstalling will delete the photo album.
---
Son of uhhh bitch. Thanks for the help.
---
800 is no joke lol
---
Wait so I can play the drums all day to get the meat week rewards while I’m at work as long as my camera is spinning on a rubber band!? Please say it’s true.
---
500 for me. It's the shotgun version.... sooo I don't reload for the next month
---
I don’t read it as blaming lag that it happened - just that it caused him to be careless and make the mistake. At least that’s how I read it.
---
I dont know but there are usually a couple of them every year. that and purveyor sales.
---
No. It's lost the the dark Bethesda abyss
---
I've played nearly the whole thing solo. It's definitely doable, and still is a good experience. Playing at your own pace does make the game more enjoyable imo. The only things you can't reliably solo are the more popular events like scorched earth, uranium fever, heart of the swamp, etc. You might need a private server if you want to play those alone. Same with nuke zones, if you drop a nuke anywhere it's pretty much guaranteed some people will come in. Other than that, player interactions are actually pretty rare unless you go out of your way to look for them
---
Bugs are a whole different matter, but at this point it's fairly par for the course with bethesda. The biggest outstanding issues are the half dozen damage bugs currently going on. You can work around them, but it does get annoying having to control what you do
---
It’s been update to 760 Atoms I believe.
---
lol
---
No I'm enjoying not having worry about it and doing other things
---
Thanks for clarifying. Previous posts have suggested lower level caps but I cannot confirm personally as on console
---
So what is up with the cool down anyway? It seems like I can only turn in 15 I guess? And by the time the cooldown is over the event is over
---
A whole set of weightless with the chameleon mutation lets you stand upright in stealth. Combine that with sentinel effect and its pretty powerful
---
By shuting the fuck up and not being an annoying little shit begging them to play it
---
😳
---
I'm pretty sure it's intentional. Rifles have reigned supreme since the game came out, even before the fixer you were still hard pressed to find something to compete with the handmade. Heavy guns are good for overall DPS against tougher bosses, but rifles have that extra versatility that allow them to be used at long range and as stealth builds. Stealth commando is simply impossible to beat, it's too far above all other builds. Their "balance" for that is making them weigh more than the literally named heavy guns once fully modded, and not having a perk to reduce that weight
---
Oh good
---
Put them in the cooking pot during event.
---
Put Good With Salt Perk on so that you can slow down spoilage.
---
if they are taking the word of a reviewer/youtuber over someone who is their friend.. whats the use..?
---
fuck em
---
Jeez coming off a bit harsh
---
Technically, making a new character and rolling after only learning those plans would give you better odds than on your main, but it's really not worth it. Raising a character to level 50, transferring a spare fixer plan, and all of that just to remove a couple items from the potential pool. All the base game plans will already be in there, the only things that are excluded until you learn a plan is stuff that was introduced during wild appalachia or wastelanders
---
You rude piece of shit
---
I love you, but I haven’t asked them to try it since nuclear winter came out, and I’ve never really asked them that much but please keep that same energy
---
My camp is at the top of Seneca Rocks. By the grace of the Holy Mothman, Sofia has been cast down from the mountain. She lives in solitude at the base of the rocks, never able to fully shake her nightmares.

Honestly I actually kind of miss her at times because it is so incredibly rare for her to actually spawn in my camp...
---
i have been doing this for a while while at work set your systems for not shutting down in power menu. you dont need elastic band mine work just fine without it (but my remote are in the charger bay). sometimes you will disconnect because bethesda reset the server you're on. enjoy the reward  :)
---
Yeah, right? Only 5200 more hours for me to go lol
---
You cant be running your controller on batteries. It has to be plugged directly into the console
---
Yep, they fucked over TSE. It needed a nerf, not a gutting. Makes you dread the coming nerf doesnt it, and all the new "bonus features" introduced in every patch which will brake something else. I wish TSE got a boost, and Mutant's prefix as well.
---
Ye I do it through the night
---
Friends since middle school we’re all in our 20s now lol they all kinda agreed that they “weren’t gonna waste” their time on it, lol I don’t know how to change their mindset
---
They fixed it so Junkies doesn't lose addictions unless you take addictol. You used to need to chem up every time after you die but that's no longer the case so it's more viable now. My junkies/heavy/PA build does great damage. Only bloodied does better damage and after the nerf to bloodied junkies will be pretty close.
---
Drop there fat man. It’s literally the worst effect on one of the worst guns in the game
---
If you have Healing Factor your health regens. Idk If it's mandatory or not tho

I play on PC. I haven't had the experience of trading. I play with friends so I don't have this issue. Sucks that it exists.
---
Happened to me also...so I show up 5 minutes early to grab a drum/spit. Gives me time for a cup of coffee or bathroom break.
---
don't you mean when you fail a mission?
---
You can die from starvation. Just get really really really close
---
I run on full health PA with either Furious or junkies weapons.  I don't know if you really need bloodied. It just takes me 4 bullets to kill something instead of two. Or one. I just don't like dying that much. I like being super tanky. I followed angry Turtles heavy PA to the T. Very hard for me to die. I died from just not paying attention to my rads usually
---
I always wanted to visit Finland. Came close once but trip got cancelled. :(

 Why would it drop on a Sunday?

---
Anti armour one
---
*happy almost dead noises*
---
Thank you :D
---
Here's a tiny bit of consolation. With One Wasteland, high level players will be met by far better mobs. So you'll get level 50 mole rats and scorched even in the lowest level areas like Tyler County. So you will basically be getting 100+ XP per kill from even trash mobs depending on your build an buffs. But I'm with you. Let the SCORE roll over. I've completed zero challenges now that I've finished Season One.
---
The anti-armor, faster fire rate is the much better one
---
No point, really. I'm assuming you already have some gold plans learned with that much. Once you take the required 240 days to cash all that out, assuming you buy from smiley from time to time, you will literally have enough gold to buy everything in the game and then some leftover. I mean every underarmor, every weapon, every mod, even every armor upgrade, including the lower tiers. It cost 70200 gold to buy literally everything available before the SS underarmor/SS deep pocketed and ultra light mods came out, and that went down to like 64k if you got the chinese stealth suit from the settlers
---
Ima get healing factor then! Guess I’ll be getting fast travel bugs
---
Haha, I like them for all the reasons you hate them.
---
What can I say some people are just baaaaaaa d players.
---
The Anti Armor one for sure! You would usually use heavy guns in power armor and VATs drains fusion cores.
---
The raiders rep glitch is the only 'cheat' I have ever taken advantage of in this game.  Totally worth it with no regrets.  Look it up and save your sanity.  Then you can just focus on Ward at Foundation.  The grind is real.... and hellishly slow and repetitive.
---
Uncle Roger wanna suicide.
---
There was another person posting the same issue with their tesla rifle. Showed up twice in inventory, they tried to equip it, game threw some error then crashed. Their tesla rifle disappeared.
---
Looks like a new bug with the game's database handling...
---
Likeliness of that happening is very low.
---
With the current PTS’s dmg nerf, TSE could become apart of the new meta depending on how they handle the tweaks. Nothing’s set in stone rn, but if you liked that build previously you may enjoy it again
---
Lol what you plat on?
---
Im not sure u can spin the camera while playing a drum but u can just walk in circles all day long in the area of the event.
---
Tip do it somewere kind of hidden because players can push u around by bashing ya.
---
And also it’s not really just reviewers but the gaming community as a whole, I’m sure you all know it was rough hearing your favorite game called the worst full priced game of all time.
---
Also worried about this for events like riding shotgun and tea time.
---
I have six porcelain steins saved in my vending machine. Can't display them but they haven't despawned.
---
Because I'm sick of waiting
---
This. I’ve done the event probably six times now. I’m a full health build so I’m usually going for pylons. Often times this means I don’t see where the impostor sheepsquatch dies. I don’t understand how this happens; I’ve only actually found his body once. 
---
I guess it doesn’t matter though because legendary drops are almost always trash. I already got the main thing I want out of this event which is the fixer plan. And that doesn’t even drop from the boss but rather the event itself.
---
Yeah, it works both ways whatever you choose to do
---
U dont die of starvation... ist foodbuild 76 dont think to complicated. :D
---
how?
---
Some people like to just do a bunch of stuff in a game then play a new ones. Other people like to dive really deep into a single game and do all kinds of things, and explore and re-explore things. 
---
Really comes down to personal preference.
---
I'm downvoting you simply because you seem incapable of writing a coherent sentence.
---
;)
---
Also, you can’t turn them in during the lull/warmup period at the very beginning of the event.
---
oh and you dont die from starvation / dehydration
---
Mutants would be a great build for BGS to fix. I would love to see it's damage based on how many mutations you have or maybe up to five like junkies has. I think it would be a fun build if done right.
---
Trust me it needs to be addressed
---
I didnt sleep a lot of hours but i imagine if you're gone for 6? 8? 10? hours you could disconnect
---
Tesla is just one of those weapons that are much worse in VATS than outside of it.
---
Like it's nearly impossible to miss with Tesla and VATS does just that.
---
Is the weapon really good or something? I don't even know what it is.
---
Just a bit ridiculous... especially for how little atoms the challenge is worth. That should be for at least 7600 atoms lol
---
It's really useful if you are busy and want to keep your vendors online, just set up somewhere in camp, you can even do it near the vendors to provide music.
---
Thanks for the help everyone. I thought you turned it in after you completed the event and not during. Explains why I haven't been able to turn in anything....*sigh*
---
I disagree with all of you explosives are great I run two shot missle, two shot fat man, furious and fast auto grenade launcher, if you have demolitions expert you should be able to deal some massive damage, and if you take it to pvp you’ll see that the staggering and area damage are incredibly OP, I respect all opinions but it my experience, Bombs are the best weapon in the game about bombs

Gail from Crater meets him, they marry, Grahm sets up a farm with her, Chally and rara outside of Flatwoods. Grahm adopts the loose brahmin in Flatwoods.

PS4
---
I’ll do it then
---
Wish I knew this years ago...
---
I had this happen to a very nice piece of armor when I first started playing the game. Almost stopped playing then and there because of it. Looking back now, I should have.
---
Weekends off from the office. Which means the game Gremlins are moving about.
---
That has to be the dumbest reason to not want text chat.
---
When legendary sales come around, it helps to have max characters at lvl 50.
---
And also 321 dmg is low for an AOE attack my missle launcher does about 1300 and my fat man about 2650
---
Yeah I haven’t had anything in my system, but drugs and alcohol since 2004. Only downside is that you live a half life, a cursed life.
---
What?  Next you will be telling me to stop freezing the queen in the air. What will my noob ass do then?
---
I use a full health PA heavy build, it’s a solid one.  With the way stacked buffs are going to change, bloodied is taking a huge hit.  TSE weapons aren’t the best, but it looks like those, furious, AA, junkies, and other weapon damage effects will fare better after the upcoming patch.
---
How what?
---
0%
---
Earliest it will be at this point is Tuesday.
---
Hey, that’s much preferable to ghouling out from excess radiation
---
Big yes yo that

Checkout the new nukacrypt-&gt;roguetrader.com, we have a trade authentication system where you setup your trade on the site and it gives each person in the trade a special auth token you can exchange to verify it's really the person you think it should be.
---
Get nothing for doing nothing doesn’t really sound like punishment. I’m ok with ppl AFK’ing the event if they’re helping, but it would make sense if your odds of getting reward items rises with contribution lvl as anyone of any lvl can achieve about the same contribution if they actually play it.
---
I can buy the serum off you, please and thank you? I appreciate the kind offer :)
---
I’m watching tv at the moment however (and afking on the drums :3), I’ll hit you up when I get back on if that’s cool?
---
I don’t think you guys have demolitions expert equipped
---
i said three souvenier steins, you counted three. idk why you would ask if you‘re missing some :D
---
I think they intended for the Hunting Rifle to be the equivalent to the Anti-Material rifle when upgraded to .50. Though it was CC for Fallout 4, I think Bethesda would see it as redundant. I would love some new weapons that don't require massive amounts of grinding to get ahold of. 
---
Don't get me wrong, though. Plenty of weapons in New Vegas were the pinnacle weapons of the series. My personal favorite was the Battle Rifle which is a M1 Garand.
---
this, probably. it‘s a shame.
---
Yeah i hate when you can hear the neighbors thru the wall
---
The ape who makes the patches has free sundays by contract
---
Everything I don’t mind parting with is in my camp vendors.  I only carry my loadout weapons, which I’m not about to trade.  I wish there was a way that I could redirect Trade requests to the things I have for sale, but there isn’t :(
---
Runescape had this in like 2002.
---
A little wicker man 76?
---
“Aaa—-ugh! Why’s it green? Why’s it green?! WHY IS IT GREEN?!?!!??!?
---
Now that's just not true.  Bethesda hates ALL people.
---
;)   joking
---
You play adventure mode?
---
Play ESO lol. I can’t even get this game to load on my PS4, so many blue screens. I’ve un/reinstalled many times, still no help. So I won’t to Elder Scrolls Online.
---
I’m not crying, you are...
---
Ye no prob. It only cost a few cobalt and that it's fine. I'm give you it. My PSN is matthewcoop. I'm not in rn either just hit me with text when get on
---
Do any have quest other than Becket or her?
---
Thanks for the reply, I kinda figured it may be just crap at VATS. And to be honest with it being a Tesla, you pretty much just have to point in the general direction of a target to hit it so it’s no biggy.
---
You feel well tuned
---
That's all I did up until like level 90 lol ALTHOUGH I did some events on the public server.
---
How does it let you afk that long??
---
No, OP is talking about the steins that are already in the game as junk. You can find them on Helvetia and some other places and the metal and wooden ones can be placed in the stein display. The porcelain one (that only shows up during Fasnacht) can't be displayed anywhere for some reason.
---
You got it! Thanks so much man.
---
Grahms home is the open road... 
---
If he had a home people would never give him a moments rest
---
Not just the anti material rifle. The entire gun runners DLC, as new weapons added to all loot pools and weapons used by npcs, not just skins.
---
You will feel noticeably weaker, but you'll also gain a feeling of near invincibility.  I run both Bloodied and Vampire's on the same low health build, depending on the situation. For Vampires I don't run in nerd rage.  I use Vampire's for all day to day situations, and break out the bloodied against the big boys.  Vampire's is especially good in mobs.  You are gonna want some good Vampire's gear though.. FFR, Explosive, anything that will give it a bump.  I also carry lots of psychotats and ballistic bock to help bridge the difference.  All in all, it is still a quite satisfying experience.
---
It's like the uncle who falls asleep on the couch at thanksgiving
---
I use a bloodied m79 as a secondary, and one shot solves most lower tier hordes.
---

---
&gt;LOOSING
---
But seriously, what do you mean? Have you been hacked through trading system? Maybe you sold an item you didn't want to sell? Please explain your problem.
---
Nope.
---
Eh. Somethings are meant for junk I guess.
---
It’s a sacrifice i’m willing to make .. we all need a lil *thiccness* in our camps😏
---
&gt;I can’t even get this game to load on my PS4, so many blue screens. I’ve un/reinstalled many times,
---
your posting history does not support this claim
---
Oh good at least it’s not like a 10 atom challenge lol but man that’s a lot of hours I think I only have like 500 ish
---
The whole point of the legendary run was to get more people paying in more money, by forcing daily logins and vastly decreasing free atoms.
---
They're not going to give atoms again.  They want your money.
---
My two shot fat man (Big Boy) will one shot (technically two shots) any online player, the first bomb halves and staggers, the second kills. This is all in defense i assure you
---
How’s that creeper?
---
I need a laughing emote. Badly.
---
Not yet , I just finished. Strangler armor (with Cosmo skin). Solar is another few thousand of bullion's..
---
The damn yao guai. I'm heavy gunner build and can pretty much take a beating from anything. But you get 2 of those bears and you can get off being staggered and 3 or 4 hits and your dead. They drive me nuts
---
I could attribute this to...
---
Most Holo tapes we pick up are like Rewritable voice notes or even just Data. So with someone sitting at a computer and making it, the program creates a text log?
---
Whereas the Grafton monster holotape is one purchased in the store. Just some gas station cassette tape to keep the family happy on the road. No text to be displayed on your pip boy because they were too cheap to add it.
---
It’s like the cassette bible stories you find at some truck stop in Utah while on a road trip.
---
Best way to do it would be to bring up Wastelanders. If you're on PC or Xbox, it is on gamepass so they could try it on there if that's the case. 
---
I had the same mindset as them but eventually I bought the game off of Ebay for 15 dollars. I've put several hundreds of hours into the game since I got it. It doesn't hold a flame to the other Fallout games, but it's a fun experience with friends. 
---
Atleast up until the endgame grind.
---
Well, the B-team in Austin that's  used to making F2P games was the primary developer and was in way over their head. On top of that it's basically fallout 4, which was meant for single player, with a new map and new functions, like online play and some code from Skyrim, poorly layered on top. Additionally BGS **needs** to rebuild their game engine foundation that has bugs in it from before BGS bought it more than two decades ago when it was NetImmerse then Gamebryo.
---
Now a two shot or bloodied, auto grenade launcher 🤔 that could be a god roll
---
Honestly I’d be down for new guns even if they were semi redundant just for more variety. Then again I played a ton of payday 2 and 70% of the guns are redundant.
---
Public teams are usually just solo players that team up for the boost in exp or special. Generally, there's no interaction between them, but it'll save you caps at the start being able to fast travel to camps for free. The lag has been pretty bad the last few weeks though.
---
I did the gold grind on 3 characters, working on the 4th.  When I stopped pushing myself and just started playing casually, the grind became far less painful.
---
Fought one solo in the Overgrown Sundew Grove on PS4 a few weeks ago.
---
NW is very different that other pvp games. It is really a game of two phases. 
---
Phase one is resource acquisition and survival. Get to the loot crates, get enough gear to be competitive, and then hide. It helps to know where some of the orange crates spawn. I kill people during this phase but they are typically fights over territory to hide in or over crates. I don’t actively hunt people. 
---
Phase two happens once you are to about 10 people left and the circle is small. Hopefully you have decent gear by then. Now your job is to hunt and kill. Alternatively you can hide and hope to take a quick stab at first. However, I usually find that at this phase I get put gears if I don’t start killing some people. 
---
The game heavily favors survival time in its rewards. So don’t feel bad if you just want to bush Wookiee/aqua person your friend at to some easy xp. You will be much more competitive once you have some levels and good perk cards.
---
Vampire minigun, lmg or 50cal is very fun. 
---
Still deal good damage while being invincible.
---
It’s definitely not as amazing as the past games but as a fallout fan I can truly appreciate the amount of customization and interaction with the world it’s honestly just a fun fallout game (hell of a lot better than elder scrolls online😬)
---
I know you meant helping other players but it’s really fun to imagine that helping bother players is also what you do
---
I was able to complete it last night on a private server after it got bugged out on public server
---
I think I’ll just show them your comment 😏
---
Do you have starched genes? It will disappear if you use RadAway without starched genes.
---
It needs to be max level
---
Fuck liberators I fucking hate them my level 95 character with full utracite armor fucking gets obliterated by 3 mk5
---
I find that my public teammates visit my camp pretty often. That free fast travel is a nice incentive to browse goods
---
I think it should give scrip and bullion instead
---
They need to give companions more lines for after you complete their main story thats is more uplifting
---
Ra Ra no hurt Chally!
---
It’s great for doing chores like laundry and dishes.
---
A couple quests will be pretty hard without others but others will invariably show up to those quests so it isn’t much of an issue. I play mostly solo
---
Lol. I’m not even going to edit it😂
---
Lok’tar Moo’gar.
---
Just... why?????
---
Oh I absolutely hate when something’s green and it won’t place because “it’s floating” or “doesn’t have support” like I mean then why tf is it green.
---
To be completely honest, with the Gun Runner's arsenal, alot of the guns were redundant but it felt like you had such a vast array of weapons to choose, even if they were slightly different. 
---
The problem with 76 isn't the variety of guns, but that most guns aren't very practical. For most weapons, you'd need a good legendary roll for it to be usable. I would love to use the Single-Action Revolver but the reload speed is so slow and it's damage is only marginally better than a western revolver.
---
It’s public posting history that takes one click to check, it’s practically the easiest thing that people can do to combat bullshit posts.  
---
[https://www.reddit.com/user/johnwhitmyre/posts/](https://www.reddit.com/user/johnwhitmyre/posts/)
---
What's the sound of one hand clapping? Someone beating their meat
---
Can we get the posts and fences while we’re at it? 
---
I imagine the answer is “of course! That’ll be 1200 atoms please” lol.
---
Definitely! Player ran vendors are necessary for late game weapons
---
50 cal is way easier on the ammo than the minigun too.
---
I have already fought several in the bog while and/or after scorched earth. xb1.
---
I play on PS4 and have no issues with frame rate.  It sounds like it may be an issue with your system itself.  So many variables - do you have proper ventilation to make sure the system isn’t having issues, have you modified it with any custom apps, which generation of PS4 is it...etc.
---
Agreed I loved how like you said most of the weapons in new vegas were similar but different enough to be used. The legendary roll thing is spot on, god I love the look of the 10mm but the handmade exists.
---
There is no one making you do those grinds.
---
It's your own brain.  Get over the "need" to get everything, stop giving a shit, and just play the game how you want, OR take a break. 
---
It's not that hard man.
---
Yes they do exist
---
Found my first one last night in the bog. Fifteen minutes and 5 fusion cores later, got a 2* piece of armor. Never again.
---
Great idea yes!
---
But oh boy you’re so right lol.
---
Grind XP in line in the sand. I'm a level 400+ and rank up 1-2 times each event. Can't imagine needing to grind more than that.
---
If I decide the leveling challenges aspect of seasons takes longer on main vs alt I may put those levels on the alt. But at the moment the perk cards on main seem to be greater value currently for what the legendary perk system is looking like. I do enjoy the challenge of the alt and not blowing myself up with gauss shotguns tbh.
---
Definitely the AA. The executioner’s effect works only when you’re late to the party lol and vats damage is useless on a slow-start-fast-spitting weapon like the gat plasma.
---
This! 
---
Between public teams and the challenge for buying/selling to other players I've had a lot more CAMP visitors and it's really cool.
---
You can also kill them very quickly with stealth.
---
Like muh caps
---
&gt;will still out damage most builds.
---
all builds no metter what you do it will be the best dps build in the game
---
I was getting frame rate issues.. But after cleaning my PS4 and doing a reinstall it largely fixed it.
---
Still remember the guy from Radiotion Rumble event and how Bethesda cannot do anything about his weapon. This game became ridiculous
---
Have fought 2 on xbox. They're like a 10-15% spawn chance in certain areas
---
Aa ffr &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; executioners. The ffr is dramatically more valuable than vats crits on a heavy n
---
If you want to make it worse, turn on damage numbers. 
---
99% of the time you do hit but the server just ignores it.
---
If you or someone gets another plan for the tenderizer I’d be willing to trade for it
---
I’ve been solo player since around launch so its perfectly viable i only join teams for events &amp; bonuses, the game isn’t as bad as people say it is, its improved massively since launch (especially after wastelanders)- there are some issues occasionally but overall the game is fun especially if you like ‘soft-core’ survival, lore and the fallout genre as a whole (also the world design is the best yet)
---
Nope. Enjoy your untethered freedom. I finally have the time to do some junk runs.
---
&gt; I've heard that recently the bloodied legendary effect has been nerfed 
---
EVERYTHING got nerfed stop the misinformation
---
I really hope this is not the case :( 
---
It’s just annoying because of the amount of hours we play and after years this game is still buggy as hell 😕
---
those lamps are on the PTS right now, im guessing they will be Daily OPS rewards
---
This is all way too relevant
---
Oh awesome! Nice to know. Thanks!
---
That’s what I mean, if your PS4 has picked up a lot of dust (and they can pick up a TON of dust) that can impact the performance. If it’s a poor ventilated area that can impact performance.  
---
The console is just like any other computer, it needs to be maintained (of course sony does a piss poor job of making it something that we can maintain)
---
Fought one today in the Grove. They just stand there and eat my ammo
---
In addition to this I've noticed that my railway rifle does more damage aiming down-sights than VATS and even more damage crouched aiming down-sights than standing and aiming.
---
I mean the hello wave does the job for me would there really be any visual difference ?
---
The other draw back with the launches is they break so quickly.
---
ive helped shoot Earle a few times in the face before, so yes they exist.. in game
---
Building teams/unyielding set and food/drugs what made it easier to finish for me. No N.W. needed. Tuesdays nights (weeklies) would be the only day of the week, playing more than two hours at a time. Every other night it would take under an hour. Rotating characters, (4) so at least one is ready to level up the next day. Worse case, I have 19k atoms saved to use on next run.
---
I can just see the matchmaker, "omg I know someone perfect for you!"
---
Bloodied explosive &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; TSE even with the rebalancing because of accuracy. Plus there’s so many perks and armor rolls to keep you alive that the disadvantages of being low health are meh.
---
Even on Xbox that’s an issue my game crashed once and sounds like a jet was gonna take off I brushed it down and cleaned up the vents and was working wonders
---
what kind of build do you use? i normally run with nerd rage (3) and either scrapper/batteries or demolition (2), switching to gunsmith/fix it good/weapon artisan as needed.
---
why not try using your repair kits for a bit, and using int perks that help you kill faster/survive longer?
---
Having a blast as a full health junky heavy build. Exact opposite of my bloodied stealth commando. 
---
Have also had fun with a vamp low health build. Same build as bloodied but you trade the damage for not dying ever (as long as you have ammo).
---
Oh so youre the guy who has her in her dirty underwear
---
fixed on their own wire. two variants (4 bulbs and 3 bulbs) they act like the hanging christmas lights, or the winter icicle lights
---
Let you PC/console run for 7600 hours! , or just pay 10 bucks for the atoms, hmmz, touch choice.
---
Putting a reflex site on a gatling laser is more than 2 pounds and changing the receiver is more than 5 pounds.  The weights in this game are nonsense.
---
Oof that sucks bud rip
---
Ah okay cool. 
---
Thanks for the info buddy
---
It's even harder on mobile
---
Yeah, my PS4 and PC are both due for a cleaning, between dog dander, pollen, etc, coupled with the high humidity and heat, my PS4 completely crashed and froze while I was just sitting there on my vendor.  
---
Might have to risk COVID for the trip to Staples
---
You can get on the drums go into photo mode and rubber band the joystick so the camera spins. Or get a  keyboard that you can set to press a button every couple minutes.
---
I learned recently that I can solo it, so I no longer have to sweat it if no one shows up in the nine minutes or however long. 
---
(as a level 260 ish sneaky rifle) 
---
Probably going to change with the player nerf
---
Unless you join back on a friend you do not join back on the same server. Public are not perpetual. So if you dropped, left the server then rejoined with a different character you rejoined a different server.
---
Yeh u gotta put her in some far away places so she can properly space out. I keep the punch bowl with nukashine next to her
---
The real endgame should have been killing liberators with VATS.
---
If only there were a way to have all the companions in your camp at once
---
My 1000+ damage gauss shotgun regularly does single digit damage to mobs unless in VATS, misses 95% of the time on 95% hit VATS shots, instantly kills me while doing no damage to mobs if they're too close, and regularly locks up so I can't do anything other than shoot more or holster it.
---
And it's still better than the gauss minigun.
---
Congratulations!
---
There is no way you have seen everything, maybe all the marked locations. I'm 1,800 hours in and see something new everyday. But if exploring and digging for junk isn't your thing I understand that.
---
Is double xp weekend?
---
Radscorpions. 
---
Screw those guys.
---
You only need one alive. Consider the fact that is is very nearly impossible to max out the rooms  besides the venison room
---
If there's enough people, by all means guard every animal but you only need one left to win. That in mind, it makes sense to stick to the deathclaw
---
Thank you! ❤️
---
Guys! It was our season 1 feature! Of course we lose it at the end of the season. Gotta earn season twos reload gli...feature.
---
The second me and my 3 friends get over to the event. Me and one other get on the drums. And the other 2 start turning the spit
---
That way the rest of the people can start killing the creatures , I'm just sick of the high levels AFKing thinking they dont have to do anything . Source a Level 100
---
I hope so because i've engaged in fisticuffs with them a few times
---
No.we're in a perfect limbo of nothing ,untill colossus event drops and senlptember patch comes.
---
The server was the same , I log in in the same team I was before , that’s for sure.
---
And WoW a few years later.
---
The problem with that is that the hunting rifle sucks even if you put a .50 receiver on it. It looks like to me they wanted it to be a more cheep .50 rifle than an am replacement. I think there is still a need for a super high damage rifle out there.
---
I suggest as a general rule of thumb regarding Atomic Shop items to hold off on buying new items until you've searched the Reddit for posts about it or have seen it used in-game. It sucks to see people be disappointed repeatedly by what should be a really cool, fun purchase. 
---
You should be able to submit a refund ticket at least, unless you've already done that.
---
A world day is only a little more than an hour. So you should have to cook new food every few world days.
---
I play solo like 95% of the time(that includes joining the public “teams”) and the game itself is totally solo friendly. The most interaction I get is when I do events or visit someone’s vendor.
---
It’s tough. I ran a new character past lvl 50 during the last double xp weekend. Now I have to go back and do the quests just to start grinding rep again. Not looking forward to doing my daily rep grind route again.
---
I made a promise to myself i'd complete the legendary run once the first time so i dont have to the next time around. Hoping this logic works in my favor and perfectionism and the completionist part of me doesnt take over
---
Congrats, the meat tenderizer plan is all I need now, I have 9 grill master hats though haha
---
They are not to be messed with
---
Yes yes yes 🤗
---
Oh, definitely. Semi-auto and bolt actions are garbage in the game, even with all the associated perks. This is coming from someone who used rifleman from level 1 to 90. I switched to auto because it's more viable and I hate it.
---
Yeah.  Was thinking about making a new character but then realized I’d have to grind all this sh!t again.  Sorry, not until you can easily share equipment with alt toons.  It definitely limits the replay ability of the game.
---
Just rare. Last year only the weapon dropped, not the plan. Now we can learn legendary variants since they’ve included the plan. It’s the weapon that Grahm uses
---
And then Bethesda thought to themselves “hmmm what else could we add to the game to make it more annoying, ahh yes I got it liberators”
---
Hope you get the plan! Happy meat week! :)
---
Nah, she keeps her underwear clean.  It is the settler wanderer that looks like she hasn't bathed since 1976.

I'm at the junk node near Pleasant Valley station and she says the same thing. It seems she has dialogue based on the region you're camped in

That’s your tittle for your post in the market subreddit of 76 that’s not allowed to be mentioned here. :)
---
Yeah I've killed 2 or 3 in the Sundew grove before the event was released. Pretty small chance to spawn though.
---
I run 4 accounts and 20 characters. I invested my time into the workday characters when I first heard about Legendary Perks being (what I understood to be) account wide.
---
Every character I have is between 250 and 100, with most around 150. I have tried to plan my time in preparation for account wide Legendary Perks, so I'm beyond annoyed that this is not the way it's currently working.
---
I wholeheartedly agree that this needs to be an account wide system.
---
This is genious.
---
no
---
This. 
---
The only thing I really wanted was the raider cage in the tree. It's pretty much the halfway point of the board. 
---
I would occasionally knock out most of the challenges as sometimes you could do most of them in like 10 minutes. 
---
Otherwise I just played the game.
---
The brotherhood needs 200m score, keep grinding knight!
---
Have you tried it with am vampire explosive weapon? Like do you still manage to out heal urself
---
Do you have meat sweats from event perhaps?
---
 Not sure but that sounds nice.  My thirst keeps popping up at an alarming rate constantly.  Every time I fast travel it’s tanked, constantly having to drink water.  My hunger seems alright though, not as out of control.
---
It's events like this that makes me happy I'm a junky heavy gunner build, I can tank the pylons and spray the field with explosive rounds killing mobs and tagging the sheep in one go
---
Yeah it would be alright. Il prob turn it in later and il let you know.
---
I've enjoyed and played all fallout/elder scrolls games, even through the hype and complaints but was not even interested in FO76 after seeing all the problems with it. I decided to try it on gamepass and will say it's a good thing to have waited post wastelanders I enjoy the questing solo and events. I'm only level 70 after 3 months no rush, a few crappy legendaries a few hours a day and I'm still having fun. My2c
---
I have one question do you have demolitions expert equipped? It’s commonly mistaken that big guns increase explosive weapon damage
---
Bethesda, 100% easy quest right here.
---
Yes. What’s that do. Generally turn in 15 each event so get the advanced sweats?
---
I got the plan and mod, but checked the work bench under melee last night and couldn’t find it to craft.  I already learned the plans, any suggestions on where it went?
---
I play a shotgun/rifle build and absolutely love it. The weapons are hit or miss though. I recently got a two-shot with fast fire and fast reload that does less than half the DPS of my VATS one even though it should be doing more based on the stats being displayed.
---
Collect and find unyeulding woth 1 intelligence armour for maximizing xp if ya can

Maybe tell them it’s not as bad as they might think. I know that playing wastelanders for the first time and siding with crater, I was introduced to more interesting characters, better level design and more entertaining skill checks than almost the entirety of fallout 4. 
---
But if it doesn’t click with them don’t sweat it. Fallout 76 is by no means a traditional fallout game, and if they’re dead set on that, they’ll be disappointed. 
---
Personally, while it launched in a rough state, there’s no other game that entertains me as much as 76 does now.
---
Check YouTube to find the iron and lead ore sites.  Put on Excavator Armor before you farm.
---
For the longest time he was the only one...
---
No, you wouldn’t
---
IT JUST WORKS
---
i find molerats are very easy to take care of, just walk backwards when you know some are there. it will make them pop up out of the ground infront of you for an easy target.
---
It’s in blunt melee weapon type ✨
---
Oh yes I would, I’ve played New Vegas, 76, 3, and 4. I know what I’d rather take.
---
Yeah you’re right I might have a disease.  I think I am always contracting diseases...  I’ll try that later!
---
I think it’s a blunt melee
---
I’ve made great friends in the community, and I got friends to play with so I’m not really too bummed, just a little sad to see my friends fallout fandom die 😢 it’s been so long to the point this was my final attempt to change their minds and honestly oh well 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
I ran emergency protocol today but still died once or twice from the rocks in the earl's cave
---
explosives are trash on purpose because of pvp and camp griefing
---
Yep it’s that. Awesome. Didn’t know that. Although I have enough food to sink a battleship now lol
---
The advanced conduits plan has one that goes there walls
---
It’d be cool if they gathered up all the unused score after you complete and distribute it to players who haven’t finished it yet
---
If u know where I mean. That drinking fountain cures all disease
---
Might be under blunt weapons.
---
Fuuuuuck Ive been gathering any decent weapon plans to do exactly this thinking it was only learned plans available from him, didn't realise vanilla weapons were all there from the start 😩
---
Yeah ive been to every marked location at some point, but I need a goal to work for. Almost done this season, already grinded my t-65 set got some legendary weapons I'm happy with. Hoping daily ops will be fun.
---
Never met Biv?
---
I want them to add the SMMG, very creative and cool!
---
How does self damage from vampire explosives thou?
---
Sheepsquatch club too! Only one in missing that doesnt cost gold.
---
Thought I looked there last night but I’ll have another look there today.  It should still show even if I don’t have melee crafting perk cards right?  It would just tell me I couldn’t craft them...
---
it works as a gas mask and it has a built in functional light just like the mining helmets but its light cant be modded like the mining helmets.
---
you don’t understand it took the think tank at big mt almost 100 years to create cazadors also it literally wouldn’t make absolutely any fucking sense for the brotherhood to bring the most dangerous creature in the Mojave across the wasteland for absolutely no reason, there is no way in hell one of the creatures will survive that journey. Radscorpions, mutants and the Brotherhood are all already a stretch this would just straight up a be a blatant lack of creativity and trying to appease to audience that enjoys a game that they have ignored until now.
---
Maybe me showing them these threads will help
---
Nah nah imagine a cazador king flying from out of the boundary map an coming in an doing a take down on the sbq in a ingame cinematic lol. Make it rng so it's unexpected on each nuke launch to mix things up. Scorchbeasts are nothing compared to cazadores imo. A giant cazador is a insane thing to go up against or specimen 73 that flies at you at Mach 1 and the only reason you're even alive is cause of vats.
---
That would be nice.  Weren’t those in FO4?
---
Yeah, kind of stupid that the SBQ and Colossus are not guarantee a least a 3\* every time on top of other loot.
---
Imo i feel like mutants should always be weaker than junkies cuz i feel like it aint really a build? Like its more of in every build to run mutations
---
Understandable, it not the same for everyone.
---
I used a pair of conduits on the top. One pointed down, the other pointed up. The flat area above the door is a good spot to put them as well.
---
I managed to convince my brother to play it, he played about 3 hours, happily, I speed spammed hordes/ leader of the pact for those low level legendaries. My bf managed to convince his friend as well. As excited as we were to have that full 4 people team and ready to help them grind those levels... After they played a couple of hours, it was over. They didn't like it, therefore, even if you DO convince them, chances are they just won't play it anyways. I think you should meet them halfway, and find a game you all can play! 😉
---
But you can always stream the game and show them the goods of it, worked for us so at least they try it!
---
Oh snap! I may have jinxed myself, because after I posted, it fucked up at the event by the Wayward. I think that was more because there was 2 houses and 2 tents surrounding the event...creatures had nowhere to spawn I'm assuming. Hopefully they fix it, and extend it a few days, I'm seeing a LOT of people grinding that event out, and they're losing out if it's messing up.
---
PSA: ENOUGH PSAs already!
---
I like this idea. But with the rise of humans in the wasteland and plenty of mothman cultists, I can see them actually making the wise mothman a “rival” to the scorchbeasts. I would also love a small story based update where we see them rise in power, and learn more about their history and leadership.
---
They have one, but I use it as a hello as you can't tell the difference.
---
My daily ritual, down the hill from my camp is a honey nest.
---
I’m just so sick of Call of Duty 🤢🤢🤢
---
I have it equipped but mainly just because I have an explosive rifle. I don't use big guns at all. I'm just a rifleman build with two explosive rifles I use. Hence the demolition expert perks. It's good for grenades too but I never use grenade launchers or missile launchers anymore. They'll take down enemies well sometimes but the stronger enemies and boss enemies have way too much explosive resistance
---
"It's year X." I've never understood this appeal to the fallacy of constant progress.
---
Havent played PTS but the missile turrets do work if you have a fairly defensible base and good lines of sight. My camp is in the bog just outside of where everyone usually nukes for the SBQ, so I get high level spawns most of the time. I have a perimeter wall with towers on each corner with 2 missile turrets on each and 2 shotguns covering the entry (no door). I come back all the time to find dead scorched/gutsy's/whatever else laying around. They even took down a normal lvl 65 scorchbeast yesterday while I was afk.
---
This always happens to me I end up having to rebuild every time I want to move my camp
---
And why didn't she close fucking doors behind her?! Did they not have doors in space?
---
12 year old.
---
i suppose i could have just tried that. i've never used the conduits despite knowing the plans since day one practically.
---
Yeah im wondering how the pts nerf would affect things too cuz if things are taking longer to die, it might mean more opportinities to take damage as a bloodied which might mean more dying.
---
Idk i kinda like the damage nerf? Like i enjoy fighting things more similarly to other looter shooters. But dont go division bullet sponge on my ass pls
---
i used one for a while. nice damage and it looks badass with the silencer on but there's better rifles.
---
Not new here, just an old man...
---
That is harsh. I've deleted an entire account before but "all" I lost was 120K caps. I don't know what to say. Perhaps it was an unconscious cry for help to be free of the tyranny that is daily service to the Legendary Run?
---
use kinetic dynamo and dodgy, action boy and rejuvination.  boost agility
---
I've been playing since beta and for the first year or so avoid Reddit and all other sources of info and just played.  Actively avoided other players, had no idea why I occasionally was awarded atoms.  No min/maxing.  Just ignorantly wandered around the wasteland, trying to stay alive.  Enjoyed it much more than I do now.  
---
Totally playable solo!
---
The best rifles are the handmade or fixer. And youre best dps will be using them at full auto. Sadly snipers lag behind in this game
---
😍🤬
---
Yes, it should show you, it will be grey and unavailable without perk
---
They're great for internal wiring. Clever use of them can send power all over your house with very little visible wiring.
---
I wish I could sent pics, my fat man and missle launcher are both two shot, and they are insane for damage, statistically and situationally, take it from an explosive main who’s been playing since fallout 2, and played 76 since launch, sounds like you guys got some shitty weapons for explosives (no offense at all just saying your weapon is probably not as good as you think)
---
Sometimes it does that. You should be able to just back up. Wait for lasers to turn purple. Take mask off. Put it back on. Approach the grid and it should let you through.
---
How tf do you get this house type
---
Yeah tbh I keep my camp in the Forrest and don't particularly like using lots of turrets (they take up a ridiculous amount of budget). Guess where I am at the moment should be level 25 tops, but I do like to branch out sometimes, would probably keep me from moving.
---
its an add-on, but its free to everyone who owns 76, so you just gotta download it like a patch or update.
---
Yes! Grahm should be a leader in a small Super Mutant community, living somewhere in the Bog.
---
I'm always annoyed that Beth just uses the SM as baddies. &amp; then Meat Week rolls around &amp; Grahm has all these lines displaying a high degree of social &amp; emotional intelligence. Fo2 humanized the shit out of the Mutants, let's get back to that!
---
I'm currently dealing with this nightmare. Blueprinting is by far the most half-assed system in the game, and is completely worthless for anything but the SMALLEST of structures. Spent hundreds of hours making my camp and because of a bug on Bethesda's end, I was forced to move my camp in order to get budget back. Only about halfway done after a day or so of building because NONE of my 10 blueprints want to snap to anything.
---
lol. Most likely.
---
I shoot my two shot fat man once in pvp and all players (who aren’t hacked) die after my second nuke hits the ground
---
Sure:
---
ACP (A Colossal Problem) obviously :D
---
AWOL Armaments has at least one
---
Primal Cuts can have 0-3 (from what I've seen. normalle 0-1)
---
Encryptid has at least one
---
Project Paradise has multiple
---
Scorched Earth obviously at least one
---
Riding Shotgun can be started manually and has one guaranteed
---
Leader of the Pack has 3 seperate ones
---
Campfire Tales has one
---
Monster Mash normally spawns a couple 
---
One Violent Night spawns at least one
---
Radiation Rumble can have multiple
---
Free Range has one
---
Heart of the Swamp can spawn multiple
---
Uranium Fever normall has three
---
Surprisingly not gold (sort of). I was at 4,900 and didn't notice, I went to buy 300 from smiley it let me choose the 300 but only charged me for the gold I could actually hold. Granted it left me with a uneven amount I couldn't purchase but at least it didn't all go into Oblivion.
---
I also didn’t try the game initially because of the terrible reviews but glad I bought it about 2-3 months ago on sale.
---
Already had my money’s worth from playing over 330+ hours already! 
---
I find it quite a relaxing game to play? Explore, quests, looting, scavenging, finding legendaries! And if you have a group of friends to VC with too then I bet it’s even more fun!
---
The aesthetic doesn’t really fit the game, looks like it would be better suited to Beverly Hills, but very well done nonetheless.
---
And why does she not close fucking doors behind her?! Did they not have doors in space?
---
It's best he travels. Haven't you ever followed him a while, and made it feel like he was in your squad? Take 30 mins when you find him out and about and just walk with him.
---
Wastelanders is a DLC of sorts.    
---
You can buy 76 but I think it's being phased out. Wastelanders is big secondary story to the game. As 76 is the first game in the entire story of Fallout, not having people/NPCs for a year and then people/npcs coming back to it is a HUGE development.    
---
If you're reading a book or watching a very long series, you get used to not having people around in this story. All of a sudden you hear people are coming back to this area and it would be a big thing.    
---
I've finished Wastelanders once and IMO it's quite good.
---
Ironically I have a piano in my camp, never had Sophia or whats-his-name play it.
---
Yeah. You can out heal the dmg. Vamp is best on a fast fire rate gun as the vamp effect is flat healing per hit and not relative to damage dealt.
---
I can kind of agree with that since "its more of in every build" but mutations do have negatives like addictions. So maybe base it on how many mutations so there are more debuffs you have to deal with for more damage. That way it wouldn't be as much of an "every build" thing.
---
Either way it would be nice to have another viable build to chose from.
---
Damage doesn't register all the time. Sometimes I can snipe other times I wiff point blank vats shot. Sometimes I hit like a truck at range other I hit like a pillow same with close range. Completely inconsistent magic or not.
---
There's 7d2d, rust, the forest. Which all are similar in ways that you get to build, survive and grind for them goodies. Otherwise, in reality recent reviews have been better after wastelanders. I had quit due to bad reviews and frustration from all the buggs, but after a while I'm back on the grind and the game actually feels WAY better.
---
I think your best bet if they really don't want it, make them come play on free week, whenever they have it, nothing to loose for them, and they can try it. Get some chips, cola and let's go boys haha.
---
Sounds like it's making you...salty
---
The sound...
---
Yeah it was around May that it was last up. Try waiting on the giddy up buttercup rideable...I lost count for how long it has been.
---
Thought this myself too, sometimes I'm doing tea time and the pipe is like half health and there's a tiny ant hidden in all the bodies munching it. Always wonder how an ant does so much damage to the pipe, would probably destroy it if they didn't adjust the health of the pipes.
---
reason i've never bothered with them as i usually don't bother with complicated buildings. never had the need to run wires though walls. but i'm gonna make use of this dome on my next build and don't want to lutter it up with the generators.
---
Super relaxing game ! And so much fun with friends thank you for all helping me try and convince at least one of them 😂
---
Forest but same, much less repair after removing turrets
---
That's awesome, but it's sad that the community has to step up and provide something like this because a system doesn't exist in-game.
---
my preference runs toward Levers.. YMMV
---
Same here for the same challenges. I've done most of them, taking time to grind for each but those same ones elude me, it's common knowledge that they are broken. Radio silence from Beth on fixes for them though - they are low, low priority so I don't hold much hope.
---
Good use of traps, question do you have it set to trigger when you sit?
---
I'm just like you. The lone wanderer. You can avoid PVP by not taking workshops and playing pacifist mode (so you can't accidentally initiate PVP). You'll find yourself occasionally joining groups for special events and world bosses, but 95% of the time you can be doing your own thing.
---
The nerf is hitting junkies too
---
How in the...
---
Right, all of the annoyance of a molerat combined with actual teeth.  The poison is no joke, especially to bloody builds.
---
Was it know damn:(
---
If you care about fully optimizing your build, then there are better choices. But with a good B/J gauss rifle, you will still definitely remain relevant, and more than hold your own in combat. 
---
Thing about this game is that effects usually mean way more than the weapon. A bloodied lead pipe can still hit for absurd amounts of damage, and so can anything else. That’s why I say use whatever makes you happy. You’ll end up playing more, and enjoying the game better. 
---
I hope I helped! Good luck on your travels :)
---
Okay good I have been itching to get my handmade out there
---
If you need nuka cola I’m the plug on ps4 hmu, and literally don’t wanna risk downloading 80gb of shit, I don’t blame them but it’s not shit it’s really tasty
---
I am against it honestly, it emerging breaking.. 
---
but I agree they need to make it scam proof
---
My mom has this like two foot tall garden gnome that looks exactly like the in game ones and i went there last night and was just staring at it the whole time.
---
0
---
Awesome!  Will look forward to them.
---
Expansion
---
OP is talking about actually trading with other players face to face, item for item.  Not the player vending machines where you "trade" caps for items.
---
I have totally soloed it from day one. I will say the public teams are nice to join because of the bonuses you get but you can join one and then do your own thing. The only time I ever see my team members is if we happen to be doing the same event.
---
Noice
---
Diseased Mirlurk Spawn is the only way. These are fired from the Queen - much higher chance if she in turn is diseased. Use PA (amount of damage taken is not related to your chance of catching it so long as you take a point of damage) and just let them bite your ankles. Oh and make sure you immediately cure any other disease you contract otherwise you won't catch it.
---
Id buy a Dr. Disrespect skin set
---
Am guessing he means when you arrange an item for item trade over voice chat or elsewhere and then they take your item and "oh no taxi to aiport is here!" (literally this happened to me) and then they're gone never to be seen again.
---
We need mailboxes in this game. You should be able to mail anything to another player that you could otherwise trade.
---
Take it back it was June 2nd ATX https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/gva6x1/june_2nd_atom_shop_update_for_those_back_at_work/
---
Submit a ticket, request an atom refund. Works for me every single time.
---
I want that plan so bad, everytime that mission shows up I fast travel there, put on my stealth suit get out my shish kebab and equip friendly fire.
---
Then I stand there like an ugly girl at a high school dance waiting for people to spawn in.
---
Really?!? The info I've seen from people covering the PTS says Junkies will still be the number two build. If that's the case I would think every build is getting hit then since junkies will supposedly still have the same place standing.
---
I use PA all the time and never noticed something like this... Well, will pay close attention but honestly would be nice if it is something intended (enemy ability such as a EMP) and not bug
---
[This might help!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4lwlh3eDEA)
---
Righttt i used to avoid perks like dodgy cuz of vat rifle builds
---
I see she uses abraxo cleaner for the laundry
---
I think so yeah
---
Yes, I use that sub. I'd rather give it away here though as the market sub is more for high end traders. This is a giveaway to a more causal player
---
Thats true. I find plague walker p interesting but never wanted to dabble in that
---
It will most likely be the number two build.  Two shot may make a come back....  but the nerf isn't to bloodied, it's to how the math works behind the scenes which affects everything.
---
Nah, I user a switch that you can trigger from the chair. I made other versions where the switch is in another room so someone can be executioner.
---
F in the comments boy's....
---
Four builds, one tank/Melee.
---
Gunslinger, food build and ghoul.
---
The tank evolved into bloody. Gunslinger became sneak, food build turned into heavy weapons and ghoul uses explosives.
---
Each has its level of positive/ negative attributes. But it keeps me entertained. Took lots of research (youtube) and playing with perk card swapping.
---
On common thing between each...all have full unyielding sets.
---
Can become bloody if needed. Doesn't need to be low health. Mostly for bosses or carry weight.
---
Or what about the 9mm pistol, 9mm smg, the .357 repeater and revolver, the trail carbine, the ranger sequoia, the marksman carbine, the 12.7mm smg and pistol, red glare, the LAER, tesla cannon, recharger pistol or rifle, the lever action shotgun?
---
I was at someone’s camp a couple of weeks ago and the owner had built a target range with the target posters at the end. There was someone shooting at them so I shot the other target poster and noticed that a yellow health bar showed up, took damage and quickly healed back up. Thought it was cool and a feature of the target posters that I never tried before. 🤦
---
So now I am rearranging my camp and remembered the target posters. I wish I knew how he made that work the way it did.
---
Also be careful placing items right next to foundations.  I have a pumpkin rack that's completely not selectable unless I move or recreate my entire camp.  Happened with a flamingo and cat topiary at my previous location too.
---
Haha thanks for offer, but I know my cola spots 😉
---
Also there was a bug back in the day, that made your f76 dissappear and bugg out from Bethesda launcher. Just on that I've downloaded f76 about 3 times, then it came on steam, that's another download. I've risked it all haha.
---
Without the risks, we would never get to see some games flourish. You can always offer to keep them company through the download, play some cards against humanity or something. But yeah the question is, if they REALLY don't wanna try it, is it really worth it? 🤔
---
Oh seems it was also  May too so maybe again soon?[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ge15k6/atom\_shop\_update\_cinco\_de\_mayo\_for\_those\_not\_at/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ge15k6/atom_shop_update_cinco_de_mayo_for_those_not_at/)
---
I remember that day because I bought the prototype paint but I never seen the nukashine paint on the shop
---
Zero percent chance
---
Well mine is not bullshit. Lolz
---
Yea at that point I’m just hurting my own feelings
---
I have a quad tesla, they're fine. They messed up the animation so you can't see the chain dmg but it still works.
---
I hope
---
Yeah, I could have gone with something denser but lead just seemed like the right level of realism meets tongue in cheek.
---
I'm waiting for a legendary rolling pin to drop so I can do the murderous chef thing too. Right now I'm using a bone club. It's the next best thing.
---
Most any high lvl area that gets nuked &amp; has a random encounter spots has a small chance to spawn one. 
---
Ive gotten 7 vocal sacks under my belt using this method. 
---
Happy Hunting!!
---
Whats the food build? 0.0
---
Yeah, they are removing stacking multipliers. It's going to hit bloodied hard, especially melee, and probably stealth. Which is probably why those are the only two getting legendary damage buff cards.
---
Same! My friends are obsessed with it but it's just got so stale for me. 
---
Have you tried rocket league? It's a really good game to play with friends and it's cross platform. Makes a refreshing change from first person shooters. Plus the match making is pretty much flawless, we can be in s game within 10 seconds of hitting play.
---
You’ve been actively trading, so you clearly have been able to get into the game. 
---
There was nothing in the last patch that changed anything in such a way that made the game not work on PS4.  I have a PS4 and the game works perfectly fine.  
---
If there wasn’t anything in the patch that would have broke PS4, and other PS4 users are still operating fine, then the first troubleshooting you should do is what is wrong with your system to cause the problem
---
It’s dust in the wind like the Bethesda tax on our vending machines
---
Don't feel down! There's A LOT of cool communities that you can join to meet people and play the fallout with! You'll make new friends and maybe when your friends see you really having fun and talking about all those funny stories and cool convos, they will naturally ask to join 😁
---
I’ve been playing fall guys for that😂
---
BGS doesn't care.
---
BPSB and I have never made an alt. Still happy with my main (lvl 241). I ran Vault 79 with the Raiders, so I guess the only reason I would consider making a new character at this point would be to unlock the Foundation faction version of that achievement.
---
i'll have a poke at it and if i fail i'll check that out. ta
---
Your right and I’ve said to another I have tons of fallout friends it’s just annoying I can’t bring it up when I’m hanging out with my real friends😂 I HAVE NO ONE TO RELATE TO
---
How’d it get green? HOW’D IT GET GREEN!?!?
---
Also why I don’t trade in FO76.  My expectation is something like ESO’s system.   They should only be able to see what I want them to.
---
Feels like it always pops up for me on Xbox but no one ever does it
---
I've never traded. I assumed it worked as you described..where each player selects what they're trading and then both have to confirm. How does it actually work?
---
Just need Formula P to balance that. Same way a bloodied or junkie needs to stock up on aid. The disadvantages of dying are nothing, but maintaining a below 20% bloodied will be pretty unlikely. What armor rolls are you thinking would keep someone alive? Auto-stim and revive are the only ones that affect survivability but those are pretty limited.
---
That would be an interesting build too if BGS would do something with it. Right now it's not that great, they would need to rework some of the mechanics of it on the player and mob side or things to make it work.
---
Devs have made comments about fixers but nothing on lasers
---
PlayStation
---
Still not enough.  Should be 7600 atoms at least.
---
1) Get Nukagrenades
---
2) Throw five at AFKer
---
3) Wait for rads to kill AFKer
---
4) Wasteland justice achieved.
---
Okay, never tried that one. Isn't there a confirmation for a trade, like in FO4?
---
Personally I like the old guy the most. He doesn't play a instrument or sing or hum whenever. Just tells jokes a lot and his chair isn't big or unique so it blends in with your camp more. Beckett is a good 2nd but his bar is a little to big for me. The raider is just okay. The settler wanderer plays her guitar too much and hums way too much and then theres Daguerre. She's the only companion  that has taken a shower or so it seems so she looks the best in most outfits that show skin but is the most annoying out of all the companions.
---
Putting the chair on a trigger plate works. I have an economy mutations booth at one of my camps that has an electric chair rigged to some radiation emitters.
---
I have TRIED to actively trade but can’t. I would love to trade and I post in the hopes my game with fucking load. And I never said it wasn’t my system. I’m saying I can get ESO to work perfect but can’t get this game to load. So what’s the deal?
---
Yeah Yao Guais even in power armour mess me up big time. Im level 155 and at the Prime Meat event I had a level 46 who’d jumped on top of their tent ask me what my problem was when I got downed by the Yao Guai lol
---
Bethesda isn't interested in any economy in the game that isn't tied directly to a currency the supply of which they control through time gating and the trickle you can get from quests, etc. Adding item trades to the trade screen is how to fix this. That shouldn't be too hard, but Bethesda clearly doesn't want it because it would allow us to cooperatively avoid a lot of grind more easily.
---
So basically, since there is no way to both do it at the same people go first, then when they get the item they just leave the game and go
---
Quick FYI, terminals in the lobby explain most of the mechanics.
---
Yeah for sure the budget on them is rediculous, camp budget could definitely use an upgrade.
---
Awww.. I have 2 really cool Ultracite Lasers I wanted to slap a skin on
---
Just repeat the first sentence and you’ll have your answer 
---
It is 2020
---
Or better yet! A classic Fallout terminal interface where you place the item you want to trade in exchange for “trade coins”, the other person must then trade their items for coins in their terminal, which you can then buy for the requisite amount of trade coins. But they should for sure make it so you can only collect 10 coins per interaction, with a 100 coin limit per day. That way, you get to log in for five straight days in a row before your trade is actually processed! This, this is the BSG way...
---
Man, I have friends irl that don't even play games, but they listen to me brag and complain about them anyways as long as I explain the concept of it, or it's just a funny story! 😂😅 But that's just how life is, you don't always relate to people, you find things you both relate to. You can always make a streaming session for you and the boys! They watch, you play, all giggles, popcorn and fun times! 🍿😏
---
Nope.  That's the whole reason he's bitching.  Because there is no system for player trades in the game.  The only thing you can do is just drop the stuff on the ground and hope the other player is trustworthy.
---
Good luck to you at least it has been up a few times this year. Mr. Fuzzy rider in March Also on  **March 17th,2020 and Jan 28th, 2020**  was another Nuka shine week starting to think it needs to be a year round paint with how often they have had it this year

That week in March  had the Golden Mr fuzzy rideable I missed it and looking since the first sale 0 freaking buttercups. I only crave them for an arcade style camp I have slowly built right now it just has the ridables a dart board a shooting range and checkers using 2x2 yellow/blue checkered pattern flooring and the counters to make it the proper size using plushies as pieces.  With the new season 2 having an actual arcade game and foosball it will move me a few steps closer.   
---
Now if they just made a computer that looked like an arcade machine and you can load your game tapes on I would be set.
---
I think the scammer makes you go first in the trade. They take the item from you but then they close the trade without offering their item which was originally agreed upon for the trade.
---
To trade items you have to set them at 0 caps so they can just grab it and run.
---
I keep suggesting giant mothmen
---
When bombs start flying IRL, we should all meet up in Helvetia and ride out humanity’s last days on the parade route. Anyone with me?
---
Nice, have to keep that in mind for my raider characters camp.
---
So basically there are separate instances, I believe that each supports up to 8 players.  If there are teams, a team counts as 4 players in order to keep them together.  So if there are public teams of 1 or two, they hold four spots regardless. 
---
If this is the way it works, it is indeed kind of shit to say the least.  Unfortunately I have no idea how to keep the instance system and make it balance better at this time so....
---
Last night, a friend and I did it 2v1.  Me drawing all the aggro and tanking and my partner focusing the colossus. It worked for us as we are both specced out builds, myself a tank, and her a glass cannon, but if bad synced builds showed up and had to do the same, it probably wouldn't have gone as well.
---
Anyone that starts playing Fallout 76 today will not have the ‘empty world’ of pre-Wastelanders. This is an evolving and dynamic game world.
---
They should follow in the path of Warframe. That game has a top tier trade and market system.
---
If you are trading item for item, you invite the other player to trade.  You each set the item's price to zero caps.  And then you accept the item from the other person.  Sometimes one person might just take the item and run.  If you are buying something for caps from another player, you're fine.
---
Also, I don't like that they can see my entire inventory.   No, I am not trading you any of the other rifles I am carrying.  I am carrying them because I use them.
---
Keep in mind you might starve to death...
---
Not to mention people need to stop living their lives from one FOMO to another.  You don't need everything in game.  Missing some things is okay....
---
Interface, pipboy inventory, building menu, lot of mechanics...
---
Hillbillies and dueling banjos? Who wouldn't want to move their? JK, I live in the Pennsyltukey part of Appalachia so I already get a little taste of what it's like in WV Appalachia.
---
It would be fun times but you haven’t met my friends, we’re closer than family we’re a stereotypical small town Wisconsin friend group, and well I guess I should say no ones safe, anyone at anytime can get made fun of for anything its all jokes really but I can never get away with talking about 76 unscaved
---
When bombs start flying? We have a perfectly good bunker to use....and you wanna go to Helvetia?! Lol
---
There's gonna be a second week, plus I've heard people just leave their person on afk to slam the drum and get it completed automatically while watching movies. Maybe this will help! 😉 Also grind them colossal events, maybe you can get that god tier equipment and trade it for what you want. 🤔
---
Yes, I don't know why we don't already have this.  There are children's on-line games that have 2 step trade verification!
---
IT LOADED!!! Yes!!!
---
curious.. why are you spending so much time in there?
---
Only downside is it would have to be in an instanced interior to not break wastelanders quest line. But I'd still gladly see this implemented
---
Slowly realizing how heated our “brotherly love” gets
---
Atleast it’s not like fallout 4 where they could straight up insta kill you by locking you in an animation where they pin you to the floor and laser your face off
---
Yes.
---
You have fun with that, I’ll be in Vegas getting blown
---
I see what you did there
---
Has to be completed excavator set.
---
Those things creep me out.   It would be hard for me not to take a hammer to it then apologize to Mom.
---
Their only redeeming factor is somewhere one of them is torturing a Jangles, not sure where but I saw a pic of it recently.   At least one has its mind right.
---
True. I heard about how strangler heart had to be nerfed to the ground so it diddnt cause crashes or smth. Kinda feel like they are suffering cuz of poor base game coding
---
Serious question. I'm not saying you're wrong either because idk. But my understanding is that weapons with the explosive perk (legendary rifles and shit) ignore most armor (and from what I've seen that appears to be true). So how can both things be true? I've only looked into this because I wasn't sure if I should choose tank killer or glow sight.
---
Haven't had to solo it this time.  Last year there were a few where I was the only one to show up though and I did pull it off a few times but it's more of a pain than it's worth imo.
---
Sure no worries.
---
Yep
---
Thanks ill make sure to keep an eye on the golden mr fuzzy for ya
---
Did you get high on prime meat again?
---
I want THAT gun personally.
---
YES
---
I like the idea of adding something to rival the Scorched and Scorchbeasts. But since not everyone got inoculated (like the cultists and Blood Eagles), it’s logical for still have ‘fresh’ Scorched.
---
Yes please and also they need to allow atomic shop items to be displayed, I wanna show off my Nuka cola jumpsuits
---
They are adding it with an update.
---
I wish there were more than one or no options for heavy guns. You would think with all the skins they make, heavy and ultracite guns would have skins/more skins.
---
Would be great! I was so disappointed to find out that this isn’t a option
---
Well, aside from an intense desire to shop in the wasteland, It's mostly for the "The Importance of Communication" quest for Wren.  Every time that comes up I dread when she sends me to Valley Galleria to look for those vacuum tubes.
---
It protects against airborne diseases like a gas mask and has a flashlight built in as bonus. Looks cool too!
---
Like a deathclaw supreme, make the deathclaw a rightly feared opponent again 
---
Make it the apex predator it was, even have the normal deathclaws join it....
---
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 Didn't know that! Thanks!
---
I would love to see him settle down somewhere, but he’d have to stay in the forest region for sure. Like where he has meat week he could set up a small camp there, or even move to Flatwoods and set up shop in the old tavern there.
---
It is coming soon. Patch 22 era soon, so next month. There is a display for PA in the new run it is a branded Ace's display not sure how deep it is in the board though.
---
Bolstering or unyielding sentinel with dodgy, nerd rage and serendipity dude. You’re not at all fragile with those perks and armor rolls.
---
Lmao
---
Drop first?
---
Lost it at colorful testicles
---
Oh man, sorry to hear that. Well all you can do is then to just live with it and enjoy what you have. It just is: what it is, maybe just make a gamble that if they try it and don't like it, you get them something. 🤔 That's the best I can come up with, but I wish you best of luck anyways!

I sat an watched a legendary scorchbeast do battle with a mirelurk king and queen for 10 minutes last night, from a rooftop in watoga. Mostly because I was down to 50 ammo, and they were fighting on top of my junk bag. He took out the king, and chased the queen to the edge of town, where they were both wiped out by a swarm of robots. 
---
My laziness was rewarded with an assassin’s rolling pin, and some enchanted raider leg armor. I can’t remember if I went back for the junk.
---
le Cuts du Primal
---
I’d rather build him a home then give those BOS trash a warm welcome.
---
But honestly they probably do that because hack/modders are probably able to access your displayed items. You can never guess what they can do these days
---
Oh yeah, it definitely was crashing systems alright, a lot. I wanted to get it from Wastelanders but after I found out about the nerf I changed my mind.
---
If the BOS hurts him the whole community will nuke the brotherhood out of existence
---
Also the inert bomb daily is often in there
---
To be fair I haven't had a build really diving into explosives like you have and obviously therefore I don't keep or use any legendary explosive weapons I get. I think that if I were to spec my build that way I would certainly have a different outlook on things. I don't hear much about explosives being good is all. But it's good to hear from someone with a good amount of experience. 
---
At the end of the day it doesn't really matter what's good or bad as long as you have fun, so I'm glad that you're getting the best of both worlds
---
Follow it until it's in your range. No other way. That said, some weapons do have better range than others, look them up from wiki.
---
I live about a half hour away in Ohio. Actually planning a road trip through WV this fall. Helvetia is on the list.
---
It’s all tough love with them, I might just have to end up buying it for one of them and watch the bandwagon begin
---
I just jump server, the drone will appear on the new server world hopefully in a better location height.
---
that'd be a great way to make people riot against Bethesda, yes.
---
Use a missile launcher against the Queen....it’s like shooting a BB against a tank.
---
&gt; multiple chars this will be massively unbalanced
---
Why would this be unbalanced?  If player one spends 4 hours on one character leveling a card, why should player 2 who spends 4 hours on 4 characters leveling a card not have the same benefit?  Let the player determine how they want to player the game.
---
Okay, I thought I was going crazy when I couldn't loot the ash piles. Thanks for the headsup. :)
---
I shoot it’s propellers with a combat sniper rifle that I modded the hell out of
---
None of the answers are technically right. Wastelanders was an update that changed the game in many ways and added expansion-level content to the game. It comes included when you buy the game.
---
The more PvP, the better.
---
I wish more people had this attitude.
---
I have my share of issues/complaints.  But this isn't one of them.  Especially as they added the non-cosmetic items of (questionable) value - for gold bullion.
---
Today will be The Inspector I bet.
---
I’m on Xbox we don’t have the event and I actually found a person to trade it with me for a fixer plan. So I’m all good now. Ppl on market are asking for legacies to give it up. Which I feel is way to much for it
---
That would be the worst Daily of all time! Congrats!
---
For me it means I can revert back to PA 😂
---
Scammers ruin everything for everyone. They're probably the same assholes who take a workshop from a person who's over 100 levels under them and kills them when they're not even paying attention. 😡
---
Yeah Queen and Earle are a bit different. I thought you were talking about average mobs.
---
Imma have to vote for the battle rifle on this one
---
Most fun build I’ve done, it breaks my heart to see all this hate toward the missile launcher (probably my favorite weapon) if you unlock the targeting computer mod you will have nothing but good times, and also you can add a triple or quad barrel which allows you two shoot multiple without reloading, and with a two shot launcher... that can be up to 8 missiles per clip, all following your every move until you see nothing but a white light and pearly gates
---
That actually makes sense, because that’s how we have invasive species everywhere here on Earth.
---
Bell Delphines onlyfans and patreon
---
Missile launchers are pretty much useless against mobs too, due to the lack of serious splash damage potential too.
---
Fatman, not as bad because it does have pretty significant splash.
---
Thank you for your open mindedness I believe more people should try it out
---
Yes.  If you play it slowly (digesting the content - and really immersing yourself in the fallout world) - there has got to be a few hundred hours of solid game play.
---
There was a 136 acres we were bidding on back in Feb. out in Newville which is ESE of Flatwoods about a 30 minute drive to there or Sutton.  We want a winter hunting cabin up in that area. instead we opted for a plot in the Keys for a summer home.  Still going to keep an eye on WV though land is rather cheap in areas but we have specific wants and it seems a lot of other people do also.
---
Oh wow, you've come up with a worse idea than whoever decided to put NW challenges in the mix. Congrats.
---
Since I have the demolition perks equipped for my explosive weapons anyway, I might look out for some good legendary rolls with explosive weapons and give them a run, you've convinced me to try
---
Are you in power armor? If so get out and you should get it all. I’ve seen other players mention this issue. Otherwise I have no clue what’s going on.
---
I’m not against the damage nerf, albeit I think Bethesda’s logic for it is kinda silly as adding numbers should not be that hard imo lol. Work with a lot of engineers that have to run similar formula that have to work with one another. 
---
as far as bloodieds go, the dmg needs to be nerfed and I don’t mind the % they chose, but the minimum hp to get max benefits I think needs to be raised 25-40% somewhere in there. Not too worried about unyielding being nerfed, but it would just be better to make other armor prefixes better. I think nerfing unyielding will just encourage Bethesda to crank out more bad legendary effects instead of develop better builds. 
---
Ultimately I think the biggest problem is not enough good optimized builds. With bloodied being the meta just being a symptom of Bethesda not offering us better options.
---
I know the pain! Totally relate, and really do hope it ends up for the best 😉 just at least get it on sale, no use rushing it!
---
Get the commie collectron set it to collect blood packs and then use chemist perk card and max super duper and you will have more stims they you know what to do. I use to go find tick blood or buy them but once I got that it was so easy
---
I figured that would but it was easier to stage the picture with the switch lol.
---
Honestly no way around wasting a bunch of stims. First aid perk helps, and so does sneaking. With all 3 pylons on even those little eye bots turn into nukes.
---
Wrong game, you took a wrong turn while searching for something to play.
---
Any two shot, bloodied, or limb damage explosive is a good time, don’t script them I will buy them if need be
---
Yeah gotta keep it all. That’s why I have it always on me. It’s still my level 25 one and I can carry 550 with it on
---
🤣🤣🤣
---
Are all your dailies and weeklies completed? Is your XP counting towards your repeatable?
---
Damn. I've never even tried. That stuffs so heavy. Sucks though. I thought for sure they did something. Maybe they'll tune it one day.
---
There's an option for turning it off.
---
That was part of the Grognak items from the Atomic Store. I think it may have been part of the bundle that included the throne, but I bought it separately. Looks good, probably the best rug in the game.
---
Congratulations! I'm happy for you man! I'm gonna stay on the grind, not all lost. Sad that you guys don't have the event tho. 😕 Not hearing Grahm burp and just the positive meat yells is a loss on one of the best f76 content so far. 🍖
---
Use X01 until you're in T65
---
Why would you remove the text of hearing him snoring?
---
yes, and its good.  let pc master race be guinea pigs, filthy casools 4evah!!
---
I have to look into this. I use a VE gatling gun and when hitting smaller or more loosely defined enemies ill use vats primarily to hit them instead of trying to spray and pray an area. Never noticed cores dropping quickly.
---
I'm hoping they add it because I've never traded with randos in fear of scams.
---
How did I miss that.  Thanks.
---
Don’t do it. Do. Not. Do it. 
---
I’m here on the KY/WV border. It’s a trap. Drugs and disability checks, best jobs are the local Walmart’s.
---
I think it's your weapon's workbench. if you get in/out too fast, the wheel keeps turning and making that sound.
---
you also just reminded me that it took them over a year I think to fix the sentry bot machine gun sound effect getting stuck.
---
no love for The Two Time.. lol
---
Log in to world, then options, sound, main menu music
---
Yeah, the weight is what really kills it. No one wants to carry around 100lbs of missiles or mini nukes
---
I never wear power armor except for mining some lead, not been in a suit for days.
---
Though I shall try getting into a suit fighting and exciting. Thanks for an issue I'd not heard of 👍
---
I coulda sworn that I saw some dudes health drop down to a tiny sliver.
---
The nukeshine paint for the t51-b?
---
Yup
---
I guess someone was deeply offended.
---
Do you know what I think you're right, it is that sound. I'll try and use it again and see if that stops it. Thanks
---
I wish there was a grand trading post that had access to everyone’s trading posts if there online. Like no matter what world there on you can still view there items... like RuneScape grand exchange! That would make buying and selling less of a chore
---
I remember people doing quick switches in trades in the FOnline games over a decade ago. Imagine trying to quick switch anything in this game with its broken ass menus and lag, you'll probably end up somehow offering your atom shop painted power armor piece from your stash and one of your hornwright keycards
---
I've been saying for a while with the BoS coming from the West Coast, it should be their main new weapon for gold bullion. Sure it would cost over a thousand gold bullion, have only a couple modifications such as maybe a barrel, a couple scopes, a different stock, and maybe some clips, but it would be worth it. I could also see it having some heavy recoil  when standing (but better control when crouched) and a delay from between shots because of it being a bolt action.
---
Yeah that’s it. Health and AP will be almost entirely gone, but you won’t go lower unless an outside force gets to you.
---
You're not familiar with the awards pool for this event it seems. One alive will get you scrip and some junk. Two or more are needed to reach the valuable rewards.
---
It’s actually just the torso you need for ore. The +100 carry weight bonus is what having a full set gives you.
---
Atomic shop, contemporary set
---
I was in radiation rumble two weeks ago and was getting seconds per frame not frames per second. Normally lots of piles don't cause that bad of an issue for me but BGS probably broke something again.
---
Ps I'm dumd, thought you were trying to turn off main menu music, fml
---
Is it still available?
---
Seems brighter than standard, but dimmer than bright mods.
---
Yeah I missed the event last year being I bought game at launch and grinding until main story complete but then took a break because I was at 3k over weight being I used carry weight glitch and when they patched I had to drop or sell everything to vendor bots. That includes legacies being I didn’t know they wouldn’t be around. But yeah I took a break and missed this event last year. But yeah the colossus event really sucks we don’t have it yet. I have a feeling they will delay it for the 5th time this week
---
🥚
---
And Lily
---
God, you’re so amusing.
---
I'm not sure, you'd have to check
---
It’s expensive, but if you have nothing else to spend your gold on...what the heck.
---
T-65 is the beat. Between X-01 and ultracite x-01 has higher energy resistance and ultracite has higher ballistic
---
Make new characters, help low levels, run events, play with friends, pvp, and trade. Just playing the game really, just wish there were more quests to do, dailies are boring.
---
Bolstering doesn’t help lol. The armor hard cap is around 450 and that can be achieved with ss armor. Unyielding doesn’t provide any defense besides a few extra dodgy at 30% and neither does nerd rage. If you looked into bloodieds you’d know we die plenty if we run the dmg numbers players like to quote. Most of us are doing the dmg that Bethesda is nerfing is to already. We just run at 30-40% hp so we don’t die all the time. Even then, all it takes is some lag or an event boss to kill us quickly. I can’t even survive a single imposter sheepsquatch melee ATK.
---
I collect armor sets. Currently working on metal heavy set.
---
Killed 11 of them so far.
---
There are sound bugs that occur when you switch from NW to adventure without fully quitting the game.
---
I do miss the PvP servers, it did add a bit more excitement to the game while adventuring.
---
Yea my 2 shot fat man is sitting at 6248 damage. I have adrenal reaction mutation, demolitions expert 6, and nerd rage 3. Also does 50% more critical shot damage
---
More will come.
---
Changing servers worked for me in the past. The tree limbs poke through my walls at my camp and sometimes they prevent me from editing the walls, sometimes they don’t.
---
The pvp system has been addressed (mostly.) Once you become level 5 you are eligible for pvp. In settings, turn on pacifist mode. This removes pvp except for workshops where a griefer or teams of griefers can attack. Most players don't bother with pvp.
---
Consider it a solo multiplayer game.
---
I would like to see more New Vegas Themed items added in Fallout 76, Good Suggestion.
---
i peddle potions to people
---
Just..whgrrgl
---
Honestly I built a similar character to the ones i made for FO3/4, and it works fine. Except for the damn mirelurk kings and high lvl floaters most things are a breeze without a pre-determined build. So you do you and just see what works.
---
I do, that's probably it. That's dumb.
---
Just curious... what was your reasoning for buying 20 copies of the same card?
---
I thought it was the torso and and arms
---
&gt; but, really, it's like you PC players are playing a different game.
---
We've been playing a different game since early 2019. We have people running around with bloodied explosive compound bows (that shoot bullets, not explosive arrows), beam splitter .50 cals, broadsider miniguns, MIRV miniguns, laser muskets, and some weird binocular abominations that one-shot everything. We have flying cheaters in every few NW matches that instakill you with their fists or a combat shotgun from across the map. We have a perk loadout mod. And more recently, we have been the guinea pigs for all the broken new updates. I honestly can't imagine what this game is like on consoles
---
X2
---
Very nice how do you like it? My two shot is at 3200 and it kills players in one shot everytime
---
Friend has bundle but it’s not in the build menu at all.  Any chance it’s from something else?
---
Play a different game, pretty much.
---
Bethesda, in partnership with Alienware, is proud to announce the ZAX-76, the only desktop unit built to run cold for 7601 hours.  For the low price of 2999.00. Comes with a duffel bag!
---
I like to build, love when people come check out my camp. Hit up events, hook low levels up with gear. Just walk about. I'm 1.2k hours in game and still enjoy just fucking about
---
Clap cheeks and drink
---
Glad to help bring a smile to someone today!
---
I had quit it after the original lunch of the new vault dungeon, it was my limit trying to join and then getting stuck in power armor at last moment inside. I rejoined when f76 appeared on steam, and have about 500 hrs in so far just on steam. I missed the event last year too! So I relate. The colossus event is the best grind for those 3 star legendaries, acid and screws. Plus the helmet is pretty sick! But it's like 2% drop rate I believe 🤔 prepare your legacy items! Haha 😂
---
I already know it will be broken. I don’t really give a shit. Why delay when it will be massively broken anyway?
---
That is just weird. What could possibly stop them from simply copying same function from previous Fallout game?
---
Second confession time, I got it the first time I successfully completed the mission. I feel a bit guilty about it. Especially when I hear others hard luck stories. If you’re on PC I could build you some Rad barrels.
---
Don't worry, todd's just waiting for the shipment of lube to arrive. Doesn't need it for PC players since they don't have another party to turn to (that actually cares)
---
Wasn't part of the bundle.

Been like this since the last patch with the dead bodies causing frame rate issues line in the sand. Nuke launching. One violent night all cause issues if you aren’t looting every single corpse

Run the atheltics course at sunnytop ski resort. takes about a minute. You get caps, xp and aid. I think i was getting like 3 or so each time. Start the course. As you run down take care of any traps. no hurry. finish it. fast travel or run back to the top. rinse and repeat.
---
Explosive weapons work best. And no I don’t mean rifles or snipers. I mean submachine guns, heavy guns etc. 
---
Aim at their little thrusters.  Or try your best to spray in that direction. They are easy to break even without the demolition perk. And it will also help make it fly really slow, or make it stop completely and just float there. 
---
I used to struggle a lot with snipers or just pistols. Then I got my hand on a .308 heavy explosive furious gun. And I can finally down those things under a minute. 
---
Also keep in mind that thing flies really quick once you shoot it. So that’s where a fast firing weapon comes in handy.
---
Lol I guess this is the right answer. Problem is I want to play the game. I just feel like I’m doing the same things over and over again.

I slap an Excavator torso on my Ultracite set in Lucky Hole and get 4 ore per pull.
---
Yeah for me, my fallback has always been just camp building. But the same for me, I love my camp, I'd like to rework it a little, which would require replacing the camp and then redoing it completely almost basically the same, but it would only be worth it if Bethesda finally makes atomic shop trees plantable on soil tiles so I can build my underground garden.
---
I had the repeatables triggering up this point, I've completed all current dailies and weeklies except the NW challenges.
---
You have strength maxed and have room in luck?  What is the rest of your build like?  Im thinking about switching to a shotgun build but worried I won’t be able to use many luck points... to keep mutations and such
---
Strangler heart. Dr and er mean very little in pa. There's a 3 damage difference between t65 vs sh/ultracite and t51b from a level  95 behemoth attack.
---
Strangler heart is the only pa with a set bounse, the bounse is small but its there. It also has the highest rad resist which actually does make a difference. That being said you are just as well off with a set of t51b outside of nuke zones
---
LOL, yeah half the time you can't engage in or keep a trade window open for very long. Maybe they should do as u/KingwoodSloth suggested so it's less likely to break something that's already existing. I think we know Bethesda will screw it up if it's possible to screw up, they are the essence of Murphy's Law.
---
On the contrary, I want scorched to take over brotherhood patrols so we have power armored zombies to fight. For the first time since the game launched, maybe then scorched would actually be a challenge
---
I did write a backstory for Grahm a long time ago. Essentially while still turning into a super mutant he fled from Hunterville up to Flatwoods and hid in a barn during a rad storm. He was found by the daughter of family of settlers who were living there. She convinced her family to take him in, giving him a pair of overalls and a shirt (this would actually lead to a new appearance for Grahm, showing overalls with a cable holding up one strap, and a plaid shirt worn open, with armor over it). The father would learn to appreciate Grahm as he scared off raiders, while working in the fields, finding keen interest in Chally, one of the family's Brahmin. One day after the father came across the Scorched, he and his family fled, leaving a note saying they would return one day. Grahm waited....and waited...and waited still...but his family never came home. As he sat there on the front step, Chally would keep him company, the last memory of the family who were so kind to him. Packing up what he could, he hit the road, always wandering, hoping one day to find his family and settle down once more.
---
That will eventually happen, the scorched dead and gone.... Some Fissure sites have already closed, I think once the BOS arrive it will coincide with that part of the story.
---
Also new players keep arriving, so the story needs to be kept for now, for them to understand it and see it for themselves. All said and done I agree but as I said it is going that way.
---
It is confusing a bit. Dont forget to show up during the starting countdown timer to play drums or turn the spit. It gives a boost to the initial start up. 
---
Had an event last night where every station was full by afk'ers and was almost to tier 2 when it started. If you do nothing it starts at 0 and can fail quickly.
---
It wasn't part of the grognak bundle. It was a seperate but related item sold at the same time.
---
I don't what it is, but the faster reloading is just so satisfying.
---
If you're just doing the same things over and over again, it sounds like you're getting bored.
---
This game has a lot to grind, but not a lot of content to play.
---
Do the stuff that entertains you, then when there's nothing left, find some other source.
---
I found a nice quiet pond next to lucky hole mine. Overlooks fort defiance and the Watoga skyline out on the horizon. Great spot for photographing nuke explosions too. I think my rambling days are through..
---
You always do, kid.
---
The Strangler's effect isn't really worth it and the T-65 is still better defense.  
---
I'm usually tuning out the six or so Wendigo that like to claw at my shins until one jumps into my line of fire. Survival is what matters in that fight, so T-65.  
---
Also, lean on energy damage. I haven't put on the Perception Perk to confirm the numbers, but my Gauss Mini does noticeably more damage on Earle than my .50 cal for some reason, when they're normally about the same on everything else.
---
The game got the reviews it well deserved, even if it’s a different game now it’s still a shitty company that continues shitty practices
---
Not being able to hold a AAA accountable for shitty product and treatment of ~~players~~ customers is just enabling them to keep feeding you garbage
---
legacy weapons should be untradeable.. 
---
pretty wild how people have different opinions on the same thing...
---
I was not gonna buy it, but I saw a couple of camps with items inside it, and thought I'd take the bet, because the fence looks pretty sick as well. I haven't built with it yet, but hopefully by the time it do, it is somewhat fixed. I mean, they fixed the water mill thing, so it makes energy instead of being usless. I have hopes for my bunker life to be! 😏
---
This. I remember shitting myself when I saw one in FO3, then in New Vegas, that quarry full of them, man even the blind ones in NV made me run to the closest interiors. I remember one actually glitching in at some point.
---
Seems like if I dont get a plan I get challey's outfit -not the hat. Have so many right now
---
I had to stop my trolling to show respect. This is awesome, great job. I didnt think it was possible
---
Nope not the workbench, argh so annoying!
---
It’s fixed in the PTS right now.
---
To answer the question, just remember this 3 words: "It just works" even if they dont. Also remember how this game started
---
Well ain’t got none so it will be a real grind. I just finally started the collecting rare outfits as I didn’t pay attention to that stuff before and weapons I just used whatever I had weapons for or most damage. So I’m sure I scrapped decent stuff being didn’t know what I had. Lol I really started the weapon and outfit and perfecting the build when I came back in October. I learned fixer plan about two months ago and one night I got the best luck with purveyor. She gave me 3 bloodied weapons in a row and one being my bloodied fixer. It’s 250 damage resistance while reloading and 50 more critical damage. But I love that gun. I’ve tried getting my hands on a legacy now but ppl want to much for them. I have 800 hours in and am level 300.
---
I always find joy in offering great stuff in my vendors. I like to be a camp where you can find very nice stuff for a reasonable price And be save while shopping.
---
because it's easier to gain level when you are below lvl 100, and the xp curve goes up again after a while (I think it's after lvl 500)
---
Home
---
Bringing back weapons that break the game is a horrible idea.
---
bark at them loudly and demand they lower their altitude. 
---
works about half the time.
---
Had something similar happen to me because I started an event team but I was the only one on it, no matter how many times I pressed the button nothing. Left the team and went down no problem first push.
---
I’ve been lucky trading with genuine people in the past, but we definitely need this.
---
I used to make fancy camps, now I have the Red Rocket Garage and Slocum Train Cars so my Camp is just portable.
---
Yeah, it finally worked, but I had to leave my team.
---
I love two step. It's saved me a bunch of bs with my ex and her shady ways.
---
I was just testing to see if there was a limit and went a bit far pretty much
---
Perfect, so weird though, cause our group would’ve 100% bought it if we’d seen it and no one did.  Hopefully it comes around again. Thanks.
---
Shuttup_heather. 
---
Sorry I had to
---
I’m writing a Fallout 76 novel
---
Nah this dude is full of bullshit
---
With any luck it’ll be like deep pocketed SS limb mods or challenge auto complete fix, and not make it to live servers.
---
I miss the free plasma core reload bug and this one will be missed too.
---
What?  Why?
---
tell me about it, i wanna play with the Red Glare, and the 10MM SMMG (Shoulder Mounted Machine Gun)
---
Not garbage if it makes me smile and, shit if that’s the case I guess I love garbage and so does the rest of this subreddit 🤷🏼‍♂️ I mean look at the community and ask them, they like the game and how it plays as do I, if you really want me to compare red dead 2 online is a joke of a multiplayer game and has 1000 more problems but everyone still buys that 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
I run vampires heavy in PA. Full health, high carry weight, and can kill most things in a couple shots. I changed to this from rifleman hunky about 50 levels ago. Honestly, im ready to change again now. I think my fun in the game is getting a bunch of levels saved, then changing to a new build and seeing how it feels and trying to make it work. 
---
Switch your build, if it takes extra rounds dto kill something, so what? Try it out and see how to do better without 20 hours of youtube videos.
---
Well, Deep Pockets will be coming to consoles this week and ultralight limbs are in the PTS now.
---
Bring back the two step goodbye please
---
I’ve been hitting up my dailies pretty hardcore now that I recognize my next grind is gold and legendary modules to get secret service stuffs. That grind looks mighty long too.
---
They do
---
Oh my god I had my radio set to a station frequency that wasn't close by FACEPALM
---
He’s a ramblin’ man.  Maybe he doesn’t want to settle down.
---
As part of a group that has been working on killing without the use or hacked gear or exploits, the absolute highest damage output comes from Bloodied Sneak Commando + buffs. With Blight Soup, Calmex, Ballistic Bock, Psychotats, Tesla 8, Small Guns Bobble, we're hitting for close to 400 per shot. Our last attempt saw him die in 23 seconds
---
I love it. But i do wish vats mini nukes wouldnt vanish from existance lol
---
Ditto on the FPS drop lately.
---
Guass mini does more damage?  That's interesting.  Also many thanks.  Looks like I'll be visiting smiley tomorrow for some gold 😁
---
Easily the best camp design I have seen in a very long time.
---
They use the same mod as combat rifles, scrap those
---
&gt;Legacy weapons are cool for people who got originals but they are market destructive and leave newer players at a huge disadvantage by not having access to them. 
---
Not true, if a newer player gets a couple great weapon rolls they can probably trade up to a legacy.
---
I have a half dozen legacies that I got after the fact.
---
I run 19% health and definitely die due to lags sometimes but honestly not enough to reconsider the bonuses I get from the additional special stats/ perks. I’ve heard differing things about the armor “hard cap”. I do not think it could be that low though because then why would Bethesda even create the T-65 power armor. Gotta be closer to 600... which is what I’ve seen others say.
---
Edit: I also run junkies sometimes on encrypted and that stupid B smokes me at full health too.
---
yep, even if it's just a light like the winter icicle ones and not hangable from wires. it would still be nice to have those.
---
Same same. I am halfway into collecting all of the asylum outfits, especially since I like how they look! Also when it comes to weapons, just get the ones with magical effects, it's the best! I don't play alone, so when it comes to weapon and equipment, me and my boyfriend have double the caps, double the loot and double the possibilities in general. He recently got the minigun with that minty perfect fire rate and magical effect 👌 we can solo SBQ in 20 mins or less without worries that some guy just destroys all the other legendary small bois without sharing. 😉
---
But they never left. Players didn't lose them. The new players just don't get to level the playing field by having access to them and dupers use this as an opportunity to gouge up and comers.
---
Very nice!  Does crit damage help too with this approach?
---
Ha ! I was wondering why the last one went by so fast. Good info, ty.
---
Scroll through reddit
---
Indeed. They have a nice vibe to them. Really like them!
---
They should have been made un-tradeable when they were first made legacies.  However, now that they have been duped and are available on a massive scale, they should simply be removed from the game at this point.  
---
The only other option would be a major Nerf for just these weapons, and I wouldn't trust the programmers to not screw up the other weapons in the game.
---
I've never traded with another player yet only use my vendors, which is a shame as it would bring more player trust and interaction.
---
Thanks very much! You think it's better than my previous one? [https://imgur.com/a/hVThU97](https://imgur.com/a/hVThU97)
---
Why Beckett? The real trick is just to hide Sophia somewhere safe but still within earshot so whatever is attacking just kills itself.
---
The answer isn’t to bring more of them in game, the real answer is to either delete the explosive effect (or remove the weapons entirely) or, as suggested above, make them non-tradeable
---
Pharma Farma as high as you can get it.
---
Fast travel to Vault 76.
---
Go down to Moonshiners, to the Logging, through the homestead, follow the path to Flatwoods, through the agriculture buildings, down towards that food workshop’s buildings.
---
If that isn’t enough, then fast travel to Morgantown airport and do all of the area around it (not inside).
---
Good luck! :)
---
Yes! We're all running the same build with similar gear and using VATS Crit chaining. We're pushing for every tiny little bit of extra damage and hoping to get our run below 20 seconds before patch 22. I can post a video link to my 42 second Solo run if you'd like?
---
look home is where the heart is, so his real home is in his chest. (and now i want to rewatch doctor horrible)
---
Yup I got a couple magic weapons. I break big daddy out when I don’t think the event will complete. It’s a junkies magic mini gun. It’s a beast. I bought it from the watoga vendor. Guess someone didn’t know what they had or idk. Last weekend on one server we had 2 queens and I fought 3 of the colossus at the grove. I had 15k 5mm saved up I had to use almost 12k between all 5 fights. It was sweet
---
That. I got all my legacies threw trading (well other than my Qe rw harpoon but that hardly counts).
---
It toon a long time to get the gear to trade for them. But I enjoyed it. I got a be, Tse, Fe, and Ve gat plasma all threw trading. And before the massive dupe waves
---
Bloody hard call that one lol I'm loving the designs in both and you've honestly made me think about doing a redesign of my own camp
---
Oh okay! I will definitely consider it. 
---
You see I’m very fond of the photograph option in this game and I’ve collected many great pics so far. I would be sad to loose them but if that means I can play again there’s really no option I guess lol. 
---
That makes sense but I didn't know there was a limit of 8 since the outdoor events there are no limits to player participation that I have noticed (there often seems like more then 8 in some events).
---
Why in that first event would it have seperated our team?  We are a team of 2 and I think (but not positive) the other guy was a team leader.  
---
I have to admit that my character, despite being level 160+ isn't the best balanced character for the high lvl events (colossus, SBQ and encrypted) but otherwise she usually does really well. So I really tried but know I do need a few hard hitting machine gunners to help me out. 
---
 3 star shotguns, sniper rifles .50 cal modded, and long range guass rifles (anti armor for all 3 types) and lots of perk cards to help.  Although part of the issue is the shotgun bounce back in npc health and the gauss riffle missing in vats often at 95% chance.  Both hit really hard when they connect and my crit bar fills crazy fast.  But I know it's not the best setup for the hard events.  Trying to figure it out still...find the right weapon for my specs for each boss fight.
---
It's so smiley can disarm his customers.
---
Okay,I will be on after I work today, about 7:45 Central time and I will be up late playing :)
---
But should we have to leave game go to a site and all that hassle for something that should be a cake walk :(
---
Hunt for plans. Stock up on bug parts for Stings and Things. Restock my vendors. Go to yard sales. Treasure maps.
---
YOUR TELLING ME, but honestly with the two shot fat man (Big Boy) you shouldn’t have to vats unless your fighting scorchbeasts, which if they are the enemy in topic, they pretty much have fireproof level 8 because they live in burning acid, so... get one with limb damage? My missile launcher is two shot anti limb, and it always gets the job done, damage wise it does about 130-200 damage to the Queen and from testing on private servers it takes off centimeters of her health and when we’re talking scorchbeast Queen, one guy chopping centimeters every shot he takes, that’s quite a bit
---
Id say remove them entirely.
---
I’m sorry you didn’t receive your Primal Points immediately.  Please submit a ticket and one of our advisors will be with you sometime next year
---
Such a tease.
---
I usually throw my mic on and exit party to tell everyone this stuff as they arrive. I hope it helps some, yet I dont think it always does.
---
I don’t trade period point blank.
---
I'd like to see the score convert to perk coins so each daily earned one and each weekly earned 3 after you complete the season. I'd also like to see the weeklies being all you need to complete the seasons and the dailies as a way to get there faster for those who want to finish the season and start grinding perk coins
---
How does making them non tradeable help even the playing field to new players that don't have them?
---
I got so lucky and a guy traded me the plan for a fixer plan. So happy, I had a plan to trade chally outift for mod but I didn’t wanna do it since I didn’t have the plan. Then I got the plan and the guy already sold the mod. But congrats I will be grinding for that mod
---
For some reason it's about 5 more damage a shot, which isn't a lot, but every bullet counts. It's just odd 'cause on damned near everything else the .50 Cal does about the same damage and is cheaper to feed.
---
Smiley's gonna be a very rich man it seems!
---
Rule 10 pal
---
Put it on imgur and then post the link to the pic.
---
So you mean that it’s likely to be implemented? Haha
---
I have taken down 8 of them in total. 3 of them was on same server on Xbox last weekend
---
I wouldn't hold your breath on the whole this week thing for deep pocketed
---
I went to ubber and left myself spinning on the drums lol.
---
It would keep sellers from gouging people.
---
With a power squash incoming we must expect power creep to come in soon. We have technical 4 star items already what is going to be needed though is lvl 55-100 items, that will  make legacies useless based on the the new math they are going to use.   
---
Now there will be cry babies that are all asshurt but this is common in multiplayer games those that scream the loudest will be the dupers and the dupers selling for real money as their source of income just got slaughtered.
---
They dropped with the PC hotfix.
---
YO MAMA BWAHAHAGAYAHAGAHAGAGA
---
Do you know which vendor typically has combats rifle plans?
---
Cool! 😸 But do you have anymore fixer plans? 🌚 I’ll pay 2k caps for it 🤔
---
No doubt. I expect you'll be hearing from BGS any day now with a competitive job offer 😂
---
I go play and then get bored of waframe. 🙃
---
Crap! That would suck lol, are there any perks to help? This sucks lol but if I’m losing health cause of hunger wouldn’t my healing factor keep me from dying?
---
I'm aware. But I wouldn't hold your breath on consuls getting it this week. I hope it happens. But my hopes arnt high
---
TSE should see a bit of a resurgence with this change. The second bullet will actually gain damage due to addative not multiplicative damage (essentially the thing making everything lose damage inverts for negative effects like 2nd bullet)
---
Just hit Whitesprings....all the vendors are there.
---
I was reluctant to start a new camp after that build and the first couple of days I couldn't come up with anything lol Glad it worked out with this camp
---
I know..I feel ya.
---
No the pitt has an ammo converter that is ALOT less painful
---
Haha too true, I guess I didn’t realize the true disdain for PvP.
---
I just play and enjoy doing it. Camp/workshop building and playing alts. All slots full and every alt is over level 100 and main is 260+.
---
Yes, please post it! :D
---
I'm on the other side, four out of five of my characters have permanent homes.
---
My main's is in the mire. He's been there since level forty or so and he's over two hundred now.
---
I'm just dumping all caps and magic weapons on my bf, he's the dmg, and I'm just mastering my aoe and support abilities, it's the best when he can deal the dmg and I can just make sure he doesn't get staggered by a random bear that wants a hug in middle of melting that SBQ. Also lmao, big daddy, best weapon name I've heard! 😂 Also also, we have the luck of buying few of those god tier finds from vendors that are trade only items, gotta love people!
---
My apologies. Is there a area that this kind of post is allowed?
---
Who is this Graham
---
You've raised the bar as far as I'm concerned
---
Junkie builds are great. Nowadays you negate any negatives by being on a team mutated. Plus you have an excuse to use all that psychobuff you'd never use otherwise. Plus if you have party boy/girl perk maxed vodka gives you 75 max health which is a sizeable amount, more health than a bloodied build will have in total. Instigating works great too on a lot of weapons. Then have an executioners to switch to.
---
[42 second solo run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV5FkTrNQc8)
---
Oohhh i see.  so expert Gladiator is a card I will find in a pack, alongside the regular Gladiator card? (So to speak)
---
If Beth ain't gonna fix it, they better bring it back. It's been an year and a half since they said they would address the issue but no change is being made and I don't ever expect it to happen in the near future. If you are not gonna fix it, let legacies drop again
---
Your ideas are great. What if the robot acted like your vendor but would roam around events? The robot had direct acces to anything in your vendors at home and thus players would be able to buy from you without visiting your camp. Id accept a robot that only delivers letters back and forth. Id still be happy with my own personal insult bot.
---
Might it be a visual thing? Have you earned 1000 score that you’d need to complete the legendary run?
---
I don't know what is viable. I don't have a plan, but I have a balanced non-power armor stealth build. I have rifleman and shotgun 2/3 maxed out and i carry a melee weapon, a 10mm, and two each of shotguns, rifles, and snipers. I enjoy manually removing enemies with the sniper or the fixer at range without being caught, and when my cover is blown, my shotguns obliterate things pretty quickly. The 10mm is for lower level areas to save ammo. The fixer with vats gets the most use though. In stealth it can do almost 700 damage. 
---
I have full health and am gradually improving my armour. I haven't finished the main quest yet so I don't have anything fancy, just a mishmash of things I found. I have the odd bloodied style item, which helps save me at the last second sometimes, but it's more of a safety net than a choice. 
---
I carry excavator power armor for when it can't be avoided, like nuke zones or radioactive ore mining.
---
I can hold my own most of the time in fights, even solo. Melee attackers and radiation are my weak points though, so I probably want to address that. 
---
I have a lot of fun, tbh, and since I am not grinding for the "best gear", i always get excited when I find something good that can improve my setup, even incrementally. I also like how I have to approach a lot of situations with some strategy and not just run in blasting everything to bits.
---
I am level 145 or so, and largely focus on building.
---
You could always use the free time to tackle some Pioneer badges if you still have some left. Or go to some places in the far reaches of the map where you never seem to go. I've discovered some great unmarked places that tend to spawn legedaries that nobody ever seems to go to. They usually require a bit of a hike to get to though.
---
Same here
---
We arnt allowed to speak its name here. But replace the fallout in fallout76 with market and that's the sub. Also make sure you are formatting your title correctly or you wont be able to post
---
The stash capacity doesn’t mean I have to stop exploring, I’ll break things down at every station I come across, and occasionally have to make some decisions but for the most part I can explore 3-4 locations without needing to go back to camp.
---
You got auto deleted for saying the market subs name
---
Yea i would use it during encryptid and SBQ. Id only vats target to try for the critical shot then go back to my bloodied prime gauss rifle to build the critical meter again. Il have to keep an eye out for the limb damage one now.
---
Hate to be one of those!! But I %1000 saw it in the shop in the past week or so. Honestly I'm not even trolling.
---
What about the fact the entire story is given through these but you can’t pause or rewind them
---
I bought it. It is a separate item from the bundle.
---
Shooting the propellers is sound advice. Slows em down.
---
Idk man, workshops put a fat yellow sign in ur face that literally tells you about PvP.
---
That doesn't put weapons in the hands of players for players to have similar damage output.
---
or just get rid of the caps cap and lets us sell stuff in vendors
---
Yeah I was worried about that too so I moved my camp into the middle of the lake by thunder mountain power plant, now no mobs spawn. Haha
---
But when your stash gets full you can no longer loot
---
Yeah my current camp is in the mire as well. but i move it occationally if i start doing stuff in different areas.
---
Maybe this is the advice he was looking for! Don’t be so hard on yourself, mute is always an option
---
Personally i'm just hoping for the Wattz 1000 and 2000 (classic fallout's) laser weapons.
---
A. give us laser weapons that aren't made of paper mache.
---
b. they look cool
---
it would fix market gouging for sure though.
---
There's also pickled scorched body parts in Morgantown Airport. In case... You... Were interested in expressing that passion for cannibalism 🍖🤔
---
I'm shocked.
---
Not everyone has too. I am level 542 and have never needed or used a legacy.
---
They suck vs bosses, they are heavy, their ammo is heavy, they break quickly, sometimes they dont even explode.
---
And you need a two shot legendary to make them worthwhile.
---
If that doesn't sound bad to you then i don't know what you consider bad.
---
Any weapon with explosive legendary stat kills players in a second if they dont have fireproof.
---
I've been grinding out better and better secret service gear for awhile now... It's so satisfying when you start to get a decent set together. The dailies are invaluable to the process.
---
There exists a trading community on reddit where there are trusted go-betweens for really good weapons. I wouldn't have 1/4th of the great things I do without all of that help to make certain that people are trustworthy.
---
I played the game solo until about 4 weeks ago, then a friend joined me. I personally loved it solo
---
It really killed any narrative victory with the main quest that nothing happens with the scorched
---
Maybe try the scorchbeast queen event or the wendigo collosus event that's coming soon
---
Destiny manages it well enough
---
do The Motherlode sidequest in Charlestone, combat rifle plans is one of the rewards
---
Bulk down the junk and sell it at a vendor is generally what I do, for steel and wood I maintain about 150, everything else is 50-100 for the super common stuff (less common or important materials like lead or fiber optics or ballistic fiber I don’t put a limit on)
---
Generally my stash stays around 700, and that keeps me well capped
---
Very good point but I mean I have a whole load out of explosive weapons that I consider god rolls on my level 90
---
Get double chem perk with super duper and convert stims into diluted. You get 4 to 8 diluted stims while conveting one stim.
---
I’m glad to hear that I’m on a good path.
---
I also have found that I really like having that caps alert perk on. Paring it with the bobblehead and the other perk that maximizes your gains? It’s kind of fun. There aren’t nearly enough cap stashes in the world overall though.
---
Good for you my man! And I've had the luck to find those nice minty perfect god tier deliciously amazing armors and weapons! Mostly I just find cursed shovels for 20k tho.. 😏
---
That's one of the best thing that could happen.  
---
I've reainstalled the game last week and it got me again, i'm a junkie...
---
Frequently because the trade menu is buggy, people will simply drop the item on the ground. He's saying he'll usually make people go first to prove they have the item. Problem being that means that other person would have to trust you,
---
I've come to except it being late, only because technically it should, should.. Be a little more polished for console players. I expect bugs still but at the same time it should be smoother for us... Again though, I'm in need of some new content, so hopefully sooner than later. 🤞
---
I’ve never heard this either, but then again doesn’t anything that drains ap also make fusion cores drain?
---
That’s cursed
---
many people i have seen ignore the Spawn, if you wanna help out you can take out some spawn between attacks on Earle
---
I was one of your friends until I tried it during the free week NW was launched. I wanted to hate this game so much, but it's easily one of my favorite games now. Especially since Wastelanders and the world now feels lived in again. Maybe convince them to just try it during a free week or weekend when they have one. I bought my copy 2 days into the free week lol. 15 bucks on Amazon and I feel like I've gotten moneys worth. Heck I'm even a Fallout 1st member now.
---
A shovel for 20k oh man I could never
---
Just go to colossus event, there's always that one guy who is downed 20 times. 🤔
---
I have been in several servers where people went ark at the drums and spits for hours on end. I checked the map after seeing them the first time and they never moved from the spot.
---
How are you being scammed?
---
Myth Confirmed. Leveling in general makes me not want to make a new toon, grinding for additional stuff to fit the new build just makes it worse. I honestly hated every hour until I got to Rosie, and that was lvl 35 or something.
---
I have a second guy that I made for Wastelanders, but I forgot how low your Endurance is in the beginning, and my new hypothetical build requires a relatively low Endurance. I love to hate, and hate to love this game.
---
What’s crazy is that Bethesda didn’t think of anything for this situation so they just said fuck it
---
Heck no lol
---
Were you part of XCOM prior to going into the vault, by any chance?
---
Read the other messages
---
I honestly have only played a tiny bit of Destiny 2 so wouldn't know dude.
---
Nah I'm lazy. Was just trying to help though :)
---
For you, I could sell it for 19k 😏 now THAT'S a steal!
---
One think I have noticed with my limited experience with explosive launchers is that a direct hit deals significantly less damage compared to a “near miss” that catches the target with the explosion. Explosive damage is just coded weird tbh and I wish it could be fixed.
---
The best is playing on a lower population server and having the Prime Cuts missions fail, and then having the 3 pieces of prime meat you couldn't turn in last event spoil.
---
Hahaha oh man, that's perfect reply 😂😂👌
---
Now that the games been out for a few years the main story is over but new players can revisit it as if they were visiting memories
---
I started this game 2 months ago, got a few good purveyor rolls and have been the proud owner of a tse gat laser a be gat plasma and a tse flamer,  I dont see how new players dont have access to these weapons
---
It must be random for each player
---
A decent farm area for combat rifles is Camden park and it also has a weapon bench there to so you’ll never need to leave that area
---
I would also like the plasma caster to be as OP as the one in NV while we're at it.
---
LOL
---
This...  It was sold during the Grognak themed Atomic Store sale.   I have it in my CAMP as well.  I really liked the design.  The only thing that bothers me about it is that it has blood stains on it.  What they should have done is created two variants, one with the blood stains and a clean one.
---
Some of my best memories of fo3/NV were my encounters with deathclaws.
---
I remember my first visit to old Olney and the sewers...holy s$/t it was terrifying, tbh any encounter with a deathclaw was terrifying..they just seem to have lost their edge in fo76, they feel like a minor irritant with yao-guai being a more difficult encounter.
---
If they make them tougher and can slice through even the best armor like its made out of tinfoil that would be a start..even letting them roam in packs would make them more of a threat
---
GREEN MEANS GO!

Have you ever just walked into a station and found that one legendary on the floor because someone couldn't put it in anymore? Or ammo? God, I love these people! But yeah... Car blowing up is the best👌
---
Blowing up people's camps.
---
Not quite what I was looking for, but, THANK YOU!
---
Watching enemies explode when you kill them
---
Bethesda loves this type of pain

Watching enemies explode when you kill theml

Watching enemies explode when you kill them like

I bet he will do it for cheap too.
---
Considering this is one of the few events where AFK'ers can actually have a positive impact you really do have to boogie yourself to the event ASAP.
---
From what I've observed a full AFK team on the drums and spits have the event bar about half way done before it even starts from the accumulated drum/spit effort during the 2 minute pre-event gathering.
---
I tend to travel when I see the event notification and there is generally time on the pre-event clock... so I'm not sure when it actually fires?
---
As a melee build I would have to say scorchbeasts. Nothing is more infuriating than when they refuse to land
---
“Grind” implies you end up with something useful in the end.
---
Nope
---
PvP, try out new builds, collect good legendaries...
---
Oh ok, I appreciate the info, as well as apologize for posting this originally
---
When I loaded into the lobby, I had about 30 seconds to vote on the map, and then the game started.  I had very little time to explore the lobby -- is that unusual?  Do you usually have more time to look around?
---
Its all fun and games until the Whitesprings Janitor takes splash damage.
---
Just learned elsewhere in this thread that while you're health will actually drop it will eventually stop at some sort of insane low number.  So make sure you turn Pacifist on if it's not already.
---
Dunno, usually if I join it immediately, it still takes about two minutes till event starts 🤔 but yeah my best solution for joining the event is that super zoom, works every time! Also I'm content with how much work my boi Grahm is putting, this burps make my day every time I hear it 😂
---
They are bad even with buffs.
---
My non legendary plasma flamer does more damage then a two shot fatman i have for display and it weights only 4lbs.
---
It also doesnt kill me unlike the fatman.
---
The guy who killed me made it to 2nd place before being killed.  He basically went and hid in a tree after killing me, and sat there for 5 minutes.  Not too exciting, but it was an interesting way to experience the game for the first time.
---
In my experience yesterday I had it fail more often than not.   Either the 4th wave wouldn't spawn at all, or it would spawn, we would kill everything, then it would fail anyway.
---
The notification shows up a full two minutes before you can start collecting ect.
---
During that two minutes you can play the drums and turn the spits.  If a few people do this the event starts upto halfway done.
---
To click on the icon easier, zoom in on your map.
---
You can also fast travel to vault 76 and run to the event in about 10 seconds.
---
Then it's a party!
---
What level of makeshift warrior does it require to craft? Does pepper mod require a level as well?  Been looking for an answer on this for a while as I also have the plan but not sure which character I want to learn it on.
---
I did the Overseer/Settler/Raider grind on a character I don't enjoy anymore, and now I'm back to my vegetarian heavy weapons lady who is much more fun to play. I don't think I have it in me to go through all that again, and right now I'm only playing for the score points and Grahm's cookouts. This might be what makes me actually give up and find a new game, like I've been half wanting to do for a year now.
---
You're such a cynic.
---
Level 4, mate :)
---
Mine are built into existing structures.
---
My main is built into that treehouse near the radio station.
---
Oh.  Damn that’s shitty that people actually take your stuff like that.
---
How does the bug work?
---
Is it worth the time? I play on PS4 and the lag I take just from opening up the work menu is horrid
---
This is the only way I've been able to get the Combat Rifle Plan, haven't seen it in the bot vendors
---
From what this says I can conclude your weapons are garbage not a valid opinion
---
Sex is pretty fun. Oh, do you mean just in the game?
---
He better, it’s the end of the world
---
🥳 Unless im on my glass cannon then im fucked
---
I’d also like laser rifle skins to go on Gatling lasers...
---
About pepper mod, im not sure actually
---
Can you buy the rank with 150 atoms? I know it’s not a solution, but you could give it a whirl.
---
100% agree. They need a buff, speed, attack damage... Imagine them being able to climb, like the ones in FO4?! I felt they were even faster in previous games, hearing them catch up when you were running away was one of the best and most terrifying parts of the franchise, half the time I'd not even realise one was nearby, especially in 3. By then it was to late..
---
Meat Week is just super buggy.  I was on one server where Grahm wasn't at his camp at all.  No audio and no character.  No one else saw him either.  At least the event could still complete.  Primal Cuts on the other hand...
---
This is why, for the most part, I dont interact with people.
---
Yeah, between Grahms Meat Cook and Prime Cuts Im always max stash and script. Im leaving legendaries everywhere
---
the FT point does pop up as soon as the timer starts..
---
I usually use the free 76 FT point and walk down the hill.. I also like to get there early to chill and check out peoples cosmetics..
---
Yeah, it's not like unique loot...  
---
I've bought the new miner helmet at a vendor machine, i wanted it so much but the lighting of the lamp is different, it's not focused like the original miner helmet but diffused and it's more like the pipboy feeling... Ruining the atmosphere...  
---
This event is a pain in the ass to me but that's because of the whole dps mechanic...
---
Yeah, there are trading subs where you can build a reputation for being honest and use intermediaries who take each weapon and then swap them once they verify everything is right, but it would be a heck of a lot easier if we could just do item for item in the menu =/
---
Are u on xbox? I just need one diffuser for the badge.
---
Go to YouTube and search captainoob broadsider.  The video where he uses a bloodied one will tell you everything you need to know.  These things are bugged and completely useless.
---
I'm pretty sure they limited it to keep the thing that happens at sbq from happening here.  That is to say that sbq is just hopelessly outgunned by so many people.  By keeping it tighter, theres less crowding in the closed in arena and less competition for damage on earle.  Helping to keep him tanky. 
---
As far as why it separates your team, I dont know.  There were 5 in there for us last night and it put us in our own alone.  So I kind of assumed that the team thing was how it worked.  I could be wrong though as typically I solo so I have no issues getting into the event with people.
---
And nothing wrong with a janky build.  If you're okay with it, it works, and it's fine.  Min maxing is something you do if you want to.  You just may have to accept that a janky build isn't soloing any queens or anything.
---
I wod say it is, I'm a rifleman build, and those 3 points can be used to assign to per instance rifle man to give me 20% more dmg which in turn, costs me a lot less bullets to use, this time and materials I save crafting bullets already make up for the minute I spend in my perk screen, never mind the stimpacks I save cause the enemies drop a lot quicker!
---
Move around constantly to avoid the adds hitting you. When there gets to be too many of them to manage there's an outhouse to the left after you drop down the mine shaft. Standing on top of that seems to put you out of range of the adds attack range so you can keep melting Earle.
---
I believe you're playing on a console. If not, you must've missed my mod I released on Nexus a while ago that shuts companions (and many other npcs/traders) up for good. I personally couldn't stand their chatter too so I resorted to making a mod after a while.
---
Might seem like a stupid question, but how do you find the main discord? Only search I have on discord seems to be for users. Do I need an invite for it?
---
I sort of create content for myself like most Beth games. So I haven’t used the gauss pistol yet , my lvl 20 alt will be a pistol build cause I haven’t done that either. There’s also dailies and quests I haven’t touched for this reason. New camp ideas. I’d also love to rerun the Main quest. Reputation should be shared or the ammo vendor. 
---
Dynamite! Wtf is Dynamite not on loot tables, especially for low levels and the dumb ass floater bases are? It would fit so perfectly looting dynamite off these new human settlers and raiders in The Forest and what not.
---
Stash capacity really isn’t a problem in terms of junk. Just bulk it, make ammo, etc etc and you’ll always have space. 
---
This is coming from someone without FO1st and I loot everything useful when I see it.
---
Ah thanks for the info will take a look!
---
Ahh, that actually sounds good. I think Bethesda could learn a few things from other developers... I'd love them to implement shared inventory, like the division 2. Nice and easy, it can't be that hard. There is no real reason why we can't or shouldn't, imo. I could go on but we both know we haven't the time in the day lol.
---
When the enclave is finally ground out of existence the work of rebuilding can begin. 
---
All the blights of this age can be laid at the feet of the enclave. Their bio-weapons projects like the mole rat, robobrain, and supermutant saw thousands if not millions tortured, mutated, brainwashed, and killed. The concentration camps like the one at Point Pleasant, were factories of death grinding up innocent civilians in the chance of finding infiltrators. Big MT, Sugar Grove, West tech,  and so many other science facilities were engaged in unconscionable research on POWs, mental patients, and just civilians. 
---
All the death suffered from the nuclear war that annihilated the world will be worth it as long as those whose greed led to it  are never able to hurt anyone again.
---
Early this week.
---
My money is on Tuesday...at the standard update time
---
Uhh.. the last dupe wave brought them back in force. And all those "suspended" accounts came back without out any real penalty other than time away from the game (still had all duped items in their inventory). So there should be plenty of them around in the market sub.
---
Once more, with feeling!
---
It’s obvious they don’t know how to do it properly. I’d say this is their first online game but it kinda isn’t
---
There’s a discord link in the sidebar. First option under quick links
---
Thank you, you're the best, may the meat week be good for you! 🍖❤️
---
This is the type of answer I was looking for. I can't imagine trying to play Nuclear Winter on PC and suffering the cheating madness or seeing people with weird weapons.
---
Thanks :) I'll have to figure out which perk cards I should start using then. I play shotgun/ranged sniper so I'm thinking 1 card for sniper 2 for shotgun. Time for a bit of testing though. Thanks for all your help, I'm glad I'm starting to understand it all
---
the notification appear and you have 90 seconds before it starts.
---
SAUCE: me standing with grahm and the notification pops up and it says 1.30 in the top right corner
---
I dont know how the listing works  and I wont claim to. But it was definitely in there hence the reason this post got my attention.
---
Cynics can never be disappointed, only pleasantly surprised...
---
Lmao I was gonna comment “how loose are your trades? Mine are tight”. It’s so annoying people don’t understand the difference between lose and loose
---
Does it show a moderator deletion? It must be a shadow deletion, if that's the case fuck the sub and fuck redit. This site has been going to shit for a while.
---
Yeah it’s typically 2 to 3 minutes. Just keep playing especially if you saw some enjoyment out of your limited experience, you will most likely like it a lot once you figure out all of the mechanics.
---
It does give that option. Maybe you didn't see it or it was glitched for you but it does give it "normally."
---
Craft a plasma flamer and hit a legendary scourchbeast and notice how weak the fatman is compared to the plasma flamer.
---
I can guarantee you the flamer will kill the beast quicker then the fatman.
---
And the reason i bring the plasma flamer for comparison is because the ammo is rare  and does aoe damage, and breaks quickly.
---
They are pretty similar in many categories.
---
On PC, there is the option enter as "solo". It was there 6 minutes ago...
---
You can enter alone on a team...
---
Smh, noone tests anything for fo76 at Bethesda
---
I too am still hunting for the spiced and salted mods
---
Same here, everything I have came from drops or vendors. I don't trust people in general, let alone random strangers on the internet.
---
Go AFK on the drums and walk around outside for a while
---
I run with Excavator and Medic torso. My VFFR 50 dealt 4-8 dmg per shot at 12.3 shots/s and kept me alive. Stabilized + psyhobuff helps a tiny bit too. He is really tough.
---
I ignored the Wendigos and stayed at the drop-in location so I don't run into dangerous things.
---
Broadsiders have been completely broken and bugged to hell since the launch of the game. They are absolutely useless.
---
Totally understand what you mean. If I wasn't a big fan then I probably would of left by now but I'm holding onto hope and putting faith in them. I've played other games, during my time on 76 but I get pulled back in.
---
That's insane!  Ok I'm going to level an alt for this build now XD.  Also nice video btw.  No filler and straight to the point.
---
Ive check every week and day since the end of June I haven't seen it
---
From all the things they're copying over from ESO I don't get why they didn't the trading system. It's literally what everyone here is asking for....but nope! 1st! scrap boxes! One Wasteland! without the QoL stuff ESO got.
---
It's best that you grab a friend just in case, if you or he crashes, then one of you can still do it! But grabing the special megazines and probably grabing a special weapon with the special trait just for clearing out the robos is what makes your life easier. Wish you the luck! 😁🤞
---
If simple logic makes me a Douche then so be it. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that if a title mentions something that you have not experienced that maybe you shouldn’t read it. 
---
Not to mention it is easier to deal with bugs and potential fixes on one platform then three.
---
There are lot of spices spawning at diners
---
Yeah that too.
---
Collectron can be changed to find other stuff, in collectron station menu.
---
(When you have more then 1)
---
So something like that for no voice.
---
Does anyone? I always put shit out for cheap af. I am always surprised by the high prices. Seems like shit would just clog up your inventory, never sell.
---
All I really, desperately want is the r91 and a couple ballistic sniper rifles that that can keep up with the Gauss rifle
---
Also, if you notice there is 3 cards per damage build e.g. rifleman expert and master, each one nets a plus 10% at level one, if you are going on the hybrid route, a word of advice would be 2 1* cards are better than 1 2*, 1* gives +10% 2* +15% 3* +20%, so 2 1* gives plus 20 where 1 2* gives plus 15, what I have myself is 2 maxed out and one at level 1 netting me a nice +50% of my cards and having an extra 2 point to play with cause I didnt upgrade my 3rd one, I use them for Vats limb targeting or glow sight, depending on the situation
---
Was able to trade a fixer plan for it and then next event I get the mod
---
If you want, I'll hop on and do it with you. I'd need to get a card first. I've had it glitch out, but never crashed
---
Edit: I can also show you how to save time doing it.
---
Time to get new friends
---
Good point. I'm kind of a solo player but public teams should make it easier to find a friend. Thank you!
---
Why not just use a courier or a friend to mediate the trade? Not that hard and if either party screws over the other it would not take long for them to become know on trade boards or the other site.
---
I bought it, didn't regret it. I discovered the floating effect depends on the ground. So I built it hanging from a tip, put everything inside and then moved the whole thing to the wanted place. 
---
Again, hang it from a cliff so there's no floor before you furnish it. 
---
It looks good and it has a ventilation on top where I can put the wanderer's chair. She can't reach the guitar there.
---
I would say most players play solo and only really interact with other players via vendors and events.
---
Thanks.  Yes I run medic pump too, and really handy for this event.  I'll try staying the drop location next time.
---
I was just playing NV and thought they could very much add things from that to 76. Weapons, Outfits, maybe some creatures if they can explain it with new lore
---
As someone who uses the dragon regularly this bug is fantastic!
---
I’ve seen a lot of players claim many numbers, but so far I’ve only seen backed math up to around 450. And even then the number becomes negligible at 300-400 because of another soft cap. It’s why berserkers are even able to function. The hard cap isn’t a hard cap cause Bethesda prevents any dmg above 450 but because the cap is based on enemy lvl and there isn’t an enemy currently high enough to make 450+ usable from what I’ve seen. Encryptid blows through everyone for sure. But it’s an actually one-but punch for me at 40% the issue isn’t us being too tanky as much as there are few enemies that deal a good amount of dmg. Last I saw a bloodieds hp at 20% is worth 75% the protection of a food build with no set perks. It’s is only worth like 30-45% of a optimized full health build. It’s a pretty dramatic difference for a bloodied’s ho to be worth 1/3 when the damage is only going to be 3/2 of another optimized build’s dmg output after this nerf. 
---
Those fractions should be the same.
---
Just to be clear, my stance is the dmg nerf is ok, but hp min for buffs should be raised and most armor but unyielding should just be buffed so they actually do something useful.
---
That’s honestly sad that that has to be a thing.
---
What they'll do is create several great looking PA mods but make them all say really annoying stuff, then charge Atoms for us to buy "silent" versions (which mostly work - but not always).
---
Oh wait...
---
Just gonna add, your talking about an aoe type weapon against a solo enemy it’s not gonna be very easy to hit max damage 😂 but do me a favor next time you find a bloodied two shot or anti limb fat man try critting the beast but honestly if you do your build right you shouldn’t need the crit honestly I can take down a 3 star scorchbeast with one shot if I’m accurate, maybe you need to work on accuracy with explosive weapons? I’ll give you the fact it’s a learning curve with the fat mans arc, but dude your talking to a guy who has made 7 characters that are level 80-150 and my super soldier, (my demo build) is my favorite and easiest to farm xp with, explosives are the best weapon I will argue for my love until my thumbs turn to bone
---
Here to help, it's thanks to those that take it upon themselves that we get to collect nuked flora, do the events and get the legendaries! I tip my nuka-cola for your efforts! 😉
---
I know sprinting does, but i havent read anything else about it. Ill have to pay attention and remove my perks for my fusion cores to make it show up more readily.
---
Would not appear on Xbox. I tried several different methods, front and back doors, travelling away and back again, when I tried entering, nothing would happen.
---
   
---
It wasn’t accessible until I left my team. When I came out, my spot had been filled.
---
It **does** have that option.  Not sure why you’re not seeing it.
---
Nope I got the notification that you replied but when I went to look it was gone. You're reply also was no longer in my inbox thing. Just the 1 in my notifications
---
Awesome thanks I have done meet cook at least 35 times still no tenderizer plan
---
Pogchamp
---
What bug is this?
---
I find gauss low damadge
---
No, it doesn't.  I just did the event \[PS4\].  At exactly the hour there was no event notification.  I fast traveled as soon as the event notification popped, which takes about 30 seconds, and there was 30 seconds left on the timer.
---
Perhaps it's sever lag or has a lower priority than the other events on the server but I have never seen it come up right as the 2:00 minute timer starts.
---
Now, this might be a platform issue.  Are you on a PC or a console?  Does it always show up right at the top of the hour?
---
I don’t run bloodied because I don’t feel it is necessary for 90% of the time.  Normally I use a stealth rifleman build with a nice lever action rifle.  VATs works well for me when you add concentrated fire and for the most part I nearly 1 shot everything under level 70 anyways.  I don’t want to be that asshole who kills everything in one shot anyways, that person sucks and is taking away everyone’s XP, loot, legendaries, and most importantly, their fun.  When I’m with groups I have to often handicap myself and not sneak in order to get a non lethal hit in and allow others to as well.  
---
Basically, I just don’t want to be that guy whose trying so desperately hard to be better at this game than everyone else.  I don’t need an intelligence of 60 either.  All of this seems exhausting to the point of ruining the fun of the game because now you’re stuck in a loop of grinding for the best stuff and the highest gains which really don’t mean squat anyways when my buddy whose running a slapped together flamer build without any specific buffs or perks cosplaying as a lunatic firefighter and he’s doing just as good as I am with it and having a ton of fun (more fun than I am it seems) simply because he gets lots of joy out of the crazy cosplay he’s doing with no regard for the legendary loot or XP.
---
It just seems pointless and ruining the fun you could be having.
---
They are more like family at this point, closer than my blood but yea I have other fallout friends for that
---
Vanilla ones you get whether you have the plan or not, other, special ones you need the plans for them sadly. 😒
---
What platform.  I've never seen it show up this quickly on the PS4.
---
Certain plans like the fixer
---
While I do agree, I think that no man or women can wander forever. But I think he could find happiness with occasionally waking around Appalachia
---
Can you get flamers and handmades without the plans?
---
I just did this on the PS4 and I had 30 seconds left on the timer.  Server lag or PS4 issue?
---
I'm just east of Foundation on a random assault spawn, and so long as I check to see if that spawn is up before leaving my camp usually don't have to worry about it getting leveled.
---
Occassionally floaters or the random sheepsquatch spawn into my camp and break the most random items, but worse damage tends to come from super mutant mini gunners who were ignored for too long.
---
Wood walls dont last long against miniguns. Usually tho can go more than a week without needing to repair. And even then it's quite cheap.
---
Also they are all high level spawns.
---
Worse damage seems to happen when I have alot of visitors and they activate the assault and leave not knowing it's just up the hill.
---
In that case I will return to several walls and my generator busted, due to their having been going ham on it while I was out.
---
Done.
---
If you are the team leader, you have to enter as a team, but then the questline progresses for you while doing so.
---
Happened to me too don’t know what’s wrong
---
Right now, run the Primal Cuts event. I played for about six hours yesterday and gathered 150 stims.
---
Welcome to the club (of broken hearted XD)
---
Never heard about aoe farming in wow?
---
Yeah but on ps4...or signed on other instance bs
---
Confirmed and annoying as hell.  Happening on PC too.
---
Bethesda support go to the website
---
Craft your own using Chemist and Super Duper 3. To farm the Tick Blood (which is the hardest resource to get), there are a lot of spots, but my new favorite is the Tea Time event.
---
So my kids (5 and 7) make me play this Roblox game "Adopt Me" this is kind of a Pokemon rip-off. 
---
Sadly, this silly game has a trading system 1000x better than fo76. You both offer up your items, wait for a ten-second count down, then both need to click "accept." Even after that, you have a second or two to cancel. If it is canceled or not accepted nothing happens.
---
As a bonus, you can also click on a player and select "Give" to just give them stuff for free. 
---
All in a silly game about raising pets that was likely made by a single person as a hobby.
---
Bethesda announced on their forum this past Thursday that it should be this upcoming week.
---
Aaaahahhhhhuuuugjhhh fuck this post made me happy, I hope if it’s ever added in it’s actually powerful, like explosive should be a default effect. And it should do wot more damage than the hunting rifle
---
u/unexpectedrunningman
---
Yup, although you only get access to certain cards at certain levels.
---
Wow... that’s actually a really good backstory.
---
They need to fix it or remove it. Things like these are just lazy and another log on the bug bonfire. Why wouldn't they remove it to save face instead of reminding everyone anytime one drops?
---
I noticed the same. I went through 40 purified waters in a few hours of play time.
---
were you logged in?
---
i always wait til 12:15 myself just to make sure
---
Nuke mines bypassing pacifist mode got patched.
---
 Fair enough. Yeah I googled something that showed the dr was a continuous function based on incoming damage so 600-1000 dr would be useless against like a Minigun (6 dmg per shot) but very helpful against a very large scale damage attack like a SBQ wing attack. 
---
https://m.imgur.com/a/Q5ntmvE
---
So it’s diminishing returns but it’s still useful. I dunno though I agree that the nerf is fine but I’m still probably gonna go bloodied. I can handle a reduction in the damage output.
---
I like his snacks
---
Xbox, appreciate the offer though.
---
For thirst I think it has to do with a bug where to need to take class freak off and then put it back on for it to work. I have speed demon and have to do this for it to work and not drain my meters.
---
I actually have a backup notification for this event. It's my clock when it reads :00.
---
Reading your comment made me remember how Jagex went on to abuse that system by giving items a value and only letting you trade items of similar value. I remember their being literally thousands of players protesting. I haven’t thought about RS in so long
---
Nope. Next season take it slower or enjoy the break you can now have till the 8th.
---
The entire set on a chassis weighs less than the torso alone. Why would you do it that way?
---
I don't have any turrets.
---
I never had any ennemis coming to my camp.
---
I'm in the swamps.
---
Yeah imagine explaining this to someone that doesn’t play this game.  “Yeah there’s a weapon in the game that regularly drops that just doesn’t work and it’s been like that since launch nearly two years ago.”
---
yep, others have posted about it. It happens to lots of people on a daily basis.
---
I love the world
---
Without a getting the score? Could be from NW, it often auto-finishes. If that's the case, see how many points you lost and go make a help ticket to Bethesda on how many points you lost, or if it makes up-to one level, if it's for example was weeklies, then ask for enough atoms to level up once. 🤔 Otherwise often you don't see the challenges being done when you're in power armor, so once you exit it, it shows that you suddenly completed them all. 😂
---
Ya
---
The seedy shed is doing this now as well. I used to have two weapon racks covering the back windows, now I moved and it tries to place them behind the shed.
---
Release dates are just jokes at this point.
---
It is back in
---
yes
---
Spawnig too far away - spawning underground - not spawning at all.  Tents - no tents.  It's just broken.
---
Awesome! I'm not on till later but we can meet up sometime. My IGN noahfecksss.  Do we both need a nuclear keycard?
---
There is unreleased teabag emote. Vault boy putting teabag in cap of tea with sadistic face, i need that badly 😔
---
It still shows on my end but does not if I go to another browser not logged in. It's either an intentional shadow deletion or redit is having issues, considering I had to clear my browser to log back in and it's not always the most stable site, either is possible.
---
 Thanks for letting me know 👍
---
I’d swear it’s been increased because I have a character without any mutations with a house on the cliff side south of Graham’s meat week and he needs a drink just sprinting up when the event starts.
---
master race yo
---
If you are on XBOX, you have privacy settings gone awry. 
---
I fixed mine by resetting all settings to the console.
---
If they ever give us the option I'm going to play that very song on a never ending loop at my camp.
---
That song is my jam.
---
Thanks! I'll keep that in mind as well
---
I think the Scorched shouldn't be eliminated.    
---
There's a problem though. Going through and completing Wastelanders is subjective to each character. If I create a new one, then the vaccination doesn't exist. IMO, I think the numbers could be reduced but also new kinds of Scorched. Not just Legendary mutation with NO physical changes at all but a new kind. It doesn't have to be photorealistic upgrade or changes but a noticeable change.    
---
Considering how that new criptid thing used to be human, then the same thing could happen to the scorched. That thing is trapped in the mine. It getting out would be a boring thing. You have an uncontained SBQ who like that thing is activated by a Nuke. Would a similar third  enemy be any different? No, it would be a copy to a degree.    
---
We need something unique.    
---
An enemy that can temporarily suppress mutations. On the offset, there would be an item that could negate that. There could be a very slim chance that after enough damage to a certain body part, it would release and energy that would increase your mutations and temporarily negate any negative effects from them. In essence, a supercharge. That would heal it as well but not like a Legendary mutation health regen.    
---
Maybe you'd have to hunt down a certain material that would be used to craft weapons that can damage it. Similar to Kryponite. A quest which involves meeting a person or persons, finding dead enemies like the Scorch and getting plans by the end of it to create these weapons.    
---
Melee, new types of firearms, ammo, explosives, and even an anchor/net gun.    
---
B/c the Scorchbeast can fly, it would need to be able to as well but be unlike a bat-like creature.
---
No it's 100% a shadow deletion. This subs mods and there's had a big falling out from what I heard
---
Yeah never be logged in thats when its pretty much a 100% chance you get screwed always log out bout 5-10 mins before.. dont log back in til 15 after
---
I was not the team leader in this case.
---
I still believe that the cap and scrip limits are bugs that they still dunno how to fix, no matter what anyone tells me. 😂
---
IIRC, legendary armor with "weapon weight reduction" as one of the stars lowers weight of rifles.
---
Nah they would just inadvertently create a new duping glitch somehow.
---
Still happening months later and freaking disappointing on a double challenge weekend. I don't even know how it's possible to not have this resolved by now.
---
feels bad man.. 
---
this has not been my experience...
---
Was this ever confirmed for all games? Or just Indies.
---
Right. Sounds crazy but you can't blame scammers on Bethesda. At least this time around, let's call a spade a spade. People stink.
---
I'm not a veteran but I've sunk about 200-250 hours into the game since quarantine started and honestly I just trade, farm events, and launch nukes. 
---
I wish there were more quests that weren't boring dailies and I wish there was more of an incentive to do them but the game is fun and I enjoy playing it
---
Nope, just one of us. Unfortunately, I can get on in the next two hours, but can't tonight. Friend me if you want help
---
 now, or next weekend. I run a silo every time I'm on. Ign raskol.
---
I suggest you stop buying from the shop until you hear some feedback from others.
---
Remember in OG Destiny when the Vex Mythoclast first dropped and melted people in the Crucible? Or when Thorn was able to two-shot folks? Or when auto rifles reigned supreme?
---
Ah, those were the days.
---
Are you on PC?    
---
I can make Fixers but don't have the materials for it. If anyone wants one PM me.    
---
My main char isn't a melee and would prefer the plan myself. The only char remotely capable of melee is a level 13 WIP char.
---
Sticks are fine, but LB gets worn out from vats.
---
How do you get scammed just want to avoid it 
---
A
---
I envy you so much right now.
---
“All of the systems that are in this game for balance reasons shouldn’t be in this game.”
---
They are limited time, check bundles to see if they contain any, haven't seen the atom shop yet today but it is definetly possible there is only 1 available atm, updated regularly though so just keep an eye out, managed to pick up the comic books wallpaper I think 2 days back =)
---
Sounds good brother. See ya out there sometime
---
I absolutely never make new alt characters because I cant deal with redoing insane grinds.
---
I'm any game, and this ones aren't even all that bad compared to some games.
---
It will come up, just the game of waiting and patience.
---
Yes, you can get Flamer and Handmade legendaries without having to know the plans.
---
Fixer requires the Fixer plan from Encryptid.
---
Any weapons that have weapon plans sold at Crater, Foundation, and Vault 96 require you to know the plans before you can craft legendaries or have them drop.
---
There's occasional free wallpaper every few months in atom shop, otherwise it all depends on bundles they have on sale and generally just items in the atom shop. Sucks you can't just get a few free plans for regular wallpapers just for caps fr whitesprings vendor or something 🤔😒
---
Yes, playing on PC, but i already have a fixer, need a plan for legendary drops :D Thank you tho! ❤️ If you want Grahm’s hammer, i’ll gladly make you one :)
---
Just lost out on half my dailies today worth 2500. Done on purpose to force buying out levels 
---
u/BethesdaGameStudios_ ? This bug is still active on ps4. 
---
Buy sell X3 from another player, claim a workshop, gold star complete 5 challenges, and level up. 
---
No way I can complete season at 2500 deficit a day
---
ps4, I have one in my vendor.
---
Wont be on until after 4.30-5p EST.
---
People might disagree but any score you keep earing could rollover to Season 2.    
---
Knowing Glitchesda though.....
---
Awesome! I’m shepardmoon on PS4
---
Yep it happens every day. When your logged in at reset. Every day post after post around now. Tested it for myself yesterday. First day I’ve been logged in at reset in the whole of score. And had all score auto complete.
---
Try and wait until you are as close as possible to it then cripple it with rapid fire guns. If you are using a rifle or gatling theres acid please of times where it will pass your head really close whilst flying everywhere vats it with concentrated fire
---
Lol they said the 18th
---
No matter what nerf i shouldn't need to waste 9perk points for maxing out damage.
---
Gotcha thanks! - blew my mind they really only had the one heh. Figured they would have had at least a few stocked up in the wallpaper tab - thought I had to be missing something. I’ll check regularly!
---
I dont know why you are in denial
---
I already told you i have a two shot vats 50% crit fatman and have used it with perks and abused the sneak bonus and it could not one shot a scourchbeast 3* mob.
---
Why should i bother to use this trash weapon when i have  a plasma flamer that melts them.
---
They do kill regular mobs but so does any other weapon so why use the fatman compared to a gauss rifle or a .50 cal? They also oneshot regular mobs and they actually damage bosses, something the fatman does not do, hell it will break multiple times during a fight providing little damage.
---
They are bad and there is a reason you never see people use them.
---
Everytime someone invites me to trade they request all the weapons I actually use. Makes no sense that I would just give em away and if I were gonna sell them it would be through my vendor.
---
World of violence
---
Break the silence
---
Scorched come crashing in
---
Into my little camp
---
Painful to me
---
Shoot right through me
---
Can't you understand
---
Oh, my little Graham
---
All I ever wanted
---
All I ever needed
---
Is here
---
In my camp
---
It means that person puts what they're trading into a container like a suitcase (or drops a loot bag with) first, I take it, and then I will do the same with the thing I'm trading.   Too many people get their item and bug out.
---
💪
---
Disgusting. And you Brotherhood hoarders contribute? You've only had Lyons who brought water, and what was given to him and his pride? Anger, a split faction only brought back together when your human supremacists leader took control. You live under the guise of helping but you only serve your own selfish interests. You help no one but yourselves
---
So fucking intrusive and weirdly infuriating.
---
“Yeah, yeah, I’ll finish this trade with you eventually. But now that I have you in the trade window, let me just inspect literally everything you own in all tabs even though you made it clear you aren’t interested in any other deals.
---
Why’d you close the window after a few minutes? Where are you going? What do you mean the deals off? I just want to see what else you have. Let’s talk about that rifle and armor you already made clear you aren’t selling.”
---
Higher-level Scorched also drop them a lot.  If you run around areas with them, just pick up and scrap their gear.
---
Wow!   Will check out!
---
I think today is extra dailies being auto-done. I rarely ever get it, but today it just happens. Best is to submit a ticket to Bethesda with specific count of lost score, screenshots of the dailies that got completed and demand the score or at very least the atoms to go up one level. It's double score. So people are loosing EXTRA, especially if you REALLY wanna catch up and even that is taken away 😒
---
Thanks everyone for the input.  I figured the FFR would be the better attribute.  The Executioner was the second "good" heavy gun I got.  The ammo was cheap to make so I used the heck out of it.  I will miss it lol.
---
So you are saying the mods on here are petty, petulant little children that need to grow the fuck up? Makes sense now.
---
I wonder if any of them are part of the conservatory of the list of mods that mod for dozens and dozens of subs that have been called out for bias?
---
Could rationalize that with the scorchbeasts numbers being depleted that the deathclaws start to wildly gain in strength now that their not being eaten by them. 
---
Could phase in smaller softer more frequent scorchbeasts after
---
A simple barter system would be cool between players. You put items into a Q and wait to confirm the total trade. Ex: if your giving someone 4 legendary weapons for a a new armor set. You would just both put the items into the Q and when both players confirm the trade it goes through.
---
I have the same kind of friends. Most of them liked the fallout franchise more than I did. What I’ve realized is there’s no point to forcing them to play or like a game. Even if you think it’s best for them, they probably won’t enjoy being forced to play relative to eventually trying it on their own accord. It usually leads to immediately looking for criticisms instead of being more open minded.
---
I recommend making some friends within the community. There lots of other people who are cool and are in the same boat as you. You can look on here, discord, or Facebook. Maybe even just use a mic in the open world and see if you meet anyone that way if you want something more organic.
---
That's sad. It's really fun to use it.
---
I blame the phone, but that should have said unknown plans to the top of the list. Sorry that wasn't immediately obvious from the context, but it's the plans I don't know that I'd like to see first.
---
It’s safe to assume all the updates are just TBD until we actually get the update available for download. None of the past content came out on its initial date. Not complaining simply because sometimes it needs more work but when it’s a reoccurring theme each time thats a whole different story.
---
Lmao dude 😂 i wouldn’t be using it if It wasn’t good, i literally made this player trying to find out the best weapons so go try somewhere else and if your talking denial look who’s talking mr. Closed mind
---
Why didn't I think of that, will give this a try I've atoms burning a hole in my pocket... Thanks! 😊
---
Are you on PC? Do you have anything from Meat week before I know I have one Chally Head I can happily sling you if you are on PC. (i am going to sleep now as its past 2am AUS time)
---
I’m the same. Have respecd a few times already on my one character. I fear that this will no longer be advisable once legendary perks are released - judging from reports of the PTS. Unless you choose to forego the new perks that is.
---
The end game (for many people) revolves around camp building and trading/searching for gear.
---
The trading aspect and the camp aspect have so many issues there is no way anyone with any decision making abilities at Bethesda understands or plays their own game. It appears they  are so clueless I am certain it has to be done on purpose. They truly are Vault-Tec performing experiments on us.
---
Starting over from level one when you have one friend who likes the series and hates online games. I've made a few acquaintances from playing but nothing consistent for grouping. I've asked for helping in power-leveling twice over the past year and no one has offered.    
---
It's quite boring and the argument that 'learning a new playstyle' would be bad if done like that.    
---
I finished Seasons two nights ago. I managed to get the Marine Helmet in a random drop. I have the SS underarmor with Shielded lining. No SS armor as I'm no fan of random gear effects through crafting like is required.    
---
Getting a "Troubleshooter's Knife with 3 ranged effects is stupid.
---
Lol I have been following the updates but thanks
---
He doesn’t. 321 is the base damage without any perks at all to boost it.
---
Good on you! Just be careful, next time the colossal may put a stealth boy too and dissappear in the floor 😏
---
I must have by now, been killing mutes like crazy with cranberry relish and inspirational. I'm going to buy the last bit with some Atoms as someone just suggested and be done with it 😎
---
Good point! Hadn’t thought of it that way—the five pound difference between making a full set and the torso alone has apparently never presented itself as enough of a stash/carry problem to make me try to save the weight.
---
Make sure a few in your group run crippling perks like tormentor and one gun army. Keep the legs crippled so he moves less.
---
But they keep setting dates. The Road Map is trash now.
---
They work well against other players, probably the best weapons in nuclear winter. PVP in adventure mode has a damage cap, so that can make it frustrating
---
I know What your saying I agree 100% it just kills me to see people I know would like it just completely shun it
---
The real boss in the Wendigo cave.
---
That is chaining the confused and angry emotes.
---
In the same boat my man, got 1 friend that's been playing since day 2 same as me we play almost daily (especially since lockdown). Got 2 friends that just read into past reviews and won't even listen, their loss I guess.
---
If your accurate with it your gold, it’s a learning curve
---
I did that with the concrete igloo and I have since decided I like it, maybe give yourself a minute to warm up to the notion
---
Both of my toons that can use them use Shotguns, primarily because they can cripple Earle's legs very quickly through Enforcer and can one-shot the Wendigo Spawns.  The latter might be part of a "magic" effect though.  It's hard to say.  I also usually trade Bloody Mess for Grim Reaper's Sprint so I can keep VATS'ing and killing.
---
If I stick around and just loot the Wendigos instead of trying to escape (there's really no reason to escape), I usually end up *ahead* in terms of ammo, which is nice.
---
When Earle casts Fear, you *can* steer yourself around with the mouse.  It seems like a number of people don't understand this, just because WASD stops working.
---
Being Bloodied, the main threat I face is the collapsing ceiling.  This can be a really cheap mechanic because the damage box sometimes begins and ends without the visual.  So, you really need to keep your Stimpaks (ideally Super Stimpaks) handy to counter it when it happens.  Power Armor folks can seemingly camp under it forever.  Also, I don't think it's entirely random - there are spaces where it happens, and you just need to remember where those are - none of which are in the middle.
---
This battle will change pretty drastically if the PTS changes go through, though, because people will find it much harder to one-shot the adds... and needless to say, there are a *lot* of adds.  But it's also a consequence of damaging Earle.  If you get someone who melts Earle, they seemingly generate a lot more adds at once.
---
Honestly, I don't know why anyone would need to scam. The Fallout community is one of the best communities I've been in. I've been playing the game for just over a month and I can't count the amount of times players have helped me, or if I want to trade stuff for an item I want, a player just gives me the item I want and just says not to worry about giving them anything back.
---
I guess so.. it is.... what it is.....
---
If you cant fight off the enemies at lvl 60 you either lack good weapons or you do something wrong.
---
Spoilers for anyone who hasn't finished the quest:
---
I really fucking hate Emerson. I was hoping to God that we could kill him. And then I made the mistake of not transferring Athena into Artemis because I didn't go through all the dialogue choices. So now even though I don't like too, I lock the door in my camp so he can't get in. I feel bad because now people can't use my craft benches but he's too annoying.
---
Just don't be stupid. People that fall for simple scams deserve it.
---
Thank you. I wish I could have downvoted more than once to get more.
---
Um... they already added them back (on pc), and the patch is coming to console soon
---
Yeah but Jagex actually listened to their fans and removed that system
---
Good shout.  I know cripple on the queen is bugged so this is good news.
---
I can confirm it's the mods being shit heads. I mentioned the other sub on another post and it's quarantined so only I can see it. I think some of them need some therapy or something for being such petty assholes.
---
Maybe wait till it comes out first eh
---
I cannot stand the radrats. I have to use VATS to kill them. They do surprisingly alot of damage and they just keep coming after you. Annoying!
---
I think it took them over a year to do so, didn’t it? And did they ever put the wilderness back? I remember that was taken in the same update
---
Thanks again, it worked 150 atoms and I'm finished. Thanks for the kick up my butt 😎😊
---
And they don't believe you when you tell them about the absolutely amazing moments you can have in this game.
---
Hitting Sentrybots in fusion cores with crit damage. They go boom. I chuckle.  Hitting all the cars at Valley Galleria till your screen goes nuclear winter white. 
---
In fallout 4 fav was popping enemies out of power armor via exploding the fusion core.  I do hope I can do this with the Botherhood expansion coming up.
---
I’m hoping to stick with bloodied, but I rarely go to below 20%, especially now that daily ops is going to be the new grind. There’s going to be a lot more content that will mean ongoing swarms to deal with and it already seems like the colossal is almost impossible for a non stealth bloodied. So not sure what will happen when those players are also dealing half the damage.
---
There’s a lot of problems with the explosive launchers, specifically the missile launcher, fat man, and broadsider. The 2 grenade launchers don’t seem to suffer nearly as much for whatever reason. 
---
1. Some big boss-like enemies have insane explosive resistances so you’re essentially tickling them
---
2. The damage indicators lie all the time with these weapons and show extremely low numbers despite doing more damage to the health bar. My theory is  the low numbers you’re seeing are the impact from the projectile itself. This happens to me a lot. It’ll show like 1, or 2 on the screen but will take out a big chunk of health. It is what it is.
---
3. The damage on the pip-boy is lying for these 3 guns in particular. See below for a comment I made a while back that explains this better
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/gvp55e/bethesda_why_does_the_missle_launcher_40mm_and/fst1c3b/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
---
Once they are released, we can let you know.
---
Due to my life schedule I dont get to login till atleast 15min post reset, usually 30min. And I'm def not on beforehand. Never had the autocomplete bug yet. I also dont touch NW. I always login to my private server first too. Not sure what effect that has.
---
Yeah i put her in my chinese stealth suit because so I could make a higher level one and was like, oh...you...kinda have a dump truck lmao
---
Man...this whole time I was wrong 😥
---
*While staring at me in the front door and not moving so I can't fucking get in my house*
---
"Hmmm hmmm, hmmmmm"
---
I've taken two characters through the wastelanders quest, a junkies and a new bloodied. I won't do it again
---
Ya thanks for pointing out the obvious!
---
Honestly I can see where you coming from, but I rarely ever have any crashes or lagg anymore. You should look into perhaps playing with settings somewhat. I mean, if it was just the meat week event, even owners of private servers, that have no nukes or other players making it lagg wouldn't crash, but they do anyways. My bf been having problems of randomly crashing inside the colossal cave. Then other day, there's no crashes randomly whatsoever. Other times I'm crashing before I even open the game 🤔 I think it could have something to do with people in the server using magical weapons, perhaps spamming enemies in glass caverns or just Todd wanting attention. Sometimes it just works. But honestly, no game is worth to get frustrated over, we play it for fun afterall! 😊
---
I still want them crocs from Whitesprings
---
Who would this Lyons be, sounds like someone who won't be born for another 100(ish) years.
---
Besides even IF I were to accept that all our preservation of knowledge was for nought, which I don't, it is still  better to add nothing than to take everything.
---
Honestly the biggest problem solo is being able to do enough damage with certain builds.
---
I would love to use a lever action, but I've been stuck on my same bloody commando fixer build for 140 levels. I only use the flame bow for team events, but I've never found an upgrade over the infinite vats fixer build with bloodied.
---
Awesome to hear, glad it worked!
---
I'm in xbox but if they release mods in console like some suspect, that's the first one I'm getting.
---
Gosh this is a simple yet brilliant idea. Bring back the New Vegas Courier eyebot.
---
Go play or do something else.
---
For me, it was a Splatoon Splatfest weekend so I did that instead.  I haven't been doing Prime Cuts, not just because of the completion bugs, but also because there's no point given how we can complete Grahm's Meat-Cook super quickly before it even "begins."
---
If there's one thing I don't need more of right now, it's Scrip.  With the paltry 150 daily limit, the fact that Scrip always begets Scrip, because 95% of Legendaries are garbage, becomes a rather annoying problem.
---
Great to see that Grahm sharing positivity is making other people positive as well! 🍖❤️
---
That's probably the only way to do it, yeah. Wonder how that would affect the sound effects and stuff though. I'm sure you could lay that over the dialogue.
---
Finally got my first legacy in this game, I guess. A camper.
---
Every ally won’t shut up. Friendly NPCs not shutting the fuck up is a major annoying problem in 76 and 4.
---
Bear arm, tenderizer, fixer, any of the secret service weapons (gauss pistol, shotgun, minigun) and armor all have to have the plan learned in order to get then to drop from the purveyor.
---
No clue haha
---
Wish I saw this an hour ago... Rip 3k of score. 😔
---
Sometimes it just is legitimately out-of-reach.  I think it bases its elevation on where it spawns, or where it considers the highest point in its flight path to be, and if that point is the Top of the World, for example, it's going to be impossible to hit until it goes up the mountain.
---
Try the trading subreddits
---
Yeah that update killed the game for a lot of people, but wilderness is back, OSRS is still heavily played today.
---
That makes sense.  I figure too that it should lag out less if they keep the numbers smaller...especially since there are soooo many spawned mobs to deal with in such a relatively small space.  
---
Weird that most people were soloed if there is allowed at least 8...that should be a min of 2 people.  But it was weird to have been separated from my only team mate.  Next time I think we will try to port to other players in the area and try to see if we can fill the arena better.  We like teaming for the extra serum boost and drops.
---
I don't mind my setup mostly but it still does need to be tweaked a bit.  Not bad except the bosses.  So I do wait to start most events until there are enough for me to be comfortable.
---
My newer character will be a very different build from this one.  I'm trying to maybe go more heavy guns or something.  I'm open to suggestions for a good build.  Still only lvl 7 and lots of perks to unlock.  Sort of thinking melee (still debating 1 or 2 handed) and a heavy ranged gun or automatic ranged.  But I need to look to see what perks are in what so I can get a good balance.  For big bosses does energy seem useful at all?  Just wondering if that should be a consideration or not too.
---
The roadmap is really 2020-2021 if anything. I remember thinking there’s no way they get that all out before the end of the year. Which again, it’s fine if it’s needs more work and all.
---
My main is full health instigating with perfect stealth. I walk around one hitting it all, kind of fun and saves a lot of ammo. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul5HbhNTyu8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul5HbhNTyu8)
---
Chemistry station, or you know, get better dr so you dont need them. I sell about 95% of the stimpacks i pick up to the vendors.
---
It pretty much does. One simple exception added to the code (I.e. If character level &lt;50, disable perk scrapping) and “gaming the system” will be near- impossible.
---
They will spawn at your camp is you have any type of resource or generator, the generator can be fixed by doing this
---
1 but generator on spring trap, any one doesn't matter.
---
2 pick up the trap and male sure the generator is also moving, if not fiddle with it a bit
---
3 place trap with your generator where you want it to go
---
4 connect a conduit to the generator 
---
5 trigger the trap.
---
Now the conduit has power, even though your camp doesn't have a generator. I have tried this trick in a couple of different locations and it seems to stop mobs from attacking your camp.
---
As for the resources aim all your turrets in their direction, missile turrets are the best and you should be good
---
Cazadores must return to put fear back into the wasteland. If you saw a red dot on your radar moving left to right faster than you can aim, that's a big old nope in front of you. With how vats works now and doesn't slow down time, cazadores could straight up cheese vats simply cause of how fast the move.
---
I’ll subscribe to this. I hope you’re right. Would love to see it added to the game.
---
Funny, I posted something about this a couple of days ago, and had several people tell me that it had nothing to do with it.
---
Don’t know why they couldn’t port the menu from 4. Even that would work.
---
Yup. Redoing is basically required. It’s dumb, but it is. Hate to see it.
---
Probably TS, AA, And Quad I guess
---
Anyone that I fight is only skilled enough to use a gat plas so that's what I end up switching to and its just spray and pray back and forth.
---
It is for the scrapbox and survival tent. I am subbed when I am playing the game regularly and cancel when I'm not. It isn't like it's a huge expense. And if it is one for you, then you probably have other things you should be prioritizing.
---
It depends on the weapon, like the QE double barrel is probably the best PvP shotgun in the game.
---
I think a Mothra sized Mothman would be an awesome new enemy. Ideally as a nuke boss
---
I have inspected hundreds of items in the atom shop and never once bought something by accident. Maybe try not spamming the button when it doesn't instantly appear
---
Same, I logged out and closed the game every day and completed the run yesterday.
---
Staying logged in today 5 challenges auto completed, Bethesda really need to get it sorted out as the Run is one of the main things to do now and like just about everything else it's broken in some way.
---
I live in WV and its absolutely beautiful here and you wont find nicer folk, if you want to move somewhere for the peace and quiet I'd suggest looking at the small towns here like Cabin Creek or Paint Creek. It's closer to the south of the state and theres plenty of land between you and your neighbors. If you want a city to move into all I have to say is good luck.
---
I’m not. I’m PS4. And I have won some bits. I didn’t mean to imply I’ve won nothing. I really appreciate the offer but even if I was on PC, I’d decline as I’m not greedy. Just having a rant is all. I just wanted to see what my hard work would earn. 
---
And it’s things like this that keep me coming back. This is largely a great community.
---
Definitely need a "my shit is glitched" emote.
---
Thanks.  Yes being bloodied I died a lot more due to the surroundings.  Which would be ok usually, however staying alive guarantees not getting bugged out and losing rewards.  
---
I hope in the PTS they fix the drop area collapsing when you respawn and Earle is killed.
---
as well as both ghoul and Super mutant, id also like to see other subspecies. like Robobrain (since lore-wise they CAN use any and all weapons) and de-hived scorched
---
How could this be done without undermining what Bethesda are doing on the test server? One-hit killing in group events can suck.
---
Hunt for three star legendaries. I don't know about anyone else but ever since meat week started out of ten three star legendary enemies I have only got three three star legendary weapons or armor on average.  Everything seems to be dropping only one stars anymore. So glad I had some extra in the bank, turning in one star things to the machines to Max out my daily scrip takes forever!
---
That is way too obvious for a online fallout game
---
I have a VE gat plas and I just got my ass handed to me by a BE laser rifle
---
The lack of half vert walls and roofs drives me bananas
---
I’ve been wondering the same cause my character has been so damn thirst way to often.
---
Poor Earl's buttcheeks.
---
I always try to set all that near my vendors. More people coming through means opportunity to sell items and empty my stash. Stay away from my purifiers tho
---
Deathclaws are going to get more difficult when they get the Lv. 100 variations in the next patch, and everyone deals less damage.
---
Although, being melee, and having very predictable spawn points, they are still at a big disadvantage to guns.  This is one thing that I believe should happen after the rebalance - is that I want to see spawn points more randomized, or enemies more prone to mill about and make their positions erratic.  You clear an area enough times, you just *know* where the threats are.  You've got to take that away from the player.  I want to be walking down the road in the Mire and then suddenly, BAM, Deathclaw ambush.
---
That's actually a bug, we used to be able to break camps outside of pvp but they removed that, not sometimes you can damage a camp and itll show number. But those numbers arent accurate to what you're actually dealing, they act weird sometimes.
---
Yeah. And I know I won’t quit. I did before but I wasn’t part of the communal side of them. Now I am I really love how awesome people are and tat alone keeps me coming back. 
---
I’m hoping that investing in an SSD might make a small change. But I’m hoping it’s just bad luck today and I’ve been unfortunate. 
---
I just wanted to rant about it. Get it out of my system, you know?
---
Anti materiel rifle!!!
---
FFS it starts at the top of every hour how hard is it ?
---
But I'm thirsty 😔
---
My missle turrets were lv60 on pts today.
---
I always find a way into people's camps. Photo mode is your friend
---
Thanks for the update, I play on console. Logged on today and saw my camp was still messed up haha. Did they note a specific day the patch is coming?
---
Not to hijack the thread, but one note about healing factor: I love it too, but for me (and some others), it seems to be the main source of the fast travel bug, so I’m running without it for now. (Re-spec’d it out a couple weeks ago and have had the FT bug only twice in that whole time.)
---
Honestly wish we could be able to place them *as* a wire.
---
True dat, but there should be a system where you can unclaim a workshop without having to go to another server.
---
Likelihood of it coming out with a ton of bugs? 100%
---
Is there something that gets overwritten by the game sometimes that breaks some mods?
---
This insult made me chortle
---
&gt;With wastelanders vaccinating the survivors who have come, there's no  reason for the scorched (not entirely the scorchbeasts) to remain  threats
---
I don't think you've been living in the same 2020 as the rest of us.
---
Both factions, after all, *refuse* your help initially until you prove it to them.  Because apparently, neither of them noticed the Scorched, the ash corpses, or the *giant bats* on their way into Appalachia.  And settled anyway, building their large fortresses, all while a plague was killing them off.
---
I do the cookout every time it pops up. Primal Cuts is just a ammo sink unless you can manage a legendary spawn, but I still do it at least occasionally for the meat. On PC they are all pretty well attended.
---
I found him at a shed with a hanging radstag right outside the flooded trainyard.
---
Even Diablo 2, a freaking game from 2000 or 2001 had it. And that's only one I know of having played it myself.
---
But that's my racket maaaan
---
I usually don’t  buy from vendors who don’t put at least one station and stash box nearby.  
---
I also don’t glitch enter areas that are locked.  I figure if the owner wanted me in those areas, they wouldn’t be locked 😉
---
I like that. I’ll have to make one.
---
No. It's not fine. When they set the date and started taking money they made a commitment to the players. The Road map is literally designed to map out the year. Just because it needs more work how does that make it fine? No! It's not fine!
---
Also sheep staff/club/crook
---
There's no doubt in my mind it's the biggest contributing factor.
---
I put a one random workbench for scraping all the time for a quick scrap when I need it myself, but when I had a locked room with my main aesthetical Mothman cultists kitchen full of workbenches, some guys would pretty much force me to come and look at them clicking on the bench through the window just to show that they can get it. Safe to say, I bought those curtains, but not for the first floor. 😒
---
PvP Damage is capped at 110 per hit. I don't usually PvP so idk what the typical health pool is, but the rate of fire on 99% of rifles means that they will kill someone significantly faster than a fatman would. This is also super true of Tesla's which arc to people and with FFR can fire very quickly and explosive lasers, where each pellet counts separately against that 110 damage cap.
---
edit: also, people will frequently use Sentinel and Assassin armor in PvP and those can basically remove player damage entirely. You want a high RoF weapon to counter those because they don't trigger on EVERY shot. To use a fatman is to gamble that it doesn't trigger on your one chance to kill them, since you'll likely be dead before you get a 2nd shot off.
---
Ah yes forgot about those I never use melee lol
---
Can't you spare some water, I'm definitely not gonna re-sell it to a vendor 😕
---
I don’t even have a building it’s just a floor and a staircase to max camp height of megasloth rugs
---
Yeah, it’s weird.  Since the latest update, I had it happen during Line in the Sand a few times, and thought it might be due to all the meat piles.  A few days ago, it happened alone at my camp while repairing armor after Colossal.   Did not happen during Colossal though.
---
Don't be so mad bruh, there are non-trap camp reasons to use flamers:

---
i've had it for months and only had the fast travel bug like 3 or 4 times and it usually is only the once it happens
---
I always have this idea of what I want my camp to look like, always ends up being a rectangle tho lmao. I'm very uncreative.
---
The wow system is flawless.  You open a window, you add something. The other person adds something. You hit okay, your side changes colour, they hit okay, their side changes colour and it goes through. Any movement of anything after hitting okay reset its.  You both have to agree to everything before it will go through.
---
Same here. I was online once at reset time, and I got the bug. After that I always logged out 15 minutes before the reset and I logged in 10+ minutes after the reset, and the bug avoided me. I just finished the Run, 10 minutes ago.
---
I didn't see one for a really long time. Like 450 hours in game. Then I fought three in less than two days.
---
A camp object that can cure disease would be nice too, something similar to the sulfur fountain from whitesprings, we can do just about everything else at our camps.
---
LOL!
---
it happens now and then.
---
Um why not? U want max damage u should have to devote a significant part of your build to it...
---
Everyone I've been in the savage divide that's happened
---
As far as a new build goes, I'm partial to junkies heavy weapons, but I would wait and see what the pts brings us about the incoming damage adjustments.  Builds that work now may not work as well later, or may need tweaking.
---
That said, heavy weapons are nice as they offer solid damage with large clip sizes and have perks to deal with the heavy weight thing, as opposed to rifles which are reliant on wwr armor.  They do consume ammo though, so be aware of that.  Heavies also have the option of benefiting from power armor in the stabilized perk so you can willfully extract yourself from the armor trade until you get your weapons squared away.  That said, their dps is generally a touch lower than auto rifles in exchange for the bigger clips and longer bursts of sustained damage.
---
The last thing on heavies is the variety.  Flamers for frontal AOE on things that are hard to hit or clusters, cryolators for holding down bosses, gatling plasma/laser for high rof and big clip size, miniguns for magic and dps at huge ammo cost, lmg for assault rifle like action, gatling gun for solid reliable damage at a manageable rate of fire and very ammo conscious, harpoons for sniping or shotgunning, gauss mini for huge damage and accuracy, .50 cal for solid damage accuracy and range at respectable costs, etc.  Heavy weapons builds are the only builds I know of that consistently have several weapons at their disposal at all times.  I personally carry 12 weapons at all times and enough ammo to put them all to use.
---
As far as energy weapons go, they tend to be on the more fragile side and their damage is about average.  That said, the gatling plasma is surprisingly efficient in ammo due to plasma cores being what they are.
---
And the Tenderizer? It can be legendary from now?
---
Agreed. I finished main character on Raiders, and my alt on Settlers. Not doing anything like the rep grind ever again.
---
I think that legendary perks being character bound is a pretty clear sign that Bethesda doesn't really care about alts, which is strange when you see the Champion point system used in ESO for example.
---
We don't even have a secure way of transferring stuff to an alt without having to rely on somebody else ffs.
---
I only have one character and I do care because I agree with you and feel sorry for people who do have more than one character.
---
The collectrons, a fridge of some kind, rainwater collector. Basically the stuff that actually functions is all useful in its own way. 
---
The prefab buildings are good if you want an option for throwing down a shelter fast.
---
that would be great, little fountain of youth or something like this.
---
Understandable honestly! This game has so many downsides sometimes that it feels like having a toxic relationship with Todd. But lately I just try to focus on the good sides of the game and look for a solution to everything. But I really suggest you look up if it's not a pc problem that's making it worse than it is. Game doesn't look that amazing for what it requires, but I think the bugs make it so that you need a pretty decent pc just to play it for 30 without a crash 😒🤔
---
I need this in my life
---
I've been asking for that since launch and it would be nice if they throw in the selectable ammo as well. But given that current state of the game I not gonna hold my breath!
---
I even realized having a front door was extra
---
A *lot* of people wanted a Mothman Cult questline.
---
On my text RP server we’ve been doing our own cult stuff, lots of people enjoy that stuff. Maybe we’ll be lucky and get it after BoS. Cause we have no idea where the game is going after them.
---
No insults intended, just honest assessment.
---
I have different goals for different characters. 95% of what you get from plan venders requiring gold aren't something I'd care about on an alt. I'm only going for 100% plan completion on my main so gold grinding is a requirement. I have an SBQ tank alt and soon I'll have a story alt who I'll play through when all of these major story add ons are updated.
---
Gold grind is part of the game but it's not the only part and wouldn't restrict s new player unless they had a desire for 100% plan end game.
---
Yeah, this event is kind of unpredictable when it comes to death.  In one case, where I died after Earle was dead, I was respawned in the middle of the Forest and the game prompted booted me from the quest because I was no longer near Monongah Mine, which meant no rewards.
---
I’ve tried swapping it out and back on, not sure it’s worked. And wouldn’t that also affect hunger?
---
I thought it doesn't drop as a plan so it can't be legendary? Maybe i am wrong
---
Edit: alright I was misinformed. It does drop as a plan. Ty for clearing it up!
---
Pull a karen on them, thats what i do. Or use my gatling gun. Both are equally effective.
---
Sometimes you fail just cuz life, sometimes you fail because you have to sprint all over to kill the primals, other times you fail cuz there's 3 AFK guys standing and you're the only one putting effort and sometimes it just takes too much time for the quest to proces progress. It just works. 😒
---
I’m a dirty console player. So no excuses I guess?
---
Mileage definitely varies, good to know it’s not hitting everybody equally. 
---
Do you run bloodied or something else?
---
Well done! That plan is rare, I doubt I'll ever get it myself
---
Ditto? I want to know!
---
Honestly I'd be happy if at least they didn't auto complete on double score event 🤔
---
Did it in the savage divide twice yesterday on my PS4 with a bunch of players and we completed it successfully.
---
I'd say I'm 85% solo. However, many events require some community input and you'll find doing certain events easier and much more fun as part of a group even if that group organically forms on the map. 
---
What I do is keep an eye on large discords and see what they are doing. If they are doing something interesting I'll ride the coat tails quietly. That goes for SBQ and Colossus events specifically.
---
I think I still have my account, it’s got like 30-60m on it. Has inflation gotten so bad that my money would be worthless now?
---
I thought the rule on Queen melting guns was let everyone else get her to mutate then you can melt her.
---
Definitely more of a thinking planning style of pvp than excited charge into battle style.
---
You're done for, here, have this atoms bundle with sale for just some cash to make you feel better. At least you crash with style 😂😭😭
---
Oh yeah! That’s a awesome idea
---
Keep in mind they are vaulting the original D2 story next season. There is supposed to be a new story coming for new players. I would love to see 76 do something similar after a bit. People can come into Appalachia as actual Wastelanders, maybe find pipboys on all the dead vaulter dwellers in the land.
---
It does this year
---
There isnt a limit, when scrolling through you should how many of any duplicate card you have under it. I have three lockpick 1 skills by accident from early on mistakes.
---
Oh shit dude that's where mine is. I watched a nuke drop last night and it was awesome!
---
Well I don’t have vending machines at my camp so you shouldn’t be coming there hence I lock my door
---
There's one race tho, you just haven't figured it out. The synths are among us comrades. 🤔
---
9 perk points is just too much.
---
And if you want max damage you need bloody mess and maybe tank killer aswell as demo expert for TSE.
---
Do Cazadores exist yet? Cant recall when they made them at Big Mountain.
---
That's okay then, seems to be a misconception or at some point duplicate cards would delete if you got them from card packs resulting in confusion
---
I’ve only had it fail twice and both times were on the location with the mirelurk queen.. I feel like the spawns don’t show up as enemies on the radar but you need to kill them to finish the event.
---
While I don't practice this. Who are you to dictate what people chose to do with their camps? Kinda entitled no?
---
Agree completely.  There's no reason for this game to be the mess that it is.
---
i'm just a dirty junkie
---
Well, easy enough to verify you have them. Hope it works out for the best :)
---
The plan drops at meat week now
---
You're welcome :)
---
Was supposed to be by today but doesn’t look like that is happening.
---
Thank you!  That's what I was afraid of lol
---
On PC and it always shows on the hour.
---
Non combat perks, most quality of life. It's was a mule. High carry weight, health perks.
---
Yeah these are all important choices which is what having to do a build is all about - you can’t just have everything -
---
beth cant do single shit right, you guys should know this already
---
Hmmm, I wonder why rifles don’t get very many new types... Oh that’s right, because they’re all the same. There’s not much you can even do with a rifle, there’s already like 5 or 6 normal rifles, a laser a plasma and a gauss. An anti materiel rifle would just be a reskinned hunting rifle with a scope. Not worth their time when they could add in actually unique weapons
---
Think so, just realised my thirst bar was empty for the first time.. ever, really.
---
Explosive launchers are bugged. They aren't doing the damage they are supposed to be doing consistently. Only auto-grenade launchers somewhat work. Even they are kind of bugged as they apparently can be semi-homing missiles with decent VATS.
---
Honestly it's just sorta fuckin annoying when i just looted something, made it to a camp and there's no way to scrap my junk
---
Yeah i guess you're right, what annoy me more is that it takes a long time to switch Perks, like armor and weapon repairing, ammosthing, super duper, picklocks, hacker, stuff like that.
---
How do you not get kicked?
---
Oh hell yeah. Atoms make it all better. Nothing says, “sorry for all the crashes” like a free virtual poster. 👍
---
Collectron station
---
Ofc they don't, they'd loose people buying atoms just to finish those last few levels. But the best you can do, and SHOULD do, is go to Bethesda website support and make a ticket, take a screen shot of lost atoms and either ask for them to give them back as they bugged the hell out, or give you enough atoms to buy back the lost levels. It's double score event afterall, what's the point of this event if they gonna take the score away anyways! I've also heard on other topics that sometimes it bugs out just because your online as it's about to refresh, so next time try to logg off 15 mins before the dailies refresh. 😊
---
Same, hearing everyone bitch about this trade scam stuff for so long I simply don’t p2p trade at all and refuse to let anyone look at my inventory for fear they’ll take something with one of these glitches ppl moan about
---
Graham is a type of bread in my country
---
Well I’m with you on that - I will be very happy if/when they ever come out with those perk loadouts !!
---
it should be listed on the Bethesda website when you check the Atlas event status
---
I can only agree. The sad part is these people can’t see they are they biggest problem with this game.
---
For them it’s a matter of exploiting the system to the max, with builds the game was not meant for.
---
For them, they think they are so damn badass that they can nuke the queen in 2 sec, one shot a legendary creature. 
---
They dough forget the common people of the game, the biggest player base that brings in the biggest revenue to the game. Without them the game will not continue to exist. 
---
So yes please, take a minute and think; is it fun for the rest that they don’t get to loot. Is it fun to take the challenge out of the game.
---
I really hope they will patch the game and remove these exploits and bring the damage numbers down to where they should be.
---
Yeah but melting her to death without her regenerating ain't cool. Give the lowbies a shot.
---
I get ya. It does suck.
---
Sept 22-28
---
It’s really not that much better with it equipped.
---
Here, have this sorry emote, now you can say sorry yourself whenever you want. Also did we say it's free? Because we care. Now hand me that cork scrap. 😏
---
Back out of the server and go back in on one of your team members of you want back in the same server or the same team. Make sure they’re showing online before you do. You’ll lose your bond status of course, but that only takes five minutes to re-bond. I know what you’re talking about as it’s happened to me a few times. That’s the only fix I know of.
---
That's exactly the system I'm referring to. Something like that should be implemented to 76. WoWs system works great.
---
Hello, my thought about this. I will prefer no account wide, I don't want the game to be an easy and simplified game. If I play with another character I will be sad to have nothing to do because everything will be account wide. I understand that it's annoying and painful to grind these legendary perk and maybe some people are lazy or don't have time to play but if I want something, I work for it. I don't want an easy game. Thank you.
---
Something similar just happened to me, but it was only half the daily challenges being auto-completed. https://imgur.com/gallery/4PE3JMe
---
I mean...it is a post apocalypse.
---
I'm not trying to defend this busted ass game mechanic but I honestly like the way trade is. I rarely, RARELY do actual trade outside of player vendors, so it adds some spice. 
---
It makes sense for even something so innocuous as trading to still have an element of danger.
---
As long as you get the plan
---
I had the exact same thing to me happen! Right in the forest XD
---
The fact they won't even do anything about it is just infuriating
---
I think it's usually around sunset in the game when it starts, at least [it's supposed to be](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bovlpk/triggering_one_violent_night/)
---
Your account would be in RS3 now (new client/game, much smaller playerbase then Osrs), and in RS3 most stuff is useless. P2w for levels and everything made extremely easy.
---
Oof, guy was probably sippin on the quantum sizzurp
---
I really am curious what the trigger is for this. Both my son and I have been on during the flip and been fine. Other times I log in at noon or late and it has been fine.   
---
Now the old challenges I would have auto complete if I did NW first in the day. But not since the update run.
---
It’s not triggerable any more, it’s now one of the main server-wide events that pop up, like Uranium Fever and Line in the Sand. You have to just wait til you see the event notification pop up while playing.
---
Reputation system is frustrating
---
I had a hunch it wasn't just about not paying attention and today I got confirmation of it. When the time has came I fast traveled to the location in time, I was waiting around with the others, but the event didn't trigger for me. I saw it getting started, critters spawning in, people starting to run around, the veggie/critterpart caches open up, but nothing showed and I couldn't even contribute. I had 14 prime meat on me but I couldn't toss them into the pot even tho the option appeared when I looked at it. There was someone doing angry face emote when the event ended, so I might wasn't the only one who couldn't do the event.
---
Well I wouldn't say without any bugs. It clips with the pip boy pretty bad
---
I feel like they'd have to do something to make that palatable, yes.
---
With max Rifleman perks, Bloodied, Nerd Rage, etc. - it shouldn't take me 4-5 shots to destroy a basic Laser Turret in the silo.
---
Just checked, Perk loadouts are on the roadmap with Fractured steel coming later this year.
---
I miss those days of vex
---
I've been playing solo since Day 1. I also got Fallout 1st for the private server. Sweet, sweet silence.
---
Unlimited
---
I think this bug has become worse because people REALLY wanna get the cook out event, therefore they stay online through the moment when dailies refresh and it bugs out. From what I've read here, people have noticed it happens, so you should go offline just before the refresh. Also, you have to take a stand and not let them get away with it. Fill in a ticket, take a screenshot of the auto finished dailies and send it to them. Request for either refund on score or atoms to fill in the lost level. What's the point of double score event if they gonna take it away from us anyways? 😒
---
There's been days where I have only 1 available and days where I've got all of them available, but I've been on and off for the flip.
---
There's no consistency to it or why it happens.
---
just tell him it’s okay to not play it since he would probably struggle too much anyway. 
---
reverse psychology
---
From what I heard from the  Xbox scammer group, that has talked to Bethesda, they are working on it. But I heard that months ago and still nothing. But hey if you're on Xbox I have a group that does transfers, trades, PvP arena and queen arena, if you have discord!
---
Ultima Online had it in 1997
---
Can't you just treat them as two separate transactions for caps?
---
It's all the hormones in the chicken thighs...
---
Other games or my friends and I do like NW so we play a few rounds and pop back for the cookout and then go back to NW
---
Can confirm, recieved a bloody tenderizer from meat week event last night.  Now to find a buyer as it weight 20 lbs and is worthless to my junkies heavy.
---
Crocs?! What crocs?!
---
I can't see that working in any sensible way.
---
If you disable the perks themselves altogether until level 50, people will complain bitterly, and you create a weird power spike at level 50 that makes the game even more of a race to level up to level 50 as quickly as possible.
---
If you enable the perks you trivialize large portions of the game straight out of the vault.
---
If you enable perk scrapping at level 1, people will grind alts to level up perks.
---
If you disable perk scrapping until level 50, people *will still grind alts to level up perks*, they'll just do it in larger batches (i.e. get to level 50 as quickly as possible and then cash in all their perk cards at once).
---
If you disable perk scrapping until level 50 and don't let people scrap perks they earned before level 50, people are stuck with a bunch of crappy perks they never use clogging up their perk screen - which I think is a problem they are aiming to solve with this system.
---
Mostly I take this all as evidence of how stupid perk scrapping is.
---
Yh im on Xbox, what’s the discord?
---
Thank you.

---
That's my full health pa heavy gunner build. I run vamps most of the time and j for big fights. Been using that build for 200 odd levels now and lfind it very solid
---
Also what I’m thinking. It would be very cool feature I think!
---
Thanks for the help.
---
I had exactly the same just happen but then again I forgot to log off before the dailies reset.
---
I've sent them tickets and evidence, they just say it's out of their control and they're "working on a solution" but a solution doesn't help if it drops when the event is over.
---
Yup! Tying this system to perks (effectively levels) instead of XP is a mistake.
---
Also, the game throws extra perk packs at you at early levels, which makes the differences even bigger.
---
I have zero defences as well. Whenever I TP back to my camp there's usually a couple of enemies but rarely they are engaged with Beckett. Usually they are down the road and don't bother my camp unless provoked, which I normally do of course.  
---
I just don't have enough camp budget for defenses. I'd rather have it look great lol
---
This is actually a really good idea. Since I've completed the run I will try to do this as well starting after today (I woke up too late to do this today).
---
I will report back my findings later this week.
---
Who says it was wooden?
---
Yeah, and you can turn in 5 three times.
---
a lot is two words
---
Yep. I was quite disappointed after finally finishing the run that the poster was broken.
---
they weigh nothing and you can carry as many as bethesda allows you to in one stack
---
I've gotten rid of her because of the 'nightmare', the wanderer because of only playing 1 stum over and over and the Raider PUNK, because if he shouts 'Round the rugged rock' one more time I'll smash his face in with a rugged rock.....
---
I've not had the other one, 'Gramps', because he just creeps me out.
---
I feel there should be a direct warning when you take more than one workshop. Something like "Are you sure you want the server to crash? Y/N".
---
9/22-9/28, if we deliver enough Glass during 9/7-9/10.
---
Cheers. not too long I guess.
---
Same here.  [https://imgur.com/plPVXjo](https://imgur.com/plPVXjo)   
---
P.s. The auto complete bug only happens (for me) is, if im in a party when the challenges reset. Never happened if i was solo. Can anyone else can confirm this?
---
You'll want 5 Adreneline, 3 Nerd Rage, 3 Stabilized, all 9 Heavy Gunner and 3 One Gun Army. You also want to have Emergency Protocols on your PA. That's what you can do without moving points around. If you did move points around I would suggest taking a couple of point out of Strength and Agility and put them in Intelligence for Power User if you want to main a Gatling Laser. 8 points in Agility for 5 Adreneline and 3 Dodgy, 12 in Strength for 9 Heavy Gunner and 3 Blocker. 
---
That is of course if you're going for a Bloodied PA build.
---
Pretty much everywhere, if you're on Morgan Town the train station to the west is a good spot
---
Do it like how Warframe does it, that's a genuinely good trade system
---
And if you’re crafting the ammo each missile takes I think two screws
---
Similair to how Warframe does it
---
I gotta admit it runs as smooth as butter on a decent PC.  However, I've been playing on console since day one, so that's where my main character lives. Lately, the lag seems utterly horrible and the game crashes fairly often -- usually during events.  Between that, crippled camp building, and the upcoming weapons nerf, I'll likely end up rage quitting and go outside or something.
---
I'd say it's pretty high since I have never really enjoyed that part outside of random events in game.
---
Atomic shop as a stand alone, came out around the time as the Shoot for the Stars Bundle

Need an anti-materiel rifle because the .50 hunting rifle conversion is a piece of shit that is NOT an adequate replacement for a native .50 rifle.
---
The gauss rifle is basically the closest thing we have to an anti-materiel rifle, but the gauss rifle is technically an energy weapon. I want an actual ballistic weapon that can rival what the gauss rifle is, but isn't a conversion AND ISN'T A LEFT-HANDED HANDED BOLT.  And it better not be an Atomic Shop skin either you goons.
---
Sadly, for Bethesda it's ok to sell broken stuff, they don't test them prior to putting them up in the ATX, and then they barely care for issues from the players, that's considering pretty much all items this week (no idea about the daily rotating ones) have been broken with no fix. It's so frustrating.
---
Exactly this.
---
I waited 5 minutes to see if I actually finished....
---
Wait, do you get booted for inactivity if you're playing the drums/on the spit?
---
Funny story. My boyfriend bought one year fallout 1st subscription and he got extra atoms, like 3k randomly, so instead of just keeping it, he submitted a ticket. First he got a reply that they don't know what's going on and that it's probably some bug, in other words some vague explanation. He then sent a long messge with all information, that he as a buyer has a right to know what's happening and as a good person he did the right thing and such, only to get a reply that if he was to use the atoms, it would be an exploit which is bannable, but he got a proper explanation. Keep pressing them. You pay for a game, you pay with your time, maybe buy atoms or subscription, therefore just saying "we are fixing it" is not enough. Point is, you lost what you paid for. In legal rights, that's punishable, but for some reason games just say opsie and let it slide. Once is an opsy, twice is a problem. Don't let them abuse you like a blind sheep.
---
Start your day with Queen of the hunt, if you get wendingo knowledge that's  an 10% extra damage, Blocker is helpful, there are several powerful meat based HP buffs that are helpful if you are a carnivore,  overall if you are mindful of your surroundings you shouldn't be taking too much damage. I have yet to go down during the event with my Junkies non PA build but i am fairly tanky.
---
Or have the option to fight for it or give it up
---
Another reason why mine autocompleted. I was playing and lost track of time. Plus I wanted to be on for the Meat Cook event.
---
I imagine your just as frustrated as I, especially if you're trying to complete the legendary run. :/
---
The problem actually isn't the game board in many cases, the problem is the mesh mapping of certain walls, especially with some of the premade structures that define the wall as a few inches below where it actually should be.
---
Over in that Jacuzzi house area with the frogs.
---
Im enjoying my new full hp vanguard junky (i was gathering all good junkies weapons). I miss extra 15 special tho, but excavator PA help with weight. I die way less, since poison and surprise asaulttrons cant oneshot you
---
Ha! You think a lock will stop me from using your benches?
---
I built my house on a road he frequently passed through and at one point made a house that he should just walk into and walk out whenever
---
Yeah. :/
---
a lot of people aren’t worried about caps because they buy and sell so much or some people have a million presents and many other ways to get  a ton of caps. Some people have 4-5 characters with max caps. Basically if it’s in the vendor and they want it, it’s bought. From my experience if it’s something worth buying it will go. 
---
I recommend trying to get your moneys worth, you would be surprised what sells.
---
Yes In a way.. I won’t be grind rep again unless they add more daily quests or way to earn rep.  If I do start a new character it will be already with a build in mind so I would only need to “rep” for the build necessary reward. 
---
Legendary perk and perk coin is already account wide so regrind require
---
At least it's a new poster unlike that "free" one we got that was actually in the game from day 1
---
It resets at 20 hours...
---
Try to survive until the end, many creatures spawn in the end zone.
---
This is happening to the log cabin walls too
---
I have been pushing them, I keep opening new tickets when the problem comes up again and I keep contacting them about existing tickets they're just giving the same copy-paste excuse.
---
Hello fellow Tenno
---
The Blood Eagle NPCs often drop them as loot. Crimson Project in the Cranberry Bog, and the North/South Cutthroat camps near Top of the World are good spots.
---
There are. Well technically none of them have a sex, because of mutations. I think the super mutant that's at crater with ra-ra is presumably a female.
---
Hence why I stopped accepting trade invites
---
Doors are a suggestion
---
With or without lag?
---
What are you talking about sometimes when it’s red it’s placeable
---
as well. 😅
---
Donc c’est “The Cuts of Prime” en anglais.
---
All super mutants are sterile and likely have no real sexual characteristics to speak of.  There are female super mutants, see tabitha and that one follower from new vegas, but they are really no different from the males save their voices and dispositions.  You can also find in west tek some holotapes of fev subjects, some of whom are female.
---
I also wonder if Gail from crater is female as the voice is higher.  I just dont care enough to speculate more than that.
---
Oh yeah it's also easier to model in a development sense and such as we can just have a single super mutant as a base instead of needing a male and female model.
---
It’s random generated drops, there’s a loot table somewhere in the reddit for the event. I would do the event all week because people who don’t get a certain thing are going to be looking for it down the road until the next meat week. It’s also really easy to do, gives good xp and it’s quick.
---
This happened to me as well. I thought the rads got me thanks for the heads up
---
You can if you wish for but it be difficult not too make friends , this game is very social 
---
And there never any pvp , pvp is optional
---
[Grahm loved that]
---
My frequent visits are him going around foundation
---
Yea thought i was gonna DC when I claimed the final button....didn't know that was a built in feature.
---
I had the same issue yesterday, was using the armor workbench near the bunker while waiting for her to spawn and in the time it took me to do the animation to get off the bench she was dead. 😑
---
They're genderless, the FEV erased every sexual characteristic of the mutant essentially turning the them into one big muscle.
---
a similar effect tends to happen with food items that increase your max HP
---
Edit: yes I love Grahm so much that I love graham crackers too
---
I took screen caps of everything to review later.  This helped out alot when trying to decide what NW perk cards to use.
---
Now that there's npc's all around, it would be nice to have doctors again that can cure you of anything you have.
---
Stupid phone.  That'd be nice if plans and recipes sorted up too, or have that be a sort option (maybe value would do that? I'll have to see when I get home).
---
I decided to store all the notes that I've picked up along the way (aside from ones that it won't allow me to drop) and it's made finding plans and recipes much easier.  I remember reading somewhere about a trick to scroll faster through those long lists, but I can't recall how.
---
bethesda is color blind. 😒😒
---
If I wasn't playing it with my bf and going through this mess of a game with him, I'd prob had quited a year ago when I tried for a week and didn't feel impressed by it. They keep trying to expand, going on steam, releasing it on all consoles, but reminder, obviously this game is just some extra profit for them to get some cash so they can focus on their other projects. From the very start of the release, this game was an empty half-backed egg. At the start you'd have to re-install the game from Bethesda launcher at least 2 times through 200 hour experience. Because the launcher would randomly decide that the game files are nowhere to be found, so as a PC player, can't say I'm getting the best. And when you think you're starting to see a brim of light on new decent content, you get extra spicy bugs, a splash of that content not being as great as it used to be and of course a sploosh of disconnecting / crashing iissues.
---
Several of my friends and my brother have the game. I just can't ever get them to play it with me. :(
---
The game has improved a ton since its release. I think the original coverage of the game turned away a lot of people from it. I am a huge FO fan, but even I waited until the release of the wastelanders update to buy the game. Maybe show them pics of you playing it? It does now feel like a proper FO game with all the NPCs
---
From my understanding they are account wide but not how you are describing them.
---
Your perk coin earn are account wide and you will have to re-use them on new characters.. I don’t want the same legendary perks rank5 on all my characters..  
---
what if one is melee and one uses heavy gun? 
---
What if one is high chr and the other is high luck?
---
Edit:  
---
lvl500 with 5 rank legendary perk which cost me 1500 perk coin 
---
Lvl1 with 5 legendary perk slots and 1500 perk coin so used up and rank up any legendary perk I desire for the new character
---
No just my thirst was effected. It’s seemed to help me after doing that.
---
I was never a fan of the way event triggers were changed a while back.
---
I'm almost done, I was logged in like 60-70% of the times when the dailies changed and only got caught by autocomplete bug twice, but that two occasion happened in the past one week.
---
I got my friends into the game for a bit and convinced them to play but they left because at the state they were currently in the games all grind and no content
---
Did you put a chemical in it? For example rat poison, you have to put a chemical into the syringes for it to have an effect.
---
The Recharger Energy Weapons!

[It's true, it's all true](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Utkaow63rfXZrojLdMRD_zY6hG5Kpq2I/view)
---
Agreed I play pacifist and have no interest in pvp, i've had players  instigate pvp just because i've claimed an unclaimed workshop for the score challenge, then I have to jump servers to get away from them or to get rid of the claimed workshop.  
---
It's Bethesda's fault for not implementing something like that, before these score challenges came along,  I had no issue's with griefers at all until now.
---
I just don't do trades because of this risk. Not that I've ever had much worth selling.
---
Definitely anti-armor.  Critical shots seem kind of pointless on anything automatic.  Now vats damage is pretty useful on an explosive shotty.
---
I haven't had issues at all until more recently with the same idiots that griefed me when I was level 22
---
Would be more useful than missiles and mini nukes.
---
You have my sword
---
fuck that. I want to spend aas little time in that hell hole as possible
---
Im in line for morning coffee laughing maniacally. Well done on that joke!
---
Go to Summerville and enter the first house on the right when you spawn in. It’s kinda blue, with a green deck and red posts. Inside are about 350ish different books. They are on every floor and out back. Pick them ALL up. This will effectively clear your spawn table as it’ll now only contain books as entries. You may need to reload, then drop/scrap books and check you favourite places for junk again.
---
It's likely that people are just getting there before you, if you're desperate for lead I'd recommend moving a camp to a lead deposit.
---
That’s absolutely ridiculous. I never even knew about this, as I never used one. 
---
Has Bethesda commented on this?
---
At least you can wrrite a ticket, funny thing is, I've been trying for MONTHS and the entire online website crashes the moment I click "continue to submit ticket". It really makes me tired of this bs. I try to be positive and be happy for everyone, but excuse me Bethesda, what the hell is this? Is this even legal? Runs through my head more often than I wish it would. Negativity just catches up with me and that uninstall button starts looking quite juicy 😏
---
Try lucky hole mine with excavator PA  if your in need of lead. You can get around 300+ lead there if you pick all the ore and melt them with acid.
---
The game won't respawn world loot for you until you've looted a certain number of other world items. I've seen various numbers thrown around, but if you just pick a place you haven't been to in awhile and loot everything for a little while the weight rooms should respawn for you.
---
you have to pick up so many items to make stuff respawn. 
---
go somewhere like the golf club there's hundreds of items inside. flowers also count. 
---
one source said 180 another said 255. All i know is it's definitely not 180. It may have used to be that but it isn't now.
---
Damn, is that why?  I was literally hanging out in Sutton waiting for them to roll over.
---
Not really. No meat = no meat cook off.
---
There are, but super mutants basically have almost no visible sexual dimorphism anymore because their transformation changes males and females to just look like monstrous, over-muscled sacks of flesh with very deep voices.   You'll never really be able to tell if a super mutant is really female because both males and females share the same outward physical traits (that we can see), unless of course they explicitly tell you they remember their previous life as a man or woman.
---
They're actually bringing that next update. I think it's a season reward
---
No you cant
---
Just keep it in mind for next time, and keep in mind if it's super bad, you will get some atoms from the last bundle, so you can spend some of them on leveling up with atoms without loosing any that you already have, plus glass caverns still works, along with event "Line in the sand", so you can just spam XP.
---
Just like the Holiday Emotes where nobody wanted to buy them, but someone had to take one for the team.
---
I too just got the hazmat meat cooler and now I regret it because I noticed it was off center
---
Sounds like something a commie would say.
---
What you need is a heavy dose of Uncle Sam's boot in your ass.
---
It’s the age we’re living in. Some people will trust what they read on the internet before the close people around them. Also, we’d be crazy to say that every complaint on the internet about this game isn’t true. The game has its problems but the horrible press and exaggerations in reviews made the game unredeemable to some
---
Again? It's never gone away. It's just bad latency likely. I server isn't registering your shot, or the various multipliers it should be adding on.
---
Bone piles, Chally Poos and Fires will degrade the time faster than drums and spits fill it. they need to be cleaned FIRST!
---
Read a lot about it on this reddit. First time its happened to me and that’s the only thing that I did different since the run started. Luckily I am at rank 97 so should still be able to complete as there is a good bit of time left yet.
---
So far I always log off (to desktop) 5 mins before reset time and wait 5 mins after to be sure. There can also be issues if you are in NW at reset time.
---
It's for a lot of people and Bethesda are "working on a solution". You won't have gotten a score reward and Bethesda won't compensate you either.
---
With the new public groups, you can join one for the buff, then run off to solo. Most players I see do the same, only teaming for events.
---
You can, and that's not a bad idea.  👍
---
nope, only Grahm knows how to tape salt shakers to his hammer
---
I finally got my brother to play it yesterday and he really enjoys it( being his first fallout ever)
---
It is stupid. I hope they can figure out a better working system.
---
I do think that the legendary perks should be enabled at level 1, but I also think perk scrapping should simultaneously be disabled until level 50 to prevent players from blatantly gaming the system. You can reap the fruits of your labor from your main character fresh out of the gate, but you wouldn’t be able to rank up the cards until the new character passed a certain threshold (in this scenario, level 50).
---
I do hope people grind alts to level up the perks because who could be asked to level up a single character to level 900? It just doesn’t seem feasible to me! At least if people were grinding to level 50, there would still be a grind involved, and people wouldn’t be able to max a card off a single level 50 sprint, it would take perhaps 2 sprints, which is still a combined 100 levels, a somewhat decent time investment. To max just six cards you would have to dedicate quite some time pushing characters to level 50. I would prefer that grind over level 900 any day, and I’m sure many in the community would prefer an easier grind as well.
---
Literally the most widespread bug in the game.
---
I've played since the beta, and never had any issues, once people realised that you were pacifist they tended to leave you alone rather than waste ammo niggling at you.  
---
Then score challenge comes along and I have to paint a target on my back, but only 10 levels to go and I can get back to playing normally again lol.
---
Thanks for the info was about to waste alot of materials otherwise.
---
That’s really good to hear!  Glad to hear you get to share something you enjoy with your brother.
---
I finished yesterday and agree it was very meh. The spinney light thing doesn't even work. I mean I knew it wouldn't. But I hoped
---
If you play on Pc you can get a perk organizer from nexusmods :) it saved me so much time have used it around 400 hours
---
Yeah, but that’s work. All kidding aside I just didn’t know what was happening. Never had this happen before.
---
If you pretend like you're looking for locks to pick, you're more likely to find creatures to kill. Hah! Just start at the outer edge of the map, and follow the line of power lines in(those things that look like little x on the map), I usually found creatures around those. Sometimes I found them around Grafton Steel, too. Plus, when the storm moves, they spawn around the outer edges of the storm, too.
---
I know in f4 you could put lights on power lines.
---
Yeah, its usually very rare for a griefer to mess with me 
---
Honestly, I just capture do the event then leave
---
That's not how One Wasteland works.  
---
Those Liberators are only level 100 to you, to anyone else that walks by their apparent level would scale down to whatever their level is.  The same thing would hold true for NPCs, pets and turrets.  All of those have their own individual levels and the damage they deal and receive would scale relative to whatever happens to be attacking them.
---
I’ve played for quite a while and never knew this mechanic. Thank you.
---
I only want them to fix it because it's double score points. All the need to do is a reset.
---
I'm on Xbox. I should of specified.
---
We don't
---
Someone didn’t play New Vegas
---
Thanks! Ive never been more happy to drop 100+ known plans 🤣🤣
---
Happens to me 100% all the time when I’m logged in at the time they reset, if I’m not logged in at that time I haven’t had any issues with it.
---
Same here, laughed my ass off at death by tato salad. The food equivalent of being killed by a radroach
---
Thanks so much!  You have been super helpful!
---
I too carry several different guns with my current build.  Mostly the shotguns (weigh little and have a couple pump actions for ghouls explosive rounds or robots but reload sucks).  But rifles do get heavy like you said so that's why its like 1 guass and one .50 cal sniper with good hipfire accuracy but slow fire rates (well gauss can fire quickly but terrible damage compared to a fully charged shot making it slow).  I have been considering changing to something I can lighten up but probably won't.  That's what new characters are for...and weapon reducing armor pieces.
---
Thanks again!
---
South of  Power Plant have had up to 3 bloatflies spawn.  The high-school usually has mongrals.
---
What you can do: Build a dream camp, try "world" (workshop) pvp, play Nuclear winter, explore the world, do events, tame a pet, do challenges and achievments, level up new character with different build, grind reputation with your main character.
---
What you (probably) should do: Play a different game.
---
I mean if you played the game for months before you most likely aware about all game features and things you can do. If it's not fun anymore why force yourself to play the game?
---
I'm kinda in the same boat and I asked almost the same question a month ago after I finished legendary run. Most popular anwser was "Play with friends" but my friends don't play this game and to be honest I like to play solo. All though I'm fairly new player (I've been playing for 2.5 months) I feel like I played the shit out of this game.
---
I tried to make my own "goals" like:
---
1) Build a T-65 power armor with all needed mods (done it 2 weeks ago)
---
2) Level up to level 500 (done it 2 days ago)
---
3) Collect all magazines and comic books + all holotape games (done. it took only 3 days)
---
I enjoy the grind and I can do something like tadpole challenges... but is it fun? Not really... I'm probably gonna play until I hit max rep with settlers and raiders (almost there) but after that... I probably gonna play something else.
---
Ya the world spawn table is pretty lame. I rather they spawned daily then based on what you picked up last. 
---
At least that way you know the items spawned rather then waste caps and time jumping back.
---
Yesterday I was doing a primal cuts, knocked out about 4 legendaries in a row (small ones) and the server dropped me before the big one.  The next time I did it, robots spawned instead of animals...
---
The skewered beast on the cliff is just an easter egg, that was one of the original concept art designs for what eventually became the scorchbeasts.
---
Gail? Guess she's like the smurfette of super mutants...
---
When I got my wife into this game, I did the same thing. 
---
Now, she has two copies of the Chally Backpack and I have none yet.  It’s kind of funny!
---
Wait for a free weekend, or if you are on console, spend 15 bucks and buy them a copy
---
Only grahm is smart enough to use tape I guess
---
Good luck in your future endeavors.
---
As a side note.  With all my guns and about 3 power armor frames at 10 lbs each, plus ammo and healing wares/chems, I sit at about 250 to 280 lbs depending on how much ammo I'm currently holding.  So the perks for weight are a godsend.
---
Play New Vegas 😉
---
Oh believe me, I also want them to fix it. I've missed out on thousands of score this week because of this bug. Bethesda isn't likely to fix something just because it's a serious issue though.
---
it is on the road map for winter 2020, but who knows for sure. atleast until it is in our hands. 
---

---
Oh man, today I've already told all I know to like 5 people with the same problem, but here's all info I have anyways. 😉 You get it auto completed, or there's higher chance that it auto completes because you stay online when it refreshes. People are spamming it everywhere because due to the meat cook event, more people are staying afk for event or just waiting for it to happen, so more people are loosing score, for tomorrow try to logg off 15 mins before the dailies refresh. Also, while I highly suggest submitting a ticket and demanding the score back or atoms to buy back the level, seems like many people have done it to no avail. 😒 Which doesn't suprise me tbh. Many people use lots of score because it's double score event, so it's good for catching up, but if you think you're a gonner, good news is that the last bundle has atoms, and you can spend the atoms you have on extra levels accordingly to what you get so technically you don't loose any atoms and still get levels. Hope it helps! ❤️

It’s fine, it’s a quote from a musical

As cool as this Kaiju fight would be, you know Bethesda will just reskin the mirelurk queen as a giant Mothman.
---
Im a true comrade &gt;:)
---
I say buff the base damage of all weapons by 60% and yank the damage perk cards entirely. Or tie different weapon damages to their appropriate SPECIAL stats. 
---
Using 9 perk points for weapon damage isn’t fun, it just pigeonholes us into character builds based around specific weapon damage and not play styles. It further limits the usefulness of the numerous weapons in the game—it’s why we so often feel like our loot drops are “Trash”.
---
Log out 1 - 5 minutes before update, log back in 1 - 5 minutes after update. Go to atom shop for quick look then play game. Never had bug. On PC
---
MEAT WEEK MEAT WEEK MEAT WEEK
---
bye
---
See you soon....
---
Thanks, I'll keep this in mind.
---
Similar thing happened to me twice yesterday, I never really had a huge problem with griefers till now. My solution was to use the PA glitch and hide so they can't take the workshop at all.
---
I’ll see you tomorrow
---
I started after! Thanks!
---
Couldn’t agree more.
---
Bye Felicia
---
Oh that explains it. The camp I found had alot of atomic shop toys. It was fun to play with everything. I'll have to wait for the theremin then. Thanks!
---
Why tf are you replying to my post thats almost half a year old
---
For the Grahms sake, you better clean it all up and prepare some greens for the MooMoo, what kind of monster just slaps a barrel and hopes to get free rewards!? 🤨

Got the fixer plans for 100 caps.  Check everything

There's about 150 year discrepancy since the "creation" of cazadores and the hike from California to Virginia. 
---
Dr. Borous states that he created cazadores in 2003, but his chronometer was intentionally altered by Dr. Mobius so the Think Tank couldn't keep track of time. To get around this, the Think Tank keeps track of events versus time. Dr. Boris states that while 2003 doesn't sound right, he did create the cazador slightly before the "Great Static" (when the mountain top was blown off of Big MT) which was in 2281. 
---
76 and the events thereafter start in 2102. The times just don't add up to make sense logically. 
---
Has this ever stopped Bethesda from retconning the shit out of established lore?
---
*ABSOLUTELY NOT*
---
Bye.
---
I use an instigating bladed rocket sledge hammer and I one hit most everything without the perk cards( carnivore plus 3- 4 melee meat buffs) with perk cards i 1 hit low lvl scorchbeasts

Advanced hair tie technology on my controller 🤓
---
Ya one time it took me about 5 10 to 20 min runs to do a 3 creature challenge. I’ve been jumping and running everywhere.
---
It’s completely RNG. They usually have a high chance spawning around land marks and at the end.
---
The salad is the trap, you can only trust Grahms meat but that cow, the cow is obviously trying to poison us. That's what you get for not bringing it feed. ☠️
---
Literally not possible.  Bethesda knows people are fucking idiots and that's why in order to delete a character you need to type in their name to confirm.  Even if you deleted one character, lagged and hit delete again you would then be prompted to type in that new characters name.
---
In an event like that where you need to protect something, I think you’re alright.  You can’t wait forever.
---
Depends on the situation, if it was a 3 star and they were at the end of the tunnel grabbing crates for the mission, then ye I can see why they were upset, any other scenario though just ignore them
---
Isn't it kind of the nature of mmo's to have that grind aspect? I have limited experience but I thought that was kind of par for the course. Or have I been desensitized by grindy mmo's?
---
This is happening to me with EVERYTHING. Whether I built it myself or if it's a prefab...
---
The new consoles will be for sure.. PS4 to 5 is desperately needed and Xbox x is going to be amazing if they are not lying about it.  I am really thinking about the later upgrade 🙂
---
Can I haz ur stuff?
---
I hadn't noticed it or experienced it since wastelanders dropped and didn't have any issues with it until a few days ago but you could have a point with the latency
---
Is every perk card still only worth one coin? Or did they go back to animated cards being worth more?
---
If animated cards were still worth 5 points per level, than having it be "per character" wouldn't be so bad.... but if each card it only worth 1 point, than yeah it really should be account wide.
---
There’s virtually no build that aren’t viable.  I don’t know what happens with the update but as of now a few damage perks and bloody mess are all you need to hold your own.  I found bloodied boring so now I run a PA heavy which can easily be swapped to explosives or rifle perks depending on mood or mission.  I enjoy the versatility of using almost any gun and still killing most things in a few seconds.
---
I don't understand what you're so mad about.
---
When you know you are pushing the limits and/or knowingly breaking the intended rules of what the game allows you to do, why act so surprised when you suddenly can't?  You aren't owed some kind of backward compatibility because you took advantage of an unintentional glitch.
---
Use this time to stock up on nuclear keycards Frank.

Always have been. It was that bug why i stopped playing and after a year, i csme back only to realize that this fucking annoying bug still exists.
---
Mines supposed timo be tricky to find. Have free stuff in the hidden one!
---
More importantly why do you want them female super mutants? 🤔
---
Lunchboxes will be sold for Gold in the next patch, so indirectly your wish come true
---
.deo
---
Linlithgow
---
That's not what I was asking though. Right now a modded sheep staff has the highest damage out of 2 handed. I wanted to know if a modded Tenderiser is stronger.
---
Gail doesn't like this post!
---
I wonder if I'm ever gonna finish, daddy Todd keeps taking away my score. Seems like I didn't buy enough atoms this year. 😔
---
I've had five characters since I got the game just before the first fasnacht.
---
If you like the game you find reasons to keep playing it.
---
Im still trying to get the hammer, cuz i got the pepper mod, congrats tho
---
Thanks. I didn’t even know about the spawn table. I’ve never had this issue before. Now I have a bunch of cloth for gunpowder too. You are a hero, friend.
---
My pro tip that it seems nobody does: When Earle make you flee. You can use your mouse or controller to turn that way you can dodge the dangers 😄 i avoided dying byt this method because i often run around with 10 %health
---
It's literally what Borderlands does since the ORIGINAL. Its shocking how the Bethesda studio working on this game know so LITTLE about basic multiplayer needs. This game should have been partially handled by Zenimax since the start, ESO runs fine, and should be an example of how this game should run if not better.
---
This is a tough call. On the one hand, someone doing the work to get the caches should get some gratitude via that guaranteed legendary. But “212” should have known that he could join in that central-spot fight, and then search fo caches afterwards (before opening the gate). I’d say he loses his privilege when he jumps that far ahead; I say this because I also go for the caches, and don’t care about the legendaries.
---
I'm in that same situation. I have to use my bloodied commando fixer/handmade build just to keep up. 
---
I bet most rifleman can relate, brother.
---
Yup. I have one for emergency leveling but I'll never do anything with it. This game is so boring once you've done everything once.
---
When I find a vendor full of non legendary gear selling for cheap prices, I buy it all and drop it.  It is usually a low level player who hasn't got much of a clue or many caps to spend, so they probably need the boost.
---
He was getting the supply crates most likely. 
---
Don’t worry about it if he’s mad about not getting the legendary there’s plenty out there.
---
I prefer that, over the people that doesn't even care about the spawn point of their camp. It's infuriating to have to FT again because you are stuck in a foundation
---
Check the weapon mods. They probably have different receivers.
---
This is still happening!!!! I’ve been stuck on this with multiple characters on both Xbox and PS4.
---
450 hours on PC and I never knew about the wendigo bonus, thanks!
---
Gonna try your initial suggestion. Think I might have the perks already. If I'm not satisfied I'll need another two levels to move the special points you suggested. Thanks. :)
---
Even Fallout 1 and 2 had such a trade system!
---
Thanks dude! I've come to the conclusion that my duplicate perks aren't going anywhere
---
Just want all the unique guns
---
Not mad about anything just saying goodbye to the game and the community cheers 👋
---
I’ve recently noticed that you have to equip a weapon to see the actual calculated damage.
---
Oh fuck yeah using up all those 10mm rounds as a heavy gunner would be fantastic
---
I guess I'll throw you a bone hammer ;)
---
Exactly my point. The game would be a lot more fun for everyone if wr could all habdle different weapon types without sacrificing too much of everything else.
---
I’ve tested the damage I’m able to do about 210+ to a player with one nuke I kill a player with 450 hp in one shot (two shot nuke) I do it a lot, I feel bad about it but the people usually deserve it, I am not afraid of other players and that’s something I wasn’t always able to say
---
Just wait till you find those crispy cursed 20k shovels, now if that's not a steal, then call me blind cuz this game has no bugs 😏
---
I’ve always wanted a fallout game where you can play as a ghoul without mods.
---
So many quilting posts but the game still has a lot of players.
---
Hmmmmmmmmmmm 😏
---
I know they are reverting the door/wall switch as well as trying to add double walls... the only thing I think they aren't "unfixing" is the floating walls/foundations but I have heard there are other ways to do this now. Speaking as a builder myself if you are really that bummed check back when they release the instanced interiors because my understanding is they will unlock many of the regular building restrictions such as snapping and floating.
---
Well.. the bug also seems to disable my perks/mutations that increase reload speed, so every-time I get into or out of PA, I have to disequip/reequip the fireworks or I reload ultra slow motion.
---
Haha thanks!
---
Lmao Beth can't get basic code right eg. Auto completing challenges etc. and we think they have the capacity to add 2FA properly
---
Protocol for us is to all stop at the legendary area and kill everything immediately.  Then, don't unlock the gate until the crate runner(s) return.  That is the best strategy IMO.  
---
He was wrong for leaving before getting a tag on the captain.
---
I just imagine this monstrosity of a bobblehead, which is one body, enough hands to make it look like a centipede and like 10 heads. And then they have combined weight as well. 😏
---
You know you could have just stopped playing without the melodramatic goodbye post. Why do people do that? Like it’s not real until you’ve written about it on the internet?
---
And it's found pretty well randomly, right?
---
Yeah you will unless you do something with the controller to keep you active. I am not exactly sure how to do that part honestly.
---
No love for pipe weapons either. I dont want another handmade rifle skin.
---
This isn’t an airplane terminal. There is no need to announce your departure
---
Also remember that trading is used to see what you have on you so other players can know if you can kill them or not.
---
Try running without it for a while. 
---
When I'm using my grenade launchers, I can't live without Gunsmith. The repairs are constant. 
---
When I'm using my instigating Deathclaw, I can play for hours between repairs without taking Makeshift Warrior. 
---
So I figure this depends on your weapons and how you play.
---
Buh Bye.
---
I do atleast 200 per nuke because on my friend who has maxed out BOS combat armor with 450 hp gets killed by one blast two nukes coming out and every other player I’ve tried goes down the same way, I kill a lot of people with a single blast it’s my emergency button, my trump card, if I’m getting killed by you a lot I pull out big boy and you eat two nukes and if they don’t kill you, you’ll be staggered long enough for the next two to finish the job, but that’s only if I don’t hit you with the payload, i feel like you guys are only taking the AOE into account
---
Why are you being so hostile? I just asked who said it was wooden. And I just found this. That's why.
---
Looks more like nicholas cage than travolta. Travolta has more of a fuller face
---
Damn quilters always leave me in stitches.
---
This made me laugh harder than it should of 😂
---
Lucky!
---
Ya, the weightless isn't too hard but getting all the rights effects is tough
---
I seen a lvl 15 character rekt a lvl 70~ continually. Its all about how you play.
---
Although the high lvl was pretty bad at playing.
---
Ofc there are too many low levels crying about “griefing” when it directly saying your initiating  pvp when taking over workshops.
---
Don’t be surprised about dying to high levels when you flag yourself for pvp.
---
Definitely Nic
---
good chance they will port it over from the FO4 creation club mod. i hate the left hand bolt though, its annoying af.
---
same thing happened to me. moved camp, can't put my weapon racks on the walls anymore :(
---
Either that or let it stack up for the next season. Anything would be nice.
---
Would be nice but would be a few years too soon.
---
So really it just depends on the weapons? My most used guns are my tesla rifle, lever action and combat shotty. I'll give it a try.
---
Doesn't matter how hard you try to focus on the fun aspects of the game, its still a Shitshow.
---
I for sure see more of a nick cage as well.
---
They’ve changed it to where all perk cards give you 2 coins, animated or not. A level 2 perk card gives 4 coins, a level 3 gives 6 coins, and so on.
---
If you fo many Quern fights, you get the free repair kits.  I took off gunsmith when I discovered that I had 110 improved repair kits from rewards.
---
As a proud member of the building community, I give a hearty "shrug emoji."
---
rule 34 of course
---
LOL I've done it twice so far today.  Thought it was just me.
---
Lol does that actually work while you're on the drums?
---
All free
---
I tested it and it seems that the extra hp from max HP is getting reseted before its added again so you loose hp for a sec which means that if you are below max HP treshold(i think its 60 for tatosalad) you will drop below 0 HP
---
Shit happens, people should know that it's not everyone's duty to signal you all the time and let the enemy destroy your hp, break your armor and use up your stims so they get a one star nucturnal minigun. If someone is willing to do that, appreciate it and make sure to thank with thumbs up, if you're far away and decide to look into your pip boy to look if you have any tato salad left, then whether they wait for you or not is upto them. There were times when a person could have waited or shoved that there's a legendary with them on events like Uranium Fever, but yeah, kindness has limits. Honestly I would just move on and not care. There's plenty of actually mean people, but you're not one of them. 😉
---
same receivers,i always used all of my combat rifles with the same mods because that's what i'm used to
---
even equipping them, they should be the same but they aren't
---
GET OUTTA MAH SWAHMP!
---
Grahm probably
---
Wish i could play BIV song in my camp
---
Me too dude. Super frustrating they haven’t fixed it yet.
---
I've got 1500+ and they are still stacking so I assume they are nearly unlimited.  I'll let you know at 9999 lol.
---
Yup definitely not John Travolta,  agree that he looks like Nicholas Cage
---
What's rule 34? 🤔
---
I can enter while on a team. But I have encountered this glitch before. I usually have to fast travel to the same spot a second time and it clears and allows me in. One other time that didn’t work and I had to reload.
---
Since Tuesday massive framedrops, stutter, lag and 2 systemcrashes. (PC) It’s like the beta again.
---
I have difficulty with red and green too!
---
 Your entitled as hell if you think you have a right to the works and efforts of others.
---
Guess what?  You don’t have shit son.  You want it? You go make it.
---
It would certainly feel like fighting a legitimate legendary entity, as opposed to a glowing bullet sponge. I would argue to keep the hp heal, and have it activate it's mutations. 
---
Guess what, that Deathclaw matriarch is called that for a reason. It now has bloodied, breaths frost or fire, and takes no damage while standing still.
---
Lol. Thank good they have that PTS to sort out all the issues before launch and fix them.
---
Let them. We will rip and tear them out of their tin can suits like sardines; sardines because they are overly salty and start to reek more and more the longer they are left out.
---
Bloody mess and head shots.
---
It should be railroad spikes don’t explode oh well still a fun gun
---
I find sprinting away from blocks loading in around you pretty funny though.
---
Season 2 rewards are on the PTS. Some folks have YT'd their experience now that NDA is no longer a thing for PTS content.
---
Ref for PTS: https://bethesda.net/community/topic/423535/welcome-to-the-pts-forums-start-here
---
Yup just spin your camera as you play 👍
---
Unless something changed that I don't know about, that's wrong. You literally cannot do more than 110 no matter what as of the end of January. Maybe wastelanders changed it, but that would surprise me. Here is AngryTurtle testing it.
---
https://youtu.be/19b1SpZTTRk?t=414
---
Good to know it’s not only happening to me, or even just PS4.
---
Dont ask reddit just play the game and have fun
---
I hate staggering by a level 1 mole rat while being level 289. I hate that mole rats give you a stagger chance in general. Same goes for rats. Specially when I’m in power armor.
---
UO had it too lol
---
Honestly that's just the life of workshops. When you decide to take it, you put yourself as a potential target out there. The best you can do is, have all the scrap elsewhere. There's always gonna be trolls. I once had a bunch of people lock picking into my house to become wanted, then firing mini nukes to annoy me and get me to attack them. I think my camp was on same location as one of theirs or something 🤔 I would just open the door every time they tried to picklock it, then eventually they left. A good idea is to fire a nuke on their house, block and leave that server 🔥😏 that will teach the bastard.
---
IMPOSSIBLE
---
Can I fix my spawn point? I finally built a house where I figured other people weren't so I didn't have to switch maps and it's great but every time I fast travel back I spawn at the bottom of a steep hill I had built it on.
---
I'm in the Weapon Artisan only camp.  I don't like wasting the points on gunsmith when repair kits are so easy to get and a workbench is never far away.  BTW you need to keep at least 5I so that you can prime weapons.
---
If I were running a grenade launcher or legacy energy weapon, I'd probably be forced to use gunsmith.
---
Okay thank the lords i just got this too work!
---
Xbox player
---
1) loaded into world, tried, failed
---
2) loaded into new world, immediately quit the game from home button
---
3) restarted game and loaded into new world
---
4) ran straight into medical centre and past all the scorched
---
5) loaded the t fuse and immediately fast traveled from within medical centre to the medical centre
---
6) ran back into medical centre and past all the scorched again
---
7) went into terminal and read everything first in order
---
8) analayzed sample and BOOM it worked!!! 
---
Good luck guys! It was a miracle
---
Strange. But that means you’re on PC right?
---
Got clapped! My first run was just under 3 minutes which was way better than I anticipated. We've got the technique down now and we're planning another 4 man run on Monday with all the buffs mentioned above. Should be 15-20 second kill if all goes to plan
---
So kind if similar to how Diablo 2 did it 20 years (!!) ago?
---
You can do the meat cook quick because playing the drums and turning the meat during prep time counts. The small critters are also bugged and are spawning in small groups so you dont have to search for them. With that you can basically do the event in a minute or 2.
---
We’d be happy to! That’ll be $100
---
My daughter makes me play Royal High sometimes, but by gawd am I fabulous.
---
Sharkbite is my fave though. Especially when my kids, niece and nephew are on the same server and I can go after them all lol.
---
What about the giant bird that’s staples to the hill?
---
Can’t tell you how long I keep diseases because I said screw making and buying the cures.
---
So, you had a *Face Off*?
---
You are very welcome! I stand by my honest trading and am very happy to help players figure this stuff out in a comfortable way, hope to trade with you again!
---
Make it like trading in warframe where you have a trade station but without the special currency and just add caps instead and both need to accept the trade
---
I also found that meat sweats temporarily raises your health above Nerd Rage, and you can’t rad down until the effect expires.
---
That’s what I get for being a wasteland vegan and gorging on meat.
---
That makes sense, I was gonna keep it at least 5 so I can do max Gunsmith when needed anyway. Still trying to figure out how I wanna do my build anyway.
---
The problem is, 76 is built on a single player engine and interface. There's no money in Bethesda making it a true MMO interface, and that seems to be what all developers care about now, is micro transactions.
---
Thanks. Imma have to check it out
---
Yeah I knew about the critters spawning in one spot. Didn’t know drums and the meat spit effected it during the prep before it starts. Thanks
---
That's because people come in, throw all the meat and it's enough to quickly move the meat score and finish it. There's still a 2 min thing right after it starts for preparing, so you have to hurry and start slapping the barrel if you have no prime meat. 🍖
---
I think
---
Where did you hear of this..  The only one I know about is at the whitespring.
---
I would hazard a guess that you have many many hours in this game and still call it a shitshow.
---
Says more about you.
---
I refuse to use the trading interface because _literally_ every time I've done so (thrice only haha), the other player has janked me somehow.
---
you have to move your CAMP tool. The spawn point is relative to the object. Select it while you are in building mode. Just like any other camp object
---
Just... why?
---
Try to get there a minute or two before it starts. It's a quick walk from the Vault. Then just hop on a drum until you can turn in your prime meat
---
Damn you're really mad lmao I'll stick to going through doors
---
Very.  One of my top 3.  Enjoy that thing.
---
Don't worry, it doesn't. I checked afterwards and Jen's mom is alive and in Foundation.
---
Find new guns/armor and respec to get their full effect. Just started a junkies build. It’s cool. After they add deep pocketed to limbs on SS it’ll complete my set. Then I think I’ll buy the t65 stuff.
---
It should, but ir won't. Why would they give atoms for free? Then majority of people would just grind the dailies /weeklies and not buy their atom bundles. 🤔
---
Oh. I put mine in the basement behind a wall because I didn't want to look at it. Thanks.
---
It just works.
---
I don’t want it to finish faster lol. It’s not as fun that it finishes so quickly 😞
---
Still way more costly then being able to get 5 for a level 1 animated card, 15 for a level 3 animated card.
---
People have worked out that if the drums and spits are manned in the minute or two while "waiting for the event to start" the progress bar will be half full already when everything else starts. Meaning a quick finish
---
Maybe Travolta'd is when he turned into Nicolas Cage? From the movie face off.
---
Hacks for the Hack God, Bugs for the Bug Throne
---
pretty sure a daily ops reward is a sulfur fountain
---
RuneScape trade system
---
Yes, I totally agree with this idea but for now it is your own responsibility to not get scammed and to trade items only for caps, 'cause that's how the game intends it
---
Oooh, that's a good point, limb damage explosive, with demolitions and that explosive radius increase perk, that would hit everything really really well, combined with a two-shot? Oh yes, that does sound quite delightful. Remember to always aim for the torso, I've been told, and it splashes to all the other limbs, yeah?
---
Legendary effects?
---
ain't happening.
---
FOR ANYONE WHO ISNT AWARE, WHITESPRINGS HAS A SULFUR FOUNTAIN THAT CURES ALL DISEASES EXCEPT HERPES
---
There is a big and abandoned responders church in Point Pleasant. We might have some cleaning to do but when the scrubberhood arrives, we need to keep him safe because they will terminate him :(
---
Unless they are hacking and can see your location. Or they use a terminal and can see your location. Or they are hiding behind you and aee your location. Or at the end a scortch beast shoots his beam at you and they see your location. Or that one guy in your team accidentally shoots a bullet in the air and now they see your location. Or Bethesda decides that fallout 1st members can put those bright colored free paints on armors instead of free gillie ones we get and you decide to put the bright ones anyways and they see your location. Or you're bugging out and instead of crunching you're actually swiming around and they see your location. 🤔
---
Yeah all those spinning lamps don't work on PS4 usually. But on a super rare occasion they do.
---
Just make it how rocket league does it . Boom problem fixed
---
Yesterday my wife was afk for a little while, on the drums at the Meat Cook.  She was hoping to be back in time, but figured if not she could still help out the event. When I got there, someone was ‘teabagging’ in front of here while standing on the drum. Insanely childish. 
---
I thumbed him down, then went over to another drum so I can go help my wife get dinner ready. 
---
He decides to take a few steps back and starts shooting us with his Gauss Minigun. Wasting a LOT of ammo. 
---
I do a quick check to make sure I have Pacifist on, walk up to him with the intention of a simple non-damaging punch to let him know I’ve got it enabled so he can’t goad me into a fight... and as I get close to him, he drops dead, a victim of his own explosive rounds at close range.
---
The troll dropped about 40 bulked junk packages, including 5 Ballistic Fiber, 5 Lead and 5 Adhesive, along with a good amount of loose junk/scrap. It was about 50+ lbs. 
---
My tent was just down the hill, so I dropped off all that loot and went back to the drums. 
---
He was not very happy.
---
Thanks! What do you do to keep yourself from dying from thirst or hunger? Sorry for all the questions lol
---
I just checked it and i can't apply it to the camo version...
---
So what the hell? :/
---
There's a camo version? Is it a skin?
---
It would be free, if they fixed the auto-complete bug that makes your score yeet out 😊
---
Beckett. Just Beckett. Nice, sells you food and isn't really annoying :)
---
If I store them and replace them, then fast travel away they seem to work. But only for me, my buddy couldn't see them haha
---
I place my vendors all over my camp because I want you to check out my camp. In fact one, the one with the fixers, is underground behind a secret door. I know you might rather be doing something else than checking out my camp, but tough shit.
---
You don't even need to do that, the event has a decontamination shower that runs during it.
---
the vital equipment quest from wade the settlers, if u let the raider keep it u will increase the raiders reputation instead
---
Just keep in mind you are a lot weaker in this game than in fallout 4 specially in the beginning. You will die a lot. But once you get a solid build and understand the farming locations you should be fine.
---
Maybe the OP is Cage
---
The point is to run in, grab the ores, turn them in and then hit the decontamination showers at the side before your next run. Those really reduce the pain of the super-rads.
---
Don't take him near any honey beasts.
---
Hey, made it to #3 just swimming in a puddle
---
You know I hate the reflect projectile one. Im speaking from borderlands 3 experience. I’ve killed myself so many times in that game because of that.
---
Have no idea, but lately the game has been so bugy due to all the extra events, it could be holy mothman sending you a signal to become a cultist.
---
Bahaha, I knew there must be at least one of you out there doing this shit on purpose.  I salute you
---
HMM never heard of that one there. 
---
but you're better off looking at lost home if you want to spawn a rare vendor. much better chance IMO
---
No, you have to get all 3 mod plans through the event.
---
No, you cannot. You can build your camp close to the whitesprings gazebo
---
We must cherish and protect him
---
Eh there's plenty of cool stuff and fun builds to play that don't require bullion or faction rep
---
I have one character with all the toys that require grinding, and a couple others with completely different builds that are just fine without
---
is that why she has anger issues?
---
Damn. Do the odds of getting them get better if you have the plan for the Tenderizer?
---
You know the frog tactic of survival? You get the skill to breath underwater, find the closest water source and just vibe underwater. Maybe poke a nose out once or twice, or use photo mode to look around. Will be funny as heck when there's 2 people left and they can't find you.
---
It’s fixed for the next patch
---
Ok, I finally figured out what was going wrong. At some point in the past, I had to reinstall the game and tried to install it into the same directory. Instead, I got a new installation nested \*inside\* the original directory. I would add mod files to the original install that wasn't being used and didn't realize until this morning that it was the wrong installation. Got rid of the old install and put things in their proper place and mods work now.
---
I mean I use Ultracite armor and I still collect the ore. Its just 40 or so dads per second while in power armor? Like Jesus wtf man.
---
Needs a FDA recall, probably tainted with e.coli or listeria.
---
It's been happening for me for over a week now. Like there red health gets greyed out and then replaced with red again?
---
this. i always bluepring my camps in parts, structure only usually doesnt cause any trouble unless you are glitching some part of it. 
---
The problem comes when you start putting stuff inside, indeed stuff on the walls causes issues , but i also found that a whole set dual workbenches  would work perfectly until i placed the stash and scrap boxes on top of each other
---
A blueprint of all furniture including a wall piece for easy snapping would work perfectly and even let me move the camp too until i put those damn stash boxes and i would get the above error. Sometimes the furniture blueprint with the stash boxes would place (but not snap) you would have to move the blueprint almost exactly in the requried location and it would go green without snapping and let you place it. Turns out it didnt end up snapping at all, and the wall sections would be actually floating a few inches from the rest and make the camp not moveable
---
min level exists for a reason though
---
Same odds afaik.  Mod plans could drop last year but not the weapon plan.  I know all of the mods but still can't make the weapon lol.
---
Weird. Other than the anoying part about stuff not snapping to it and meh quality mine works fine. Doors are cool too.
---
For 100 gold each I was hoping we'd get another way, at least the bonus isn't bugged so opening them at events isn't a worry.
---
That's a good work around, but you shouldn't have to burn budget to place something on the ground.
---
They cant restore character? What kinda bullshit is this?
---
Thanks, I’ll do that now too.
---
Sorry about that. It truly is random, I entered the event the same second the event ended, and still got the plan.
---
Remember ESO and how your champion level transfers? Yea so should the perks. Or at the very least the points.
---
Yeah same for me
---
I agree for other but personally the rug suits the my use of the bunkers as small rooms to personalise when getting workshops with my friends
---
I’ve attempted it 6 times now and failed every single time... it’s getting pretty annoying.
---
You realize they used to do exactly that? And still do at certain ranks. I'm also asking for fewer Atoms than before. They replaced the former daily and weekly challenge rewards (used to award Atoms) with S.C.O.R.E.. That's fine, until you're at max rank for the Season. Then you just get nothing. A reduced Atoms reward would seem appropriate.
---
I mean, people used to grind the dailies and weeklies and not buy the Atom bundles. They made the challenges easier and changed the rewards. That's fine. I'm good with that. But there should still /be/ rewards. So, when at max rank, why not award a few Atoms? As it is we grind the dailies and weeklies for S.C.O.R.E., so why not?
---
So they just transferred the accounts to a p2p game? I’m sure you’re serious but it sounds like a bad joke.
---
It also clips through some of the Marine Armor pieces.
---
Honestly their limbs don’t matter at that point 😂 your already looting their body
---
If you farm random encounters you'll find raiders to help for rep. One of them is wounded and needs ammo, so have 55.6 to spare. This is how I farmed the majority of the way to Allied on both factions... It takes hours upon hours though lol
---
No, they are the rarest items in the loot pool.
---
There are events that will awards you *a little* rep, but if you are willing to server hop, they can add up.  They're pretty random, and spread around all over the map.
---
There is one location that *seems* to have raider rep events pretty frequently, Marigold Pavilion (a cabin just east of the Mothman area).  Kill off the attacking mobs, then talk to one of the guys there who'll thank you and give you a sliver of rep (there are others that will ignore you, so you have to look for the guy).
---
I topped off my raider rep when I was pushing for ally with them.  It took a bit of hopping, but I only needed a bit to finish.
---
Oh that is good to know.
---
If XP went to everyone, there would be at least 10 people in every event T posing in the corner while 3 people are doing everything. While I understand your frustration, I honestly would like that certain events would get level requirements, so that one level 20 guy who physically doesn't do more than a mole rat would not take up space in high level events like colossal when it can be super difficult and requires extra people. It's honestly not anyone's foult, wanna blame someone? Blame the ones who decided to make the quests this way. That's just how it is for everyone 🤔
---
It's frustrating because it's so common to make fun of it. I got it for my brother on his birthday (he asked) and his friends started taking cheap shots about the game when he opened it. Like don't make fun of someone's birthday gift right when they receive it. It's rude to the receiver and the giver. 
---
But honestly I've been getting people to play because of quarrentine as a way to hang out while we wait this pandemic out.
---
Communist...doesn’t work....seems like that’s a correct feature.
---
[if only this guy understood](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/comments/if402i/for_all_of_the_explosive_weapon_badmouthers_i/g2lz8fk/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)
---
Can you explain your problem further? What do you mean?
---
It’s all in the timing. You need to fire your .50 cal and switch at a specific time. The way it’ll look is like a bullet just came out of your chest. The gun you switched to should have the same ammo capacity as the amount of bullets you had in the other gun at the time of switching. It’s difficult to time it just right.
---
Dang bro u in it to win it I think i’m still like almost halfway. Are there specific challenges for the run or like should I farm... how am I supposed to be doing this?
---
I like this, logically. We vaxxed the new peeps, and all of us vaulters have been murdering scorched forever. Where are they coming from? The scorbeasts breed underground, but the scorched need unvaccinated people.
---
Man that’d really bother me I’m sorry to hear that I think your awesome for getting that for your brother, I’ve been playing with my brother it’s a great time I hope you also have great times
---
So we can apply the skin to the crafted underarmor next patch?
---
It’s an atomic skin, you’ll have to craft it
---
🤷🏼‍♂️🤷🏼‍♂️ if i could send clips I would but I literally just did it to my buddy like  8 times and he’s lvl 190
---
Has the reputation bug been fixed yet?
---
free atom era is over yo..
---
Alright that makes it even worse!  
---
This under armor is a such incomplete product, full of clipping issues!
---
My brother got the braham grill his second meat cook event and ive tried about 26 times now lol...
---
Completely disagree my fat man does 3k and my missile launcher does 1,100, put a targeting computer on and nothing can escape death
---
Oh you sweet summer child.
---
Scorchbeast foods (any of them) provide enough heal to not need to heal for a good bit. I can usually get 2 clips in before I need to heal again (including reloading without fireworks glitch)
---
Edit for clarity: B25 fixer is weapon referenced
---
I mean, I got the weapon itself 6 times last year and held onto one one of them using an alt character so its not like I can't use it or anything if I wanted to.  Thing is too heavy to keep in my actual stash.  I have 2 of the spare mod plans I would just give you but I'm on PC so it's a no go.  Just got one of them yesterday, other was from last year.
---
If you're in the tunnel when your rads are that low you need the radaway!
---
Oh, you're right. Have not noticed it even before, but "pretty bad" seems like an  exaggeration. But it dont bothers me neither my cow :P
---
Good tip.
---
Also soften them up with a regular gun first.
---
Also best spot to kill a relatively low level yao gao i found is just south of phillipi cemetary on the road.
---
Taking pictures of Foundation and turning them in to Crater, [Farm Random Encounters at the "Assault" locations on this map and help Raiders, ](https://i.imgur.com/ID0ergG.jpg) choose Appalachia Has a New Corpse on turn in with Rocksy, On the House with Wren for max rep, Mirelurk you know. Server hop, rinse and repeat.
---
I wish. Makes sense since they're coming from the west
---
It's also shielded casual not SS
---
none that get calculated on the stat screen as it gets added when im aiming, but 10% damage while aiming on the 101 one
---
Hi, this issue has been consistent for a week now ma'am, halting the progress of the main quest. The game automatically recognizes the blood sample has been put into the processing chamber, but the terminal isn't set up to recognize until after a player manually inserts it. There is no option to add the sample to the processing chamber after it's been done once. No order of fixes has worked. I think this issue is based on stepping. If you made the blood sample an essential item, maybe it could stay in inventory until the quest ends? That way there is no need to put it in the chamber. If it's in the player's inventory, have the terminal recognize it from there, then just add t-fuse. The issue is the chamber isn't getting recognized by the terminal and visa versa. If you keep it in inventory, the terminal should recognize it.
---
That gave me a chuckle, Second only to Rose in annoyance. Those nightmares are nothing compared to hearing Rose every time I started a session for months. So glad that got fixed.
---
Right on!! I’m like the only mother fkr I’ve seen using a lever action
---
If it were for me, I'd takes those free atoms anyday, but that's not for us to decide. That's the higher ups. I've seen people everywhere talking about this empty void of nothingness after finishing the legendary run. They could give a bunch of random rewards like a nuclear keycard, for finishing all dailies, caps/chems/repair kits. Anything. So indeed, why not? Bethesda where you at, we want some extra content! Ah right you're still fixing those bugs and giving us sweet little lies. 🤔
---
It seems crazy this game doesn't have a public market with a bulletin board for player announcements on the server, a trading vending machine that allows inspection and then two party approval, bans wanted players from entering and gives every player on the server a booth / single vending machine and a display of items for trade or private sale (for the cap limit issues).  This could be at the lake by the rusty pick.  What a great way to get the players together too.
---
Only 200 more score before I too am free of the shackles 😂
---
*snaps fingers a la 'aw shucks'*.....awww mannnn....NOW you tell me
---
Lol. I logged on to my first toon on FO76.  He was off in the north 40, with 1550 wt.  walking very. ... slowly ...  remembered why I started a new one.  So now, lots of experience later,  I’m paring him down to where he should be.  I was amazed at what he was carrying ( been a while since I ran him.)  Combatting packrat-itis is an ongoing problem.
---
Its all good, thirst and hunger deplete your health to 1hp but neither kill you. Not sure if this has always been the case but at current game state its true.
---
It's fun using this interaction with Revenant and Life Saving armor though, I just use Fasnacht sausages. Might as well use it for free damage just before Earle.
---
Player reactions to me falling down just before the fight can be hilarious.
---
Well my character doesn’t get a blue line that builds up the longer you play with a team and it doesn’t show how many perk cards I’m contributing to the team
---
Yep. I got them from a Daily OP last night.
---
But i don't own that and yet it shows me the SS's Shielded mod?
---
In a bundle, and you can't buy the fences separately.
---
So the rule 34 is that everyone is a sweet summer child? 🤔 Why would you want female super mutants, is it so they would have children? Is this where the weird obsession on trying to destroy children on skyrim is coming out once again? 🤔
---
O yea sure give us more events to grind but make them longer.....
---
Weird, maybe it did change then
---
I'll make a new character when they give me a new slot. Right now I have 5 all over level 60.
---
Yeah you’re right, I just have no motivation to play it more and shouldn’t do so. Once I’m done with the legendary run I need to take a break
---
After the event is over and im done farming xp i run in front of people who are shooting, then kill them and take their junk.
---
As far as I know with majority plans for regular guns, it's, you either find a mod, a plan randomly all over the world or keep scraping it. Unless it's a special event weapon or something, it works the same everywhere 🤔
---
I owe my wins to those lovely pylon tanks. I'm one of "THOSE PEOPLE" (bloodied stealth commando). Using gun-fu and Grim Reaper's Sprint, I can clear the mobs in seconds and down the 'squatch in a snap, but I can't touch pylons.  So to all you lovely pylon people, keep tanking, get your tag, and watch me fly. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
---
Not such a secret service after all 😏
---
I've never heard of that happening before so I have no advice to share, but it does sound like a pretty serious problem. Does this happen with every type of public team you join?
---
I dunno man, I honestly never enjoyed playing when I had my bloodied build.  
---
I went power armored heavy gunner and never looked back.  Lots of fun options.  I've not hunted any specific weapons, but when I find a spicy new gun I'll reexamine my perks and shift to accommodate.  Keeps it fresh.  Best part is not accidentally dying to taro salad ;-)
---
Furious ultracite LMG is super fun for chewing up bosses.  
---
Anti-armor faster fire gatling gun is my economic everyday shooter instead.  
---
Piled a bunch of points into luck and agility to take advantage of a plasmacaster with good VATS secondaries.  
---
Got a Vampiric ultracite gatling laser that mostly gets used against stupid mirelurk kings.  It's good times.
---
One thing - not sure how efficient it would be - is to build your camp efficiently, then make extra stuff that you can scrap later to get back mats.  But would need to be stuff made with basic materials only.
---
Fair enough, I usually find I have enough time to dip in and grab all the ores from a single tunnel before leaving in full X-01. Wouldn't work in anything worse than that, though (and the rads seemed to scale with picking up the ores more than the environment itself).
---
Of course it's for the higher-ups... That's why this is a suggestion and not a discussion...  
---
And please not repair kits. I literally throw away Improved Repair Kits as it is. I already get WAY too many of them.
---
Big congrats to you! I know there's probably no sertificate from Bethesda as a congratulations for finish it, but I'm proud of you! 🎊🎉👏
---
Yes I believe the ini files can be overwritten by the game but in 76 I have never bothered to write protect my ini files I've not had any issue with this. With Fallout 4 I had to check the Read Only check box as the game would sometimes overwrite my edits.
---
I would select all your ini files choose properties then check ***Read Only*** as a precaution, not permanent anyway and can be changed whenever you wish.
---
I finished it about two weeks ago. But I bought levels 80 to 100 something like that. I did every challenge except maybe 3 nw challenges to that point. I had all these extra atoms that I had from the pass and fallout 1st. I just wanted to go back to playing and doing my own thing so I said oh well might as well buy rest. I luckily never got hit with auto complete bug. It’s nice to be done and I’m glad I got all rewards. It took me almost 3 days to remind myself I didn’t have to do the challenges anymore. Lol congrats on your finish man. I’m also excited for next season and I can’t wait for the new event to drop for consoles. Meat week is awesome I didn’t get to enjoy it last year. I think I have all rewards now, I ended up finding someone to buy the tenderizer plan from and all I had to do was trade a fixer plan. Next cook off I got the mod plan for it. If I get anymore I plan on giving them away for pretty much nothing. I see ppl trying to get legacies with it. What’s your favorite reward? Mine was the fireplace and cosmos skin for power armor and jangles back pack
---
What server are you on? I have been playing with super high levels that are barely capable of doing anything to the point I won't do any events
---
what
---
What platform? I want
---
Try shooting an explosive laser , gunsmith 5000 is needed lmao
---
2% rare
---
&gt; I need to find a group to PULL ME THROUGH EVENTS just to get XP in a normal rate.
---
Hell no. I have nothing against helping, but pulling? Fuck right off.
---
I don't know never heard of it.
---
I did make this character when wastlanders dropped and I would believe it used to suck just like the guérilla perk sucked and literally didn’t work
---
I've played solo since BETA. While there are certain events that are much more difficult solo it's fun to play alone. I've never been in to PvP so I didn't participate in those kinds of things. I just run quests and explore the world. It's a very fun game to play by yourself.
---
I'm pretty sure they are aware, but entire game feels to me like a side project to get a bit of extra cash while they focus on releasing other games. From the very start it was a half-baked egg. I mean, you'd think, that as a content creator you'd keep asking yourself "what's next?" evrytime you reach a point. Almost feels like they don't play their own game to understand what those that do feel 🤔
---
I've probably done at least 20 main cookout events and still don't have it. So I'm guessing pretty rare.
---
At lvl 202 and so far only found them through scrapping. Even a lot of the basics have some specific plans for sale at vendors, but haven’t seen a single gat. Wouldn’t be such a big deal if they didn’t eat so many of my limited scrap supply
---
That's excellent, glad you have it working, the cosmetic mods in 76 really add so much to my game 👍
---
it doesnt have amazing damage, it only does a base of 90
---
Both grenade launchers are fine. The auto can be a beast, but you can clean events with the single one. 
---
Also (and people don't talk about this) those grenades aren't affected by range and distance, which means they can cause full damage from a distance, unlike a rifle, for example.
---
Events reward substantial XP for completion and other rewards. Those should be the focus, completing the event then getting that reward. 
---
Do not trust events for farming XP, your better off just killing enemies solo
---
Agreed. One simple correction to change this to where the perk card levels are account-wide could add a lot of replay-ability to this game, which it desperately needs.
---
its not special tbh, its cool looking, but it does a base of 90 with no perks or anything
---
Rule 34.A - we don’t talk about Rule 34
---
I'm on PC, though I wont be on for a few hours if you wanted to work something out.
---
I’ve got 12 levels left. Congrats!!
---
I think this is my camp!? Was it a round camp with a dome inside, and an underground area with a shooting range? On PS4?
---
Try looking up some locations that have the bare gun, maybe you can server hop and keep grabing it, or ask someone on communities to sell the made ones for a couple of caps maybe. 🤔
---
Do you have bird bones and/or strange in numbers or someone on your team sharing strange in numbers?
---
Dead vegetarians? More meat for Meat Week!
---
Or.... you could use an explosive Gatling plasma, which does way better than the actual explosives lol
---
Because Grahm loves a good sausage fest
---
We are going to need that for ammo here soon so maybe a good thing 😁
---
yea
---
I was playing five characters at the same time: all of them high level, perfect gear, awesome builds, godroll weapons. 
---
Stopped using all of them except one, since I started grinding. 
---
The rep and bullion system is a mule maker. I am 100 sure I won't go through the grinding twice.
---
Secret Service under armor shrinks my leather armor and clips through it, looks dreadful, so I just use outfits now and don't bother with skins on my armor.
---
That's not right.
---
A Level 50 one I can craft has almost 200 Damage. That's with 3 Slugger Perk Cards, but even still, your numbers are WAY too low.
---
A Fully modded Tenderizer can out-damage a Fully modded Super Sledge.
---
It's the only thing I want from the event. Done about 20 and I have not seen it. Just costume. Costume. Flag. Flag. Grill. Costume. Repeat.
---
Why bother? You can't make someone like something.
---
If you can get me one of those and prove it’s actually a gun I can find easily then yes you win
---
I just don’t understand why, after people getting repeatedly scammed, people continue to just “trust” that once they drop their item, the other person will do the same. Just stop doing that. Would you get upset about your info getting stolen if you kept clicking on scam emails?
---
I like to build, even though the system is a little janky. I also like exploring new places and helping out low levels if they’re in need. I also like creating new play styles with different characters so it switches it up the gameplay for me
---
all i normally get is the head, ive gotten flag.once, grill twice, and thats really it, all i want is the fkn meat cleaver plans
---
I have one, where can I send you a video lol
---
Thousands have leveled up successfully, before we could ft to events.
---
So effectively you are saying you are a worse player than the ones that played before you?
---
Victoria's secret service?
---
Try not to find out, you can only cash in like 20 per day, i think.
---
Awesome!
---
Can't wait to try it when I get home.
---
Any way to integrate to RogueTrader?
---
Your totally right it just kills me for them to just not even consider a game franchise they used to love, and let some youtubers ruin a game we all liked, now it’s just ME, ME and my WEIRD online friends. So I’m told lol not actually serious but I mean yea
---
I purposely look for servers with players afk. Then I know I’ll get max reward chance
---
Base numbers are for a character with 1 strength though.
---
What system are you on? I’ve got extra cleaver plans on PS4.
---
What platform?
---
I've been running herbivour mutation and eating gallons of cranberry relish, then adding Inspirational Perk as well with everything I could do to make Inteligence as high as possible, so 5 pieces of Unyielding and any drug that increases Int.
---
for the gatling gun mods... i've only gotten them from scrapping and in premade mod form.  never found a plan past the basic gun plan.  the only exception is the prime receiver plan, which i think drops from the sbq event and is pretty much useless anyways.
---
it took a LOT of them before i was able to have all mods unlocked.
---
I couldn't agree more. I play it for the thrill of hiding. Hard to survive against experienced teams, but, I really enjoy running and hiding.
---
I seem to get about 38 rads per second in my X-01 power armor, which means I really need the radaway, where its 1-4 in the Chinese Stealth Suit.
---
To be honest it's just something to have for a potential legendary version , I think are just hyped a "new" legendary was added to the loot table so people just want to learn new plan for a chance at a new legendary and some people will go an extra mile for the plan
---
spec into 2 handed damage and it slaps
---
it has nothing to do with builds, its those fucking "magic" weapons everyone keeps exploiting. it has nothing to do with damage numbers.
---
I got a meat cleaver plan if you are on PC
---
I've never had it happen personally. During the week I'm at work when they change, and on the weekend I. Doing other stuff. But.this week I was logged in for both times because of meat week, and no issues. There has to be something random about it.
---
Every melee weapon is going to have low numbers with a Strength of 1.
---
It doesn't matter, because no matter what your Strength is, the Tenderizer outperforms a Super Sledge.
---
No, every fucking YTer that promotes glitching should get their channel closed down.
---
Yesterday my wife was afk for a little while, on the drums at the Meat Cook.  She was hoping to be back in time, but figured if not she could still help out the event. When I got there, someone was ‘teabagging’ in front of her while standing on the drum. Insanely childish. 
---
nah, im console, pc was never my thing
---
Fair enough
---
I’ve stayed logged in for 2 weeks now without the bug present. Prior to that I was religiously staying out of the game till after reset and had the bug happen several days in a row. This bug is rng based and has been present since season launch. Is obvious even Bethesda doesn’t know what causes it and how to fix it so everything we do is merely speculate to. All that we have all seen though is that anything and everything can cause it, it’s completely inconsistent. Just because YOU personally got it 50% of the time it still is just RNG
---
That's cool. Just offering :)
---
It's somewhat less of an issue for me as I have the leg mods that decrease sprinting AP cost. Run in and grab everything then run out, usually with 10-20% maximum health left - turn in ore, dip into the showers before the next run.
---
When the legendary perks come out I'm grabbing that 'What Rads' one immediately so I'll never need to carry radaway again, honestly.
---
It will, not arguing that.  According to the wiki base damage for the tenderizer is actually 75 so OP must have like 4 or something in strength.
---
I mean, even as a high level there's that one level 800 guy who will destroy SBQ in literally less than a minute. Whether you hit her or you were the one lunching the nuke, that's not what they care about. You block the person if you're that annoyed, switch a server and try again. Sometimes entire event is ruined because there was no one to do the damage all the same. Point is, it's not like they are doing anything that's not allowed by the game rules. You can literally see a legendary and just destroy it without sharing and move on to the next one. It's simply about whether person is nice or not. If you're that bothered, make a private server, go join a group that is making private servers and join them. Your personal leveling up needs, or anyone else's is upto you and while it is annoying it's really no-one's foult other than the game mechanics so blaming it on the low or high levels is really unnecessary.
---
Give some to me! Haha I can’t seem to stay above 5,000
---
If you compare it to last time, it is obvious the community has mastered it. The real challenge is to fast-travel there before it is over. 
---
Tent placing must be making all those critters to become fish in a barrel.
---
It’s not just you. Same thing has been happening to me, and not just for legendary enemies.
---
On Grunsday.
---
At this point, well get it, as a skin for the hunting rifle
---
Ya,  my stealth visibility has been buggy at the primal cut events. Something is wrong.
---
if i get a three star legendary i might become a melee build
---
Rule 34.A has been broken the moment you decided to mention it, so your rule is bugged like entire game already. I'm having suspicions about your identity... TODD? 🤔
---
Again, the point is that they were saying it's unremarkable, when it is in fact the most remarkable Melee weapon alongside the Sheepsquatch Staff.
---
The power of Aquaboy cannot be understated. I've had almost as many final five finishes just solo loitering in water as I have legitimately trying to work with a team and win.
---
Vegan meat. fresh, grass fed, grilled and topped with a special Nuka cola infused BBQ sauce
---
yea, if i ever get a 3 star legendary id prolly change to that build
---
It's actually a lot of fun! I usually play solo or I play with my friends who are still learning, so when my brother logged in with all his video game skills.. we were strategizing and he could basically hold his own in high level areas despite being level 11. 
---
We're bother sneaky snipers so it's like having two of me ahah.
---
Rugs barely cost anything on budget.
---
You can probably find it for like $10
---
Same the high levels on the servers I’m on suck
---
Again, not saying that it isn't a good (but heavy) melee weapon.  Your comment was telling OP that his weapon should have over twice the damage because you just assumed he is running the exact same build as you.
---
And stuffed with special spicy tato salad!
---
Well when I first started on here my karma was in the negatives nobody would trade with me I had no clue wat the value of stuff was soo I got downvoted hard
---
Round camp yes. On ps4 yes. Were you camped near Grahm? On the lake? And... wait you had a shooting range? Crap I had so much fun at your camp! And you had a shooting range?! Damn I missed it.
---
I have an assassins exploding sniper rifle if you’d be interested.. been looking for a player who could use it
---
Ngl I'd buy that irl
---
On ps4 though
---
It’s SS don’t worry, they already confirmed it’s SS underarmor mods, and will be fixed for next patch
---
Thank you so much for explaining this. If I had money I would award you.
---
playstation, but ive been grinding out meat week, so im waitijg until it ends to start trading
---
You don’t need a workbench for repair kits. Do it in your pipboy.
---
Just looked it was apart of the summer sale going on in the PlayStation store but it just ended. (😢summers ending😢)
---
The point I was making was that the damage was subjective, and can be very high. I never once compared our builds.
---
Speaking of assumptive, that's a lot of "he" in that there statement.
---
Yeah I’m pretty positive that was my camp. There’s a whole underground area with invisible water and stuff. Feel free to stop back by and get a tour. There’s hidden stuff in a lot of the decorations, like you can ride the deathclaw and flaming bird, so it’s easy to miss stuff
---
You should be able to do the retirement plan glitch still. That’s how I got max like a week or two after I beat main story. Settlers was a slow grind being I ripped both of them off of gold. Settlers I had to do the daily and would turn photos in to ward. I use to find some random encounters like the possum one is the best you get the most because of a bug.
---
We don’t know what bethesda will do, but it’s a very close guess that it’s free
---
That's what you get for not making feed for the MooMoo. You filthy casuals. Mess with the Moo, you get the Boo. 😏
---
Then may I humbly suggest that this subreddit may not be for you? You obviously have every right to be here, but we're mostly people who still like to play the game. You don't seem to enjoy the game. If you don't like it, and haven't enjoyed it from the start, why are you here? You'd probably get better reception elsewhere. Plus, this isn't a Bethesda subreddit. This is the Fallout 76 subreddit. Thrashing Bethesda seems even less productive here than my post does.
---
I'm the exact same way now. 👍 If there aren't at least one or two people over there with 5 min till the hour I look for another. Not worth the frustration of trying to do it all alone.
---
Sneak rifleman clinging on to a TS here, the upcoming nerf will probably be the final drop before I have to switch to commando..
---
Radscorpions are Mole Rats in mecha suits.
---
I have to switch to a heavy gunner during prime cuts because of the stealth bug, kind of annoying. General mobbing I have no trouble with
---
Yep LoopMeInOddOne
---
Only Beckett and Daguerre have a quest line, then give dailies once the questline is done. 
---
The Punk, Wanderer, and Forager give dailies only.
---
Especially if you get 90RW on it cause that things heavy and i think that's gonna be the best TH cause I think it's better than the super sledge
---
He spawned there for me as well along with two eye bots and a pack brahmin. Some other things have spawned there for me as well.
---
holy shit didn't know this playerbase is so dumb. I mean I joined a few groups that sounded like they are constant alcoholics and have less then 3 teeth in their mouth but you people on reddit take the cake even more so.   
---
Were you trying to insult a plyer that is lvl 40, has no idea about builds and say I'm the worst player? I mean yea probably one of the worst since I know next to nothing of the game and some of you couch potatoes sot onm thos game for 2 yrs (holy fuck how even there is no content whatsover)
---
In my experience, stealth has been broken in Primal Cuts (by design?) since the very first Meat Week. It is what caused me to switch from a stealth build to a non-sneak build (Junkie's full health unarmed with heavy weapons for very tanky enemies).
---
The wrath of MooMoo shows no mercy for sure haha
---
Rifle magazine capacity breaks weirdly. My 25 round furious combat rifle keeps reloading when there’s 5 rounds left.
---
I ALLWAYS bring her feed 😢
---
This. I have full sets and outfits and pretend I am Roger from American Dad. Unyielding Marine, Assassin's combat, QoL heavy leather, Vanguard Powered Urban Scout...
---
Ah that reload sound of the M1...
---
There's no need to escape, you can either stay in the pit and kill wendigos or run up the ramp and get the loot room.  Once the timer runs out you teleport outside and get the event completion regardless of if you actually escape.
---
Very little rifle ammo does either, but since bullets can be made to explode why can't railroad spike?  I mean almost nothing in the fallout universe is realistic.
---
A trade system like Warframe 😀
---
hacked item
---
Yeah I end up just dropping those or using the ammo converter, they're so heavy.
---
Try using heavy weapons. It’s a good balance between the two imo
---
Thank you very much.
---
it's almost like the plan is rare or something
---
Everyone knows what dog BO smells like. It’s potent af.
---
It is way easier to get XP out of the vault. Join or create a public team with event goal. Also whenever you see the feed the people event do it. The cannee food gives you XP bonus
---
I took a big break when Streets of Rage 4 was released. Came back feeling refreshed, a month later.
---
If you dont get enough ore to make level 1 it fails
---
Your camp do what you want, my time if I don't find them quick I hop.
---
It's a change made by bethesda because in OC fallout, the super mutants were steriles but they had genital, you even can have sex with some
---
I'm on PC and been looking for the plan if you have one
---
Because anything more than a medium rare steak is sacrilege and punishable by death. 
---
That were all the meat for the primal meat event cages comes from.
---
My entire camp had a very similar problem.  All of a sudden I was unable to place my CAMP when joining most servers. I determined that it should be placing and looked into my CAMP to see why because I too found you really need to be careful what you blue print if you want it to place. What I found was a water purifier had twisted somehow and the corner was just every so slightly touching a foundation.  Most servers found this unacceptable. I assume they found it to be floating but have no way of knowing for sure.

Grahm's Meat-Cook has a scripting quirk.  What happens is that during the "Prepare for the Meat-Cook" time between the start of the Event and the ability to actually do anything, people playing the drums and turning the spits have their progress count toward the Event's completion.  So, when the BBQ actually begins, you're already well over halfway done.
---
I have no idea if this was the case last year.  I don't remember completions this quick, and almost always starting from scratch.
---
Another thing is that in most (if not all) cases, the animals are spawning in one giant clump, much like what they do during a glitched Line in the Sand event.  So there's no need to really hunt for them.
---
Not really connected but I wish we could sell things for fractions of caps. 1 cap for one .38 is stupid. I wish I could sell 10 for 1 cap
---
I did not know that thanks for the reply
---
Dont perk packs have 5 card in them? So 5 levels should have 10 card no?
---
More pics?
---
I think I saw that those ceiling turrets that big the crap out of you in silos is coming with the next update
---
Oh man you just reminded me iv got 30 lbs to free up in my stash :)
---
Ceiling turrets are on the PTS as a Daily OPS reward. the bubble turrets that are found in vaults/secure areas
---
That’s weird. My persona pump-action one deals meh damage normally but like 7 times the damage in VATS unless I’m fighting a scorchbeast (I imagine Earle as well once ACP finally releases on consoles)
---
Excellent!
---
Really? That’s helpful thanks!
---
Nah my gauss minigun's dps won't be dropping much lol
---
Trying to find a furious gatling tho, that would be dope for the changes coming up
---
Equipped fireworks mines boost reload speed by like 125%.
---
It's almost like the plan and weapon have the same exact drop rate... or something.

Confetti Mess: Enemies may explode into confetti when killed. (c) https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Lunchbox_(Fallout_76)
---
It's a version of the cooking station.
---
Nothing says Bethesda can't use them, and with how prominent the thunderbird is in Native culture, reintroducing it as a cryptid would make sense.
---
Hell, with the Brotherhood fortifying Atlas and it having an unstable weather machine, it could be explained even better
---
It is listed with the cooking stations
---
This
---
Did it shoot confetti, or did it turn what it killed into confetti?
---
If the latter is was a lunchbox effect
---
Was it shooting confetti or where the enemies exploding into confetti?
---
Helpful in combating vending machine / stash thieves. Makes it hard to steal before the camp fully loads in if the machines are not conveniently near the spawn point.
---
Currently exist a mod who does this, more or less. Shows to you the max Weight of a group. Example: If you have X 308. rounds show the total weight. Then on every Pipboy page show the total weight of this items. Unfortunately doesn't work on the stash
---
they also have a floor and wall version, im guessing they will be rewards from the Vault 94 daily OP
---
Maybe you should've learned from the first time you got scammed. Not Bethesda's responsibility to keep you from make the same fucking mistake because you can't learn
---
I just don’t get how you become Lv 150+ and just have no weapons or lack of reading the events. How people still can’t active a pylon is maddening
---
I do out of game RP, try different builds, and honestly just explore/build camps/vibe.
---
it's almost like the plan and weapon is rare or something and you got real lucky
---
Good one! &lt;3
---
I think my heads going to explode!  I’ve waited so long for that to come out.
---
"OP's" damage number are, and I quote "way too low". Also started with "that's not right"
---
You seem to have acknowledged that the tenderizers base damage is possibly 75 at one strength.  And you have also acknowledged that it scales with strength......
---
So "their" base damage could conceivably be 90 when they craft one??  Is that not correct??  I hope not because you wanted to tell "them" the numbers "they" had were garbage and not right.
---
The R91 was datamined as a Handmade skin a while back
---
If I didn't enjoy it, I wouldn't play it as much as I have and don't get me wrong I do enjoy it. Quite a lot in fact, but I'm also allowed to have negative opinions about this game especially if you take the time to notice how many people are complaining about buggs, especially today about lost score and such, even about quiting so I have no idea why are you making this a big deal. I'm here to state my opinion be it bad or good, because I'm allowed to. People often respond quite positively to me in fact, which is fun because that means I can have a positive discussion on f76 related subjects, which also involves Bethesda because they made the game and are directly part of the game related subjects. You can't tell me that when there's a discussion about for example Scortch plague, that the moment I talk about the creators of it, it's no longer related?
---
Has anyone tried making an underground camp in nw? Like blue print the instrument on the stairs and throw it down in a match?
---
Sadly you’re gonna have to buy the communist bunker from the Atomic Shop for this not to happen.
---
You can edit your character and be a girl
---
Supposedly it's from being logged in when it resets for the day. Try logging out for a couple minutes just before that.
---
“Not us, me”
---
It's almost like that has no bearing on the argument I'm making... and in fact proves my point that my chances at the actually worthwhile rare plan were fucked over three times in a row by the useless weapon... or something.
---
Lol didn’t we already kill the scorch beast queen on reclamation day, I feel like they’d have died out by now
---
Making the cars at the red rocket mega stop explode.
---
Better prepare, he has more in store for the second week.
---
And they live happily ever after!
---
So it isn't just me, thanks. Hope they fix it
---
Wow, I guess light harted comments are bad now, I hug 🤗 to the down voters, it feels like you might need it 🙂
---
Well, it's not enough, you need to bring MORE. Make this your goal, just like cork. That's what you must do, to be forgiven.
---
I was doing the Uranium even earlier and a soon as a supervisor would spawn I would instantly be in danger even if I wasn't in the same room.  Kind of sad as I really enjoy the stealth approach.  I was thinking about a new build but I wanted to wait and see what the fallout (no pun intended) of the nerfs is going to be.
---
Ya, i got 2 different ones on ps4 that way. Was a grind.
---
I tried hard, just for you!
---
It's funny. The same thing happens to me when I eat Carolina BBQ.
---
Curious, maybe pulled from the loot for the bos invasion
---
There is certainly a severe lack of heavy single shot weapons in Fallout 76.  There are the Plasma Caster, Broadsider, and Harpoon gun, but there is just something weird about firing Harpoons and Cannon Balls.  So a powerful sniper rifle is severely needed in Fallout 76.
---
Good mooorning Grafton!
---
she knows you went out and got the inoculation, that's why you two have grown distant.
---
I'm sure some people do it because several months ago there was a bug where players could buy any item in your stash if they accessed your vendor while your CAMP was still loading in on their screen. It was an incredibly hard bug to replicate and it basically required spawning within a few feet of the vendor, but it only has to happen once to potentially lose your most valuable items. I haven't heard any conclusive reports of it happening since updates 20 and 21, but I wouldn't blame anyone for keeping themselves protected just in case.
---
My fast travel point for other players puts them about 10 feet in front of my house, [with my vendors front and center](https://i.imgur.com/p3YQcGk.png), and while so far I've never had anything stolen there is definitely a small, paranoid part of me waiting for it to happen some day. As a side note, this CAMP module orientation puts my own personal fast travel spawn point in a location that leads to me spawning underground and falling about 50 feet 20% of the time. So far it's killed me once, so I hope players appreciate it when they travel to my camp.
---
Its the first time with this event, last year no problems
---
Just that server shutting down.
---
That server was probably being pulled. It happens.
---
Recently or just in the time you’ve been playing?
---
"That's not right" was in reference to "It's not Special" and not "a base of 90," kiddo.
---
Context, my dude, context.
---
Also, why is this the the strange hill you've decided to die on? I'm sorry I pointed something out and you didn't like it.
---
I had the auto-complete happen to me once, fortunately early on the board.  After that, I would play up until about 10-15 minutes before noon and then go have lunch, returning to play after that.
---
I hate ones that are impossible to find. If I can’t find it within 30secs I move on to the next. 
---
As for what is in them. That is up to the player. Not you. People can sell whatever they want and there are some of us who search for junk and other stuff and could care less about legendary weapons/armor. Not to mention...it costs so little to fast travel that you aren’t losing anything you can make up by selling a weapon or two.
---
Dang, a shame since a lot of heavies are such rare base weapons to find in-game. So far into the game and I only have like 3 or 4 mods including the prime receiver
---
I hope not 😒 been grinding for AGES to get one of the plans and had no luck
---
I have one of those and I happened to get rewarded a two shot plasma Gatling. I placed the splitter on it and now it fires a cloud of plasma. Almost like a flamer.
---
haha, yeah, at least sharkbite has some action. The Pictionary-like one is fun but the kids never to want to play it.
---
So it seems that the SS under armor shrinks all the armor pieces used with it. 
---
And that is why it causes clipping issues for almost all of the armor sets in this game.
---
100% autocompleted to me today.
---
In time ive been playing. After  Wastelanders
---
I managed to come in first place in the beauty pageant in royal high once.
---
Agreed
---
She found out that you've getting your sleep buff from other camp. 😏
---
Maybe Glitchesda should implement an Auction house or store of sorts similar to what WoW has.    
---
There would be a central location and you'd have your own menu. You could post an item for sale and set caps price. Everything is listed by armor, clothing, weapons, junk, aid, etc. There would be a Buy or Make Offer option. Buy would automatically take the caps from the buyer and deposit them into your caps amount just like a personal vendor. Make Offer would allow one to haggle or even pay more to help new players out.    
---
That way there's no Trade abuse and 'trusting' some random people who can only get off screwing people over. Then again....it is an apocalyptic world. Every player isn't going to 'play nice'.
---
I think it's a Daily Ops reward, actually.
---
Thanks 👍
---
I don’t run bloodied because it honestly isn’t necessary. Unarmed melee or even two handed that isn’t maxed can one or two tap most small creatures you come across, especially if you run adrenaline. 
---
As a vanguard build, big ones don’t do much damage to you, so it’s more about sustaining damage. 
---
My other (almost) completed build is a no VATS, druggie (but not junkies) revolver build, which works just fine when sneaking. Don’t get me wrong, extra damage would be nice, but with tank killer working for pistols next match, it’s not necessary.
---
My big point why I don’t run it: The game isn’t that hard, you don’t need that much damage.
---
Honestly was just bored and trying to kill a few minutes while I sit in a waiting room for my tires to be replaced.  Don't actually care at all and I don't use melee lmao. Have a good day man, you are good in my book.
---
Tried a similar thing with 1 star level 5 legendaries and a lvl 300 swiped the lot. I supplied 10 lvl 5 with weapons before this happened so overall I would say mission success 💪.
---
On ps4?
---
Nope. You finished and are done. Next season take your time. 
---
With people playing legit and illegally, giving anything to anyone who finishes early is bs. 
---
Keep playing or take this time to relax and take a break from the game or simply do things in the game you usually didn’t, like wandering around Appalachia, etc.
---
Maybe with broken steel? They’ve been quite lose at releasing faction themed stuff
---
Is this the bug that prevents you from initiating trade like we used to have to do before player vending? If so, this can be remedied by fast travelling to another location and then fast travelling back to the traders location...
---
And they put non-legendary weapons and armor in there. I’ve spent hours vendor-hopping and have had little success finding something noteworthy
---
Xbox
---
who gets to define good?
---
Thanks for the heads up! Ill be sure to try it
---
Cool thanks, might just be luck of the draw 🤷🏿‍♂️
---
dang im just tired of these lack luster bundles and want them to release something like an enclave or BoS one
---
Ps4? I'm always dropping excess plans from Queen Runs, if i can get to players that will actually use them it would be awesome.
---
Ps4 utec_The_Hero
---
Well there's 2 more things I missed. You had more eye candy than any camp I 've seen. There was one same as your camp spot. It was HUGE. I think it was 8 stories. Had a whole slant roof. That was crazy inside. But, yours is like a small carnival!
---
Everyone always goes for the critters.  Be the guy who clicks the rotten meat/chally poop piles and turns in greens.
---
33 Int? Talk about a shitty build just for a little extra exp. It’s crazy to think that other players don’t make a character strictly for exp gain and choose to make builds for actually playing rather than letting other players do the work for them.
---
Sorry dude. I don’t think the laser rifle is gonna happen. Not many people use laser rifles (unless they’re legacy explosives) but every Normie loves Fixers
---
I like becket
---
Would be nice to see that Vertibird Power Armor skin or Clandestine T-65 PA Paint in the next rotation.
---
Considering that they were shown in the Legendary Run trailer, they're both WAY overdue.
---
the drums and spits just slow down the bar going down. you sill need to do things to make it go up.
---
Oh i see now PC. 
---
This post supports cross-platform gaming.
---
I've recently discovered this tool, so no, I wasn't planning integration at this moment.
---
This is sad. People have lost the “community” aspect of these events. Now it’s all, “finish quickly to go grind somewhere else”.
---
Sadly there's only grill and flag, then ton of appearance items, you can always decorate your ally by putting on the moo-moo outfit on him! 😉
---
I hate mole rats with a passion, they only have to sneeze in my direction and I get bone worms
---
Sell for sure they are really good roles
---
Why would you like it was going to be new power armor?
---
~~Drugs~~ Playing with friends
---
You're good. Hopefully sharing what you did will help PS4 folks find help
---
Well a massive BOS DLC would be a natural time for them to do that so....
---
This works great for flying enemies. Not necessarily killing them, like the scorchbeasts or cargobots, but agroing them to keep them from leaving.
---
I did something similar and I feel like the plasma gatlings version of the flamethrower is weirdly much weaker than the one you can make from plasma pistols/rifles 
---
Does the two shot give any noticeable damage increase? I feel like a two shot flamethrower type weapon must break so much haha
---
true
---
You’d think this would be added already. Dosent elder scrolls online have two factor approval?
---
indeed they are
---
People are noticing all types of weird dmg and ability glitches where it seems that the person is not dealing enough damage all of a sudden, or the build doesn't seem to work as good. Something is happening. Just not sure what 🤔
---
the thing is "winter 2020" technically goes until march 2021. people forget that.
---
like, im sure it'll end up delayed, but just cuz it wont be here in december doesnt mean that was the delay.
---
I bought this item the day it released and was so disappointed. I submitted a ticket to support and they were kind enough to refund the atoms and let me keep the bundle with promises of a hotfix coming soon.
---
I get them in chem boxes in dailies and events, not guaranteed but still there. I loot all chem boxes and ghouls and always have a surplus. I do use the white springs water fountain when I am there but I cook a lot and constantly get parasites from collecting water to cook and get rads when I over radaway.
---
Playing the drums and spinning the meat spit actually contribute to the event
---
I’d buy it. So sell it.
---
I just want a keyring...:(
---
would you rather them just sit there and do NOTHING instead? at least on the drums they add to the meat week completion goal and same with the cooking stations
---
Some probably don't know where people spawn in camp either.  Doesn't the camp owner spawn in a different spot traveling to CAMP than visitors?
---
Can these posts be put on the banned suggestion list?
---
My camp is a maze. The reward for navigating it is a visit to the vendors in the sacrificial cult chamber.
---
Yeah for about a minute
---
I'm on 99 with all but one of today's to do, so I've finished it in spirit.  Just need to go through it and claim all the scrip and caps and lunchboxes etc.
---
I have 5 missile turrets guarding my camp entrance at the pond south of whitespring, numerous occasions I have fast traveled back to camp to find 3* legendary items on the ground. Stupid mirelurks
---
Because it literally says
---
"Includes: Dark Matter Power Armor and Jetpack"
---
EDIT: Like i said, I know i could have avoided disappointment if I had googled it outside of the game but I didn't. I read what was on the board and (optimistically) interpreted it as a new set of armor
---
Out of curiosity, did anything special happen that one time you got the bug? I've been doing the same thing, not playing during the reset, no atom shop/NW/legendary run board before logging into a server, and have yet to see this happen to me a single time. Rank 89 or so right now for reference
---
As I have mentioned before in other threads, this is one of the reasons why I want a SCORE vendor not a SCOREboard.  If someone earns 400,000 SCORE, then it is useful with a SCORE vendor, but pointless for a SCOREboard.  The other reason is that we can purchase the Season items that we want and ignore the others.  Who needs different versions of the armor and power armor skins?
---
On the Test Server, the Ammo Converter and Chicken Coop are available for purchase through Bullion.
---
Forager has the energy of that old, ambiguous relative (Is he an uncle? Is he a grandfather? Is he even related to anyone?) who lives with you just to watch the farm while you're away. Bonus if you put him in a fishing outfit or something similar, as well.
---
Can't wait to make 20 mannequins and make them all do weird poses and wear clown outfits to scare the hell out of the neighbors. Maybe if I can make it emote, I'll make them dance and finally accomplish my dream of having a dance partner. We can both spam crouch together *sad non fallout 1st tear* 😢
---
I was recently a heavy plasma caster main. Was putting out 6k damage at insane accuracy. Probably my most favorite weapon. Just wish there were more mods for it. Maybe even an auto mod.
---
I believe it keeps the bar from falling, otherwise it would be hard to fill it while it drains
---
It's kinda a mixed bag on how FEV affects people, sometimes it actually increases intelligence 
---
Sometimes that increased intelligence turns out to be temporary, sometimes it does take 
---
Sometimes people infected with FEV inexplicably turn into something unlike super mutants at all, Harold turned into what looked like a Ghoul but with a flower growing out of his head, only to have that flower grow into a tree that eventually consumed him
---
Then you toss in the fact that there are also different strands of FEV that also have different effects 
---
Is there anything to validate where Grahm got dipped? I would assume he would just be a mutant from the West Tek scheme, but he does tend to wander alot, wonder if he's from some other FEV experiment
---
Use this for a rough idea on price  [https://fed76.info/pricing/](https://fed76.info/pricing/)
---
I used to be upset like you! And then someone in here explained to me how people on drums and spits are actually a big help, yesterday one time all drums and spits were full, some afk some just showed up and ran to drums and spits, when the event started after you wait for a minute the bar was almost full past the middle checkpoint, they’re actually a huge help, we finished the event within 30 seconds!
---
I'd go Gunslinger for a Wattz 1000, that thing looked great.
---
Ya with those memory booth things from fallout 4
---
Fun fact, I used to think this was the case here. Early on, many legendary enemies I fought seemed to have *something* special about them. One scorched with an assault rifle dealt DoT to me, I thought it was like fallout 4 where humanoid enemies use the legendary gear they spawn with and he happened to have a wounding rifle. But nope, just a bug and he got mutated into a mirelurk king with a gun, I uess
---
8 stories, damn that sounds huge. Yeah mine has a lot of eye candy, but really that’s just my alts camp I’ve been building over the last three days. My main has a 2x max build budget camp I’ve been tweaking for about 5 months. It’s like the camp you saw but on steroids, way more funhouse themed. If you wanna see it one day feel free to add me. Psn is x--Henny--x
---
I hit a lvl 70 floater with a two-shot missile launcher rated at 1000+ damage. I had demolitions expert, and a 2.1x damage modifier from attacking while in sneak. It took half of the thing’s health-bar. The numbers all *look* impressive on these guns, but the actual results are always disappointing. 
---
I’m not saying you’re lying, just that your experience does not tally with mine.
---
Sexist patriarchy!
---
Why it's a good idea? And it would be a good way for us to get atoms again.
---
I’ve always used a shotgun I love it! I find that it breaks constantly though.
---
Yeah, I switch between commando and heavy weapons. They're the best option for bosses, in my opinion.
---
Thanks... it’s definitely worth keeping
---
Not as many as you think. I actually came back after a year or so. Except some new content, nothing changed much. 
---
Dont get me wrong i like playing the game its still bug ridden and sometimes plain stupid.
---
Auto completion bug, health rubberbanding, loot dissappearing, half of the stuff not working properly, new systems that are so damn grindy, i could go on and on. 
---
Or would you call Fo76 a complete game?
---
Has been at most a beta when it released and still is.
---
20 is ambitious!
---
I'd be amazed, frankly, if I can even get 2 on display without annihilating my CAMP budget!
---
Also, you don't even need Mannequins and Clown Outfits, just nab this bad boy whenever it comes out:

---
I think smartie is just a friendly human that he wasn't lucid enough to actually catch their name 
---
I don't think the story requires much more than that, but I would be down to see it expanded on
---
I do hateee how bethsda hints at these incredibly complex tragic backstories of mutants and even hints on interesting aspects of super mutant society, but does barely anything to have the player learn or interface with these story aspects 
---
They're usually more interesting than the main stories or even the sidequest imo haha
---
Yeah I just switched at lvl 89 and I love automatic. My fixer feels so much better now.
---
No consideration for the working class. 9 hours bro? I would love that kind of time in my life. Sadly I have shit to do everyday so excuse me if I have to sit on some drums to get my rewards that are so inconsistent that if I only played on the time I had available, I would never get.
---
Battle Rifle and This Machine are the two best rifles in Fallout. The *ping* alone is worth it.
---
I usually log on and do my dailies then try to max out my scrip, bullion and caps. After that I run events that could give me rewards that I need (plans etc). I'm also looking at a place to re-camp, maybe to farm SB's or something. 
---
I've just made another character that I am trying to RP slightly, with a build that is a bit different to my main. 
---
Admittedly I dont have tonnes of fun every time I play, but I find short bursts to be engaging enough.
---
Yep, we can assume from past experience that they will not make such a reasonable change. When they removed flare guns from the legendary drop pool, they kept drills and syringers for many months. When they removed the "headless" sledgehammer mod, they kept the bladeless combat knife in the game for a few updates after it. Countless times when fixing things with legendary drops, they only applied it to a single drop pool and not all of them. When they "fixed" the action hero and the final word not being able to have .50 cal paints applied, they didn't fix the rest of the survival weapons, namely thinking of the assault rifle. So I have no doubt when/if they allow fixers to use combat rifle skins, ultracite lasers will not get that. And when/if they ever introduce gatling laser skins, ultracite gatling lasers will not get to use them either
---
Same reason the list and rule exists. Same reason you are not allowed to post "I want to be able to transfer stuff between my characters" is banned. It posted too often.
---
It should be added to the rule 10 list.
---
This is essentially how Legendary enemies worked in fo4, though with far simpler effects.
---
I made a really detailed breakdown of how a system like this could work which was promptly nuked into oblivion.  People don't like having to work "harder" for their legendary drops.
---
It's a shame, friend. I would love to use my Sniper and Lever Action again and actually do some damage without sneaking.
---
The missiles and 40mm grenades are great for the ammo converter, I felt the mini nukes were just a bit to heavy for me to handle
---
I've seen Roblox games do it too
---
Lol nah just dont go 1st lol
---
There is a perk for it. Think its ordinance express
---
Can none drop these ever again? That be nice.
---
Ordnance Express is a strength based perk. This perk reduces the weight of grenades, mines, and "Explosive" ammo, including mini nukes and missiles.
---
I hope not. Im tired of seeing useless and ugly shit in the shop.
---
Have you tried using the Mothman bundle from the Atom shop? Maybe if you built a few Mothman shrines, he might leave you alone...
---
Todd. Say hellow to your new drill!
---
I don't see that those are banned? Are you sure that's a rule?
---
Or antibiotics. Even if it was only one event like how guided meditation always drops addictol and beanstalk gives buffout.
---
Its literally a reskin of the white one.
---
It's never always a guaranteed 3, 2, or 1 star.  I've seen all of them.
---
It was the same last year, the event totally breaks stealth. Not the end of the world if there is a big group but hard to solo.
---
did it earlier today and it was 3\* for me. Got a 3\* nocturnal missile launcher.
---
One one hand you have people who say that these high levels are melting the enemies on prime meat events without sharing, on another people that are afk slapping the barrel to provide the constant moral support for Grahm. I mean, some people just come to an event when it's about to end, grab rewards and go sleep in their camp while they watch a movie. Plus you DO get kicked out for inactivity. I'd know cuz for past 4-6 hours I've been drumming the beat while checking to see if my help is needed. Not to mention those that do extra, get extra. I don't get 5 extra scrips for turning in the prime meat 🤔 all I get is tato salad. Which kills you by the way.
---
Search for the most fucked-up, unholy bugged items imaginable. I don't mean the garbage that's been duped to hell and back, a .50 cal with a beam splitter or that bloodied explosive alien blaster doesn't count. I mean stuff that "legitimately" exists from the game and its weirdness. I used to have a museum for the stuff, but since a lot of things arent able to be displayed nowadays, its sort of fallen into disrepair. The most recent additions are the NW weapons that blood eagles dropped between wastelanders and the first patch after it
---
Doh! 🤦 Thank you, forgot about that one! Don't have it myself.
---
there is an explanation in FO3, or FONV. or both if you pay attention.
---
The Drums and Spits are the most important part of the event. If no one is working on them, the bar will decrease way too fast to keep up with.
---
Also, donating Prime Meat does nothing to advance the bar in the event, it only gets you some Scrip.
---
(P.S. even with inactivity time-outs, which already exist, you can just switch to Photomode and rubber-band your joysticks together and the game will still treat you as active without having to move your character.)
---
I managed to get into the dome, but thank you so much!
---
I have done the event well over 50 times and the captain has always been a 3 star. I haven't played it in a week or two though to see the change.
---
That’s a fact. Unless you have a hacked weapon or an OP bloodied melee where each swing does 42k damage.
---
You got anymore of that there Skooma?
---
I got it as well. With the pepper modification it does slighty more damage than a super slegde. I even rolled an AAFSS+1E tenderizer :)
---
Nice turrets are not esthestic
---
It's almost always a 3*, but like I said, can also be 2 or 1.
---
Yes mods remove posts that violate rule 10 for being suggested to much.
---
I don't like making new characters, it's just time and exp wasted if you spread it around. Focus on one account and you'll be a god in no time 💪
---
 It’s a valuable plan. Like the fixer plan it creates the opportunity for legendary variants as drops and it’s a rare drop from a time limited event. If you don’t care for it you’ll be able to trade it for a decent price:
---
Are you on console (Xbox or ps) or pc
---
I have never seen it other than a 3*.  The whole reason why I would start that event was the guaranteed 3 star.
---
You really won't though. Ammo is plentiful, especially with ammo trader, camp ammo machine, and the new (surprisingly fully working) contextual ammo drops in upcoming daily ops, you are very unlikely to run low on ammo.
---
Well there are so many F-Us in other loot tables. It’s a feature not a bug.
---
Same for broadsider and crystalised barrel for cryolator. Till that gets fixed no point to use them, cause the projectile for whatever reason explodes just fine on anything except enemies.
---
Well, it's not.
---
Where is the list of prohibited/retired topics?
---
People on here are not the brightest 😔
---
Well it was for me. Guaranteed 3 star every time I played it.
---
Get used to it because with daily ops stealth don't work in them by design.
---
During primal cuts I'm in danger but still do the damage as if I'm caution or hidden.
---
Hopefully if this is the case with daily ops I can atleast still get my damage boost because otherwise ops sucks I'm a bloodied sneak rifle build.
---
Sorry I took your RNG, but I just got a TSE Crit Handmade from that boss today (best weapon I’ve ever received as loot in 1800hrs of gameplay).
---
My furious Gatling is already my favorite. Not as flashy as some guns, but gets the job done.
---
So you want a rifle like the one that already exists in the game. Why didn't Bethesda think to add something that is already there? They must really hate players for not adding something that's already there.
---
"Server heavy"?   More like, "server destroying".   The lag and frame rate drop make it practically unplayable by afternoon, US Eastern.
---
This is the funniest thing I've read all day
---
Al the times i played it before meat week were all 3* never lower so i assumed it was a guaranteed spawn
---
i think you could have a better chance if you remove stairs.
---
these days I just drop those prefab building they work 95% of the time when moving the camp
---
I must be lucky. My bunker works fine. O-o
---
Man I want more than 2. What if I want a little clown baby too. Also, there's something about seeing that damn clown outfit that you'd have to wear for daily level up challenges back in the day that brings fear and shame. It has to be on a mannequin, if you see someone actually still wearing it, you know that, the person is dangerous. Thus the entire combination will be the most terrifying thing you've seen for ages. You can make a small room with a window and put some invisibility then secretly move it around your camp with people on it 🤔 I'm sure I can make this work.
---
I love everything about meetweek, especially the song on the jukebox
---
I've done it a lot, maybe a few hundred times, getting a non 3 star is really rare.
---
True, but it did have fast reload and more damage to humans. 
---
Anyway i just swapped it for legendary scrip and got an explosive pump action so i'm all set lol
---

---
Well that's a little disappointing but I guess I can fork over some atoms for the nostalgia
---
What ones do you not have enough of?
---
Cool story bro.
---
The argument you're making relies on the notion those three Tendorizers that dropped for you would have been the plan if the weapon itself wasn't in the drop pool. I assure you that's not how RNG works.
---
Its not its a lunchbox effect like others replied.
---
That doesn't exist for me
---
nah, i was wonderinf for in case i get it again
---
Awesome but Graham is kind of a country stud with the strong arms and ranching ways.  How about Bailey Family Cabin or 
---
Middle Mountain Cabins
---
I'm just telling you that it's almost but not quite a guaranteed 3*.
---
I'm fucking jealous lol
---
The only legendary gatling I've ever gotten was instigating rip me

If you are on the same account it will. I believe it works only through accounts but I could be wrong
---
Wait...there are legendary chickens!?
---
Valid. You have my apologies. I spoke without thinking. :-(  
---
I'm sorry.
---
Don't waste your time. If they don't know where to place their vendors they probably don't know how to price things either. When you fast travel take all of 3 seconds to look around and if you don't see green lights skip the fuck out of there. ☺️
---
Yes but they’re EXTREMELY rare.
---
Any online game is not complete since they continuously update it.  Doesn't excuse bugs but a complete game is a game developers don't touch anymore.
---
I was reading about this cause several weeks ago. As a result, I have been doing exactly that - all except for two occasions.
---
On one of those occasions, I got the autocomplete bug. So yea, I believe you are correct.
---
And I'm telling you I had a 3 star every time I played it which was a lot. RNG would have shown me otherwise.
---
Had there been a chance of a non 3 star I wouldn't have played that event as many times as I did.
---
 Maybe you're version of the game is different than mine and we probly won't agree on this subject.
---
[Did i just score](https://youtu.be/oYAZCygB8e4)
---
I found one at the &gt;!Enclave Bunkers armory after completing the main story!&lt;
---
But i'm not entirely sure it spawns for everyone
---
Must be I've got almost 500 hours and have never seen one that's hilarious.
---
Only if she has a character she plays under your gt. If she plays on her own gt she has to get her own bundle
---
It was fixed but I've herd rumors that some people might still be affected but when I did it about a week ago it dropped at level 50.
---
Um what most people would think are the best weapons in the game? Like B2525 Fixers, Handmades, and legacies
---
Yep try this, missed out all but 3 of the dailies and weeklies on tuesday, boy was i pissed, every day since i log out just before reset (for me its 5pm GMT) and all has been ok since.

---
Lol personally I’ve never seen one either and neither have any of my friends, I just saw a post on here about it
---
Can always launch nukes or do primal meat event sometimes they have legendary its all random
---
You got lucky, good for you.  I've whiffed a few times, big deal.
---
I only use the autogrenade for line in the sand. I can damage everything but not kill it. It spreads the wealth of the xp between everyone.
---
You do realize that a skin is better right??
---
You can just slap it on Power Armor you already have and have modded, instead of having to build it from scratch.
---
It's not like they were going to release something better than the T-65 or Strangler Power Armor...
---
All of them seem to have been nerfed. Charleston DMV was my go-to and used to get me 2-3 per run now it's one every 3-5 trips.
---
My friend who has played it way more then my (even server jumping for the event doing it daily) said that it has always been a 3* for him and his bud
---
Charleston capital building and fort defiance are decent spots. 
---
Its not just you though. Ever since update 21 iv had very little luck finding 3 star legendary enemies and when i do 90% they drop one star items
---
Nice, i got more than 1200 and thought there’s probably no limit, I mean with such a low daily cap on how much we can redeem, those extras are just toilet papers sitting there.
---
I heard nothing about that but I saw a video about a datamined camp item that looks like a scanner from nuke silo you can get in to cure stuff... unless it was just a dream.
---
No dice, small fry. If I don't see green lights the minute I spawn, I walk to the next camp faster than a 3 legged man in an ass kicking competition.
---
I play on PC but I'm positive you cannot share it. Unless it's non atom item, which destroys itself upon you droping it, doesn't appear in your trade window, and cannot be sold in vendors. Every bundle you buy, you buy it for that one account that you made when you bought it. Only if you both use the same account but different characters would you be able to both use it sadly. As long as the item has an atom sign on it, it's completely un-tradebale. And unless they make some extra bundle to bind accounts or if that's a thing on xbox, then sadly you cannot share it.
---
You would probably hate one of my camps. You spawn completely submerged in murky water and have to semi blindly find the stairs. If your not willing to swim, I am not willing to host you on my pirate ship.
---
Can I have your stuff
---
Okay but by that logic there's not much else they can do for melee weapons and we've gotten a dozen new ones. The gauntlet is literally a reskinned power fist. The bear arm is literally a reskinned deathclaw gauntlet. The Tenderizer is a reskinned super sledge. Hell, that's just melees. All the Wastelander weapons are reskins of existing ones; a minigun, a pistol, a shotgun, they're just explosive energy weapons you don't have to trade your mule for. There's also more than 5 or 6 automatic rifles and way more pistols, and they all do about the same thing too.
---
Bethesda games are designed for modularity, which means cutting out the complexities that *make* weapons unique so you can toss a model and texture into the engine and have it work. The absolute bare minimum is made to make weapons stand out from each other, and an Anti-Material Rifle would have that amount already to differentiate it from a hunting rifle or a lever-action by not only looking different, but taking thee spot of "best non-auto rifle in the game".
---
No, what's BS is them not plugging their holes. Punishing honest players for the actions of the dishonest ones would also be BS.  
---
Just saying...
---
Even if you defeat the boss character there might still be little non bosses running around.  They can travel pretty far away from the circle sometimes to where you wouldn't know they were there.
---
Wow, I guess Grahm really does hold a grudge against vegetarians.....
---
For me, by level 120, my build was finished and I already had great gear. At my current level I can switch between 3 builds to keep things interesting, but it's rare that I die unless I blow myself up or something. Things have gotten less exciting.
---
With what now
---
Honestly, it isn't all that fun for me anymore.  I was hanging in there because of the promise of new content  but then the new content either got delayed (e.g. colossal problem) or was an inferior reskin of prior events (e.g. project Atlas). 
---
Or simply a repeat of events I had already been grinding hundreds of times and was never very impressed with to begin with (e.g. Fasnacht and Meat Week). 
---
I haven't logged in for about a week.
---
If they add it I'm not using it for a bit, because I'm sure there will be exploits.
---
Everybody knows about this. We were all disappointed. But why bring it up again?
---
I ran a heavy vampire vanguard for awhile. It was viable. Though my main weapon was a VE Gatling gun so my ammo economy was amazing. I also had a couple AA weapons to fall back on just in case.
---
A stealth vats crit rifle build is also extremely viable. I have a bud who runs a quad assault rifle with no mutations who is able to mob just as effectively as my bloodied commando. His numbers don't go up as high, but he still can hit for 600+.
---
I havent tried junkies yet, but I have several friends who have gotten amazing results from it. Junkies is also currently bugged and can give massive damage. One of my buds will shred the ISS in less than a literal second. The only downside is rad and disease resistance (his words, I havent tried it yet).
---
So yeah, other builds are viable but they are more gear reliant in my opinion. If you have a good weapon to start your build around, I'd go for it. While bloodied is definitely the easiest, there are plenty of options available.
---
perhaps but this has happened in the last 10 or so events and no marker was visible on the map..
---
I thought I was going crazy because the mainframe cores kept disappearing. To the point below about scrapping them. It was driving me crazy enough that I said to myself when I picked one up "Self, let's take this one right away to where it belongs" However, by the time I got it to where it belonged, it was gone.
---
I wasn't really serious just making light of the damage nerf and apparently that has made a few people grumpy (the down voted) even though I was hoping they could chuckle instead 😋
---
That was earlier this summer.
---
It already did happen a month or two ago. Right now meat week is going on. The road maps got screwed up because covid hit hard and messed with development times.
---
I'm not 100% certain, but I think this is a new iteration of it. I've heard that it happens when you leave an event before it finishes or something? Not sure, but I think I've tried fast traveling away and back without it resolving...
---
I’m 99.9% sure it’s a ban!
---
Thanks for the direct link. For some reason my drop down wasn’t showing that.
---
Reading though that list, they need to enforce it *as is* before they start adding things to it.
---
Otherwise, what’s the point of adding it to the list?
---
Love to see a receiver upgrade for the radium...
---
I remember going to the hidden Deathclaw sanctuary to get the remnants power armor thinking i was ready after clearing out the quarry and being proven completely wrong
---
That's so awesome!
---
On a side note, how did you get the display boards to stick to the sign? I just tried to do this earlier today but failed.
---
Edit: Nevermind, I figured it out. Thanks.
---
Cool, I'm just gonna avoid that area now
---
Your joke not only comes off as ignorant, but it also advocates for duping which is a big no no around here.
---
Same, when my [50.cal](https://50.cal) loads without the mines equipped it's almost a fucking chore....but when it loads with them equipped I feel like a badass, "Come eat this lead mother f\*\*kers".
---
I was thinking of making a new character around level 100, now I'm level 210 and legendary perks are just around the corner so no regrets ✌🏻
---
Thank you for the... update?
---
Idk about the drums but the meat spits have diminishing returns so you really only get the most it for about a minute then should do something else. Grahm even tells you this.
---
What’s the retirement plan glitch?
---
That’s the case with speed demon, lock and load, etc.  I always have to swap weapons to get the speed demon boost back.
---
I'm on ps
---
I have only been doing quests/exploring and played around with camp building and im having a great time solo. There's enough quests and things of interest to get you at least 50 hours of gameplay unless you're going as fast as possible. Im level 46 with about 60 hours played and if you take out the time ive spent just building my camp I'm closer to 45 hours and I still haven't seen every quest, still haven't finished all the main quests and only finished wastelanders last night. Ive also only done a like 5 or 6 events. I play WoW at the highest level so I know how to min max and be efficient in MMO's but ive really enjoyed taking my time and seeing the sights. I wanted to see how the game holds up as a single player fallout game and I can say that imo, even with some bugs and obvious problems with the game design, its been a great single player fallout experience and its made me excited to play more with other people once I'm level 50 and start the mmo grind. 
---
With that said, theres an obligatory "Fuck Bethesda" stamped on all my praise because while ive enjoyed this game, this company doesn't deserve a dime from anyone.
---
no the gun was shooting confetti he was running up to people and just shooting it at them and confetti was coming out of the barrel
---
Big fan of the guy who messaged me on here because of this post and called me a baby for getting annoyed about an event lmfao
---
No worries! Everyone would get somewhat upset when something they like and try to be positive about gets a negative review. I admire your ability to see so much positive and enjoy it through it all. Especially trying to make ideas and share them to make it a better place for everyone, and I encourage you to not let me stop you from doing things that you love and find fun! I don't say the thing that I do to make people upset, it's just my opinion and everyone is welcome to agree / disagree. Anyhow, I'm sorry as well if I sounded somewhat aggressive. Best wishes and good luck! ❤️
---
the gun was shooting confetti
---
I literally just got an explosive shotgun and its insane. I can boop through grafton monsters in a single shot now. And i dont have demolition or anything
---
Black titanium could be farmed from death claws or mole miners. Mole mines have other materials as well
---
Sweetwater’s special brew. Herbivore, party person and strange in numbers. 6 perception from the perk (starts at + 2), double to 12. Possibly + 15 with strange if I didn’t make a mistake somewhere.
---
Dang
---
Its a glitch people are abusing, that's really annoying. I'm not sure how much lag it may cause on a server but I kinda hope people get bans for it. I notice large frame drops when I load into someone's camp that has them.
---
Yeah this is my rule now. If something gets released that I gotta have I just tell myself "No, check Reddit first" Sure enough 9 times out of 10 there's a post detailing something wrong with it. Which is pathetic.
---
I’m on Xbox
---
Not just the queen. It did 12 damage against normal scorchbeasts too lol
---
no the gun was actually shooting confetti out ive seen the exploding enemies confetti it wasn't that
---
Could use Horizon’s rest. Or he could just live near his BBQ set up in a new shack.
---
HEY DUDE!Guess what.
---
Happy cake day.
---
But grahm understands
---
If you leave the area they vanish too. Stay in that room. That turned out to be my problem
---
I B SS S Super Sledge sold for over 200,000 caps the other day in auction. I would guess you could get similiar.
---
Apparently the testing that they do on the PTS isn't helping it all or much anyway.
---
You can't let the bar go all the way down. The timer is a secondary measuring tool. You shouldn't really be doing the cookout on a private server anyway
---
Tried it once. The nonstop spawning Wendigo were bad, but some kind of effects were going on that dropped the framerate down to a stutter the entire time. Died five or six times before time ran out on everyone there. Not an event I'll be doing again.
---
Shame as it *seems* cool, but whatever the effects are, it made it unplayable.
---
It's a messy game with a messy history, but a great community. It's not Fallout as we know it, but I think it's still worthwhile.
---
Pump actions, like 10mm, are a low tier “leveling” weapon and basically useless in endgame (post level 50) content.
---
I love the feel of both, but was forced to accept that no combination of “god roll” legendary perks will make them compete with combat shotguns and other high tier weapons.
---
Fans of these weapons swooping in to downvote won’t change that reality.
---
Thanks 😎
---
The sacrificial cult chamber better have an orgy room or I'm not going!
---
Oh right, didn’t know it was a alcohol, also I chose carnivore for extra meat buffs
---
that thing is trade only, dont sell it for caps. trade it for something you really want, that axe is exceptional.
---
It wasn't no matter what, just that *most* people got level 20 versions. My vats unknown dropped at the appropriate level shortly after wastelanders dropped
---
Yep, they clearly didn't test it with armor just as a stand alone apparel.
---
After 1300 hours I didn’t know that was a thing!  :)
---
I wouldn’t know what to do with that many caps apart from buy a boat in new gad and ask rose to join me
---
the chickens duh.
---
Stood and watch a bunch of clowns try to kill the perma-drummers today.
---
Must have used 30/40 meat grenades and well over a thousand rounds between them.
---
What is the problem here ? It's a great move, even if it wasn't designed with AFKers in mind. Any Meat Cook I've been at that has two or more drummers has been over in no time..!
---
SO STOP TRYING TO BLOW THE AFK DRUMMERS OFF THE Servers...you know who you are...!
---
I might not agree with the ignorant part but I couldn't agree more with the duping subject being a very charged subject. But hey this activity is promoting a good post so I love it.  We need a better way to trade!
---
There was a bug? I've been selling my 3 star legendaries for weeks now 🤔
---
I logged in an hour before Reset and it still happened and I have missed all my weeklies Bethesda need to sort it out
---
I wouldn't count on any changes happening too soon. Sorry to say that but that's the history.
---
Ok I'll add you when I get back online.
---
Yeah you got lucky. 3 star spawn most of the time but I've seen 2 or 1 star captain spawn
---
&gt;Most popular anwser was "Play with friends"
---
That will only take you so far though.   Playing with friends is basically what kept me going, but even that aspect starting to grate on me.  Someone is always bragging about their amazing new camp (which isn't amazing at all and isn't new- it's the same damn camp rebuilt for the 100th time because reasons).
---
Either that or they are  talking about plans and gear, or gear and plans  and plans.  Like all other aspects of the game it gets boring. 
---
I am currently on hiatus from the game. Haven't played it since they announced meat week. Something about them announcing meat week at the same time they announced the  delay of colossal problem for the umpteenth time that... that was just really off putting to me.
---
Oh I did not know, got the game during the Summer Sale on Steam, pretty sad that its gone for now.
---
Runescape can do it. Why cant you? @bethesda
---
Thank you sir!!! You were selling for way too cheap so I bought your 4500 10mm as a thank you.
---
Thanks .. time to have a think
---
This would make too much sense..no way its happening
---
I'd like to have the Children of Atom ones too. I see they're already in the game too, up in the northwest corner on an isolated wooden walkway.
---
Radation, so hot right now.
---
Ive definitely died to vodka+psycobuff running out at tue same time
---
This happens occasionally with the event in the Mire. The final boss is a Mirelurk queen and even if you kill her, if you miss the mirelurk larva she releases (very easy to do) before the timer runs out it will fail.
---
It's just broken will have to accepts the game is not perfect.
---
THIS! Glad somebody got it. :')
---
Aw man
---
Out of curiosity, was this sign aimed at all the people wearing the Chally's outfit?
---
She's just looking annoyed at the ghoul kids playing soccer outside in your backyard. She just planted mutfruits and she knows how delicate they can be growing up. But sure, it could also be what you said.
---
Unable to respawn? Maybe you mean on certain locations? Sometimes it doesn't allow me to respawn on my death spot, but that's why I'm always in team doing same event together, so I could spawn on them. 🤔
---
Thank you for making my night and getting it!
---
Was it around the time the game launched? Because I thought they stopped dropping those as a buff,
---
I'm level 69 though (really) and its easily the best legendary weapon i've had in the game so far. 
---
Maybe i have just been very unlucky with legendaries before
---
Hotfix for consoles is supposed to drop early this week.
---
This would make the game perfect
---
Its common. People are blaming various things, no one has a concrete reason why or sure fire way to avoid the issue. At first people where saying to be super aggressive and chase everything down as quickly as possible. I tried that and actually had better luck moving slower, going forward to meet things but not sprinting all around. But it might be just luck, who knows.
---
if you just run Pharma Farma you get disease cure like crazy out of medical kits
---
What is the best armor mod for the SS armor?
---
I hate weapon skins with a passion
---
There will be an issue for you if you both revised to play with someone else and don't get Fallout 1st. They're will be no way for you to transfer items between characters. Players can shuffle items between characters using a private server, or they can trade with a friend, switch characters, then trade back. If you don't use either of those methods you're gonna have a bad time because you'll quickly run out of storage space. If you can get past that, it's worth the money (if you enjoyed Fallout 4). However, I'd wait until after the next update. There are still some bugs (they're annoying, but tolerable) but currently one of the main story quests has a bug that prevents completion. Most players have already completed this quest and never encountered it, but new players have. This problem will be resolved in the next update.
---
The best way to put it is this came is janky, but incredibly fun. I've put in over 1400 hours and have definitely gotten my money's worth. But if this doesn't sound like what you're looking for, don't sweat it. Cyberpunk will be releasing soon and you can play that.
---
You only need one stick. Rubber band around the right stick and right grip.
---
Don’t think it works that way
---
Song on the jukebox you say?
---
It also lags to shit when it tells you ‘you’re suffering from dehydration’, so you can’t move or fast travel or even navigate pipboy. Any bug that keeps us longer in the game is a feature to them.
---
Finally safe?  The bug has been fixed for several weeks now.
---
The glitch where people could access items from your stash for cheap, through your vending machines, even if said items were not for sale.
---
I haven't played very much over the past couple of months. Wasn't sure if that ever got fixed.
---
You have to use the levels to get access to those perk cards. For example, you will not see Super Duper perk card until your last pick because it is not available until level 50.
---
I played it since launch and it was all I wanted out of it since they teased a multiplayer fallout game, that’s exactly what it is, Bethesda is well known for their bugs, if you could handle it in fallout 4 you can in 76 am I right?
---
Thanks man , probably with colossal problem , hopefully lol
---
That's unbelievable, it also shows the lack of knowledge in how the event works to begin with. Partly why I started this post to begin with, well that and frustration from a failed event. 🤣
---
shit
---
Are you at or close to encumbered?  It seems to have something to do with that, if I recall earlier posts correctly
---
Black titanium outcrops are literally laying around all over the ash heap, several around Welch. 
---
If you go to the Nexus there is a mod that makes all ores glow (different colors, based on type), Black Titanium glows purple. If you get this mod and walk through the ash heap it's crazy how many different ores are just laying there to walk up and take.
---
You can still find some common goblin, jester and owl maks, but just like me, if you find them still, it's gonna be sold for that profit of holding them on my chest. Plans not so much sadly. Not gonna talk about rare hard to find masks, even on event they were all legacy trade or rare lucky vendor finds.
---
Honestly I must just have a gifted character or I’m just good at using those types of weapons 🤷🏼‍♂️ it seems barely anyone agrees with me until they play with me lmao
---
The long highway chain reaction car explosion in FO3 was immensely satisfying.
---
nah ps4
---
Got the grillmaster hat today
---
w my forest urban mask an enclave uni
---
looks sweeet
---
As I mentioned to someone else. I just wanted to make sure. I haven't been online to play very much over the past couple months.
---
I saw a post about a similar glitch as recently as 8 days ago. That's why I asked.
---
Oof yeah it was about a year ago i think

No idea. In my case it makes my character unable to move when there's no loading screen after dying, and when I want to respawn again somewhere farther to force the loading screen and unlock my controls, I'm often overencumbered and the only option then is leaving the server and losing the event. That's why, when it happens to me during the event, I just stay there until killed or until the event is finished.
---
All I know is the bug got a lot worse after Wastelanders.
---
The Wastelanders grind was a bit of a chore, but I found it tolerable.    But more and more Bethesda is building this game around FOMO (fear of missing out), locking content behind  limited time events.     It really is sucking the joy out of the game for me.   I do wish this wasn't the case. There are things about this game that I love, and I have enjoyed playing it.  But it's harder to enjoy these days.
---
I remember when people complained fo4 deathclaws were weak but even those could toss cars/trucks at you and had that Ohko grab unlike fo76 deathclaws
---
Does the game have the junk jet or rock-it launcher? I'd like something like that
---
It's pretty pleasantly surprising when you find something from the Atomic Shop working as intended.
---
The aren't constantly moving though. You're basically moving them once and that's it. Consider an hour clearing West-Tec, Harper's Ferry and The Burrows next to a rubber band in one position for. The same hour.
---
You don't need to be wanted to damage other peoples camps
---
Not sure that was a thing or my trade only god tier legendary items would be long gone. Especially since my vendor is on 24/7. I think you should be safe. If they didn't steal mine, or people are not talking about it, means it doesn't happen, unless you have some specific person that's always there to annoy you haha.
---
NP.
---
I intentionally placed my vendors far away from the player spawn point because I lost many good items back when the vending machine glitch was going on. To make up for people having to walk a bit to shop, I put giant neon letters and arrows pointing right towards them so their easier to find.
---
Sure is! Those two are only viable with a sneak bonus now..
---
I think this is pretty normal you just can't see you'r line but you still get the bonus you just need to wait a bit.I don't see the blue line too btw,its normal.
---
*Cries in Logic Gates*
---
I, too, once had beautiful electric monstrosities to build...
---
I put them all in a separate structure at the edge of my build space, it is way better. They have there own bed and chair. It is way better.
---
Not a bug, it's a "feature". Increase jump height in Fallout 3 and see for yourself, same thing happens. Same in 4, Oblivion, Skyrim and 76. It's just what happens when you jump a certain height in Bethesda games. Marsupial just makes it more common :)
---
a common fix would be to not get your jimmies rustled over a round worth 1 cap.
---
Really? I’m on pvp enabled and can’t damage anything
---
Which is why it has top priority to get removed.
---
Your best luck is joining the ones where's more people. That means they can kick off all smaller targets and finish it off fastee. 🤔
---
Awol armaments consistently has good legendary bots. The burrow is pretty decent too in charred ghouls. West tek is a favorite of folks as well.
---
Appreciate the info! And glad to hear that there no longer appears to be issues!
---
apparently the bug only affected you if you glitched your budget
---
Yup happened to me all morning on the ps4.  So annoying.... lose prime cuts, treasury notes, etc.  Blowing all that ammo for nothing
---
Not always no. There are a few spawns in your camp, one when you, the camp owner, loads into the world if you are logging in and standing in your camp, the spawn if you are fast travelling from a distance, a spasn if you are travelling close, and a spawn if you get stuck somehow in the camp, like stuck in terrain, and fast travel on top of yourself. There's a few more possible spawns too I think, but I do know about those.
---
What's tape? Is that some new type of glue, and can I scrap it for adhesive?
---
I know this is a old topic but I did this and figured out if I max all the settings out the system stabilized around 120 FPS on my 5700xt. Now here is the kicker, the shared ram with my gpu goes up to 3.3gb (10gb total). The game is using some of my regular ram and I do have 32gb as a reference. I can’t tell you why it works, because I don’t understand why, but the game fully works at higher refresh rates this way. The gpu usage while playing is 75-85% used.
---
Edit: I’m playing at 1440p
---
I can't help but feel like that post is addressed to me lol
---
It returned in May my friend. Next time will probably be around March, when it happens in real life, if they don't have again problems with delayed content.
---
Scrap mole miner suits, kill deathclaws, loot black titanium nodes.  Capture the junkyard near morgantown, setup an extractor on the node there
---
Screws and such from fans, toys, giddyup buttercup parts....
---
Not that I've been aware of, people would be constantly spamming everything if it was a thing, especially since increase in legendaries due to colossus and meat weak events would drive people to cluster all the good legendaries and sell the other ones. So they would notice for surw! 😊
---
I found plenty of plans for wall and floor decor stuff (flags, green tree thingys and confetti stuff) from player vendors, mostly sold at reasonable prices. Regarding masks, I have found few rare ones like sun and skull from vendors selling at like 10c, dunno if they are duped or just lucky finds.
---
So when i buy 20k worth of ammo, I only get 10k. Nice
---
I'm also tired of the damn enemies not fucking spawning during the Prime Meat events. We will get all the way through all the waves with plenty of time to spare, but it will still say "eliminate the final wave" or whatever.
---
Everyone in the instance will just scatter every which way looking for ANYTHING to kill and slaughter anything that moves until the timer ticks down to zero and it says we failed the missing.
---
The other players could have Passive enabled.
---
Shit yeh I forgot about the ones on 4 throwing and pinning you... Ahh good times. 😊
---
I wish a radio bp with this song was a reward :(
---
Oh weird. Well, good to know. Thank you!
---
Dang - do I need to stop using semiauto handmade and rifleman? I go through ammo like crazy so i can only imagine how much 5.56 I’d burn through
---
It's not about the grind, it's about the fact you can literally miss the event if you aren't there when it starts because it's over so soon. It's really dumb for a main event to work like that.
---
Good point!
---
That looks like it hertz.
---
Okay, quite misleading for BGS to put it under the update 20, but whatever.
---
For those who cap out daily it's an easy method for vendor bots.
---
I sell mine for 576 caps.
---
Happens to me aswell, i need an answer. What OP is saying is if you die, your body just dies and falls to the ground and the respawn screen goes circles around your body. Like your remote completely died and no button mashing works (your remote still works)
---
I have only found it twice in my entire time gaming. So I’m assuming that it’s valuable.
---
Well have they fixed that most people now get the correct lvl, cause my lvl 100 got a LVL 20 one and that is what I am trying to replace on an alt because the gun would be perfect for her. She dresses as nuka girl.
---
I mean, I "waste" around 28 perks for damage. Might be  forgetting something.
---
I'm working on my third character right now. My first is ally with both, and to be honest, I didn't feel the grind was all that bad. I maximized rep with my dailies and split with everyone. It went pretty quickly plus I was busy doing other stuff so I never logged on "just to do daily rep." That being said, I have no reason to pursue those quest lines again on my alts because they only exist to be scrip mules. Level 50 and never to be played again.
---
So this isn't a multiplayer game then.
---
Might as well just made Fallout 5.
---
Fuck Todd.
---
The Prime Cuts events are so buggy I totally stopped doing them 😖 it's really unfortunate since the meats help the Grahm event meter and is a nice source of script.
---
This Machine is my favorite Fallout weapon ever! I’d love to get an M1 or M14 variant in 76 though
---
Every Tato salad I get I sell right back to Grahm. Sure, I only get 1 cap for it, but it's better than dying.
---
(I sell his annoying meat cleavers back to him as well.)
---
It’s 100% worth it.
---
Lately 2/3 sentry bots I've destroyed disappeared about 2 seconds after they asplode.  Seems like a recent thing IME.
---
I've been spaming vendors every so often, the ones that I did see, were just like me selling the common ones from 200-700 caps, perhaps you found someone who came after that old event straight to meat weak and they are getting rid of them 🤔 but it was all mostly goblin/jester/owl. The other commons like witch, soldier and sun I barley see. The rares like toothy man and the giant even less. The plans during event was usually about 100 caps but right after, I'd find the ones that I was still missing for 1k and it was a steal. Haven't seen any plans since then tho.
---
I It keep having fail with no enemies in sight. Some said that the spawns will just run the fuck away. They need to fix that, the spawns should all run towards the center
---
What, you don't feel the pride and accomplishment yet? I'll bring this up with the team /s
---
Is the ammo use a problem and what mods do you use on it?
---
Don’t sell those meat cleavers. Scrap them for style and wood.
---
Diseases are bad in this game. They just kinda suck.
---
The first time the quest fulfilled and I started the Encrypted thing with the Fake Sheepsquatch the game didn't really do any explaining that basically all hell would break loose and I would die, about a hundred time, because of swarms of a million exploding eyebots. 
---
I was like barely lvl 50 and had no clue what I was getting myself into. It was also a pretty shit server with not many active players on at the time so of course all that effort for ultimately nothing. And someone snagged my dropped scrap items from when I died...
---
Good luck on your sales then! May the caps be with you😉
---
How did you get scammed?
---
Okay then. throw the weapon away. you're obviously one shotting every single thing in the game if you're losing 10k ammo out of 20k. and you obviously play a lot if you go through 20k ammo quick enough for it to be a problem that you're only actually using 10k of it.
---
I see so its not just fire flies ooof
---
There’s a glitch that lets you blueprint the ammo factory
---
Are you using an automatic?
---
Each one will take 34% of your camp budget.
---
Someone explain how you get scammed in 76 you have to accept
---
Maybe the lunchbox effect went wonky for him
---
Beating drums actual does contribute a bit just saying
---
i find a lot of them on my route and have been getting 2999 caps for them. I haven't tried selling it for any more. (by a lot i mean like 1 or 2 a week without actually trying but when i was plan hunting i was finding several a week)
---
How were the weapons with wastelanders “reskins”? The gauss shotgun, pistol and minigun were all new: we didn’t have any gauss weapons of that type yet. With rifles, we already have tons of ballistic rifles, adding another one doesn’t add anything new to the game, it might as well just be an atom shop skin. How would you make a plasma caster an atom shop skin? Or a gauss minigun? You couldn’t, because they’re unique and new.
---
Let them stay. 
---
Doing the spit alone, just the few minutes before the start, starts the bar at the top tier. That's extremely beneficial. The time there was people on all the drums and spits the bar started halfway between the last bar. 
---
The cooking station, just let it slide. 
---
If no one else there is helping you, then don't bother. Waste their time like they're wasting yours. 
---
Primal cuts is for chumps. I got on that bandwagon late but I got a tenderizer and the backpack plan without donating. (Already have multiple costumes and tenderizer plans) It might reward scrip but I have too much as it is.
---
Saw three at robco today
---
I understand it is fixed in pts
---
It’s different because it uses less materials to make. Seriously.
---
I haven't logged on in two months, there's just no rewards that would pull me into the game. I've played since beta and the issues with the game itself have pushed me away. I just don't trust Bethesda anymore with making this game worth playing after the first 30 hrs and the time gates, bugs, and daily limits have forced me even further away.
---
The best has been when people see a survival tent anywhere near the event and they start jumping around it using various "I'm angry at this tent" emotes and shooting it or hitting it with grenades etc.
---
depending on the effect on the hadmade those are useless to me
---
I complained to Bethesda on Twitter today and they suggested that I open a ticket. I did that. I don’t expect anything to come of it but at least there’s a record of it.
---
Do you sell the plan or just the helmet.
---
Newp
---
Mother lode event I believe
---
Lol that’s not the point, but kk sounds good bud
---
Thanks, i've been trying to do some writing here and there. Had this one book idea I was working on for two summers, but kinda lost momentum. Been trying to use short stories to give me that motivation to work more on the book.
---
But yeah, I wouldn't mind it if bethesda ran with this idea as Grahm's backstory, but all i'd ask is that they give him a happy ending, of restoring the family's farm and being reunited with the family once more. Could even have a weekly "Postcard from Grahm" official post. Each week (or biweekly) we'd get a new postcard from Grahm and his family while they're off on an adventure between Grahm's wandering. One day they could be touring Whitesprings, another maybe trying to play golf, Grahm trying to fix some of the rides at Camdem Park so his family can ride on them, etc.
---
Tell them they should play it for Wastelanders, then hopefully after that they'll want to play the rest of the game too. 
---
But lets be honest. The game is not for everyone, there is a chance they just dont like it
---
I got one from beach and clear
---
It's random. Keep doing the event until you get one. And everyone gets to loot the same hatches so make sure you get to them first
---
so you say the same thing as my buddy do the breach and clear
---
Im sorry if i get you mad or upset but,OP said in one of his previous comments that he named the new character similar to his level 400 one.If he was on console he could have deleted his character by accdient,because on console while you are typing you have a keyboard where on top of the keyboard you have previous words you tipped.So for example if i were to type in "To" the word "Tony" would pop up on top of the keyboard and mabye he missread the name and deleted the wrong character.
---
This is just my thoughts,im not saying you guys are wrong or correct.
---
We just gotta wait for the Ammo Factory Legendary perk!
---
You make a blueprint of the ammo factory and then you can keep building it. Also be careful, because people can build them in your camp of they join private team, and then you cannot remove them unless you move your entire camp. Also, don't think it's a ban 🤔 if exploiting bugs was a ban, everyone with magical weapon, double sided walls, those who used the red cages from lucky miner event to get more building space, people who fake force quit and rejoin for instant enemy respawn, people like them would all get baned. It's just inconsiderate to make everyone lag just so you get a few extra ammos. We all suffer from the lack, if we all started doing it, he wouldn't be able to grab it since he would be bussy constantly crashing. Not our foult Bethesda can't fix their own game 😔
---
There has always been a problem with sentry bots doing this as far as I’m aware? When they detonate their loot is gone a lot of the time, leaving like a 2 second space to actually loot them
---
The radio thing that’s all fun
---
I'm a hermit that has a toe nail collection and when I trade it for 5000 caps I want to make sure I don't get scammed. So how does the trade scam work?
---
During Meat Week, or before?
---
It's a type of cracker in mine.
---
Done and done. And I mean done.
---
I have had the event complete in less than a minute with people doing those activities before hand, when I have done those activities before hand alone.
---
It’s a difficult needle to thread. The longer it goes the more likely it is to fail and no one wants that. So anything you can do to make it end quickly reduces that risk. I’m not gonna get mad that players playing a game try and play it well.
---
Thanks for the details, what’s the downside of not being able to transfer items between characters ?
---
Or now bare with me on this one... GET THERE EARLY LIKE A DECENT PERSON if youre not going to be there early to prep then gtfo.   If youre only showing up last min to reap the rewards then thats your problem
---
Never a good idea not just on this game
---
the plan. 
---
if people want a helmet i give them it free.
---
Sadly, it's better to use auto weapons. Rifleman just needs a buff and i feel it would be better.
---
It does burn though ammo rather fast. I usually carry about 15k-30k ammo on my at all times.
---
Thanks. It was just the Hunter’s long coat I was after and I have that now. Maybe I’ll fixate on something else like the Travelling Leather Coat, you know just to stay consistent.
---
How do you “find” a lot of them.  They are a rare drop from specific events.  Last one I believe was the miner one.   Unless I’m mistaken.
---
Every damn time with that Psychobuff. Gotta chug water to proc Nerd Rage, but I become the ultimate glass cannon in return.
---
The only argument otherwise, is with multiple characters the time gated, scrip/treasury notes/module grind doesn’t feel as bad. I have 5 characters, the lowest being level 240, all but one have completed wastelanders. This way, I’m always out of treasury notes, rarely have enough items to scrip, etc. 
---
some of my friends that are getting burnt out are looking at a stack of 1000’s of treasury notes and feel discouraged because they feel like they’ll never get rid of them.  I told them early on, level up a new character, make a different build and go to town. If I don’t feel like playing bloodied commando, I’ll play bloodied heavy gunner/melee/shotguns or high health junkies variants of the aforementioned.
---
Your good you need demolitions expert and only certain legendaries are super good on explosive weapons like two shot bloodied furious(auto grenade) and honestly even the weightless ones are just really nice, I played 90 levels on this character and a good 60 of them have been all xp from explosions lmao I still main the missle launcher and fat man the missle launcher needs a targeting computer and could use a triple or quad barrel if your on ps4 id be happy to help out explosives can be really really fun if done right
---
Why ... Why you people can't understand main objective of season pass making people to spend their atoms If they want people to able to get free atoms easily they won't scrap what we got before
---
Yes. It pukes ammo, so plan accordingly.
---
Yeah, stringy cartilage gets stuck in his teeth.
---
But that guy I tagged he was just anti-explosives I didn’t understand what is so bad you just gotta figure them out
---
oh ok I will have to make sure I do that
---
Yeah we need BoS power armor paint schemes. And a BoS paint scheme for combat armor. And a BoS outfits.
---
I have like every mod you would need unlocked just lmk I’m on ps4 dm me for username
---
make sure to report. And yes it will get you banned.
---
I had the same experience as you. The Gatling plasma flamer seems really underpowered.
---
I got one from Breach and Clear as well
---
hunt for a red aslyum outfit. I did it for 150 hours and didn't find one. Great stuff.
---
Breach and Clear has the better drop rate for it
---
Wish you could get a 3* version
---
Yea you got lucky I never got one around launch I didn’t know apparently
---
Count the spots from the green spaceship.  That should be the number of days.
---
this reminds me of the conversation between Gimli and that Rohan princess
---
That's the marine armour helmet. marine tactical helmet can spawn in several places in the bog area (may be other places but i find them there)
---
Will purposely start putting green lights in random spots around my camp nowhere near my actual vendors.
---
Personaly I think there cannot be more perfect location than fort defiance. First off I've noticed that many times it can have upto 3 legendary 3 star ghouls ready to be slammed. If you don't find any? Still decent xp farm. You can also grab daily straight jackets that you find there, which is one of the most expensive outfit item that you can sell for around 40 caps eatch. And if you go to the other side, at the very end, at the one of the bunker beds you can find the colored asylum outfits for extra caps. I believe the super rare one is like 30k caps or something. So usually I have a friend who has his camp next to fort. I go in, do a quick run, after I'm done if the other side isn't open I check that for asylum outfits, then check the map, no events? Switch servers, good even? Do event, then go back, switch servers. 🤔 Best thing ever, or what?
---
Slightly unrelated, I came across a random spawn at the primal cuts in the ash heap yesterday where a settler was running away and screaming for me to save him from a legendary chicken. Of I killed both the settler and the chicken. The dropped a low level explosive pipe pistol and it reminded me of the exploding chicken Skyrim mod.
---
Honestly they prolly only don’t have it because I’m the only one of our friends who plays it and let’s face it I’m wack as hell
---
I'm somewhat willing to do ps4/xbox since both are gamepad and don't have hackers
---
Pc/console hell no, because of hackers and M+K differences
---
They're literally just a shotgun, a pistol, and a minigun, dude. We've already got energy-based versions of all of that. You could make all of them skins for laser pistols, scattered laser rifles, and gatling lasers and the only difference in function would be the inherent explosive damage, which is something many people already have with legacies, and higher stats, which an AMR would have. Plasma caster is the only thing you really couldn't just do a reskin of something with but it's an energy-class broadsider.
---
Again, the entire Bethesda weapon system is designed to just slap a skin on and change some values. If you wanna boil a new weapon down to "well it's just a reskin with higher stats", then you need to understand that that's the entire point. Hell, aside from the reload animation, the lever-action is the same situation. You've gotta be saying the lever-action is a pointless weapon, too. Or the Enclave plasma guns, the Ultracite gating lasers, and again 90% of all melee weapons. If a weapon has to be unique to be worth adding then we should just get rid of every melee weapon aside from the pool cue, the lead pipe, the ripper/chainsaw/buzz blade, and the brass knuckles since every weapon of their type does the exact same thing.
---
At least it's still good in gatling mode lol
---
getting to 2 doesn't count as you can get that before you step out of the vault basically. i am pretty sure 3 is when you get the challenge. it would take you like 2 minutes to find out.
---
Maybe it'll be a stand alone purchase like the settler/raider bundle but stuff is coming.
---
Edit: Just checked the leaked vertibird PA and it has a BoS insignia.
---
I’ve never traded items except through the vendors but that seems like a shitty thing to do to just have ppl steal shit
---
Yeah I tried this too, you level inside the vault don't you? It might start proccing after leaving 76
---
Nothing special happened, I did the exact same thing I always did but still got the bug for some reason.
---
A decent person goes to the event when it starts. You know, events even have icons and travel option for that very reason, because that's how its works, thats how it designed, and your bitching about it not gonna change the fact that they fucked up this one.
---
Everything is tankier than normal, I thought that was by design though.
---
Done? As in, you're part of the mothman cultist club? Welcome if so my bredda, may the holy moth man be with you!
---
Yeah my next perk(s) will very likely be demolition expert. I have a bunch of other explosive weapons that have been in storage for a while.
---
Ima add it rn but you should take your username down unless you want a assload of notifications
---
There already is one, Zorbo's Spaceship is the countdown.
---
He started the Season around level 30, and moves once a day. The race ends when Zorbo reaches lv 100. Hence, "A Race Against Time!" and "Defeat Evil Dr. Zorbo!"
---
No, with TODD all things are possible.
---
I personally would love it. Just more players that can play, trade, show camps etc.
---
Maybe cuz they had to make colossus tankier than the weaker regular colossus, so the code changed everywhere, and everything's tanky all of a sudden.
---
During meat week
---
yea you level in the vault, I just wanted to know if it was like level 10 or something but I will try to get 3 and see if it works.
---
Whoever said its an insta ban outfit has no idea what theyre talking about. The travelling leather coat is a legitimate outfit. Whoever said that either wants to be a troll or was also misinformed
---
You won't have a blue line by your name when in a group.  When the others join your group, their bar will grow until it completes the bond - so you'll see three blue lines only.  In a full group, you will notice above the top character 'x4' - showing you have fully bonded.
---
Thanks, I will try for 3 and see if it works. Gotta make the long trek to wayward!
---
They haven’t plugged holes since before the game was released from b.e.t.a. I have seen the same problems persist since then. Expecting anything to change is a pipe dream, IMO. 
---
I still stand by what I said...next seasontake your time or take a break when your done.
---
If the instanced interiors comes (yes if lol) I'm stacking mine with all outfits and gun displays
---
m1 garand would be amazing. i also miss the original fallout 3 sniper design.. wonder why they got rid of that
---
Dont know...
---
F...ing ghouls are my bane of existence, everything else is a joke to me (even if they tear me apart, just by looking at me)
---
I am seriosly hate feral ghouls, they too fast, too much much dmg, and radiation, and if you deal with one, there are hoard waiting you around corner, you are screwed if you dont bring some auto minigun mivr nuker(or any automatic guns/fast reload ones)
---
Yup, started recently. Bad fps drops on LITS, Earle, Whitespring Bunker etc
---
In order to save on memory and processing power, each character is only allowed 800 pounds of storage plus whatever they can carry. Weapons, for example, are really heavy and take up a lot of storage budget. It's much easier to store items you want to keep but don't regularly use on your side characters than to keep everything on one character.
---
All of these things are already in game. There’s like 7 BOS PA paints for T60 and a butt ton of outfits you scan get from turning in technical data.
---
I really wanna see the legendary squirt gun that shoots bubbles. I do not understand what they have against giving us more than flare gun to mess around with just some soap and water. 🤔
---
I had a feeling. Thx
---
the cook out starts in 10 mins. go there. kill critters. that should do it.
---
110% agree.  I hate trading because of the scammers.  It's awful.
---
This is a fair price. The other person in this thread is just trying to bleed people dry.
---
Can't look at the legendary run map right now since I'm out of town for the next couple of days :/
---
Oh right. 
---
I’ve seen that helmet too.  Didn’t know there was a plan for it
---
Unfortunately this bug has been fixed in the PTS, so it will be gone in the next patch.
---
Yes I've been farming the hell out of Glass Caverns (when it does work) and Line in The Sand. Wish I got more than 100 SCORE per 10k exp, though.
---
I mean... I have a good amount of DPS-enhancing shotgun cards right? And even so, a goddamn level 20-something scorched againat my like 120 damage combat shotgun with +35% damage shouldnt take moren than 2 shots right? Just seems so asenine
---
New damage update?! Oh no... lol
---
If you like outfit s with backpacks, try the union outfit, it has a black backpack and is entire black outfit. Looks pretty cool and not many people have it or wear it 🤔
---
Why do we even need dumb bullshit like couriers when games have solved this problem **for over two decades**.
---
Well ESO is developed by ZeniMax Online. Bethesda is only the publisher.
---
I will look when I get on and let you know. I want to say it's two more weeks and ends on Sept 8th.
---
I need cured so bad I’m not able to hold some of the ingredients long enough to make cases worth &lt;as in water cases amounts&gt; and I haven’t found as much in med boxes and bags. Adding these to loot pools in 2-3 cures would be extremely helpful
---
This. I was in several events in a row where there were at least two people on drums (me starting five minutes before the hour) and at least one on the spit and we started the event with the bar half full. With a couple of people doing the other tasks, we finished in two minutes or less.
---
Then I just had two events in a row where the drums and spits had no more than a total of two people the whole time, 5 or 6 high level players in power armor all running around trying to shoot the same squirrels. We actually started ticking down both times and took 4 or 5 minutes to complete.
---
That actually helps a lot! Had no idea that was how that worked "under the hood" so to speak. Appreciate the help pal.
---
To unlock more attachments for it, I basically just have to keep scrapping other combat shotguns, right?
---
That's a junkies 2h god roll
---
I did and can make
---
Ever use a TSE pump before the nerf?
---
Thats ma'am and very welcome. Im level like 365 at this point caps are kinda meaningless but thank you!! Glad to help out.
---
Yeah Ive been trying to get a legendary shotgun but havent had much luck. I think I only have one tier of bloody mess, Ill need to get more of those.
---
Level 2 doesn’t count but level 3 will. I do this all the time. I usually go straight to wayward, but first I stop outside at overseers camp to craft a weapon, armor and place camp as wayward xp isn’t enough alone. Then click through the dialogue in the bar quickly and level 3 is yours. May be a faster way but I don’t know.
---
I think I get like 500 score from one line in the sand if I have all xp boosts and I'm slamming those targets right on point 🤔 my bf with his noob and two shot 10mm went from level 10 to 20. So the xp amount is great but it can always be better, yes.
---
Rip. I use a BE laser rifle and it does work on people. But if they’re bloodied, they’re low health so you should be able to smack them down if they’re not careful.
---
To my knowledge gauntlets never double dipped. Only the meathook. And no, that was patched out with wastelanders (I believe that was the patch). So, unless they rolled it back accidentally with some recent hotfix...
---
Theres literally posts about this event specifically to get there early and help prep.   Because when the event " starts " and has the icon everyone still has LITERALLY 2 minutes until the actual cookout.    GTFO
---
Not sure about that, I had larva running about after the event I was at last night that successfully completed.
---
If the people are there before the event starts and all 6 positions are manned for the full 2 minute warm-up phase then the event can start with up to 85% progress. My fastest event completion with that was 15 seconds.
---
U can’t control where the spawn point is
---
Not even 5 minutes ago I hit lvl 40 and I agree
---
Could be. Was a rude surprise. I found out they're tougher and stealth doesn't work so well the first time I did one. With my stealth sniper.
---
You mean the SpongeBob song from meat weak? Plus you an always listen to music WHILE playing fallout tho 🤔
---
Gauntlets never benefited from both of them. The only one that did was the meat hook. And no, that was patched a little while ago.
---
Anything you use to “punch” including the meat hook now only benefits from iron fist.
---
I don't feel too strongly one way or the other, but I wouldn't object to cross play between consoles.
---
I agree it would be a beauty to have !
---
it ends in 14 days so September 7th (enemy ship has 15 moves left to "win") So we have the 25th and the 1st left for weeklies.  
---
Note it will technically be the 8th at noon EST I am pretty damn sure since the ATX updates on Tuesdays.
---
Ive recently come back after not playing since opening week and have never touched melees I thought it was all gauntlets
---
Me and a friend had a group for civil war done before my deployment and I made confederate hats and the full union. They are nice but I prefer either the coats because of green hat thing from the assault gas mask and it’s variant br caravan just without the Gasmask
---
Nice details actually I don’t about that thanks
---
How dare you use logic!? This is America where we prioritize guns and the military over Healthcare.
---
Why not make one post about all the weapons you want to see in game?
---
How much do you sell them for? That's a really good idea.
---
Seriously just add one to a museum and bam
---
Okay thanks! I should be able to get the final bundle easily then
---
14 spots left after today
---
lol what kind of incel answer is this
---
Thanks for sharing, I’m so gonna get the Red Scare skin, hope they don’t remove the feature.
---
Gotcha. Is meathook unarmed or gladiator now?
---
Well good for you
---
Because if been getting 1+2* captains as well
---
Sure.
---
Its a reward for completing the event
---
they'll add it as a new skin for the lever action. Why the lever action? because the receiver clearly says .30 CAL, similar to how they made a handmade skin that clearly says 7.62
---
Wait nevermind I misread the title
---
I got 8 more spots to go but feel confident. Also I am not sure how they are going to do bonus challenge weekend. Could be basically like this weekend but double the challenges?
---
What platform do you play on?
---
different categories should have different sort fields
---
I feel like I should not have to tell a developer this
---
I know, sometimes it disappears from my inventory after completing the event. I’m wondering if it’s a bug
---
Yeah it’s pretty tricky but you need to take advantage of the auto snap feature
---
the wilderness is back
---
source: i play runescape though i mainly just am a skiller
---
There's higher odds of a rainbow dragon being riden by an alien being added into the F76 than a reliably functioning 1911 is.
---
Though I do agree, a 1911 would be awesome.
---
Just get the cursed ranged gun, forgot how's it called. I see a lot people abusing it, especially since it's reduced weight!
---
Raw flux spoils while pure flux doesn’t so it’s probably raw flux rotting into some other flux (I forget its name)
---
Start a new character and leave the vault without picking ANYTHING up. You should be level 2 by the time you’re out of the vault. 
---
Once outside you just need to level up to complete the challenge. What I found easiest to do is to fast travel to a friend (who will most likely be anywhere except flat woods) and then just tag any enemies nearby. 
---
OR what I normally do is, I grab a lot of steel and I drop it by vault 76, I join the same lobby again when I make the new character and I craft a bunch of throwing knives. Assuming you joined a public team for intelligence, even if it’s just you. You should rank up pretty easily from crafting throwing knives.
---
Grahams a rambling man ,he holds his freedom dear
---
Ammo use isnt as much an issue as ammo weight
---
even w Bat Included 2...1-2K rounds weighs almost 40lbs
---
It's not worth it to me, I have to dump most plans. I can't even be bothered to FT to 76 to dump them there anymore. 
---
I don't want to be that guy selling ultracite PA plans anyways.
---
Noice, was disappointed the captain cosmos skins wouldn't let you equip it
---
Yeah I read about that, I'm sure that's gonna be fun to deal with lol
---
Beautiful wording. Youre amazing man!
---
It is crazy that they don't. I used to have them all the time when I looted EVERYTHING. But now, as a little higher level, I don't waste the time doing that so I'm constantly running out.
---
I had this happen to me eating hot dogs lol [death by nitrates](https://imgur.com/gallery/uQOvDqR)
---
I want the medicine stick. That thing was a monster
---
Can’t wait to have a small militarised army of cultists praising my moth man
---
wearing a mask to... she just doesn't know if it's worth it anymore
---
In fo4, I left them on my roof. Never had to worry about them jumping back into my inventory.
---
It cures herpes if you rub the sulphur water on your crotch... just ask your mom
---
Honestly I was feeling heartless this morning but my explosives are great I don’t know what everyone’s hating on them for I feel like they’re doing something wrong 🤷🏼‍♂️ or their guns are garbage sorry if it’s true I wouldn’t wish it upon anyone
---
More people need to find the water fountain and stop buying disease cures.
---
Go play The Division 2 if you wanna M1 that bad. 
---
Me I am sick to the back teeth of the weapon.
---
I want more weapons from the first two games. Bozar, Desert Eagle, P90, and the OG laser rifle.
---
Because i want diverse opinions on what people think
---
Between the two
---
I sell the tactical helmets for 50 caps each because they are extremely easy to make, and with superduper I get a lot of them. So many of them that I end up giving away most of them unless I’m really in need of caps. 
---
I’ve seen people sell it for up to 500 caps a helmet and I think that’s just ridiculous. The plan itself is a pain to find, but server hopping s good hour or so usually results in finding it. I’ve gotten 3 of them this way, gave the other two to my gf And my friend.
---
I believe it’s a sympto-matic like the one from the nuke silos
---
Seems more like Bethesda’s problem. If someone is in a menu and presses a button for no affect, and then presses it again, only to have the game catch up and buy something for you isn’t a user error, it’s the game being an unpolished turd. I’ve said so many times that they should differentiate between “inspect” button and “buy” button in the atom shop.
---
So far this summer, I’ve actually enjoyed the SCORE challenges and progression, and was surprised that I made it from lvl 400-500 in that time.
---
This week I’ve been enjoying meat week, with either Primal Cuts or a launch on Monongah in between.
---
How many mods for the tenderizer are there?  I had two tenderizer plans in my inventory, learned them, and nowhere to be found in my weapons bench (I’ve looked extensively). So I’m guessing they were just mods?  I know one was peppered...
---
But good roast bro you got me I’ll admit, caught me lackin
---
You said, "With people playing legit and illegally, giving anything to anyone who finishes early is bs."  
---
Giving Atoms away creates no in-game advantage. So the only reason NOT to give them away is that Bethesda gets money for them. That's fine. I can and will debate on the merits of my suggestion under that fact.  
---
However, saying they shouldn't give Atoms to players who complete challenges after finishing the season because some players choose to cheat is just ridiculous.  
---
Sorry, not sorry.  
---
I didn't actually complain, if you notice... I offered a suggestion which from my perspective would improve the game in a reasonable manner. That's what these are supposed to be for.  
---
Your comment was irrelevant and predicated on assumptions which are invalid. I have every intention to keep playing, but some incentive to continue the challenges would be nice as well. So back up your arrogance a notch or two and let me make my suggestion. You don't have to like it or agree with it but if you're going to /argue/ it then you should really: a. remain topical and b. not invent info you don't know.
---
Not yet they’re not. It’s only 2103, and it’s [not for another seventy five years](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Synth) research officially starts on Gen 3 synths under the premise of researching FEV.
---
For ammo consumption it’s a lot more wasteful than your Gatling, it’s really for bullet sponge situations such as SBQ and colossus, for everything else keep using the GG.
---
No i will not. I dont care if youre sick of it, you dont have to look at it. I just want it into a game that i love.
---
Meathook counts as iron fist. For some unknown reason it benefited from gladiator, but it wasn’t supposed to.
---
Hopefully they will add bosses or missions for mid-endgame players so we can actually get some decent gear. The legendary weapons I mostly use are laser weapons and they consume a bunch of cores, so when I run out and I don't have any resources to make any I'd have to use my not so good legendary weapons. It's absolutely ridiculous and I hope Bethesda changes this in the future.
---
This! This is one of my biggest complaints about the perk card system. Can we have a few templates saved to where we can swap a build just by loading its template?
---
Just recently or since the event was put in game?
---
Everyone CAN get it, there's just a low chance. Nothing should be given out without earning it it defeats the purpose of playing the game if the best gear is just given to you.
---
Russel's been wearing a wire
---
Explain how you were scammed.
---
This machine from fallout new Vegas. That ping always made it well worth the grind.
---
They have perks for it, I've played solo mainly
---
It’s difficult sometimes. Someone was furious with me yesterday cause I killed a legendary at at a Prime Meats event. Thing is was it was a damn fog crawler and it was bearing down on me and I didn’t remotely one shot it. But it was him or me. So do your best to give people a shot but dint overthink it/
---
Agreed :)
---
West tek is definitely my go-to spot. Every time. This doesn’t mean that you’re guaranteed 3 star legendarios every time. But I find it to be the easiest place. 
---
There’s been times where I’ve server hopped 3-4 times and not a single legendary appeared. And then there are times where I show up and I’m blessed with 3-4 legendary 3 star mutants.
---
It rains inside, not through the open hole, i actually planned for this and built a roof over that section as part of my base, IT RAINS THROUGH THE CONCRETE DOME.
---
you have 3 minutes until the nuke lands. and then you have the time it takes for the sbq to turn up and then (assuming nobody kills it in 30 seconds) plenty of time to get there. 
---
also perk loadouts are coming
---
Recently atleast the past few weeks I have done it have had me getting 1+2* captains instead of him being 3*
---
What screen resolution are you playing at?
---
I would like to see a new game mode.Some horde tipe of mode where you have to survive for as long as you can and at the end you get rewards for you'r character in the normal game mode(like junk or even a couple of atoms)
---
Don’t die after getting them at the event or it will disappear.  I think after you fast travel it will just drop like all other junk if you die.
---
You can literally nuke them. It will explode everything. I've heard alitilery can explode the building too. You can also always do the old trick where you agro an enemy and it will automatically attack the building if you're on the roof or inside. There's also the oldest trick in the book, offer to giveaway a legendary item, invite them to a small room, drop it and quickly put a level 0 lock on the door. Sometimes when pople leave the unconsciously pick lock the door or get wanted just from clicking, then you and the boy want for him to exit the room and ask if that nocturnal level 5 board was worth it. 🤔
---
Ik but what am I supposed to do I get about 4-3 hours to play cuz of school and family n stuff. Some people physically dont have the time to farm
---
Heavily nerfed before meat week. Maybe they figured since they’re giving away a free one star every hour so the world legendary spawn has to be reduced.
---
Go outside into the actual Appalachian Mountains and scroll through FO76 reddit. Pretty meta. 
---
if you find a game boring you can play a different one or just out games down and do something enjoyable irl.
---
same reason you can't have stacks of weapons (grenades etc blah blah). You're not really meant to have more than one.
---
1920/1080
---
I've been playing since beta, but I have seen people use different terminology depending on markets they trade in and discords they are members of. Gauntlets to me are things like deathclaw gauntlet,gauntlet, power fist, etc... but they are all in the unarmed class of weapon, which benefit from only the iron fist perk. The only unarmed (or melee) weapon (to my knowledge) that double dipped was the meathook. Definitely dont be fooled into trading or buying for an insanely high price, because their value went way down after wastelanders.
---
I don't see no freakin dupers donating for shit so get the hell outta here
---
I think Bethesda just wanted to overhaul weapon design with Fallout 4. Most weapons now do not have a real-life counterpart like New Vegas did. 
---
I guess they sacrificed the variety of weapons with how customizable weapons can be now. Pipe weapons in particular are very customizable, but why? No one uses pipe weapons after level 20.
---
Don't avoid it. Take the damn ammo and use it or trade it in.
---
Sometimes it starts and doesn't tell you
---
As long as you aren't spinning around in circles afking and at least on the drums or pits then you're good in my book.
---
other than the fact it kinda looks like a mushroom cloud there really is nothing special about this camp, just a central staircase with a floor for crafting and a ring for turrets.  
---
I'll post some other, more elaborate builds soon :)
---
Wait seriously it’s capped at 110?? That explains why I’ve been absolute trash at pvp with my black powder arsenal.... I should EASILY be able to one shot a bloodied build which was a considerable factor in my build but NOPE
---
I think it ends in like 15 days and some of the essentials like ammo converter and chicken coop will be buyable for gold bullion
---
Oh dam. Alright maybe the aliens are among us, there is that Flatwoods monster that I haven't been seeing at all...it's as if it's.. Among us 🤔
---
My wife and I hit the burrows.
---
Yes I believe that's what the subject of this post was that it had been changed recently. I haven't done it in a couple weeks.
---
 When it was 1st released until recently I did it on a daily basis, sometimes multiple times a day, and was guaranteed a 3 star captain from my experience..
---
 I'm guessing it was changed in the last update earlier this month.
---
How? You can see exactly what is being put in there.
---
I think this board in particular becomes inaccessible once this season ends.
---
I just tried this after multiple jumps and it worked - analyzed the sample then installed the fuse and bingo.
---
Yeah, I had it on until it became incompatible with the Brotherhood Knight Suit. I was bare under my armour for ages until I noticed.
---
yea luckily i rolled a 3* furious w 90% reduced weight so a 30lb gun plus 100lb ammo...it aint that good but totally worth the gold
---
A build system is supposed to come on season 2 o 3 (forgot the exact one but you can check it in the roadmap on the game's website). Anyway if you're on PC you can just install the Perk Loadout Manager mod, it can store up to 12 card builds and swap them on the fly with a simple click. I use it with 4 builds (bloodied comando, bloodied rifleman, bloodied bow and craft/cook).
---
also don’t forget the brush gun(and medicine stick) also survivalist rifle
---
I have a decent PC too but I had to reduce my screen resolution a lot just to be able to play.
---
Wrong sub friend. Check the market page.
---
Sometimes there's an a-hole with his camp ruining the event, and if he has no vendor, it looks like event is buged or doesn't start. Best is to just switch servers tbh. It could as well just be that you don't see it if you're lower level or keep missing it.
---
I have read that if you uninstall the game and delete the saved files it will fix this. Then reinstall of course
---
  Your character and progress are saved of the server.  But it sounds like a common corruption problem.  Search this reddit and it should be confirmed
---
I am on PS4 but it hasnt happened yet.
---
Have they actually said this? The helmet was in a pack that had the orange version, wondering if this was meant as supplement to that pack
---
I've got around 375 of character levels broken up amongst 5 characters, with my highest at 135.  I LOVE the actual questline, and refuse to participate in the grind that is bullion.  I dont even really like the Legendary Run.  I play the quest line and explore, looking for the changes to the game, and wishing for more.
---
"It just works" random Bethesda statement
---
oh oops my bad thank you
---
The only thing left that I need is the plans to mod out my tenderizer 😭
---
If you die, you drop and lose the flux.
---
Each weapon has a plan that only drops from sbq and Earle.  1% chance, non tradable/dropable.  Still a ton of rng, but slightly better.
---
Playing as a dude? Not in my Fallout.
---
Yeah this happened to me one time I got taken out by a deathclaw right after we finished the queen, was still able to loot her body but the stable flux rewards were gone. I was supposed to have like 4 pieces and they just weren't there.
---
The 1660ti is your bottleneck at 1080p
---
Even if your monitor can reach 144hz, your gpu can only push out 50-60 fps and max 90fps for most AAA titles
---
https://www.gpucheck.com/gpu/nvidia-geforce-gtx-1660-ti/intel-core-i5-9600kf-3-70ghz/
---
Yup same thing for me, I would be downed and the second I got revived I would get downed again. It was so frustrating. I think I was around lvl ~30 lol
---
Since Zorbo moves 1 space a day (I think) just count his remaining spaces.
---
I want them to fix survival mode and bring it back. It wasn't perfect but I am desperate for regular PvP.
---
Faction based public teams!! Give us buffs for being in a faction to find like minded players.
---
Heck they could create a pvp based team to fight other pvp based teams.
---
Yeh, shouldn't take to long. Good luck mate.
---
An M1 Garand in Appalachia. Am I saying that right?
---
Wait what? Where is this fountain? Is it just the main one in front of the big resort building?
---
They already dropped the amount we need to donate, and besides the physical prizes there will be event prizes for donating I've heard 🤔 like a second week of meat week or some double xp event. Most importantly no one's forcing I'm just donating a bit for free chest, that I may or may not sell later as a legacy mystery item. 🤔
---
Yeah I was as well, but I love the Captain Cosmos Skin nonetheless. I went ahead and created a Spare excavator PA set on a extra chassis w/ the Jetpack, Targeting Hud, and Calibrated Shocks &amp; threw it in my stash. I want to have the spare Excavator PA set just in case they patch it out in the future
---
My favorite part of Meat Week is when I show up before the event starts, I try doing stuff during the 3 minutes the event is active and the server has decided that I'm not part of the event no matter how many little Grahm dings I get. I love getting nothing~
---
Sounds like a fun gun to use
---
FSS and +1 STR are good options for any melee weapon.
---
Well...problem is with ur rant is that, most ppl already do have those rare/legacy items. It is fair as You have the same chance as anyone else to get those rare drops.
---
And with legacies, Bethesda made the mistake of not making them drop instead of erasing their properties (as they did the radical mask.)
---
Differs really. Some people are trading them for legacy items and red asylum outfits, other say they find it om regular vendor for 200 caps 🤔
---
The contribution is really big. The bonus from drums/spits is doubled if all 3 are manned. And if all drums/spits are used for the full 2 minute prep time the event starts with 85% progress and you only have to do a few things more to complete it.
---
I remember Runescape doing this over a decade back
---
Doing the ridding shotgun event for 10-15 times per day
---
What would be the point of playing if you can just push a button and get what you want?
---
Not to mention there wouldn't be any point in continuing to play the game once you had everything and all the content was trivial.  BGS wants you to keep playing (and paying, if possible), so they'll gate content behind a grind, and some things behind a paywall.  They have to be able to afford to keep the servers running after all.
---
Does it still drop after learning the plan
---
What does this mean?  I'm only seeing about 20 fps at the moment, hardly goes above that and drops to 15-18 when moving around.
---
Because people don't have to play or enjoy the game the way you want.
---
Would love that Courier Duster tbh
---
afaik demolition was made to not work with explosive legendaries.
---
I've been using a pump action shotgun, it takes me 4 shots to kill a lvl 65 scorchbeast and 5 for lvl 80 all my shots in cars do the same damage art the first shot on each one. Everything else is one hit kill
---
Gunpowder, plans, grenades, ammo, chems.. all stackable and I understand why weapons and armour can’t be stacked but why can’t outfits? they can in Fallout 4 but not 76, there has to be a specific reason why I can stack 3 surveyor outfits in Fallout 4 but not 76? It just seems so silly to make outfits unstackable and then when you’re looking for something specific, you have to scroll through several BoS jumpsuits and outfits then several of the same suit and several of the same slacks and several of the same farmhand and explorer outfits.. they should be stackable but for some reason they aren’t
---
They nerfed camp damage a long time ago. It has to be done under very particular circumstances now. Y'all have outdated info. Just ask u/Nekrosias. He misses the good ol days of destroying everyone's camps.
---
The Scrounger perk also helps you to find lots of ammo. Daily Ops will allow you to obtain a lot of the ammo you used to kill the enemies.
---
You missed it, my dude.
---
See I bought that and haven't used it other than quick demo, but I know when it first came out that it too could handle placement on walls (PS4 if that makes any difference). I'll have to try it again now see if it's broken.
---
even more ... if all 6 positions are manned for the full prep phase the event starts with 85% progress
---
Batteries included rank 3, it's worth it, the gun is worth it.
---
Also it'd be cool if they added the service rifle from New Vegas. That was my favorite one. The chinese assault rifle would be a nice addition as well.
---
Yes, actually. Now is now though, and the past is the past.
---
Yeah that would be a really nice change. I don't know what the other person who replied is smoking but when I get countless Chally costumes from the meat cook I think it's pretty damned obvious I'm meant to have more than one lol.
---
  Happened to me (PS4)  @ the 4p event.  everyone standing around flashing question marks.  5p eventkicked off without a problem.
---
The traveling leather coat is a legitimate drop from events in the mire region. I believe It has less than a 1% chance of dropping.
---
I don’t get trading in this game at all, but maybe that’s just for console as nobody seems to be on headsets. Some random person wanted to trade with me and I have no idea what he wanted, he was higher level than myself and eventually we parted without anything exchanging.
---
If someone wants something just buy/sell through camp shops, no? Is there a limitation to that or something?
---
Most of my friends were excited to play 76, but I think I'm the only one who actually ever did.  And even though, only after Wastelanders.  
---
Really though, there's no use forcing it.  If they're looking for a traditional Fallout experience, 76 is unlikely to satisfy them.
---
Yeah don't change it. I regret it. I only shifted some things around the same CAMP but I stowed it (after clearing the walls for new stuff) so I could gain some perspective of the space and when I went to set it up again behold the walls were totally fucked out. Devastated :( My whole CAMP became a seedy shed only as I gave up thanks to gaps in walls, foundations, floating/sinking with prefabs etc.
---
Fallout76 has been how me and my close friends hangout 
---
We mostly farm public events and do score dailies but overall we just hanging out in voice chat
---
Alas ps4 here. Best wishes
---
Maybe he traded someone else for the plans and is now sharing them with us.
---
Nice man!
---
The reason why you can't have weapons and arnor stacked is because each one is unique, at least the condition bar size and status if you haven't modded it yet. 
---
So the question is still valid.
---
He asked if he could *damage* peoples camps and you can, without being wanted. That's it.
---
I get that, but they still do a good job with the lore and if your an OG like me from fallout 2,3 and Vegas, there’s an appreciation not a lot of people have for 76 that I do and it’s honestly all the little tiny details and Easter eggs it makes it all worth it
---
How would it make any sense from a lore perspective for the BOS to introduce weapons created by manufacturers employed by the NCR?
---
Wow I’ve been selling the plans for like 20 caps ive found like 6 or more before
---
You're kidding right..... Fucks sake. You might have saved me some heartache as I run just the shed now but haven't set it up again in a few patches. I want to swap a poster out for the game board so *maybe* given that sinks the two bugs might counteract eachother. 
---
Im gonna build a new one next to it and check it out but thanks for the heads up.
---
Isn't it kinda funny we have to factor how bugs might affect eachother instead of just placing a picture on a wall....
---
They have white picket fences already
---
What console you on my guy I don’t mind playing with you ?
---
I use a PC for this game.
---
Ya and it's not just the event giving 1*. I get nothing but 1* items across the board now.
---
Because flash and bone is really good at withstanding explosions. Apparently.
---
Idk man, I got a Tenderizer last night and where I can’t play all day long, I’ll be happy to at least have the weapon even if I can’t get my hands on the plan before Meat Week ends.
---
Woops neglected to saying something about that, sorry.
---
Have you updated your gpu drivers and also firmware on your laptop?
---
Firmware is different and separate thing you need to update to ensure your not running into performance issues.
---
Ranged, unarmed and melee
---
Nuka grenades are life but my character is addicted to drinking it I don’t drink water
---
I would love to see him in his own restaurant but we all know when the Brotherhood finally arrives they would grief his place with explosive bait.
---
It's in a gazebo near the tennis courts, kinda behind the main resort building.
---
[Here's a thread with a screenshot](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/gbhq9f/whitesprings_sulfur_water_fountain/)
---
Oh, but he's the type of mutant that likes to roam around.   
---
He's never in one place, he'll roam from town to town.   
---
And when he finds a human looking for a trade,   
---
He promises not to eat them, he just wants to get paid! 
---
Cause he's a wanderer   
---
Yeah, a wanderer.

He roams around, around, around, around, around.
---
It does. It's just a direct damage increase per shot.
---
Like I said I've reinstalled a couple times before because of this same issue. But I didn't delete the save files so maybe you're on to something. 
---
Edit: upon inspection, it seems the only "saves" going to the PS4 HD are settings and controls. Can't imagine wiping those would make a difference? 🤷
---
15 days! I'm like 8 away from the moon monkey backpack, I hope I get it.
---
I hope they could at least take inspiration from them
---
Epic. Thanks for sharing. Can’t wait for those
---
That is bomb! Thank you
---
Definitely get the explosive perk if you have the room for it. It's just a direct damage increase.
---
My guess is there is some metadata grouping them as armor, after all they're grouped that way in the vendors. Armor has to be separated because each is unique in condition bar, condition and potential mods and skins.
---
The best Place Is Hillfolk Hotdogs because if he Is in front this Place he saids that the Place Is familiar so maybe he Is Colton Pickins, the owner of this Place and he was turned in a super mutant when Enclave starts to turn people in supermutants for the DEFCON
---
Username checks out
---
delet your saved data is what I have read.
---
Unfortunately Bethesda can’t ban everyone that uses it and the glitch fix isn’t a priority
---
One of the many flaws of this game.. what a mess.
---
Tbh I can’t even remember what was in vanilla fo4 since I just filled it with workshop mods lol.

---
this doesn't mention Fasnacht being part of update 20...
---
I think super duper lags tf out of the crafting menus for me. I was on an alt account today and I dreaded making some ribeyes but turned out it went very quickly. I don't have super duper on that character.
---
but it wouldnt be ugly or useless..? it adds to the content that were gonna get and expands on the militarized feel of the next two big updates...
---
Are you on ps4?
---
I have super duper on my alts and it doesn't lag so I don't think it's that
---
The 1911 is .45 not 9mm
---
It’s okay because people will continue to give them money, and if they don’t, then, **sigh** I guess the game just isn’t popular any more, guess we’ll have to shut it down and not pay for servers anymore. Oh well.
---
This shit is so hard to fix though. I got a long standing camp in between both senecca peaks and no matter where I place my camp no spawn is consistent. I want people to spawn on either mountain side (solid ground), not on my foundations, but the game just isn't having it. The real problem here is that the foundations spawn after your character does when you're first loading a new area, so generally you spawn falling down or glitched into the mountain side.
---
Drop all your holotapes and notes you don’t need.
---
I have an instigating lever. With full rifleman perks and concentrated fire on the head, it one-shots every scorched at Line in the Sand. I can easily solo that event and come out with more .45 ammo than I started with. Instigating is the key, though.
---
There is still no rifle build that does DPS against bosses though. You’re just a cheerleader, and it’s depressing.
---
Pvp, grinding and trading legendary weapons, doind events,helping other players, giving people free stuff...
---
Exactly same thing happens to me! Especially when cooking. 
---
I'm not sure but I reasoned that the lag comes from the amount of crafting recipes and plans you know. My main character knows all recipes, other chars only a few.
---
I used all unyielding because of the insane stat boosts.
---
They're rare enough that I usually just choose to wait the disease out. Only the ~4 diseases that actually impact my combat performance are worth using a disease cure on.
---
Deleted all the FO76 data on the console, still get the same crash. Fuck me 🤦
---
Couldn’t nuke him because his base was in the forest region unfortunately
---
Well I know this is a dumb one, the power was unplugged.  I thought I was having this issue even with it plugged in, but it's working right now.  Didn't have to lower settings or change res.  Seems to be staying around 80 fps now which is way better than where it was.  Thank you for your help.
---
Unyielding is nice because it lets you carry more and run/use vats longer. If you're using stealth then extra defenses are not as necessary.
---
I also like making my own cures. Whenever I run low, I head to The Wayward as a good starting point, and work my way north along the river, just having a nice frolic along the riverbank. It's relaxing and a pretty area. With Green Thumb and Super Duper, I usually come away with 25 cures in about 15 minutes.
---
Lol the downvotes, but yeah after going over the whole map and quests/events if you don’t have friends you’re going to get bored fast.
---
Why do you continue to support the game financially when Bethesda isn’t even going to fix the problems? You only support Bethesda to make more broken content in the game.
---
The enclave is the only way forward.
---
Did you see a scampy22 by chance?
---
Drop them as on the ground and not in your stash?
---
Meat cleavers give so much scrap (with Scrapper) that scrapping a pile of them actually makes you gain weight! I learned that the hard way: I was scrapping out so I could fast travel home, and I ended up accidentally making my weight problem even worse.
---
Yep.
---
ya mine barely weighs 1 pound w 2* bear arms and bat included 2*
---
it makes it worth it as a finisher
---
im a junkie build so my junkies gats are still my go to but its worth the gold
---
aim for that 90% weight limb damage and furious/junkie/bloodied
---
There are no physical copies. They only have a code you can redeem online.
---
google said it cost $25
---
not sure its hacked or its legacy
---
As loot is now, you cant blame them. If this change came in tandem with a itemization revision it would be a huge plus for the game.
---
There's settlers and raiders factions right now. All quests I can remember are voiced. When ping the missions for the factions do all the missions for both factions up to the raid. Then choose a side.
---
Dupers. It's harder to dupe unstacked items
---
Based on other posts on this issue, some people say it could be mounted head plans that have 0 weight. Idk though.
---
I think he means BoS Power Armor paint schemes for all Power Armor types, as for the time traveling rank schemes (Yes i know they're just Fallout 4 assets that Bethesda added in but ehhh i just don't feel it anymore/or see it as appropriate for the current time period) we have, i hope to God those get removed/become Legacy. I would much rather have them replaced with the appropriate rank insignias of the current Brotherhood lore/history.
---
As for Outfits?: Marine/Scout/Secret Service BoS paint schemes would be awesome - hell even a new Brotherhood Combat Armor paint scheme would be nice too. 
---
I mean we're getting the BoS Spec Ops outfit from Daily Ops next month so that's a great start, along with the Steel Dawn Fatigues we'll be getting as a reward from 'Fortifying ATLAS - Phase Bravo'.
---
Not to mention new weapons and armors from the 'Fractured Steel' DLC this Winter.
---
I love when I go shopping at people's CAMPs and have to immediately engage thrusters to save my own life.
---
I literally wear jetpack PA for dedicated shopping trips as spawn placements are so bad on these mountaintop bases. I also like the floating monstrosities where the owner decides to leave server as you're a mile up, once again boosting for your very life lol
---
I believe you can buy the basic gun plan from Wallace in Harper’s Ferry, possibly also the bots in Watoga.
---
As far as the mods, there’s not many.  Through scrapping, you learn the speedy receiver, large magazine, comfort grip, bayonet and gunner sight.  The prime plan comes from scorchbeasts or presents/pails/BoS caches.
---
Enemies don’t drop Gatling guns too often, but they’re common enough off crowned bosses that you should learn all the mods pretty quickly.  If you need it right away, buy the basic weapon plan, make a bunch of lvl 20 guns and scrap them all.
---
The VAMP/FFR is far superior but the TS/FFR is a superb combo. You can fetch a pretty penny for it
---
I'm on Xbox One and got several BOS CPT Knight and SGT knight paints. Someone gave me the Elder paint so I just sold them or gave them to friends. Today I got a 1* 2-shot Fatman as a reward...never saw that coming The last time I got a paint was a couple weeks ago so keep trying. Send me a message on Xbox and if I get one I will give it to you.
---
To make it simple, the meta is " Unyielding " and as you now need to farm xp to progress in your season pass, the Unyielding set is just the way to go mate...
---
https://youtu.be/LBADlzE2FQU &lt;-- how to maximise your Intelligence

Just because they're both green they belong together?  Racist.
---
4 unyielding + 1 livesaving. Just in case stealth breaks
---
I've got a little shack that has 2 vendors inside that's like 10-15 meters from the spawn, there's like 2 Vault Boys pointing to it.
---
When you build your CAMP on water, you gotta improvise.
---
Thanks for the tip
---
Has anyone confirmed this? (not that I have anything to worry about) but I've seen lots of folks say it will get you a ban but no proof.
---
even as a 2* yea thats a decent one to have
---
🤣😂😂
---
Better get used to it. When those Daily Ops drop, anyone who spent time and effort speccing into stealth will find it all for nothing.
---
Right now it's on Xbox game pass (for PC and Xbox) which is only $1 for the first month. If they don't like it they can spend the rest of the month playing the other games.
---
Lots of posts on this topic.  You gotta run around.  Usually markers on your pip HUD will show the creatures but not always.  I have only failed one prime event at the start when I didn’t move.  High perception helps too.
---
So Vamp/FFR is better since it heals you? I heard TS also makes your weapon break faster.
---
Aye. that is a good point. but still. not really meant to have more than one outfit. i mean you can and people do but.. yeah.
---
Congrats! I was worried I wasn't going to even finish. And yet here we are, finishing it early :P
---
I believe it’s recipes
---
Hunting rifle looks ugly dude. It’s not iconic or special in any way. Just generic.
---
Unyielding all the way this is my stats with 5 piece Unyielding,  plus some food buffs, and bobble head. Its pretty insane.
---
 https://imgur.com/a/ywqjjI4
---
Dont worry about pvp is basically non-existant and with pacifist mode enabled in the options its no longer a thing
---
The event is very chaotic and no one ever seems to know what they are supposed to be doing
---
I just love how all stealth has been stripped from my build by AUTODANGER.
---
Emptying clip after clip into critters I'd have basically one shotted or done serious damage to.
---
I can make you one IGN Leon\_Shirow Just finished for the night will be on in the morning GMT.
---
I've never run out, so more than enough in the game already.
---
Whitesprings has a fountain that will cure you.
---
There will be a camp item next patch that will cure for you.
---
BoS look like they'll be able to cure for you.
---
You can always just make antibiotics.
---
Vampire with FFR, especially on a fast firing weapon, is ridiculously powerful when paired with bloodied.
---
I'm almost 100% sure that in the early advertising for the game the story behind the sundew groves in the bog was that they were home to super mutant camps hidden away from the scorched.  Aside from how sparse and small the sundew locations ended up being the lack of hidden super mutant camps tucked away inside was a big disappointment.
---
*Gasps* Yesssssss! Finally i won't have to deal with bullshit turrets always getting munched on by Molerats! A wall mounted Heavy Auto Laser Turret would be sick.
---
You get pure flux from scorchbeast queen, it’s a death issue
---
And to you as well.
---
Had everything auto-complete when I stayed logged in.
---
Had partial auto-complete when I crashed loading in.
---
I never said you complained. I simply provide my explanation on why your suggestion would not happen. 
---
I fail to see how my comment is irrelevant since there are problems still in the game that were there since beta and the basis for them not doing what you suggest. Plain and simple. 
---
I offered my suggestion of taking a break or doing something new as just that, a suggestion. Just because it was not yours does not make it invalid. I never said you were not going to play the game anymore. 
---
As for my arrogance...sorry you feel that way. I point out fact and if that is arrogance, then so be it. I’m not going. To stroke someone’s ego and be like....yeah man I agree, you are so right, bgs sucks, blah blah blah. This is a public forum and I will give my opinion and provide facts when I can. If you wish to not have your ideas challenged then don’t post them. Easy peasy. 
---
I hope you enjoy continue to play the game. Toodles.
---
I noticed that too but if Scout gets the Forest Camo paint or if you use the Urban scout it blends in. I'm hoping for the Scout - Forest Camo paint that matches the combat and SS armor!
---
Death has no relevance in this game, so go 5x Unyielding pieces and don't look back. Your SPECIAL stats will all be at +15 (except End) and you'll do monster damage. Serendipity and Dodgy are worth the investment for damage mitigation, and add Blocker if you plan on getting into the melee mix.
---
Honestly, I just think it's incompetence as there is so much stuff bugged in this game.
---
BOS is coming back in winter but there will be quests you can do beforehand to help Aid their arrival
---
When I trade I always set the item to 1000 caps and make them do the same thing. That way if they grab it and run at least I got 1000 caps. 
---
Someone did run with a two shot Gatling laser I had once but I wasn’t broken up about it bc I still got 1000 caps and it was just a 1*
---
I chuckled. People need to lighten up.
---
New maps for nuclear winter. Nerf grenades and the combat shitgun, or give us another perk card to keep us from getting one shotted with them so we can at least try to fight back.
---
It's against the terms and conditions for utilizing exploits. I think T&amp;Cs are proof enough.
---
The Blood Lead and Snaptail reed is dead easy. They grow right in the river/almost in the river. So you just follow along, gathering it up. Firecap is trickier; you have to hunt for it a little bit. There's a good bit around Slocum's Joe; 3 or so grow on a log across the street, and more grow around some houses nearby. Once you've done it a few times you learn where they grow. Anyone seeing me hunt for them probably thinks I'm a lunatic, because I'm usually Marsupial hopping like mad so I can get high enough to see the orange shrooms in the grass.
---
Ah yes, the death dogs
---
You know how dumb the average person is?  The half that are dumber than that play FO76, hide their vending machines and charge you 5 caps for ammo.
---
I’m using it on my full HP “tank” so I can basically stand in front of enemies and tank their hits. I also heard TS isn’t as good (compared to FO4) since it only does like ~30% of the base damage and it’s not affected by perks.
---
I'll try it this weekend. I never had any auto complete but I mainly play in the evening long after the reset.
---
Unyielding, because it boosts your stealth(every point in Agility helps) and helps you avoid hits, asides from all the other bonuses.
---
Bolstering is trash because of how resistances are calculated, you get diminishing returns the higher you push them. It gets harder and harder to push your resistances higher, and the benefit from doing so shrinks at the same rate. Same goes for Vanguard's.
---
Because this one has not and scamming is a regular occurrence. And knowing that, why place yourself into a situation you can prevent with simple actions like getting a middle man? Sucks they got scammed, but it could have so easily been prevent with a little common sense, imo.
---
I second that!  Getting tired of having to grind just for some disease cures.
---
In my experience, and I basically always lose the damn thing because I constantly have the stash at 800/800, it can disappear even hours after you earned it, as long as you stay on the same server. Jumping servers probably makes it lose some flag the event gives it, and after that it'll fall like any other piece of junk, and stay in your death bag.
---
Optional introduce gram to ra ra or the chick from rad rumble who won't shut up about a guy with his priorities strate ra ra gives him happy life in a small cabin the rumble lady makes his cost go up but makes them both live in your camp forever
---
That's the thing, my proposal even came with a whole loot overhaul to rationalize the extra effort.  The idea that if people were actually having to essentially fight minibosses every time they found a legendary enemy there could be a reason for bethesda to at least guarantee drops in line with the number of stars, actually guaranteeing three star drops when you kill a three star enemy.
---
I haven't experience that issue yet but, what I AM experiencing is that it's 12 minutes away from the next meat cook but for the past 48 minutes, Primal Cuts hasn't triggered in any location.
---
I would suggest posting pictures of some of your builds if you want people to be interested
---
They call me...
---
"TATO SALAD"
---
Same.  It's more likely one of the prime ran off.  They spawn quite far away and do weird stuff like run away even if their chosen target isn't perching.
---
Explosive weapons aren't good.
---
Yeah but I’m not trying to fast travel to whitesprings everytime I have a disease lol
---
Are red asylum uniforms worth a lot? Why?
---
Everyone would be flying around with their jetpack while spraying the Gatlin plasma or the gauss shitgun causing the game to run at about 5fps
---
I build them for my friends so I need to ask him to get on later but I don’t think he is home, next time tough I will. The builds aren’t the greatest thing ever but I’d give them a 6-7/10.
---
If you’re going to do stealth build you probably won’t wanna waste time going for anything defence because you are honing you want to kill stuff fast to not get detected
---
FOUND TODD HOWARD!
---
The worst part is that we can all get so much more XP if we just let her live for 15 minutes or so, not having one gun army etc on so she doesn't stagger in flight, and not standing on the fences so that she'll land repeatedly. That way, she will generate thousands of XP more worth of adds that we all can eat up for score. Then you can execute her instantly once the timer gets a little low.
---
Not that I remember
---
They say next patch so the patch after that.
---
did u clear the ps4 cache too?
---
Damn, I had hoped this was true, there's not many that are 0 cost. Tried removing them, no dice, unfortunately.
---
I do this and switch between my bosltering piece just cuz it has ammo w/r. The life saving legendary seems to work better than 2stars in mysterious savior imo.
---
The SS is a more muscular looking UA and goes great with sturdy combat armor and scout. The camo UA looks awesome with the camo combat armor. I like the camo look or the gray UA with shadowed combat armor for the Captain America look. I just wish Bethesda would make a universal black paint so I can use the BOS protection with black combat armor.
---
While they’re at it, make the trade menu item picture not show! That’s a simple way to fix the unbearable lag in trade menus on console.
---
6 caps. It’s not hard to make but the fact that I made it lol

The spooky wraith scarecrow that was in the atom shop not long ago. Mothman Alters. The normal pumpkin scarecrow. The hanging skeleton tree if it fits.
---
How did you loose a shit ton? You only get a few flux from the event. Unless you mean raw flux and not stable.
---
You have 2 mins from launch to countdown to put junk away. If nothing, travel to watoga train station as there is a stash box and station to break down junk. Also, the radiation stays for a while, so you can always make your way to the trains station and then go back to the nuke area to collect flux.
---
Oh, wouldn't know what that feels like...
---
so does that make low-level turrets stronger against higher level creatures like scorchbeasts?
---
I have 2 characters both with max rep at both factions. One is level 205 and the other is level 290. I have a 3rd that's level 7 and no way am I seriously starting again with him.
---
I have all those, I'm looking to use powered items more :)
---
They do have a sex just no sexual characteristics and are all sterile. I know it’s semantics but they very much still have a biological sex.
---
Everything man. As ur health goes down damage goes up. Doesn’t matter what weapon u use.
---
Bring back the Holo rifle. The gauss shotgun is close but I want to kill my enemies with GLOWING BLUE CUBES OF DEATH!
---
I don't think Beth can actually code it in.
---
Ah. Well I’m not sure then. Maybe a siren?
---
I'd like to see a lot of things but I'd be very happy if they fixed what's already there before adding something else because each time they do they break something.. If it was something minor like textures or lighting bug I'd ignore it but some game breaking issues shouldn't exist for this long.
---
Fast traveling has a 4-10 factor approval, so I’m sure they can figure it out for trading.
---
Uh actually those weapons you're referring to: Service Rifle etc. Are pre-War, the Gun Runners just have the schematics and are able to create new ones.
---
So technically speaking it wouldn't be impossible at all to bring in weapons like that. I mean we can say that the First Expeditionary Force has crates of those nostalgic weapons/armor sets. Anything is possible.
---
Its sacrificial, not suck and fist hole..
---
I wore that until the update that gave us real Backpacks.
---
I see LOKI!
---
Well yeah, but it's as good as none. Their sex is what they remember it is I suppose.
---
I may have missed that one, but I dunno if it would have made a difference. So I already started reinstall 😩
---
Have messed with it a bit in the past but allies/collectrons will wander around and trigger pressure plates... haven't found much practical use for this but you could have them randomly turn sirens/powered speakers on and off. Any kind of trap is going to require some repairs. You might be better off hiding pressure plates around the camp for players to step on and hooking them to a random switch that turns different stuff on when you go over it. You can also layer random switches to have a pressure plate that does 2/4/8/etc different things.
---
This is why I tell myself to wait a week before buying anything. But I’m also super cheap in real life so it’s must likely that lol
---
Wattz the big deal?
---
Ive been trying to find out the same thing im almost certain i have seen one before in a vendor, unless bethesda took it out of the game, i want one for my build but no one seems to have one.
---
Ah. I ran into a similar situation yesterday where I was the 3rd and they waved me to go down in the hole and I was all try hard with my ultracite galling laser and late in a 4th came and then he melted lol 
---
Either way, situations like that are fun.
---
Whats the sub? 
---
I'd like to trade some of what i have and maybe get a better heavy weapon than a bloodied ultracite gatling laser. I want something more along the lines of a 90% reduced weight, and then the other two as long as its good. 90% weight, two shot, 50% limb damage would be ideal.
---
I think it's already fixed on the PTS.
---
Yeah, black powder is close to the absolute worst thing you could possibly use. Only worse things would be one handed melee lol
---
I’ve been playing since launch and I’ve landed three of the paint plans between three characters. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I can confirm it does I've gotten 4 total
---
The bug is back. A friend of mine had 3 gauss shotguns taken from his stash just the other day. He logged when he saw the notification that they were purchased. His camp is at a railroad station.
---
I’ve gotten a few on PC, so they should be. If you really want to grind it out instead of waiting to find the Technical Data randomly the Whitespring Bunker almost always has some in the military wing.
---
I disagree with the fast travel one but the ammo scrapper sounds cool
---
whyyy do they need to do that😭it’s okay... big Bertha will still be my pve goddess
---
I love it when someone dies after Queen
---
Cool good to know. I cant seem to get any of the mod plans anymore. Keep getting clever plans and flags consistently
---
Can someone tag the community leaders in this as this would be a game changing suggestion?
---
Cause of its rarity.
---
All colored asylum outfits only have a chance to spawn at 2nd floor of fort defiance.
---
And from all colored ones - the red one is the holy grail by its drop rate
---
It already to late 
---
I know personally ppl who set up t try hose thing in workshop all day on PS and have farm hundreds of * thousands of ammo
---
I've had this issue as well. Sometimes it works and sometimes it fails.
---
I mean, if you're on pc i would trade it for some valueables, since ts ffr is my favourite combination
---
I wish they did though.
---
My consistent item is the bloody chef outfit and hat ive gotten so much i just drop them now
---
I’m on PS4. Sorry.
---
Oh I see, thank you !
---
You mean there's legendary etiquette? 😂
---
Yes you can.  Move your actual CAMP module.
---
My sister is somewhat new and she still lives in a shack, we'd really appreciate help!
---
This is exactly how it worked in Pac-Man.
---
It is.  And they'll brag about it to their friends, laugh, etc.   There's a bounty hunter group on FB, and they put bounties on these guys.   You wouldn't believe the texts they send.   Real a$$holes.
---
Players that have FO1st always spawn their tents around that event. Just empty the Queen and run to one of those tents and immediately store all your junk. Anyone can use the stash box in anyone’s tent. 
---
I had the same thing happen to me once, but lesson learned and now like clockwork I just grab Queen loot and run to nearest tent. Problem solved and lesson learned.
---
What is your gt
---
Happened to me. Was super confused at first lmao
---
One million dollars!
---
Why oh why do they keep adding content to a broken game? Why can't I fast travel? Why does my ultracite gatling laser tell me I'm out of ammo when I'm holding 7 cores in the middle of SBQ? Why are there unkillable random enemies? I love the Fallout series, but I'm fed up with all the broken features turning off potential new fans.
---
Sounds incredibly easy to fix...
---
I think it should be crossplay with PS4 and Xbox One but not with Pc
---
Lmao, side note love getting downvoted on imgur for this video
---
I'm in the exact same boat. I'm level 72 now, I've been using the pump action since like 60 and its a beast. I liked it so much I've changed my build for it. I'm hoping to get a combat shotgun, but I still think the pump has its place. Also I have no problem with end game content yet. Using vats I can one shot most enemies and deal serious fast damage to bosses.
---
Has anyone done val kilmer yet?
---
i would love some plans! I just finished building my first (really good) camp, and i did it with some pretty basic camp plans. it still looks great, but if i had wood floors, and stuff like that, it would be baller.
---
i'll take 1, promise! i added you in game, im "getwalled"
---
You win OP. Well played 😂
---
And people buy it just because it’s rare?
---
No with PC.
---
I want to play as a Super Mutant so badly!
---
I'll reply to this once I get ohm.
---
I dislike much about the build features in 76. Like who asked for a WastelaND HOA?? I’ll place whatever I want wherever I want.
---
Same. Every time I hear this suggestion, I just imagine someone stocking their vendor with crap just to get people interested in fast traveling there.
---
Siren maybe - or some area-defined lighting, but that's a bit minor. Was hoping for more bang.
---
I have most of the good "static" decor in that graveyard already - looking to add some dynamic options.
---
You at meek week by any chance when u logged off?
---
I have more contact with people who got their CAMP budget permanently screwed by the factories... :/
---
I got that today. I could see the event start (critters spawning in,etc.), but it didn't trigger for me and I couldn't participate.
---
Bolstering is the poor-man’s bloodied Armor....unyielding is much better.
---
I'm actually hoping for the random aspect there to be the key. Not a random generate or countdown or player-controlled - but I figure you're just going to be standing there no one around on the map and \*something\* starts to happen.
---
Tesla is the easiest, most obvious and showy. The blood eagle could work too.
---
Maybe the Delbert recipes?
---
I am still trying to get a food legendary effect but I really like it. For ordinary enemies and not hard legendaries I use Gatling gun as well, for boss fights I take out my Gauss minigun. it requires a lot of ammo, as others mentioned but if you stick with non-primed version it's very easy to make. With Batteries Included I carry like 6k ammo with me just fine (it won't ever fit in the stash tho).
---
I believe I purchased the physical copy when the game came out, got a cardboard circle in a DVD case with a download code.
---
I play almost 100% solo. My work schedule makes it impossible to play on a regular basis, which really hinders my ability to make friends in the game. I'm having plenty of fun though.
---
Can't agree on the holo rifle. It was specifically designed by Father Elijah for that particular moment in Sierra Madre
---
Nothing, until the event ends.
---
Holoblaster from dead money
---
You don't even have to empty the queen immediately.   It's not like she drops wonderful weapons or anything.  First priority, for me, is to store that flux.
---
This ^ those on drums and spits are extremely important.
---
Lots of players hit a point where they know almost all the plans, have all the mutations they want, and have their "final" weapons + armour.
---
At that point they start being interested in the showboating of very rare outfits because they cant easily be obtained
---
Damn I didn't know it was rare. I ate it. Shoulda sold it... I thought it was like the general junk melee weapons in the game.
---
It would make more sense actually if those plans were located inside different vaults or military bases and we had to do quests/raids for a chance to unlock said plans
---
Yes. Because they want it and have the caps or trade items to spare.
---
It’s a completionist mindset.
---
The worst is a legendary mole rat, that burrows just as you kill it, then nfi where its corpse is to loot it
---
Rule 34.B - pointing out rule 34.A violations result in immediate termination
---
Maybe around whitespring the shop in there probably sells them too
---
I would, but people have been banned for excessive ammo before, and this character is only level 8, so i can't use the ammo
---
300-450 caps
---
With 47 down votes I thought I was going to see the biggest asshole comment I've seen in awhile. Instead I see a legit opinion and a question. It was 48 but I gave you an upvote because I see nothing down votable about your comment.
---
They have 3 normal cards and 1 animated cards (just double checked)
---
regularly happens at the Colossal problem with minigun. Honestly cant remeber ever emptying the weapon completely. Either I reload before i empty the drum or it bugs out.
---
I found a bag with 20k silver, circuits, and steel. Back when people were duping hard. Took me forever to walk to the nearest train station and a week to sell all the stuff...
---
Looks more like [Nestor Carbonell](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.famousbirthdays.com%2Ffaces%2Fcarbonell-nestor-image.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.famousbirthdays.com%2Fpeople%2Fnestor-carbonell.html&amp;tbnid=MbjDZl-8ibAl0M&amp;vet=12ahUKEwjjz6Hpq7LrAhXUcqwKHUS4CtkQMygEegUIARDYAQ..i&amp;docid=kV4Zo8TwQaYMqM&amp;w=300&amp;h=300&amp;q=nestor%20carbonell&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjjz6Hpq7LrAhXUcqwKHUS4CtkQMygEegUIARDYAQ) to me.
---
Thank you guys for the information
---
You can put that on your vendor otherwise it looks like another person who undersells which we love to see
---
Ppl building it on workshop instead so it doesn’t mess up their camp  and in private servers to mass produce
---
And when the grocery store has cheese on two for one, only poor people can buy it....😉
---
I just built the Amco ammunition machine the other day &amp; I cannot select ammunition for it to make...
---
Salt, pepper, and spiced.
---
True, im running low on them cause every time a ghoul hits me I catch something
---
Why did you bring stable flux to the SBQ fight?
---
The placement of fast travel isn't fool proof.  I have moved my camp unit many times and people still spawn in odd places
---
Overseer's house has 2
---
Score grind is the short run for exp. The long run comes with legendary perks
---
Watoga Highschool Cafeteria kitchen
---
Fort Defiance (1st Floor and 4th Floor)
---
I found just two weeks ago near whitesprings station 875 stimpacks in a suit case. I waited almost a hour to see if someone was just transferring it to another character. But no one showed up so I took it and transferred to my alt
---
Unbearable is an understatement
---
Im not stating something obvious on my build budget.
---
Every single Plan from the Christmas event...I took them and dropped them in a level 10 camp.
---
Console players say hi.
---
your math is off:
---
you get 9 perk cards for every 5 levels, which is 18 perk coins
---
300/18=16,6 of 5 levels, which is around 83,3 levels for 300 perk coins
---
I think Generals Steakhouse has at least one, maybe two.
---
NOT THE BEES!
---
Oooh I know this very well. OK every homestead has a kitchen with seasonings with spices. Helvitia has some in the dining hall building and every nuke silo also has spices and seasoning in them. Flatwoods kitchen should have some as well as the giant tea pot, not the tea pot itself but the house next to it with the robot.
---
Do the endurance points you get this way increase your HP or not ?
---
Many thanks pal
---
Yup, this.
---
The T&amp;C are extremely vague. And the vagueness is annoying because I love building up my camp but it gets difficult to tell where the line is between "working within the game engine required build order" and exploits.
---
Yes, but we aren’t talking about those my dude. We’re specifically referencing the items in the picture.
---
Yup, I am in the same boat. Got to 160 on rifleman build. However, after what people have been saying about the PTS, I am in the process of converting to commando. I just need to find myself a good handmade (nonbloodied)
---
It’s possible I only received the mods then....cause it doesn’t show up in my weapons bench..
---
Drop them next to a new player, otherwise anything in a vending machine is, well, for sale
---
It happens if the event ends while the timer is on screen, i guess the game locks your ability to respawn if you die during a public event but doesn’t unlock it when the event ends, the timer however does stop.
---
This is why I never eat salad.  Green stuff will kill you.
---
Are you guys actually affected by diseases? They're pretty weak and seem almost like a pointless aspect of the game.
---
I know.  I meant in case you don't want to use your repair kits.
---
Only run it a dozen times but always been 3* for me.  I ran it to get the unique drops like the pack back plan.
---
Where’s there a fence? You mean the boards on the balcony?
---
But it comes back to how are people supposed to know that. I get 100’s if stimpaks a day, if I wanted to offload them fast without wasting them I’d mark them way below asking as well, but I don’t expect any specific player type to buy them
---
If you die after queen your flux and scrap that you got from the event go into the abyss of Todd Howard’s basement
---
That’s a drug deal gone bad.  He spotted the heat and threw the stash out the window
---
Literally the exact system I was thinking of as well. It’s (almost) foolproof
---
Whitespring Resort (Workbench room, cooking station), Enclave bunker (kitchen) Overseer’s House (kitchen) Flatwoods (in the back kitchen in the restaurant across the church, also outside in that outside cooking area) Big Al’s Tattoo Parlor(behind the bar, lower shelf), Camp Venture (bottom shelf in the downstairs storage room) and try the diner close to Watoga Plaza. 😊
---
I’m situations like that my preferred tactic is a rubber band and my phone
---
They are almost as important as good perks
---
I sometimes run all unyielding and one chameleon piece.  Works pretty well and I still get most of the uny stats.
---
Do you think they were duped?
---
Ty , I’m trying to figured out how many lvls we need to get 5 rank5 legendary perk 
---
Which we’ll need a to total of 1500 perk to get 5 rank5 if each rank 5 is 300 perk coin
---
So are we looking closer to lvl600to max them out?
---
Perk cards? Stop selling your disease cures?
---
I’m level 53 but if I go to the store and milk is on sale, I’m not prohibited from buying the milk because I’m financially stable.
---
If you put something out there to sell don’t complain who buys it. Either keep it 1 cap and don’t complain when someone who needs stims buys, or raise the price so 100+ players don’t get them or give you more for them.
---
But when are we getting Owl Week so we can tell people they have a nice hooters.
---
I’ve done it in four different camps. It doesn’t effect your budget.
---
I’d wait and see what Patch 22 brings.
---
People suck. But no problem. Can't wait to see how many I get lol
---
I just sell everything for half of what it’s value says for me. Stuff seems to move fairly well. A few things like springs and screws I sell for more than that though.
---
Bulk is pretty much the only thing anyone ever buys from me.
---
I played solo 90% of the time on pc.  Still enjoyable!
---
Well I know that I used to hoard stims being I’m bloodied. But at most I would ever have between stims and super where around 200. I used commie collectron for blood packs and would use chemist and maxed out super duper and could have a crap ton. So I’m going to assume yes. Because who the hell has 800+ stims but I guess there is still a possibility it was legit
---
Would you also outbid a child for candy? I feel thats a more relevant analogy.
---
Map is empty camera goes around your body. I notice the scorpion and I killed each other at same time, almost, like the game didn't know what to do weird.
---
I know a lot of high levels that will buy out vendors in low level areas to give caps to the person selling them. Most will then drop all those items in the camp tho.
---
Level 543 with a level 157 alt....I have good days and bad days.
---
Best CM right here. Actually interacts with community.
---
The only thing you can actually lose at this game is time
---
If you're feeling burnt out with this game, move onto something else for the time being. Ask yourself "Was playing Fallout 76 worth the time?" and then "Will it be worth it to return to the game or move on?" and then proceed from there.
---
When you move your camp it will remain in the stored budget.
---
Appears to be a bug.
---
It may also work for carnivores as well, but they may have patched that.
---
I'll be happy if you'd build me a rad barrel mate
---
There's a reason for not having a stash box nearby.   There was a glitch at one point that relied upon that to steal stuff from your stash.   I don't trust Bethesda to not revive the bug, hence the stash is far away from vending.
---
Like i said, I’ve done it in four different camps. It doesn’t stay in your budget.
---
Can't trade for anything but caps.  So a trade between weapon for weapon, for example, depends on "who goes first", even in the trade screen.  Someone can do the ol' dine and dash... where they get the fuck out as soon as the other player drops/sells their gun for 0 caps, effectively scamming them by not trading their own gun in return.   So it works with a lot of trust
---
I've got a group of guys (and gals) that I met a couple of months ago. And I can tell you having other people to play with makes a HUGE difference.
---
Hmmm....ammo scrapper is an excellent idea.
---
Just hit 100 today. Always logged 10-15 min before reset from adventure mode (dont do this from NV), never had this happen, on PC, not a single time.
---
i hate mole rats as well even worse when you kill a legendary one but it somehow burrows while dead and you lose the loot
---
yeah 76 really sucks on the Alt-friendly front, funny as ESO is one of the best i played in that area (if only they would make riding skills account wide). 
---
Honestly a simple "account bank" for trade items between characters would make a massive improvement, yeah you still have to grind the GB on your main character if you want to send your alt a copy of the ArmCo plans but that's 4 days of works vs. months of grinding. 
---
also you can just make your Secret service armor or Gauss weapon on you main and send that over as well without having to buy the plans again.
---
Shh! 😃
---
Same here.
---
That would severely mess up Wastelanders though.
---
It still won’t make the grind enjoyable for me though
---
Nope.  Did it a few days ago, thank Christ.
---
Nice find! When I’m on my explosive build, I love finding drop bags with mini nukes, missiles and 40mm
---
I hope Grahm gets a house, that forms into the first Super Mutant colony of west virginia, later evolving into the next massive DLC surpassing wastelanders, coming out in Q4 of 2024: Mutropolis: Grahm Origins
---
Lmao... yo what's up man thanks for your junk :)
---
Go all Unyielding, perhaps with one Bolstering piece.
---
Use diluted stimpacks, when crafting them use the Chemist perk and Super Duper.
---
Just got to quick on the Stimpack button when in combat.
---
&gt; At that point they start being interested in the showboating of very rare outfits because they cant easily be obtained
---
That's me.
---
Ever since I snagged a pink asylum outfit and started wearing it I'm getting people crowding around me at the meat cook, thumbs up emotes, etc.
---
And that's just the pink one.
---
Not gonna lie though, my female dweller really rocks a pretty pink dress.
---
I haven't seen that, but I did join Primal Cuts in the Forest only to teleport to the same event in the Mire.  Twice.
---
I did this by placing a button beneath the chair. When you sit in it, it activates the traps.
---
Can't wait for all the inappropriate posing.
---
Some level 400 odd quitting perhaps?
---
Your tears are almost as delicious as your cheap stims.  Thanks!
---
Lol I feel that
---
If you dont want it being bought by a high level then you should find a low level and give or try to sell it to them directly, if its in your vendor, regardless of the level or cost it is up for grabs, its not a dick move, I would by the low level legendaries of any vendor that has them at a good price.
---
I’ve done this once then the person bitched at me over comms so I decided to keep the items and go give them to another player
---
I could get more, but that is not the point. Id like there to be some healing units in camp for low-level players.
---
Man, F those kids.
---
Go unyeilding and if you really want the chameleon then wear one piece. I find no difference in stealth or damage output from being invisible. The biggest bonus is the insane special stats you can have with unyeilding with a heap of different foods I regularly see my perception agility and luck at 50 with the rest at 30
---
yeah i got those artifacts too. ive played it 20 times but today it did that for the first time.
---
There’s a thread on it that explains in detail.  Speak to rocksy, tell the raider ‘rocksy has a message’ kill the raider, return to rocksy and tell her ‘Appalachia has a new corpse’. Then back out of conversation. Speak to rocksy again and tell her same thing.  You will keep getting the rep.
---
EZY scrip. If the gear  has trash legendary effects and is cheap enough I’ll buy it and turn it to scrip to max out for the day
---
Gotcha so half it.
---
Are you on PC?
---
yes just more daily challenges
---
&gt; hope they don’t remove **the feature**
---
You sweet child.
---
I’m a power armor build, I can’t really play the barrel, I leave that to the other players bust most of them just crouch in a stealth suit with an explosive fixer or handmade then we fail the event. I can’t do it all by myself
---
I wasn’t carrying junk, nice try poser. Lol ;)
---
0/10 low effort troll
---
Just did an SBQ that didn't respond to any exploits whatsoever. Was fun as hell and took 20 minutes with the four people who didn't bail on it.  Can still be fun for sure but I need to craft ammo.
---
Press ctrl when you scroll 😉
---
I have that and the Hunter's Long Coat.  Legit drops.  You won't get banned for that.
---
Wait.... So they're still gonna be full price?
---
for the love of the wasteland please!!!!!!! not skins new weapons
---
Ugh, trying to shop at a bot vendor that somebody has spam-sold tons of marine tactical helmet to. It's the worst.
---
Well you see in FO4 they were categorised in build mode with all the fences, hence why I referred to them as such. Other people knew exactly what I meant.
---
I know but there are models out there that run 9mm.
---
Okay. So take a break.
---
I completely understand. But man it’s over so fast! The only way it failed in the past (my observation) was when no one did primal cuts and came with no meat.
---
Don't know why you are getting downvoted, but that is why
---
What helped me with this and other games was that I didn't finish the last main mission, if it makes sense. 
---
Bethesda i believe will come with a update to make it feel less endless or with some shorter goals. 
---
Btw how did yall get those fo76 stuff after your names?
---
Thought so. Apparently it's impossible to get rid of it in the PC version of the game. I've already tested it multiple times.
---
What’s other people have to do with me? Did you say that for self reassurance?
---
Nice, wasn’t sure about that part.
---
Cuz I said the D word (and didnt spell it with 0s) 🙄
---
Do we have photos? Cause that sounds boss
---
My all time favorite Queen event took almost the entire time....she was incredibly tough and spawned dozens of mobs every time she landed. We were on our secondary and tertiary weapons, scavenging whatever ammo we could find.
---
When she finally died, it was such a relief...and it was awesome.
---
Yay...sucks.
---
But the BOS of New Vegas are never seen using those weapons to the best of my memory. They still stick to energy weapons, so there's still no lore support for them to bring these weapons with them.
---
Got it as a reward after fight. And had scrap from traveling
---
Hold tf up. They are finally doing this?!?😆😆😆
---
it would be great if a legendary or something would spawn to try and stop the cook out.
---
Because the final wave never spawns.
---
If you do one SBQ a day then you will be swimming in repair kits.  No need for perk cards.
---
Why almost?
---
1. You got 340 hours out of the game, sounds good.
---
2. The key to doing the challenges is to focus on something else that the challenges just happen to be a part of.
---
"Yeah, just taking it all in."
---
Easy scrip 
---
OR I'm trying to outfit my lowbie toons.
---
Didn't they say recently (maybe at quake con) that they wanted to make it so players didn't start a new character?
---
maybe i'll get there 2 mins prior. until today i didn't know about the "prep", so maybe i'll join in :)
---
Put your junk away asap.
---
It's the wasteland, motherfucker, not candyland. I can and will rob you.
---
Yes. This would make more sense.
---
georges junkyard workshop  has a black titanium deposit you can make an extractor there.
---
My favorite is the fasnacht one. It keeps me supplied with that precious bubble gum.
---
I think it would be good if a handmade/combat rifle alternative plan that could be bought from vault 79 with the same sale restrictions.
---
I have them all and can choose what they collect. I don't know if that happens if you have just one.
---
Choose the one you think you will benefit from the most initially. Or choose the one because you like its personality.
---
I am writing a Fallout 76 novel....
---
You forgot the part about the 2* tire iron for your efforts lol
---
I have both the raider and scavenger and I like the raider one a lot better than the other. If I'm remembering right my raider collection can collect junk too but maybe that's because I have the scavenger? But I use the raider one for ammo and guns which is really great
---
exactly. the multiplicative formula made it so they had to make all these enemies/bosses bullet sponges. and any build who's damage didnt multiply out of control couldnt kill them.
---
now its linear so they can set the sponginess of creatures according to a more relaxed, simple formula. this means, eventually, everything will be more balanced, and hopefully not so spongy.
---
1* Berserkers Rolling Pin
---
You mean the 1* nocturnal god roll legacy  rolling pin
---
Im guessing this is in the Cranberry bog?  
---
That is the one that I keep failing due to all the spawns being greater than 100m away.  
---
They spawn in the tree lines all around, and sometimes up to the bunker to the north of the location.  
---
Or maybe its the Mire, where all the Gulpers run in the opposite direction of the drum.  
---
The event requires a lot more running around than last year. A LOT.
---
Either that or make a water purifier that specifically makes sulphur water like the fountains at the whitespring. Could just carry water that cures the disease that a molerat gave you by nibbling on your ankles
---
Yeah, none of the descriptions are good. Basically any damage you do goes up as your hp goes down.
---
👍😂 Yeah me too. He's my gum dealer.
---
To be precise, with 415 levels you get 1494 perk coins, then 3 additional perk cards, which makes it 418 precisely to rank up 5 legendary perk cards, at level 300 you'll pen 6th slot though, so you'll need additional 82 levels to get to exactly 1800 perk coins for all 6 legendary perk cards
---
I’m legit afraid when anyone offers to trade
---
Agreed, bubblegum and sometimes honey/ royal jelly
---
Video? 🤔
---
Can't lie about it, it's super fun when she doesn't die easy.  Just kept blowing through ammo and was determined to get it done even though I was alone for half of it.  Didn't matter what she got hit with, it didn't do much of anything.
---
Was also awesome.
---
Yes! I make royal jelly taffy and it sells. 😂
---
I did not know that, or miss remembered, thanks :)
---
Shut up and take my money!
---
Actually I was thinking the other day how sad it is there's no Caesar's Displacer Glove in any other game. I get that it's unique to the great man himself, but hot damn is it cool.
---
Lol got a bloodied ffr version when I was trying to get a junkies version after like 10 tries
---
[Home Sweet Home](https://imgur.com/gallery/ACw28DY)
---
Yes, it is.
---
aS a cOnSUmeR
---
Damn that's cheap I would have paid 15 caps each and still thought I got a good deal
---
I didn't log in for an entire day and then logged in 30 min after the update a few days ago. And all mine was auto-completed except one(1).  It doesn't affect me any longer because The Legendary Run is finished. But I took a pic and filed a Feedback Ticket because it is unfair to other players. I really think it is up to the RNG if you get hit. It is like it was intentionally upgraded for The Legendary Run? It was around before The Legendary Run but never as bad as it is now. I got hit with it maybe once in two years of playing this game, (when we got atoms for dailies) but when they started the Legendary Run it has hit me probably 10 times.
---
I think it did for me.  You just find stuff to do.  Before WC, we launched Nukes about every night and public events.  I can give you a discord invite if youd like.
---
And that's why I wish you could trade these, I got so many decent rolls on the Secret Service Armor but wasn't Unyielding so didn't use it
---
The weapon is good but non legendary versions of it aren't special.  I can craft you a new one if PC
---
Have a better keyboard now (not on the phone / thumbs) thought I'd reply a bit here.
---
I find that Sophia PRIMARILY uses a few things ...
---
* she's at her station a bunch of the time
---
* there is another terminal, the weapon workbench and two chairs she tends to use
---
I know she triggers pressure plates, and I've played around a bit by putting one right on her station.
---
I'm thinking the same / similar for my collectron.
---
Again I want un-attended, semi-randomness - and maybe this is a fools errand ;-)
---
I'm thinking - I can make something happen while she's off-screen, and it could create environmental effects in my camp. I don't care if it kills people, as much as I care for the "WTF is happening?" thing.
---
I think I'll wire up at least one Telsa. I've not tested, but if a Tesla burns out, is it's power use removed from the system? If so, I could have a series of Tesla and over time they'd burn out ... one at a time. Sure, I'd need to repair them all, but it could create some fun / pseudo-random effects.
---
I wish there were other noise options. Speakers aren't that awesome, maybe a siren?
---
I like the idea of the random switches (for extra randomness). Got to think on that. 
---
I could probably make the strobe on/off sometimes by just keeping a connector / power radiator far enough away and one close by on the switch.  I'll try that out tonight - the way fo76 processes lighting, the strobe could be beneath the ground and likely to still show / bleed above ground.
---
I kinda wish I could get the flamethrower to rotate and point up - but you know ... wishes. THAT would be awesome.
---
I can sell these to vendor bots for 10 caps each. High level players are probably buying these to on-sell.
---
That’s not WoW specific. Many systems have done that for ages. What’s astounding is that FO76 *doesn’t.*
---
And sugar bombs
---
I meant the plans.... I ate them... Shoulda kept them and sold.
---
Make everybody happy. Weekly challenges give score. Daily challenges go back to being atoms for everyone. This way everyone can earn a few atoms whether they have finished the legendary run or not.
---
Also are you really trying to stop people from suggesting something? Be a big boy and just dont read those suggestions if it bothers you.
---
Imagine trying to start an argument on the internet with somebody. Good night princess, try somebody else.
---
If this killed me I don't think I could be upset... I would just be laughing at the absurdity of a Tato Salad overdose.
---
Sort of like when you die from the well fed buff wearing off. 
---
They should put a prompt "You have died of first world problems."
---
OIC.  They will still drop just keep doing the event.
---
That could be. I just think that replayability is important for an rpg. 
---
The endgame content simply won't keep me playing. Once I get the gold bullion items I want, I'll end up leaving the game until new quest lines are added, because doing events gets old real fast, for me. For that matter, I won't do most of the events ever again.
---
Starting over was surprisingly fun, but the grind to get what I have now is just too exhausting to imagine ever doing again. I'm more likely to go back and replay Fallout 3, 4, or Skyrim.
---
25% reduced ranged damage is not fun
---
Parasites is annoying
---
There's another really annoying one but I can't remember what it does
---
I’m on console, I always close the application after I leave the world and usually don’t play until after the daily reset the following morning. The auto complete bug has never happened to me
---
I appreciate your offer but nty, I don’t do well in discord groups but again I appreciate the offer
---
Then that's on Bethesda's part to get off their lazy asses and bother to catch up to basic trading standards in MP games.
---
You shouldn't need a middleman just to trade a gun with another person without a possibility of things fucking up. That's just failing basic game design for player trading.
---
I've literally sat at 900+ scrip as I wanted to stock up on modules. 
---
So instead of something useful we get twice the shitty rolls we normally get.... Fucking hell :(
---
I know right? No matter what I can't get my friends to eat dog shit.
---
Juicehead video.
---
ore needs to be smelted
---
Then your best bet might be to find lower level players and outright give them stims
---
I just got a that fuck ya 2* TS FFR ultracite lazzzzz
---
same rarity

---
So same issues as others many attempts with no luck as well as quit to desktop and reloading, when I went to private server it worked!!! Went straight to computer Analyzed blood then placed fuse and entered the tank.
---
Or simply press x to auto walk on pc :p
---
Yeah, 2% rare. Now you need the pepper mod (2% rare as well) and you'll have a 2 handed melee able to out damage a super sledge
---
I always run in there with my low level character. It is the single best event for leveling up. If I wait for it to fill with high levels id never get to even tag enemies before the higher levels 1 shot them all. So im sorry but I will always start the event early. its the best XP farm there is when its live.  
---
Maybe if high levels wouldnt one shot everything you would find lower levels more apt to work with you on this issue.
---
Script

I dont care either way, its not up to me to tell someone how to play their game, to each there own.
---
There’s still a possibility you accidentally enter the wrong amount of plat. I’ve almost done that once or twice myself lol. Often happens if I’m trading while talking to another person. Worst almost-mistake was me having to check again on a trade and realising I almost paid 10x what I should by adding an extra 0
---
I don’t think it is. I think it’s like someone wrote above and the game considers them armor.  To stop duping makes no sense being that outfits are probably the most useless item to dupe
---
I have still yet to have it happen with score points, despite staying logged in during reset and jumping straight into nuclear winter. 
---
Maybe my account could donate some blood for an inoculation or something.
---
Which option supplies the gum? Is it the proletariat?
---
How do you do that?
---
Take a break. If you need to force yourself to play the game like a job, then dont bother. Come back in a week or two
---
Find a Magic weapon
---
I dunno, the reps level fairly fast and treasury notes are plentiful, it's pretty easy compared to the level of grinding I've put into Warframe, WoW, Everquest, etc.
---
I have 4 characters and 2 are well into their rep and gold grind. Working on SS and SH atm.
---
A lot of games at certain points become non alt friendly but it doesn't really bother me, I just want to play different characters.
---
The legendary run is more work every day than getting some treasury notes and doing the daily. Events and a quest, nbd.
---
Yep. I encountered similar once so far.  
---
Was there are person in your run using a Tesla rifle?
---
For item for *caps*. There is no basic confirmation for both parties when you're dealing with item to item trading. Which is a thing that's been solved since the ancient days of Ultima Online and Diablo 2.
---
Hello everyone, im somewhat of a beginner to the game and my girlfriend and i are in need of stimpacks!! Im lvl25 shes lvl14 is there a place we can buy them or farm???
---
Any other tips would be appreciated!!
---
I have a 1\* B handmade, and it already tears everything a new a-hole.
---
Why you'd want anything more powerful than this, I have no idea.
---
Doesnt make any less true lol. Unstackable items, while def not impossible, are harder to d00p3. That is the reason.
---
That's why the community hates the purveyor sales so much, they're useless for most players. It's not even the sale itself that people hate, but the idea that it's being pushed out as a big reward for the community and feedback about it has been ignored for so long. Obviously it's still a reward and better than nothing, but for most players it's not noteworthy. You need to specifically be above level 50, but also low enough that you don't have any great gear, for it to be worthwhile. And even then, it's just the same gamble as before at lower rates. Which honestly just means that your inventory gets clogged with things to scrip for a week after the sale
---
I’m sorry you took my question personally, it was just a question. I guess you couldn’t think of the relevance of what you said &amp; felt attacked.
---
The problem is that most of the cool ones were made at the Big MT, such as Cazadores. I do think that Wanamingos might be added though. I’d also rather see new creatures and maybe some old ones. Maybe a mutated Bob Cat, Cougar, Black Bear (not Yao Guai), racoons, etc.
---
Chem bench with acid.
---
The bug has been around since launch. I hope it gets fixed. I have several flamers I would love to use... But this bug makes it annoying.
---
Idk if everyone knows this but you can get ahead with the progress bar if ppl start on the drums and spits during the 2 min before events starts. So it doesn’t bother me during meat cook. As for Fasnacht I could solo it,  so it wasn’t that big of deal to me then either.
---
It sucks so bad like being in slow mo
---
Yes! Seems like the best way
---
You basically have it. Being AFK during Fasnacht was unhelpful and simply leeching. Meat Week on the other hand, if you do the drums or spit you’re still contributing
---
I love my unyielding set.
---
And it synergizes well with perks like Dodgy, so you don't even need bolstering or extra DR.
---
What? Legenddary plans?
---
Whatever you say man. Fuzzy says hi 🤣
---
Ah, I see what you did there...☢🔥🤣
---
&gt; and I'm thinking it's intentionally done by Bethesda, especially when you consider how long the game has been out and the amount of patches released to fix the game.
---
You can have as many conspiracies as you want about it, and honestly with the game's direction it's not unreasonable, but I personally don't think that is the case. They already cut down atom gain drastically with the seasons update, and even though that got them a ton of backlash, ultimately people don't care beyond a week or two of an outrage. They don't need to take such petty measures when they can make an official, acknowledged change and come out okay.
---
Also keep in mind: the prime receivers for the combat rifle used ultracite .44 instead of ultracite .45 ammo due to a typo. Do you know how long it took them to fix that? Just short of a year. There are many, many, many examples of fixes an intern could do in under 5 minutes that took bethesda months or even years to fix in this game. That's more than likely the case for these achievements
---
Yup, we're getting Mannequins for normal clothes/armor (A plain cloth one, and one with stripes it seems?), and for Power Armor.
---
And Light-up Displays that can snap together and hold the Mannequins in a fixed locations (in a bunch of colors).
---
When you sell your wares, they are open to everyone.
---
Many of us donate stims to new players anyways. I’ve dropped off gift boxes of 20 Stims, 20 Purified Water, 10 Radaways, a Serrated Machete and Hunting Rifle with 100 .308 rounds at Vault 76 quite often. 
---
Maybe I’m buying your cheap stims to add to a gift box. 
---
If you want it to go to low level players, find them and gift it to them directly.
---
Basically it gets the explosive 2nd star on any roll (being gauss is explosive as a base weapon)  so of you can roll the same thing it will have the  higher base damage plus the explosive damage
---
Those Babybels are not for you! They are for scruffy and his rag tag band...coming in here with shoes and stuff thinking the cheap cheese is for you... shame shame shame.
---
Are you on xbox? I'm usually giving out a ton of free stuff like stims to help out new people
---
It might come with the BoS DLC. They said they will bring new weapons and armor.
---
that would be class
---
When are they releasing this?
---
Yeah but what's a leveling base? Never used one of them
---
That sucks. Ive only had a legacy flamer so i never worried about range but i got a decent two shot flamer recently figured i try it and i love the fact that it doesn’t break in 5 seconds. But that issue is now drawing me away from regular ones if this is persistent.
---
The red glare would be brilliant, would definately appreciate that
---
It is. It's very unfortunate.
---
Ugggh I just tried this and it didn’t work for me. But I also should add that every time I went back to try after fast traveling back the location there was always another player in the room I’m assuming trying to do the same thing. 
---
Anyway I might try again later but after the 4th time I’m annoyed.
---
Hey when does this sale start? I had no clue it was happening until now.
---
Script or they didn't read that it's a level 5 I have made that mistake before
---
Also, sadly, I can't make the scarecrow come on automatically - have to activate it and then it turns itself off....
---
I miss having power fist variants.  The ballistic fist from NV was my jam!
---
No you cannot unless you are in pvp with the camp owner. You will find that people are generally extra careful to not tag up at camp. Also wouldn't this revenge just make you a troll like them?
---
“Cmon they just reheated it in the microwave”
---
I’d like to see your builds as well. Enjoy seeing other’s projects!
---
Makes it so tempting...
---
Or maybe just don't fall for scams
---
at a chem work bench. you need acid and a certain amount of ore
---
I have some of the bottom floor of my first actual build on a subreddit I made with my friends, if you check my account you’ll see it. And I asked my friend whose base it is if they want to get on to model it later, it is the first design
---
Lol, i burned through almost 15k 5.56 in a 4 hr session....
---
imagine grassing someone up because they were high level. like. really.
---
I think they might be slippers, like they give you at a spa. Even though by now I know I can't, inevitably I always try to pick them up.
---
Of course you can play stupid and say its open for everyone. But then you miss the point of the symbolic price.
---
Why send in a ticket?  What harm is it doing to you?
---
I think it's just the Fasnacht option.
---
That's what you get...
---
TATO SALAD IS CALLED SALSA!
---
Now we are talkin
---
So, this is my idea. The BoS will want to get rid of the Scorchbeasts, and know that the ATLAS Observation Station has a weather thing. They may try to change the weather to a much more unbearable type for Scorchbeasts, making them want to stay underground or fly away from the Cranberry Bog. So now, without the threat of being eaten, the creature we see stung up on the mountain side? Lets call him the The Roc, will be more prone to flying around, allowing them to act as a new kind of Scorchbeast. They are a tad bit smaller, but more vicious and fly in groups. They can occasionally be spotted fighting Scorchbeasts.
---
Oh my lord! How did i forget about the Bumper sword!?  Yes please!!
---
Who gives a fuck
---
My bad missed the /s. if it's vendored you've accepted to sell at the price listed. The customer doesn't matter.
---
The progress bar starts at 50% and degrades during the two minute pre-heat. Being on the drums (and I think spits) keeps it from degrading. 
---
As long as you’re afk on the drums, it’s not an issue. It actually helps.
---
Ok Karen.
---
How does one flip someone off in game?  I want that emote.
---
Whatever. Screw the customer.
---
They should give us a dialog option to instantly hit max rep with any faction that another character on our account has reached max rep with.
---
Like a dialog option you can choose with the faction leader that says something like "Hey my friend has done some work for you and they can vouch for me, I'd like to do some business with your traders." ... and then it takes that character right to max rep with them.
---
The bullion grind isn't bad IMO, it's the rep grind that kills me.
---
Either that or make plans account wide.
---
No. Not tolerating the intolerant does not make you intolerant
---
You use chemist as well? That will double your yield.
---
A reddit thread full of puns?
---
Shocking.
---
Not gonna lie I bought this recently. I love the aesthetic of it and all but it is so humongous you can barley place it anywhere and not to mention it like hates trying to sink into the ground. I really think it's a cool item but I wish it maybe had a smaller variant.
---
On a side note, with the not so recent wave of bans, I'd love to see a novelty weapon added. The Ban Hammer, have it be a ridiculously oversized commie wacker that has a an innate debuff  like the tenderizer perk applied to it.
---
I haven’t fail once if I am doing it solo. The mire one which spawn gulper is probably the most buggy one. Because gulper may run opposite direction like crazy. My tip for doing event is to open your map very often to locate the prime beast. It doesn’t matter if you kill any other mobs like mole rat and sometime the prime beasts may be chilling somewhere you can’t vats them or fighting other mob. So open your map to chase them down is very helpful instead running around just and killing everything.
---
My grandmother can't stand them, just straight up deletes their stuff unless she's on an active quest.
---
Personally I don't pay attention anymore.
---
I just wish she'd stop complaining after finishing her quest. I really thought she would and I was wrong.
---
Stooping to there level doesn't justify it. Just perpetuates it. Take the high road, move on.
---
There’s like 2 or 3 plans you can get to make them yourself.
---
Totally possible. I usually play in 45 min- hour bursts than afk for 10 minutes somewhere safe for a break. Only did meat week a few times since it started tho, so I don't believe it's causing the game breaking crash. 🤷
---
Ah damnit i had my hopes up for nothing lol. The slippers i know i’ve seen somewhere before. 
---
In fact arent those equipped automatically with the bath robes?
---
The enemies are almost always on your compass. Since I've paid attention to that I haven't failed once.
---
Graham showing us the evils of salad!
---
This literally just happened to me. Unclaimed shop, I claimed it for the Dailey, and just to plant some crops. Some guy in his Chinese stealth suit blasted me. I saw him coming, didnt Fire. Certainly was not worth losing my stuff over. Yeah a “want to fight over this or not?” Option would be nice.
---
I keep getting bloody chef outfits. Just want the Chally head!
---
It could have anti armor as a built in effect, non legendary.
---
I believe you are right, made and accidentally released in big MT if my memory is right
---
Why? Just hand them out if you want them to reach the intended target. Being lazy with your goodwill means anyone can purchase what you are selling. 
---
Vendors are shops and a good deal is a good deal.
---
I ask cuz it’s been happening to me as well. I get all the way to the point where u hear the over-encumbered sounds then the circle on bottom right corner stops and the screen freezes. Happens when I’m at or near meat week when I logged off and trying to get into another server. Not at exactly same point as u  but I get the error code too.
---
You can take all three as a full bloodied build too, I have a friend who takes all three and has no problem doing damage at the same time, and sometimes she's even able to pick up noobs like me when we get lasered
---
I have 7 flag plans so far. So not very rare.  Brahmin Grill has been harder for me to get, I only have 3.
---
Yeah for the riflemen out there take your suppressors off as it's a balls out firefight now. No point even trying to hide. 
---
My quad handmade is back in action as who has time to reload ya know. Glad I invested in commando line and accompanying perks. 
---
Kinda embarrassing when at night you can do x3.5 and one shot most things normally to now spray and pray alongside the level 20's lol
---
Still an awesome event though and I'm loving it :)
---
The game has been out approximately 671 days. You would only need to level up on average 3 1/4 times a day to reach 2177.
---
Obviously some days you level up less, then there are days (especially when you stack lots of bonus XP during double XP weekends) you can take in quite a few levels.  I can go from 1-50 over a weekend no problem with a buddies help, and get another 100 levels over a week if i really focus.
---
2177 sounds high, but is completely possible for someone dedicated to the game.
---
When/Where is the Fasnacht one sold?
---
Just got my 2nd one.
---
I think explosives are just rather...inconsistent. For me, there are times when explosives do TONS of damage, but most of the time, they're rather useless. Even the blast radius seems to be incredibly weird. I remember launching several mini-nukes in the giftshop of the Whitesprings golfclub and only getting killed once?
---
On top of that, dense/fireproof seem to work strangely when dealing with your own weapons. Explosive bullets bullets seem to be nullified while grenades, mines, and heavy explosives seem to range from nothing to 1hko's.
---
In the begging when you got together, it was all three star legendary. But now, she's grown weary of your nocturnal rolling pin. You're one star buddy, and she's ready to trade you in for scrip.
---
Thanks and it’s good to hear my team cards are working for other people
---
Possibly no one was able to complete Prime Cuts, rather than no one tried ;)
---
It would be nicer if it was t over so fast. Maybe they can tweak it.
---
Alien blaster rifle please.....
---
You're a saint.  I run pharma farma &amp; sell mine for 35.  They sell out constantly.  Agree on dropping from an event rather than another mini nuke.
---
What are you looking for?
---
Taking workshops gives a lot of plans.
---
If I want to help low levels (I do this quite a bit). I find them on the map and drop them ammo, stimpaks, water, and food.
---
Blueprs only really work in smaller cut up bits ever since patch 12.
---
Yeah, workshops will give camp plans,
---
That hate though 😂
---
I'll upvote you a little.
---
Do u have a link to it
---
Then why don't we remove rule 10
---
Not that I noticed.  Was a particularly hectic run though.
---
Unless you have a sign up "low levels only" on the machine nobody knows what you're on about, and most won't bother to check your level to see if you're just a low level that's selling crap or a high level trying to help out low levels, so they assume the former if your camp is in the forest.
---
They're probably just buying cheap stuff to do the daily challenge, and scrip is scrip, it's not a dick move unless your machine is labeled. I put low level scrip scrap in my machines all the time because I want caps, I don't care who buys it.
---
I use the raider collectron simply because I’m a lead and ammo hoarder on both characters.
---
Yeah, I think they are similar, if not identical.
---
I'M A FIVE STAR MAN
---
Yes an educated one you are right about all of that but that can be blamed on the servers bugging out (nukes blowing up and not rendering damage) you can get duds but compared to shotguns as others say, explosives don’t irritate/tilt me but the shotguns, ugh the pellets from the shells are literally smaller than bbs, atleast it feels like that using it in pvp
---
Wait until the event is over.
---
That way you know your help is going exactly where needed!
---
Meat Cook is over in like 30 seconds most times Ive been there with other players turning up. If theyre on the drums or the spits then afk'ers are actually contributing helpfully because otherwise the bar drops and the event can fail if enough people arent doing the other stuff. Its different to Fasnacht AFK'ers doing twirlies in rooms. They werent contributing at all. So personally I have no problem with drummers/spit turners afk'ing. As long as they are at least doing that
---
Got the plan twice so far in less than 10 attempts. With all the drive for it, I wonder if I should sell the plan before or after it ends.
---
They said they fixed this issue 3 times too.
---
Have you tried Whitespring?
---
I noticed the 4x but didn’t think anything else was working. That makes a lot of sense thanks a lot
---
To be honest I don't remember.  Whatever it was supplies booze, gum, gumdrops, pre war food.
---
Wasn't proletariat because I think that one supplies radaway, sweet tato stew, propaganda flyers etc.  I could be wrong.
---
Bethesda needs to just give us plans for outfits not the outfit. We can then just build them as we need them. But Bethesda loves messing with our stash.
---
Love your opinion though your the only one who was educational and not just calling it trash, no gun is trash if your smiling every trigger pull 😃👍🏻
---
IMHO, the basic collectron is my preferred one. I get the collectrons based on what they gather but use the basic one and select what to get. My main reason is because it's the least annoying. My other reason is so I can switch as needed.
---
Workshop rewards and you can also go at Whitespring. Their vendors sell them all ! 
---
And players vending machines. A bunch of players sell them for peanuts !
---
(Edit:) I guess you have been pretty unlucky, because on my side, on ps4...everybody tries to get rid of them...
---
Unlikely to happen but I still have good news in an upcoming dlc. On mobile app for iOS so stop reading if you don’t want spoilers.
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Spoiler below&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
---
In next dlc with brotherhood dlc you can earn a disease cure machine. It’s exactly the same machine you scan yourself in silos and for vaccine quest except it cures your diseases.
---
Yep.  Plenty of those too.
---
Fair enough.
---
I grinded(ground?) pretty hard with 2 characters, now I'm just casually doing rep dailies when the fancy strikes me. Definitely NOT putting serious effort into that grind again.
---
I was doing this in Pong.
---
What’s your Ricky Spanish set?
---
My experiences with this event have run the spectrum of “damn I’m going to have to do all the heavy lifting” to “shit that was easy”.
---
Yesterday I nuked Monongah and two players showed up.  A lvl 30 and a lvl 60.  Playing a junkies heavy gunner with a gauss gatling, I burned through 6000 2mmEC, plus a heavy gun bobble head, a dozen psychobuff, 16 vodka and an ignore 30% melee magazine.  We won with 4 minutes to spare.
---
Today I was playing my sniper with a full party of players in the lvl 100-200 range.  The event was done in about 5 minutes.
---
Its "Viande de Qualité"  
---
Literally "Quality Meat"
---
Nope. That's the punishment for glitching. Lol
---
This is an interesting bug. Sadly no suggestions as to what it could be, but I am curious now
---
Am I the only one who thinks that diseases are kinda lame?
---
I never use cures really. And I never notice the downsides of the diseases either really. 
---
I would love if they in fact didn’t disappear by themselves or at least had a much longer duration time. 
---
Am I the only one?
---
(But yes I’ll agree with your post non the less!)
---
I've heard you can't.
---
Maybe someone can clarify?
---
I have all of them, and I find that for a ranged weapon build I get the most benefit from the Raider ammo+weapons option in combination with the ammo converter, to make use of unwanted ammo types that it finds. For a melee build I use the basic one with the scrap option; it can bring in any kind of scrap including the occasional ultracite.  
---
Also, at your camp you can place whichever collectron you want and use the terminal to change the collection type to any option from any collectron that you already own (so you could get fasnacht treats with a raider collectron if you own both).
---
As a new player, Ive been wondering why do people let their radiation level get so high? Obviously theres some advantage to it cause radaways arent that rare.
---
Am i missing a mechanic with radiation?
---
I don't know why anyone would be upset at others using this glitch. The fact they can never remove it and get their budget back is absolutely hilarious lol.
---
I got it from the Atomic Shop. Not sure if it's still there unfortunately. 😯
---
But keep checking because they bring things back. He sings and is happy and it cheers me up. 😂
---
Pretty sure you could only buy it in the atom shop during fasnacht.  I'm glad I snapped it up while it was there.  So far I have all of them except the raider one.  It is nice to be able to switch modes when I need certain things.
---
It’s building for me, I love finding new areas to build beauties at
---
I have many other characters, but there is no way I am going through the Wastelanders slog again.
---
All plans should be account wide. And there should be an limited account wide stash. 
---
If they had this I would actually play with 5 different characters with different builds. 
---
Until then, I'll stick with my vanilla Bloodied Commando.
---
Dude I’m literally stating I wish they would drop at events and dailies. Would make so much more sense than mini nukes and heavy combat armor left arm.
---
Why are you assuming they work? I am on disability and this IS my job. Clearly to get to 2177 they had to cheat. But so fucking what? How does that affect you? Totalitarian systems need people like you to operate: you make them possible.
---
i think you are thinking of something like a browning hi power.
---
Well, we trading, not barter /s
---
The game caps you and it is designed entirely so if you want to "progress" you have to log in daily. 
---
I got the game on sale during steam summer sale and definitely got my moneys worth. Now I realized I simply do not like the games online aspects. There is just too much for me that feels like it can be done better or simpler etc. So I only log on when I really feel like playing or have something in mind to do that isn't grinding.
---
Personally I always seem to have a surplus of Stimpaks so I don't mind playing medic. Just give me some of that sweet heart emote and we're even if I happen to revive you, but I'm a quack surgeon so I probably just liquored you up anyways.
---
Isn’t that when people gouge prices?
---
You can get strangler heart power armor that's legendary but it's a grind to get it.
---
Dude, I have like 40 bubblegums in my backpack and I still find myself running to the collectron like a little kid every time I go back to base, just to see if there is more bubble gum in it.  I think I need therapy.
---
From what Ive read I think you have to move your CAMP and even then it takes up ghost budget that is really difficult to get rid of. Someone said you can get rid of that by moving CAMP multiple times but I dont know.
---
why is it that some people will just believe every stupid thing they hear
---
I find it pretty funny too. Lol. Although using it on a mule isn't a terrible idea.
---
I’m extremely generous at my shop lol. I sell sunshine oil for 26 caps cause that’s more of a grind lol
---
Look the 1911 handguns form has been put into multiple calibers nowadays
---
Veeery nice
---
I think the game would be boring as fuck playing solo. It's best played with friends. 
---
There are probably a lot better single player games out there.
---
You mean the birdwatcher's place? That's one of my favorite locations in the game. :)
---
Look for Bloodied Builds.
---
My camp is by a workshop that has drops for both chemistry and tinker workstations which I sell for zero
---
At my shop, I usually have 3-4 in there are a time but every so often someone will come and just grab the entire free inventory, doesn’t bother me I’ll put plans I get caps for in that spot till I get more, just find it strange
---
Well there's you're problem, you're an over-powered meta-build and you keep taking her out in one shot. What she needs is a 60 minute man.
---
*" I rock 'em, roll 'em all night long...."*
---
If you want to never ever worry about food or water again. Get the commrade collectron and a herbivore mutation. Running speed demon was a pain before getting it. Lots of useful food items you get pre-made or items to make food. Also a few meds. 
---
For extra measure plant maybe a few melons and one purified water. Even if you don't buy the collectron that set up with herbivore is easy work.
---
I don’t know how, that’s why.
---
I’ve never had the trade interface open long enough to see how it’s supposed to work, and all three times I tried ended up with items taken I didn’t want to give up.
---
My last attempt was over a year ago. Maybe there was some since-patched exploit, but as they say “thrice bitten ever shy.”
---
That’s what I’m working towards at the moment, I have 3/6 pieces so far
---
I don’t mind it besides how loud it is.
---
The only ones that I hate are blight, rad worms and dysentery. Anytime I see that pop up, I take a disease cure.
---
This, you'll get tons.  Take/defend/retake workshops.  Guaranteed camp plan.
---
How about not calling people stupid?  
---
You have no idea *why* they’re buying it. Maybe they plan to donate it. Maybe they have run out and need some for right now. Maybe they have a friend that just started playing and they need some extra stims for them. 
---
***You’re*** the one that’s listing it for 1 cap.
---
I’ve dropped far more Stimpaks than I’ve bought from vendors. 
---
Until Bethesda gives us ‘level-gated’ vending machines, your choices are to either deal with it or find newbies to give assistance to directly.
---
This. If your goods are meant for newbies and lowbies, tell people with a sign. *Most* people aren't actively trying to be jerks and they'll respect it.
---
It has a chance to drop during breach and clear, however, it will only spawn in the containers locked by a hornwright executive card. Make sure you have one before doing thw quest. Also, it only spawns at 25 or 35.
---
Nice. I would just stick with that then. You should also get a level 50 backpack to have a little more carry weight while out of power armor.
---
It's a Fallout 4 bug where maximum health is not really adjusted with radiation for formulas, so when you see some perk or legendary modifier that says "below X% health" or something similar, it will not take into account that maximum health have been reduced by radiation, and will think that person is at 20% health even though they are at 100% with lots of radiation.
---
There are a lot of perks and legendary effects that grant benefits when at low health, generally this builds are called "Bloodied"
---
Tell them it's just like anal. It's painful at first but then you eventually get used to it and enjoy it.
---
Does it use a lot of budget?
---
I doubt they will ever in a million years do it because it would shorten the grind, but I am behind your suggestion 100%.
---
Ah, ty. I thought it was to keep mutations or something
---
I enjoy building too, but I'm always too nervous to tear down my current camp fearing I won't be able to get everything just right again. Plus I like to plop my camp near resource veins with a view, which often don't go together.
---
I'm bias - I can't stand power armor - the feel, hud, the view screen, worried about power running out, the noise when moving around, limited melee weapons, just everything.
---
Secret Service fully buttressed, with jetpack, cushioned leg mods and soon to have deep pocket arm mods - the best.  Plus, you can wear outfits over it.  Stylin'
---
I’m hoping they add legendarys to power armor one day
---
If you don't care about selling stuff go ahead 👍 each player's time is their own mate. I'm just not going to spend mine looking for vendors. 🤣
---
On console,I got zero things to do. I cannot wait for september's patch.
---
I decided to try and complete those 2 NW challenges of winning 5 games naked and in PA, and so far i only managed to do 1!  Without a team it just seems almost impossible.
---
I dont know because i havent been silly enough to do it. I think its about 10% or something though so yeah. A noticeable amount
---
Fix the trading! No more waiting! Fix the trading! No more waiting! Fix the trading!

(This really is a major issue that has no excuse for being so lackluster)

Upvotes for you - very nice.
---
Yeah, anything other than another Handmade skin or Sledgehammer skin.  The Fixer needs some too.

I joined onenwith 3 people on drums and 3 people on the spits afk. After the 2 minute counter the event started at at like 75%. Than with the funky critter spawn one person shot the large group of critters with a few explosive rounds, collected the chunk and turned them in, event finished in like a minute.
---
So true about the resources, I just recently moved to a place where I could get 2 resources at one camp and I’m def missing the views.
---
... Not us?

Fusion cores have never been a problem for me, my friend sold me 600 fusion cores like a year ago and I have only used like 200
---
Surgical Glove with a tattoo on the back of the hand labeled "Fisto"
---
this is like how borderlands was doing this YEARS ago
---
I regularly drop my trash camp plans at vault 76. Sometimes I even drop extra PA frames with full fusion cores.
---
Upvoted everyone since some dickhead is downvoting everything here.
---
I, personally, am too good to eat any of your irradiated melons, corns, or meats. I only eat the best pre-war, prepackaged food 😤
---
5 slot the limit
---
Nice! I just hit 301 yesterday
---
oh, i have both lmao
---
I like the idea of more difficult environments as opposed to more difficult mobs as a change of pace.
---
But most of the Brotherhood of Steel at this point are using remenents of US Military gear! They've not been scaving energy tech much yet!

If you want a legacy excavator torso, now's your chance.

Open a ticket with customer service. I've had them give me Atoms for problems like this.
---
i use photomode
---
Let me guess: you were on top of a tent or fence during the fight and the SBQ either didn't land or didnt land much. Not that I buy this shit but some people are fanatical.
---
No date yet, they've just been datamined in upcoming Atom Shop and Season content.
---
Xbox player here. I'm just sad I dont have deep pocketed SS limbs yet. Colossus seems to be a colossal problem I dont have to deal with (😁) but I want that carry weight.i was promised (about) 2 weeks ago
---
Ghost budget tings.
---
I do agree that Beth should focus on the new factions and create new creatures. It'd be really interesting to see an alligator or snake
---
Edit: i forgot about the gatorclaw in fallout tactics and nukaworld
---
I’ve done this as well. Added some radiation emitters alongside the Tesla coils for extra torture.
---
Welp, start rolling for that B/SS/S tenderizer lol
---
My guess is that someone would be able to use it to dupe
---
Both players have items locked in 
---
Player A exits to dashboard/desktop
---
Player B still has trade screen open and accepts trade 
---
Both players now have player A’s item 
---
I understand it should be easy to do for a top studio but this game is a joke and isn’t meant for online play
---
And let them learn nothing and keep scamming vulnerable people? You sound like Neville Chamberlain with his “appeasement” bullshit.

We do a lot of bitching and suggestion making here but this is one time they really should listen.
---
I clearly see 6 slots on PTS right now
---
I've gotten up to nearly 800 stims legitimately. Many are gifted to me or sold at crazy low prices. I end up dropping many to my small group or to lowbies because even with Traveling Pharmacy at rank 3, those motherfuckers are a bitch on my carry weight.
---
I don’t think it’s dropped on consoles yet
---
I made a kill chamber first. Radiation emitter under the chair, four flamethrowers and four tesla arcs pointed at the chair all attached to a switch in another room with a viewing window, "death in progress" lights, and strobe lights to bake it seem like it was making the lights flicker lol.
---
31/08.. Project Bravo reward is the BOS collectron.. save your Atoms for something else?! 🤓
---
Oh. Thanks for the tip.
---
Oh I saw something about it dropping the 18th
---
I have the same bias, I just like the interaction with the game better out of power armor, yeah it helps out my heavy weapon build but I haven’t had much of an issue out of power armor tbh
---
I’m guilty of that but with insurgent outfits lmao. Only takes cloth and oil and sells for 25c.
---
Anything in a vending machine is for sale.
---
I honestly just finally broke down to watch where to find firecaps and since I've made beaucoup bucks selling these puppies at 25 caps a pop
---
Not that rare these are the spare plans I have 6 meat week flags , 5 Brahmin grills, 2 moo moo back packs, 9 meat cleaver, 2 peppered tenderizer mod and 1 spicy tenderizer mod.
---
The meat tenderizer plan seems to be super rare I've not gotten one yet and it's all I need.
---
they've got a couple of nazi guns in the game, need something to balance that out and the M1 Garand would be perfect.
---
so they should be similarly equipped as the dead BOS soldiers we find in Appalachia, who are also using remnant military gear, like assault rifles and so on. Why would this unit be any different? To the point where they would be bringing along 25 - 30 different types of weapons with them?
---
I believe you. Was wondering what the hell happened to my flux lol.
---
He does have a bit of dialogue in between cooks saying he worked all year getting the prizes for us humans (obviously in his own words)
---
I could see him getting plans for it to give to us
---
It's not perfectly clear,but i've seen mine disappear for cards which I have all ranks animated, or all ranks normal.
---
Animated have other restricting mechanics.
---
You're an idiot.
---
the cow god demands sacrifices
---
Both have same drop rate
---
9.09%
---
I highly agree

I’m sorry there’s a disease cure machine in silos?

What are you looking for and are you on Xbox?

Good deal man. Hope that pump serves you well

Welcome to Fallout 76!

This is just not true but okay

Um, how about not use glitches to blueprint an ammo factory and build them? Real vague there chief. Reading is hard apparently.

I heard the couriers talking over on the Market, “It would be sad for us of course since we’d be out of a job, but it would be worth it if that means people wouldn’t get scammed ever again.”

---
So don't take a workshop. And DEFINITELY don't stay within the workshop boundaries, dumbass.
---
If the event ends and you die or are in the process of dying this happens. Very annoying that the devs don’t fix stuff like this instead of some stupid photo mode frame that no one uses
---
Im having this issue now, did you ever resolve this?
---
The real slog on getting the SSA is the legendary modules grind, not the gold. 
---
Either way my SPECIAL spread is setup so I can min/max a heavy weapons/PA build, however I can turn it into a respectable non-PA heavy gunner, shot gunner or melee depending how I feel like playing. I have a decent set Unyielding SSA and a mix and match of other stats for a full health setup as well. I'm still refining my SSA too. I see no reason to stay in one build when I can effectively have multiple builds on one character. I have an alt that's for rifles though.
---
Edit: And no the SSA jetpack doesn't use fusion cores.
---
Big lesson? Handful of junk and the knowledge they got to you. Seems petty
---
I wish...I really really do.
---
Ahhh, thanks
---
Eh, the one in Nuka World wasn’t a PURE gator claw, it had a bit of Jackson’s Chameleon and super super mutant brain cells, so a naturally mutated gator claw would be cool.
---
I go back and forth on it same way I do with how quick metal armor breaks.  I hate it, but without it, the game is rather empty.  My only gripe is that the 'survival' aspect is being used as part of the main game experience and not just a side piece as it should be.
---
Personally I think armor should break slower (think 60% slower than current) and diseases should occur less commonly as at its current setup, if you get hit by a diseased enemy, its a veritable guarantee you'll get infected and many times they dont even need to hit you, but just be in your vicinity (ie: have killed disased ferals before they land a hit, but still magically contract parasites.)
---
Also, can Bethesda PLEASE stop making 'parasites' occur 9 out of the 10 infections given?  No joke, my character eats over 4k calories a day just to not starve...
---
Yeah wtf since when?
---
Man I used to use so many weapons but about 2 months ago I got a 2 star bloodied explosive handmade. It was so good I rebuilt my character around it. I can't imagine going back to anything else now. One weapon probably shouldn't be so good that every weapon I touched before it immediately becomes obsolete.
---
I have both, ss for everyday use and my x01 for big events that I need more protection.  I am geared up as a heavy PA user and I just like my PA.  But the ss is much better for just running around killing.  Not having to get out of PA, or use cores.
---
My Explosives only build begs to differ.
---
Eventually, they have a lot of stuff from Fallout 4 they haven't sold yet
---
Some actual weather changes for the world. My biggest hope is that with the BoS taking over the ATLAS Observatory, eventually we can get snow covered Appalachia during winter. Or a huge Halloween event in the mire where the fumes from the swamp completely block out the sun for October.
---
I want some world changes man...
---
That would be nice. I use ultrasite primarily so having legendarys on that would be nice.
---
Yes! The swarms at SBQ and Encryiptid are mostly just annoying and take away from the event imo.
---
You have to stay in the boundaries to claim the workshop, it only takes one dick to hide and snipe you while your taking it and you are in pvp whether you want it or not.
---
I meant that's how I would implement OP's idea not that that's how it works.
---
God, I hope so.
---
Thank todd
---
I have to agree with the majority. If it’s in a machine and good price I will buy it. I just turned 100. When I was around 30 someone gave me 800 stimpacks. Not a typo. It overloaded me but there was a camp near by and I swapped out my stash so I could keep them all. I started passing them out like candy and still pass them out to the new and lower level players. I would not put them in my vending machines for a cap though. Deliver direct.
---
I just drink from my sink, get sick, then just power through it. I don’t even look at what the diseases do anymore, apparently they don’t bother me that much.
---
Not to those greedy level 100+.......
---
Thanks everybody!  I haven’t checked Whitespring for plans - good call - I’m all over that. 
---
And I keep getting the same 8-10 plans from workshops. That frustration is what really drove my post. 
---
Thanks for the quick responses!
---
I think they are partially there so it is in fact perilous for a low level, even if you made the whole area as irradiated as the nuke zone I had the stealth armor by level 35.
---
I think you were on to something have to get through an area to get to the boss, maybe not just rads but super high diseases, maybe you take on damage unless you have x amount of resistance
---
Everything is set up to Disadvantage people with multiple Characters. I think they are eventually just going to remove them. And everyone will be panicking to try and figure out what items they want to fill their main characters stash box to the max with and what to lose forever. Event outfits, Fasnacht masks, Legendary Items everything that we evenly distribute out to all our characters that takes up to much room in one stash box will be gone.
---
Car park at Valley Galleria
---
Not exagerrating at all... no need to be so salty grahm. You just need to learn how to play the game and manage your time. I grinded it out in three weeks so that I could enjoy my summer, mask included. Good luck, and please be respectful. Reddit is full of trolls and negativity, so try not to be a contributor. Thanks for creating drama.
---
Ya some buddies of mine and I were hoping to have are own chapter earlier today we talked about how awesome it would be to add pilotable vertibirds dropping in soldiers
---
I want a good semi auto rifle for my stealth build so it might be able to stay effective post one wasteland nerf.
---
My level 48 pistol build has been using a pipe auto pistol. Just clinging on until i caan something with some aactual substance.  welcome to rushing through wastelanders for gauss pistol
---
Oh, neat. Thanks.
---
Outstanding resource! Thank you!
---
No human npcs, tons of bugs, more crashes.  It was a bit of a dumpster fire.
---
When the poor sob at Atlas gets denied entry into the BOS......he will find Modus.
---
I said the same about my unyielding free radicals mask
---
Just a psa for anyone having disease troubles....get urself the recipe for cranberry bog disease cures, super easy to farm the mats (goo from the pitches plants, glowing fungus, and cranberries). I always keep my vendor well stocked with antibitotics for cheap...i know the stuggle : /
---
Those reset timers are on *your own personal character specific timer*. 20 hours from when you made the first transaction after reset.
---
If you want them to be at 8pm EST, do them at 8pm EST.
---
been playing sonce beta.
---
no, human npcs werent around cuz everybody was suppoused to have either died or left except the 76 residents. the "gimmick" was all the humans were other real people (players). the gimmick obviously didnt work out well for most people, so Wastelanders had humans come back.
---
there was no radio dj. just songs on loop.
---
the game relied entirely on environmental storytelling, and imo it worked. tapes, notes, AI's, etc. all gave you the information you needed. your goal was to finish what those who went before you started but failed to do. shame people who dont have the patience for reading ignored it and claimed 76 had no story.
---
They added bubble turrets but have not unlocked them yet.
---
Better yet make it a weekly reset since many people are not able to play each day but are more than capable of racking up an entire week’s worth of currency in just a couple play sessions
---
Give this person a job Bethesda
---
Wow really
---
Or in workshops
---
Sold?
---
An experiment....
---
No radio host, and yes all holotapes.
---
Good luck with your pistol build. My buddy uses it and it's pretty situational. Gauss Pistol definitely makes pistol builds viable to an extent.
---
The one in silos dose not cure diseases. but the machines that scan you dna for the keycards are sympto matics
---
Am i the only one that didn't know you could do this?
---
Literally give us all the weapons from New Vegas and then redo Legendaries entirely with new and better rolls.
---
If you’re going stealth scaly skin isn’t necessary. I don’t use it and I’ve had no problems on my stealth rifle/pistol build.
---
There was no human NPCs correct. There were a few NPCs though, Grahm has been with us since the start. In fact I saw Grahm before any other Super Mutant in this game lol. Rose was there from the start as well, and even though I'm alone in this I consider MODUS an NPC. All the old main quests are still there and exist as they did before WL. All that Responders, Firebreathers, Rose, the Free States and BoS... That's all the same as it's always been, just no random NPCs in some of the areas. And there was no radio host, it was just the songs playing in a loop.
---
Some people play the game with the community, some people are only playing for themselves
---
And if you aren't sure what the plan titles mean or what they include:
---
https://m.imgur.com/a/3ZhkLJl
---
They also need to implement an option you can toggle to share scapbox content
---
You can hold control to scroll through lists faster.
---
Its my second character too, first is level 143 sneak rifleman, so running through the same quests has been really repetitive
---
But weren't they somewhat immune to the plague? Also I would just like them to get a serious merf to their teleport ability, the same goes for radscorpions.
---
After doing meat week a few times I noticed I had tato salad in my inventory, never seen it before but I had like 7 of them. I ate one, immediately got downed, and then Mysterious Savior revived me. 
---
Immediately dumped the six I had left on the ground and threw a Molotov at them. Never touching the shite again. I knew it was weird when it was a tato based food item that still gave me benefits even though I have carnivore...
---
I never have trouble moving my stock, and those who make it to vending machines overwhelmingly show that they loved the experience.
---
that was the date for PC. since rolling out additional hotfixes is easier on pcs than consoles, they're holding out on the actual console update until they feel it's actually 100% ready.
---
which is kinda surprising since usually they just say "eh good enough" and give updates to everybody.
---
big lesson, they now have to repair their fusion generator and Decon shower. Fuck outta here griefer
---
The double sided walls also count as exploits don't they?
---
its an exploit.  dont be suprised if you get a mandatory 2 week "vacation" from this game sooner or later.
---
Legend has it that he traded all his B2525 fixers for the plans
---
I guess they change it from announcement
---
why would you be alone in calling modus and npc? npc literally stands for "non player character", and modus is a character who is not player controlled. so modus is an npc.
---
Yeah it was a letdown. Range was basically melee distance too.
---
Reflect damage will be a perfect bitch slap to my bloodied ass.
---
Lol got unyeileding as well but I'm a junkies stealth build
---
If someone can be that stupid they deserve it
---
Awesome, as I said each player's time is there own. I'm sure there are people who camp hop just to check out people's designs.
---
Yes. Knowing the plan will allow for it to drop from the usual legendary sources.
---
That even took over a year after launch.
---
Supposedly yes. I have seen youtubers like JuiceHead reporting on it, but I have yet to see one.
---
