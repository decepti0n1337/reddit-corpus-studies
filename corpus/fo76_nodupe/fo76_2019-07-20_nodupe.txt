oh no, so you're saying "worthless food build corpse" unironically?

Add bobble eyes to the assultrons head for extra Psychological warfare.
---
Radstags.  I love that they will bitch slap any creature or Wastelanders from behind.  I always picture them wearing black sunglasses and a cig hanging out their mouths after an attack with thug life flashing above their heads
---
The first time you can do both, sounds plausible.  I never skipped, had to grind for that ammo machine!
---
Yeah those got me. Until I got a gatling plasma, now it's a couple of seconds.
---
Soaking up ~~those sweet rads~~ overseer xp?
---
Literally the fucking best one yet
---
I want the second star to be AP refresh OR poison resistance for two of them but definitely want the third star to be reduced weight of stuff.
---
There isnt really one as far as food goes but Rad Ant lager gives you a temp buff of 50 extra carry weight. The downside is you get a breif "hangover" period of a few minutes when it wears off that decreases it by 50. It would be enough to get you to a place you can offload to though. Theres also some that will buff strength.

It only lasts 60 seconds though I meant something that lasted 30-60 mins
---
Did they ban your account? Are you able to get back on? 
---
If you can, I've got a card that I've never used and I keep meaning to use it.
---
I make it a point to stay away from anything unyielding or bloodied. I tried it for a bit it and was far too boring one-shotting everything and being a god. But if they raised the rest of the effects up to actually being useful, they could balance the whole game around more difficult content. Right now a large chunk, maybe even a majority of the playerbase is just running bloodied. If they balance the game for bloodied, they are literally cutting off content from everybody who doesn't min-max their build. I quite frankly don't care if they nerf bloodied/unyielding/everything else that stacks with it or buff everything else and then adjust the rest of the game difficulty accordingly, but knowing bethesda it would be much smarter going for the simplest possible option to ruin the least amount of things
---
Mother Mole granted me a Bloodied swing speed Bear Arm today! Too bad I don't run bloodied, but a helluva piece.
---
Keep it!! I rolled 4 pieces of unyielding when my sneak vats crit commando was full life. Kept all of them until I found a B2525 Handmade and switched to bloodied. Best decision ever.
---
Got me at the HS also lol

Are you perhaps a Destiny player?
---
How long does it take to reset?
---
Someone already grabbed it just give it a hour or so
---
I missed 1 day since I was out of town and when I came back it was like it had reset to day 1. It gave me the notification that one daily quest was ready but when I went to track it in my Pip-boy the importance of communication and retirement plans were ready.
---
Thanks!
---
Calling someone an asshole =/= Genuinely nice player.
---
I‚Äôm still playing, thankfully, I just can‚Äôt chat with my friends. Thanks, man, I‚Äôm glad there are some awesome people on here. I got another keycard, but I just wanted to vent. It‚Äôs just frustrating AF.
---
Isnt that part of killing it with fire?
---
It's just casuals being casuals. It doesn't help that a good deal of the player base has little experience with online games. Bethesda RPGs are also some of the easiest RPGs ever and can be made even easier with the use of their many, *many*, exploits, mods, and at least in PCs case console commands. Most players of Bethesdas RPGs have never had to really work for anything and they aren't used to it now.
---
I‚Äôm sure you can understand my frustration. But, yup! I am! üíú
---
This game has been nothing but a grind. Why are people always trying to squeeze their way out of difficult things. Don‚Äôt make another character if you don‚Äôt want to have legendary perk cards...they are not for everyone. I could see being able to ‚Äúshare them‚Äù with yer team but not other characters. 
---
Next do you want to share you secret service armor and new Gauss plans with all yer characters?
---
Fire wookies already exist, my dude. They spend the entire game hugging the inferno üòÇ
---
Who doesn't love sitting by a nice cozy fire at night, with a souvenir beer Stein up your ass...
---
Shh.
---
Go to the theme parks and pick up the rubbish I. The ground, all the cups and hot dog containers are plastic
---
unless they can hide in the flames it barely counts. those are just warm wookies
---
üëçüèª
---
28 hours... bleh.
---
I almost have no 5.56, I really only have .44, .308 and .38
---
Hi thanks for the reply but my problem is I actually picked it up and the quest hasn't updated. So I think I'm screwed, but I'll wait and see if that works. Thanks
---

---
@OP are you on PC?  I have an explosive hunting rifle.
---
You can heal them with the friendly fire perk and a shiskebab.
---
I‚Äôm just recommending that if someone made characters it‚Äôs a bad move to make them re-level it and punish people that play different builds. It‚Äôs far better to allow people with multiple high level characters work together and upgrade the legendary perks together since it‚Äôd encourage more player numbers with constant progression for people who don‚Äôt have all of them at a high lvl.
---
So I dont have to engage in PvP in order to get the S.C.O.R.E challenges :)
---
I would be fine with it if it just had a reflex sight to reduce it's AP cost a little more. I have a J2525 that I love(I have basically infinite ammo and it tears everything to pieces!), and my sole issue is the AP cost being just a little higher than I feel it should be.
---
Edit: I'm bad at math.
---
Just to ask do you still want a fixer plan I‚Äôll give that to you for free if you still want to try and get a better one
---
It's an exploit, involving blueprinting the ammo factory
---
at least you can login since I got disconected today doing silo for the 4 time (couse disconects when arrive on the last place to actual lunch the nuke)my "play" option is grey out on my main character, the alt I can log in normal and you can trow there on your rant a lot more bugs that I spent some hours searching about and is there since day one, like I have to hit 2-5 time some low level Mob becouse the hits don't register, the first feedback from it that I found is from 2018 so yeah 2 years and the same bug still persist.
---
I am with you.  The necessary grind to just be able to grind making these and its shit roll after shit roll after shit roll that all you can do is sell back for scrip.  It's the 1\* and 2\* crap that really  just puts the cherry on top you know.
---
I've rolled one or two awesome UNY pieces but yet to roll a VAN that I want to keep.  I've only managed a single piece that is good enough (for my tastes) being BOL WWR 1P.
---
Is it bannable?
---
I love that someone gave this an award. It‚Äôs starting to make me laugh too! I‚Äôve been called so much worse in Smite and Overwatch... lol. I felt like asshole was the kindest mean word.
---
yeah my mentor totally went out of his way for me
---
Your frustration led you to violate Xbox chat rules, for which you were muted (usually temporary).  I‚Äôm sure you can understand that.
---
Of course, but when a kid joins my xbox party and says the n word and a bunch of homophobic slurs, hes in the right
---
I have a troubleshooters 50 cal, need some help? I take robots down.
---
This. This is how to run that event.
---
Could be. This is a pretty blatant exploit, so even for bethesda it shouldn't be too hard to track down. The heavy handed ban wave earlier this week gives me hope that they might start taking action from now on, so they could very well start banning or giving suspensions for it
---
Technically yes, but then again BGS picks and chooses which exploits they deem as banworthy.
---
It really depends on if they have the capability to track who uses it. If they can, they may ban. If not, they'll end up just patching it out.
---
Making multiple builds/players is not a punishment... it‚Äôs role playing. Being able to share perks with another character - one of our own -  defeats the purpose of the MMORPG (don‚Äôt forget the RPG). It‚Äôs the same as everyone wanting a shared scrap/inventory box or allowing free perk point swaps.
---
"Even a basic crafted fixer is better than the combat rifle."...nope
---
you can't build either with ffr; this is when both shine...otherwise, craft a handmade 
---
Fixer skin, HAH... when ALL of the combat rifle mods fall to your ability to mod a Fixer...f'n really. Beth will never make, perceive, the connection... just saying
---
Special and Perks:  At level 17 I reccomend a more broad distribution of points and explore different perk cards, see if you like them!  There are quality of life perks (alot of endurance ones or those that lower the weight of certain items) that you'll love or hate. 
---
I feel some are gimmicky and useless, like the canned dog food perk. Yes you find enough canned dog food and can do the feeding the people event or just visit mana dolches plant to find more of them..
---
 While crafted recipes give alot of buffs. And when you finally start playing around with mutations herbivore and carnivore double those effects.  
---
My favorite and reccomended perks are 1) Green thumb (only 1 point and it doubles plants you find- this doubles the amount of healing salves, disease cures, vegetable starch, and food plant based foods you craft.);  2) Chemist (doubles meds you craft);  3) Serendipity for a chance to make a duplicate of what you're crafting (You'll soon start crafting ammunition and this extra ammo is super nice);   4) Ammo smithing perk (ammo is king)
---
The important thing for crafting perks is you can equip them when at camp, and once done, equip exploring and damage cards.
---
Lastly, at level 50 you can redistribute special points instead of taking a new perk.  So if you realize you dont need 8 endurance and dont care about lead belly perk you can transfer a point to a more useful special category.
---
Thanks for the info, I watched Angry Turtles video recently and that was his method to solo also if I remember correctly. Something to think about, I'll have to respeck a character as full melee.
---
Heck I'd settle for Uny dropping to +1 on all, that's still a +5 across the board. Bloodied damage is a fare trade imo. I really feel the uneven is just the special boosts.
---
Or rather, it should be like an 'adrenaline rush' and supply the strength, agiliy, endurance (added) which is also fair. The bullshit is Charisma, Intelligence and Luck boosts.
---
Im sure some fucker covered in blood is extremely charismatic. Police ask no questions and he always gets off with a warning lol
---
The holotape quest doesn't amount to much - it's just about exploring the wasteland. I don't think it even has a conclusion.

Enjoy, you should be fine reaping the rewards at a workshop in a private world
---
Pure fear
---
What‚Äôs funny is I rolled an unyielding 3 star leg in my first two tries.  I‚Äôve done another 30+ more (all limbs) and nothing close
---
It seems pretty easy to track. You could just look through peoples profiles for the blueprint and if they do then they could ban them. I don‚Äôt know much
---
Xbox
---
I was gungho for a while but its too disheartening.  I buy one module per day for a single roll that I have no expectations anymore for and it continues to let me down day in and day out.
---
That happened to me so now I just don't use profanity when messaging people. Now I'm like "Hey baby" instead of "Hey asshole"..... it will get some funny reactions
---
Thanks, I might need to try this out.
---
As a shotgun main Im always short on Plastic.  Tons of everything else though.  I switch some perks for melee to manage trash mobs.
---
Bloodied by itself is fine, but it's cheesy due to all the synchronization it gets. Nerd rage, serendipity, etc all make sense in theory. Then you put it into practice and realize that staying at low health makes you a tank build with the best damage buff possible in the game. Little bit of a miscalculation there
---
At this point I'm banging my head against a brick wall, so I'll just leave it with my favorite quote, "It's hard to argue with someone smart, impossible to argue with an idiot." Safe to say it is impossible to argue with you.
---
I'm gonna play the season out, then move on to other, newer games like Cyberpunk 2077, that Ghost of Tsumimimimi, Assassin's Creed: H√§gar the Horrible edition, the new Destiny 2 DLC, then return to Fall Out 76 when they've dropped more story/content DLC.  The idea of doing 100 level seasons every quarter just sounds so mind-numbing.  I tried with Destiny 2 seasons and just couldn't.....
---
Just checking by all 3 heavy gunners you mean normal/master/expert, right?
---
There is obviously some flat ground, but any flat ground in the game is taken up by permanent structures.
---
Ghoulish helps with this challenge.
---
How dare you
---
Can you be on the terminal without launching the event? Like to stop someone from doing what was done to you?
---
Yeah I really don't know. For a while they weren't really banning people for exploits, not until this most recent dupe wave.
---
Just a few months before that though, there was the display case dupe in which people duped a shitton of legendary modules, treasury notes, and holiday gifts (among other things) yet they didn't ban for that.
---
I'm with you on that.  My current 3\* scout armor is hitting on every \* just the way I like it and its proving way to hard with SS to replace any of it.
---
Cool, I'm not offering to give you my card. I'm offering a chance for you to do the event with me and whoever else in the thread wants to go to there.
---
Not to mention doing this gives you XP.....
---
Like I said I just go with friends who do it legitimately. They're geeks for this kind of stuff so when I told them nukacrypt exists they just scoffed and went back to their decoding.
---
Yes. They are the biggest geeks for stuff like that.
---
By the way, killed a 3 star ghoul today at WS and rolled a bloodied handmade with FFR.  Granted, it was a 2 star weapon but still very exciting.
---
This is true. A few weeks (2?) back I had access to the atom store wallpapers without owning them. In true form, I didn't say anything and used them all... They kinda sucked so I'm glad I got to trial them. 
---
They've since locked again, but this isn't a BS post and the OP is certainly telling the truth.
---
USS Rulebook
---
AND DON'T FORGET, THERE ARE MISSING MODS FOR LIMBS.   YOU CAN'T BUY/LEARN/ADD ULTRA LIGHT BUILD OR DEEP POCKET TO ARMS OR LEGS.
---
It can be done solo.  But it takes a fair bit of luck.Ôøº
---
You have to cripple all the spawning ghouls so they are crawling then quickly loot the caves.
---
Then you can sit up on top of the machine and cripple and kill on both sides as needed.
---
Of course you can‚Äôt get the top rewards solo
---
I could have sworn there was a armour workbench in them, no?
---
Is 80% of the entire player base actually a real number?  Where is that being sourced from?
---
You get some scrip from the Overseer if you find them all.
---
I wholeheartedly agree.
---
I know, but it's not the best way in my opinion. It looks stupid and makes no logical sense.
---
Arming the scavengers or passing a skill check to upgrade the turrets would be better.
---
Maybe it's just me.
---
PS4.  I try to keep healing factor, speed demon, carnivore, adrenal reaction, and twisted muscles in my vendors.  I know some have sold lately, so I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs in it right now, but I have the mats to make more.
---
I will likely be on again sometime between midnight and 1a EST.
---
Aj ninetyeight.
---
Definitely gonna steal but I only have the Chinese flags.
---
Yea. I hate wasting so much ammo on them though. but they are supposed to be tough.
---
nope... the op took a bit of liberty in emphasis for the point. Instigating is better than some of the noctournal, and such, crap, but neither gun does enough base damage to function as a one-shot weapon past L20-30 baddies.
---
If your Instigating stars include faster fire rate, then you have something fun to throw lead with.

Happened to me this morning. I hit up Mama Murmurgh at the Rusty Pick for some legendary modules then went to the Charleston junkyard to take it over to build my 10 things for my final SCORE challenge. It looked unowned on the map and there wasn't much there so I went to take possession and lo and behold some Level 19 came in guns blazing and well I tried to keep it competitive but let's face it he's no match for a level 350+ with a deep bench of 3\* legendary weapons and after a couple of thwacks from my instigating baseball bat he died, I got the workshop, I built my 10 things and left.
---
Gear:  Main story quests, side quests, and ally quests will guide you towards level appropriate areas, and award you special legendaries at the end.  
---
You'll also get awarded legendaries sometimes for public events.  Even if they aren't good items you can trade them for script at train stations to then trade for  a random legendary weapon at the rusty pick.
---
Shop at player vendors.  You can find alot of plans and important recipes like the stimpac one for cheap instead of paying full price at an ingame vendor.
---
You‚Äôre right my bad
---
Some people use the puke emote when they need radaway.
---
I‚Äôve always wanted survival back but every time I mention it I get the standard ‚Äúif you like PvP find a different game‚Äù
---
True true.
---
I mostly get down at craft time, when I'm chasing SB brains, using shielded casual under armor etc to try max my crafted durability at resting 11 int when uny is already 15 without trying. I almost thought about keeping a 1* Uny set and standing in fire just to craft.... Which kinda shows how stupid it is.
---
I think you mean ASSaultrons.....
---
It‚Äôs punished when you have to grind on that character too. Every iteration of the perk system requires a huge amount of lvls to upgrade the perks but in the end it‚Äôs only for one of your 5 characters. Choosing a new character and leveling it from scratch is hard and requires time but what‚Äôs the point in other characters if your main was so hard to complete then why do it again. I‚Äôve seen people using the xp bug way more due to people just not wanting to be forced into one character non stop when I asked them. We‚Äôre moving away from a sandbox MMORPG into a grind fest so that you can reach hard to achieve perks in an end game level that won‚Äôt be transferable when people already one shot things. Adding an insane grind behind extra perks is not gameplay it‚Äôs padding that forces you to play to improve. All this asks is in order to lower the grind and make it more rewarding based on an account level achievement rather than spending too much time on one character that won‚Äôt even use all of the legendary perks.
---
I'm looking forward to trying this.  Thanks!
---
This\^...ish... don't forget about the stealth bonus
---
They can't even keep this game functional and you're proposing multiple new games?
---
Sleeping bag, normal stash, scap box, cooking pot, and a music instrument. That's it.
---
I would love to have a big green tree or two.
---
Oh ok. Thanks
---
A while back, I was doing one violent night. Back when you can grind the event out before the time limit existed.  Some people join and we was giving and grinding the ghouls that come. Then this guy came in and started yelling at everyone for killing the ghouls cause he wanted to get loot as well. He keep complaining at me. Cause I'll accidentally one shot the ghoul. 
---
It got to the point where I left. However right before I leave there was another ghoul. One shot it. And he called me a stupid n word and started yelling a bunch of cuss words. Didn't report him. Just block him and let him be. People can just be asshole in this game.
---
Were you through setting them up or were you in the process? If you don‚Äôt get the cards picked by the time the match starts or get disconnected it‚Äôll reset your cards to how they were previously set
---
Oh I like that. Haha. May try to do that. This was the first time I ever let off on someone.
---
Don't farm screws like a noob; CRAFT screws like a pro!
---
1. Get a Scrap Assaultron Head by killing an Assaultron.  
---
2. Equip level 3 Super Duper perk.  
---
3. At an Armor bench, craft an Assaultron Helmet.  
---
4. If Super Duper does NOT proc, scrap your newly created helmet to get the Scrap Assaultron Head back, then craft another helmet until Super Duper DOES proc.  
---
5. If the perk procs, you now have TWO helmets. Scrap them both. Now you have TWO Assaultron heads.  
---
6. Keep doing this until you have as many Assaultron heads as you need screws.  
---
7. Scrap the Assaultron heads (but keep one Assaultron helmet for future use) to get screws, silver, and circuitry.
---
Presto! Now you know how to craft screws for one steel scrap each. Craft responsibly.
---
I made a new unmodded camera right there in the overseers basement, got my film and he still won't give the quest.
---
The Chinese should have invested into punji boards.
---
And keep an eye out for the cranberry relish recipe! 10% xp bonus. Sugar/gourd are the other uncommon ingredients and both can be found in the same area as the cranberries.
---
Doesn‚Äôt eso have things like his? I heard that you can buy extra character slots.
---
On a game thats supposed to be about teaming up and cooperation, its f\*cking mindblowing there's no chat system and the voice chat is so fragmented because if a player is in a team you cannot hear them until THEY jump into settings

Maybe? Does that work?

More clothing customization

This link is great for identifying what objects in a plan will actually look like, in case you are trying to decide between two plans of similar nature.
---
Actually try out both guns on a behmoth u might find the AA crit does more dmg atm as the crit stat is bugged on heavy weapons, make sure you use the high firerate barrel. Certain stats with higher firerate weapons have had a weird dmg increaseing bug plus with the stabilised perk it shreds
---
And a clan system
---
Sorry, I misread that. Lol. Yeah, that would be lovely.
---
Emote is called "lets cook" in the atom shop.  Not to sure if it was vaulted or not.
---
Odds are said player was trying to be like "you salty bro?"  (At least thats how a few in my friends group use it)
---
I was helping a low level complete an event and he started eating the scorched corpses. Nasty.
---
Who needs a Chinese assault rifle when you have a board with potentially diseased nails
---
skin or not; the Fixer provides a stealth bonus. the combat rifle does not. so, different guns, and yup, we would purchase skins....
---
It‚Äôs was picked already. It happened when I was loading into the map.
---
Every day this is brought up. It'll be active until patch 21.
---
They wouldn‚Äôt do that because then we‚Äôd never go back to our camps
---
This has been known for a while.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs modded anymore. I think they fixed that.
---
Had a legendary card but it disappeared also.
---
angryturtle has a video on youtube for some optimizations. i removed the grass from my game which helped a lot, but i think the real reality is that it runs like poop for most of us with decent computers.
---
Hmmm, Haven‚Äôt seen any legendary cards
---
Weird, I use the carnivore mutation and still get the 5% xp boost from the cranberry cobbler.
---
She is not. But if you get I believe either Beckett or Sofia romances and you switch them out for her you still get the enhanced time on well rested.
---
Only becket and commander are romancable.
---
The other 3 settlers will give you a similar buff to lovers embrace though
---
Now now, you either get the stinging mag OR the pistol perks. 
---
Everyone knows pistols aren‚Äôt supposed to have armor piercing of any capacity in this game :)
---
Why would you want to? She's filthy and not filthy in a good way.
---
I have yet to see the wendigo colossus. Where is that event located at?
---
A multitude of perks just aren't working properly right now.  For me it's been Scattershot, Action boy, adrenaline, lone wolf, fireproof, luckybreak, and escape artist. They just work at random times temporarily. I'm on Xbox.  I have no doubt that there are other cards not working. And from Bethesda's recent post, they're fixing adrenaline in the next patch. But that's it when it comes to perk cards.
---
Start farming lead and steel. Then, get a first account so you can store it in mass quantities.
---
ok
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure they did that to increase the chances of selling scrap and repair kits.
---
yes
---
f*ck it, i‚Äôd rather take the perks
---
She's a hippie
---
As far as I know you can only have a ‚Äúromantic‚Äù relationship with Beckett and Sofia the astronaut.
---
Those are definitely duped lol
---
If you have tens of thousands of anything, be wary (especially rare things like maps)
---
Looks nice...my problem with my camp is I reached the lights limit
---
lol
---
What's the incentive? They've said repeatedly that there was far too little interest for it to be worth the expense in development time. At the end of the day, they're a business out to make money.
---
Dont go over 100k of any one item. You can have 10s of thousands of different ammo dont go over 100k. I have 50k 556 and 40k of 45 and 15k of u45. And with the maps just store what you can in your stash or across mules
---
Workshops are PvP too - you have to hang around them waiting for someone to stop by, but there is potential there.  I'm surprised players haven't organized events around those spaces.
---
That sucks, but it's sort of comforting to know that I'm not the only one.
---
I don't have anything running in the background, apart from Discord occasionally.
---
Same thing with ironclad and Berserker. Confused the hell out of me when my DR shot up all of a sudden.
---
No as I said different server loads. Like how you can load in between Adventure, Nuclear Winter and Private (you used to be able to do Survival as well) and you get an option to choose from for a variety of content. No matter what, when you first start out you have to start in West Virginia, but once you reach Level Milestones or whatever, you get to open up new load ins in the main screen. Not new games.
---
I got shot underwater today by another person underwater. Didn‚Äôt know that was a thing.
---
Thank you
---
Wouldn‚Äôt even waste my time with that crap. For multiple reasons. The easy ones? Is having that many treasure maps worth possibly getting in trouble? There‚Äôs only so much you can get from those maps anyway. You know the saying. If it‚Äôs to good to be true? It probably is.
---
Lucky hole mine. plenty of ore in there.  Resets after 24 hours
---
With Ammosmith you get 180 bullets, and if super duper kicks in you get 280
---
I run a 50 cal as well. 
---
My house is on an acid mine (10 acid per collection - use for lead ore processing and making gunpowder), i run the lucky hole mine for lead (around 800-900 scrap lead per time after processing the ore) and i run West Tek so i can scrap the guns for steel (also using the scrapper perk i get at least 600 steel per trip)
---
What are mules? And ok thank god. I was scared for a second. Cause he made the 10k ammo for both incredibly fast and it seemed a bit too quick. Plus idk how one would even have that much steel n crap to even get them much. Thank you
---
Not all of us are mutants. I am part of a BoS chapter where no one is mutated.

The best option would be waves of SM/robots/monsters from everywhere. And I dont mind if there is no reward  at all but please give me some hot survival VERY complicated gameplay bcz everything is soooo boring.
---
They said it was intended to be a bound item and not be crafted. They said the ability to craft it was a bug.
---
This happened to me the other day. Annoying for sure, but seems fairly rare though.
---
Yeah. Well I'll keep em
---
Thanks
---
You aren‚Äôt missing much. Don‚Äôt worry.
---
Ok, thanks maybe I just leave it to gather dust.
---
So I'm stuck with a level 15 one? Guess it's only novelty. At least I got one
---
I would at least be happy with some way of getting the confetti effect, I would use up a legendary effect spot just for it. Better yet, a mod that comes from some special event.
---
Ok I'll get rid of like all the maps, and keep like 5 or 6 of each to sell n stuff
---
I think i have rug plans in my vendor if you are on xbox i can pull them for you.
---
I should have mentioned I am lvl 63 but you guys helped a lot anyway
---
I want to say this is right. I also have no proof but remember reading something like that.
---
Wait until Meatweek. He'll be in one spot and you can buy all the plans you need
---
No it doesnt. It take 4-6 hours. Nothing in this game takes 28 hours to reset.
---
Okay so: 1, I'm not deaf and I personally enjoyed it. 2, they're still missing something that everyone else gets. It's not fair, and it's not right.
---
Lou
---
Wouldn‚Äôt mind it at all. Mostly because you run out of things to do pretty fast. Been playing since launch, have done pretty much everything in the game. Would be welcomed in my opinion. But of course, I‚Äôm probably the minority on that.
---
I figured this meant my XBOX? Which is 28 hours...
---
I was about to say the same thing. Dont make things any more half-assed than they already are. Some restrictions aren't making the game more challenging. More so needlessly annoying.
---
Agreed. One of the few things I'll just avoid because of how annoying they are to fight at higher levels
---
Ah that could be. I took it as the event. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇü§£
---
Maybe they had to take a dump? For real.
---
Stop doing Bethesda's job, you might give them ideas /s
---
I think some people share this one specifically to mess with the bloodied builds. Along the same lines of trap camps.
---
Not necessarily the 5mm, I‚Äôve had over 20k at one point just because the ammo machine makes more than I use.
---
Haha! Idk how long events take to reset. I‚Äôve never really paid attention to them.
---
Ever got attacked by a horde of cave crickets? üò®
---
It seriously is the most inadequate response. 
---
Why can‚Äôt we at least display the damn thing?
---
I've had people asking me for a radaway or disease cure with that emote.
---
I agree with everything except global chat. It‚Äôll just be a spam fest.
---
That‚Äôs why I said be wary. The maps absolutely are duped though.
---
Imposter takes 4-6 hours. Others vary. Usually my group just bounces between our private worlds and farm it that way.
---
Wow, it looks like you were right! It seems like I got a refund successfully for the error purchase and my Gma kept her sub from the right purchase. Nice :)
---
Which is cool. But I need the plans so I can finish my base lol
---
Let‚Äôs put it this way before ban wave I would have to server hop to fit my camp in server...now lol I hardly have that issue. Also forget about doing queen runs or encrypted‚Äôs half the server is like lvl25 and below.
---
What,like the entire game engine? No problem! They said they're looking into it!
---
But seriously though,it would be pretty rad.
---
Everything, anything that is a duplicate of something is.
---
What?
---
All I can say is you‚Äôll have to reset them up, Only thing I can think of. Not sure what to do about the legendary card
---
Yeah that‚Äôs pretty lazy on Bethesda‚Äôs part
---
I have 50k 5mm, since no one is buying it for 1 cap I'll be trashing it all.
---
Oh, nice. ü•∞
---
Air wookies are only on PC. They glitch out and travel over/under the map.
---
For any power armor I run the leg mods that give you more carrying capacity, just because heavy weapons are real heavy, any power armor mods that increase strength are good as well
---
Assaultron = easy XP.
---
A real challenge it's trying to sneak around Yao Guai with their super perception that sees straight through Chameleon and Chinese Stealth, and has a wicked melee stagger that embarrasses those not-so-scary Deathclaws.
---
Ammo is fine. 23k maps maybe not so much.
---
[removed]
---
I'm always amazed how people want to add more things to a game that can barely handle the physics its suppose to handle now.  Have you tried using the new ss jetpack (glorious nonetheless) in battle in special events?  You can reach pretty much lower orbit if you aren't careful.
---
Bethesda needs to prove it can handle what it tries to do now before giving them more challenges.
---
(Still love the game though)
---
I got six on an alt that I use for inspiration 3 that doesn't even have power armor. Held onto them hoping bethesda would be smart about  it. My hopes were in vain.
---
Because they finally caught on that people hold them accountable for what they say. They're not going to suggest they're going to fix something only to let it sit.
---
They haven't abandon the game by any means. But as long as they keep making money off of Fallout 76 to fuel other projects they have going on, they're not really going to jump at fixing much of anything unless it's a complete showstopper.
---
Just two cents out of what I've seen over the years.
---
This is what makes this community great, I played during beta so this wasn't really an option but the next best thing was leveling and doing quests with friends, showing each other where to find screws or adhesive or whatever
---
Awesome, are you playing tonight? 
---
Whenever is fine, this thing has been sitting in my inventory for a long time a few more days won't hurt it. I think I can make a new posting and get enough people from Reddit there to have a successful event.
---
It's probably the same people who gave it a bad review after playing it for 1057 hours.
---
Many drops take a few minutes to appear, that's assuming the cargo drone hasn't been shot down by some trigger happy dingo.
---
How can Modus be real if our eyes aren‚Äôt real?
---
Oh wow, honestly that would be dope! I could use the plan to build some non-Legendary versions for my brother as well.
---
Edit: I won't be on for a few hours tho -- gotta get some dinner &amp; do some stuff  first.
---
Again, you're asking them to create the equivalent of entire new games.
---
In all likelihood it'll be on the Atom Shop during Christmas time this year for around 300-400 Atoms. That's my guess at least.
---
I am just now realizing that the legacy aae gatling plasma some guy just gave me might not be legit.....
---
I think some of the cannibal clan use it to communicate as well, like their version of a secret handshake...üòâ
---
I've recently switched from full health rifleman to bloodied commando. Personally I think commando is way more fun, you can still tap the trigger to one shot weaker enemies, hold for a 3 round burst or something like the Queen hold the trigger and unleash. And bloodied I'm enjoying far more than I ever thought I would as I used to always think of hate it managing low health but I'm probably getting killed just as much as I did when I had vanguard. Hardest thing oddly can sometimes be getting more rads after getting revived.
---
I want that paint so bad but have had the opposite experience, barely touching NW except for SCORE. Some day that gold vault boy will be mine...
---
Are you going to use it or are you going to be selling it. I wouldn't go over 100k
---
I just DM‚Äôd ya!
---
Oh but they will recolor it into a candy cane, so it's totally worth it.........
---
One perk card that sometimes goes unnoticed is Power User. Works with weapons like Gatling Laser, doubling the amount of ammo per fusion core. Stabilized is another must have under Intelligence.
---
Mules are you 2nd or 3rd characters that you can bring in to put items on
---
Cazadores.  Those things frighten me more than any deathclaw.  Fast, small, and packs one deadly punch.
---
Nah, I like how it is right now, feel like text chat tends to be more toxic in games 
---
Would prefer something like a mail system between players terminals if anything
---
I'm not deaf but I do have frequent tinnitus. I have a decent gaming headset so that helps focus the sound. I can't have things too quiet (reasons). As for making a game where deaf/hard of hearing can enjoy.....that's more time and labor among implementing that into a game.
---
When you want to talk to a person but they're in a team so you need to make up some weird sign language out of emotes.
---
come on, it isnt hard. AREA TEXT CHAT
---
Or make it included as part of a full Power Armor skin that makes you into mecha-Santa. I'd actually get that ngl.
---
I suggest visiting other peoples shops. Look at their prices. Especially close to whitespring or top of the world.
---
Okay that would be worth it
---
Lol downvoted by fanboys that cant accept people disliking bugs. Thats sad for gaming.
---
Just so you downvoters know. Its people like you thats the reason we still have the fast travel bug weeks later.
---
Sad as fuck.
---
This. For anyone who doesn't know, you can stack 2 of the support beams in the "stairs" category together, blueprint them, and it'll let you place them anywhere. You can use both sizes and remove the top or bottom beam after placing, but you won't be able to move them afterwards.
---
It's worth spending some time ranking during double XP for sure if you want that paint. It and Pink Sprinkles are by far the 2 best ones imo, nothing in the shop even comes close.
---
I been wearing it with t-65. It doesn't seem to make much difference and it looks better.
---
Should have asked "don't you know how this quest works? Just how old are you? '
---
And when the foolish one says" I'm 12 and better at the game than you, old man" report them to Xbox as it's an 18 rated game.
---
...im not the vengeful type, but some of the idiots online deserve a little of their own medicine.
---
Yes! Had to leave a great team because of this. Tried asking thw new guy to swap it, but some people do it to mess with others... I was sharing all kills and never even came across there path so idk why.
---
This is literally the worse thing you can do to a bloodied melee player, I had all my XP buffs including 4 lunchboxes waisting away because I became severely overencumbered when my rads where wiped clean. The slow crawl back lead to a whole other venture of misfortunes and much waisted time.
---
So much of my armor needed repair since having no AP meant crawling while eating gunfire from swarms of enemies while shaking me melee weapon in the air uselessly. Of course after all this I was out of ballistic fiber so I had to further delay and go farm some. 
---
A great team leader will kick sunkissed sharers when the team has bloodied builds on it, or they will be stuck with the troll.
---
(Because it's not clear enough for some, this is aimed at people who straight up do it to be mean such as the guy on my team who straight up told me so, hence the "get stuck with the troll", most players are considerate enough to change it upon request or I just leave as stated prior).
---
Thats the new excuse for shitty pvp nerds. It happened to me today because I was using a Junkie's Gauntlet and one shot a bloodied player who couldn't activate a srealth boy in time.
---
It can be toxic yes, but it's more worth having it than not having it. Makes some situations extremely tedious. There is precautions they could take to make it less toxic.
---
My whole family is deaf and I've got tinnitus from Active Duty. It's lazy, insensitive, and - again - wrong. Running subtitles is easy, and it's already all over the game.
---
Edit: they're deaf, not dead.
---
How are you supposed to communicate with people in the world when theyre in team chat and you are in area. Supposed to lead them to a terminal? get real
---
Mines underground as well. Likely will be fine. If im banned, ill let you know though, haha.
---
Sounds about my luck. I've made probably 20 Plasma Casters and haven't gotten a single Junkies one yet.
---
It's only good for pvp because it ignores the damage cap
---
That's what I did until I got the helmet. Can you mod the helmet? I haven't tried
---
There's a cliff camp spot near the vault just up the hill from the Gorge Junkyard that has copper and iron within the same camp radius. It's good to know where the handful of those are, and you can find videos on the rest on YouTube. The rest are in more dangerous areas.
---
Was it a challenge you may remember completing before? Sometimes the GUI forgets it was completed and displays the reward banner but the back-end server does actually remember and doesn‚Äôt issue said reward. 
---
This happens quite often for myself especially the first few minutes after login or around times of high server stress like a Nuke event.
---
It‚Äôll become a spam fest of 
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm new I need help‚Äù 
---
‚ÄúHaha ez clap git gud‚Äù 
---
‚ÄúGive me back my junk I‚Äôll report you!!‚Äù
---
‚ÄúAnyone want to team?‚Äù 
---
‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt the Queen give me loot??‚Äù
---
Yeah really disappointed being I got 2 of them this year and they won‚Äôt ever be worth anything. I thought I was lucky being I didn‚Äôt get a single drop of the three rare ones and I got this one but it‚Äôs just junk
---
I don't get why they're non tradeable, or level locked
---
I built for Junkie's after finding a J25 10mm SMG in someone's vendor for like 1500 caps, which pretty much instantly replaced my previous F25. I already wanted to go for Junkie's before that, but now that I have, that thing has almost entirely replaced my Handmade as my go-to. I have a feeling it's going to be a very long time until I find a J25 Handmade.
---
No mods but the light works
---
More of a thomas bc of the gentleman
---
U on Xbox? I‚Äôll be happy to take so of that off of ya
---
That‚Äôs fine i can give it to you tomorrow
---
Go to nukacrypt.com for the codes.  Try to hack all level 3 computers to turn off turrets.
---
It was an exaggeration but the number is high. It‚Äôs at least 25,000 people.
---
Happy cake day, homie! :D
---
Thanks, I know there were a million better ways to handle this... just frustration.
---
For future reference, in any game sub/forum first post what platform you are on. That way those who are also on it can help better than the rest. I'm on PC.    
---
 What sort of perks and specials to go for?  - It's not that simple. You can Google "Fallout 76 builds" and get examples. The Nukes and Dragons site is essential for NOT screwing up your character. There are some basic things know as each build is mostly subjective and you're free to follow them to a good degree.    
---
Focus on damage and playstyle. 99% of enemies have a ranged attack. I'm no fan of Melee only builds. My main is level 81 and is a Stealth/Chameleon(gear)/Sniper. I love it.    
---
Endurance is filled with ease of life perks.    
---
You can't save up Perk points b/c new perks won't show up until you start leveling in your Special. The Nukes and Dragons has a level by level suggestion near the bottom after you've made your build. I can make a sample on if you PM me about how you want to play and what weapons/gear you prefer.    
---
Of course. However, most quests that net better 'stuff' is rewarded by level. Every 5 from 1, 5, 10 etc. or 15, 25, 35, 45. If you want, look up that quest's rewards and if it includes a random weapon/armor, get to that next multiple of 5.    
---
You can always have someone craft for you but it too is leveled and you can't add legendary effects. At your level, Leader of the Pack is a good one for lower char's that's in the Forest. It's time and I would get as many points of interest around the Tyler County Dirt Track as possible.    
---
Every so often, upload one of those U.S. Government Supply Requisition tapes. Free stuff is a good bonus early on. Scrap, craft, or sell. Please, just PM me and I can elaborate more.
---
U on Xbox? I‚Äôll be happy to take some of that off of u
---
If todd is in a good mood lol
---
its beth can not expect much from them
---
Did they announce a exact date that one wasteland will come out on?
---
Some people are genuinely trying to help with medic builds in the same way you see it in any other mmo and I keep seeing these same complaints - I don't see why they deserve to be on a team less than a bloodied build player especially if they're actually helping anyone not running bloodied. Min maxing like that is supposed to be risk vs reward, just think of it as one more risk
---
If anything, those maps will get you banned. 23k is just way beyond normal. It‚Äôs a bot that scans accounts and flags them under certain situations. After that your account is suspended pending investigation. If your account was investigated, pretty obvious what would happen
---
Wow that had to have been frustrating to build. Awesome job
---
Thank you!  I didn't even realize that it was my cake day.
---
Yes, I have 4 mutations from serums
---
The ammo might not be duped. I‚Äôve never duped and just from the last week alone I have 6k 5mm ammo. That shit is so easy to get. If you one shot most of the super mutants that have mini guns you‚Äôre guaranteed 100 but I‚Äôve gotten 500 from a bunch also. And some people craft and save or never even use most ammo. When I was using just my bloodied death claw and axe I had 10k of almost all ammo until I switched to bloodied rifles
---
One day I hope. But they can't even get this one working at the moment.
---
https://discord.gg/DhaxcG
---
If it expires before you see this, let me know. ü§ó
---
Yup
---
The bear arms perk card is goid to reduce heavry weapon weight.
---
Still would, just wouldnt need to head to a bench. I almost never go to my camp for a bench.
---
That's on BGS then.  
---
I'm disabled (not severely) from Army service. I've dealt with it for so long. I can drive, work, and do most things with my hands in careful detail but at times they go all wonky. It happens when I write and more when I play games either on PC or PS4. It's not enough to put me off but at times it can be very annoying.
---
Was a exact date announced for when meat week starts? Also wtf is "meat week"
---
Settler wanderer also gives an xp bonus on well rested extending it to 3 hours "kindred spirit"
---
It‚Äôs so discouraging lmao. I‚Äôve been trying to get a left leg for weeks now but I took a break to roll a right leg this week and finally got one so now I‚Äôm back at trying to get a left leg üòî
---
The event isn't live yet, but it has a chance to spawn at a few locations if nuked. Only one I know of for sure is the Sparse Sundew Grove.
---
They are actually stripping every aspect of survival in this game away. They are removing the variety of levels in favour of level scaling. They are removing the debuffs of food and water. Honestly it‚Äôs becoming an adventure game at this point. 
---
I recommend doing what I do. Download ark off gamepass when you want a real survival experience with pvp. Rust is also good for this. 76 isn‚Äôt a true survival game anymore
---
So I hear u like helping new players out...I started last week but I‚Äôm lvl 30 because my friend helped me grind xp, since I‚Äôm not as new of a player as others I‚Äôm willing to spend some caps to get some ammo and plans off of u
---
Are you able to attach floors to them? I'd love to build a kind of raider tree fort using some kind of exploit like this.
---
I‚Äôll DM you.
---
The scenery looks great, some of the towns are a bit lazily done though.
---
I put her in the red dress and immediately got rid of her. I couldn‚Äôt believe how dirty she was.
---
Thank you! I was wondering what those modules were for.
---
I did this, [but I used the terrain trick to hide the grate on the bottom as much as possible](https://i.imgur.com/HptfY28.png). I couldn't get it any further in without the ladle also clipping, though.
---
Why would he write that long ass post if he knew he did something wrong. You'd have to be 2 nuts short of a basket case to write all that, clearly outlining innocence, just looking for a little validation... but instead he actually knowingly did something blatantly wrong. Reality is MANY people have a similar story... wouldn't it be more likely that these thousands of banned players were banned by a faulty script? Hence the need for review? Not to mention their reputation for buggy shit. You think Bethesda hand reviewed every account then sent the "will review later" for shits and giggles?
---
Ok, thank you
---
Also fix the learn rate from the mods!
---
Nah you‚Äôll be fine. It‚Äôs not as if people can raid your base or something and you‚Äôre hiding in the mesh to stop them.
---
With mics
---
thank god i farm xp on my private server.... it is good strategy though. sharing em on public server and go to ur private server.
---
Wanna get on tomorrow? I am not sure if your comment was sarcasm or not bc of my rant, lol.
---
If 5+ get popped you lose the exp buff until the effect wears off.
---
God I remember the old days of Xbox live. We had I think 4 different settings you you could pick from.
---
It was like safe mode - for kids, no chat or voice messages apart from between friends
---
Up to underground - expect trash talk, profanity, anything goes kind of thing. 
---
So if you didn't like swearing or abuse, you could avoid playing with those kind of players. If you were an actual adult and knew it was just words, you could play with everyone and swear all you wanted!
---
Everything is pussyfied these days.
---
Edit: https://xbox.fandom.com/wiki/Gamer_Zones
---
I wish we had the .45 pistol from New Vegas instead. A Light Shining In Darkness skin option for easy atoms too, Bethesda!
---
Just fought me first one. Super underwhelming... kind of expected it to be about 3x the size
---
Wonderful !!
---
One more less obvious combo, Tesla Coils (chest mod) with Suppressor and/or Tenderizer. These perk cards will work when Tesla Coils hit enemies, for full health builds this is one of my all time favorites.
---
What platform are you on?
---
you mean more than 5 lunchboxes?
---
Nah, not a plan. But have the lunch box as a reward for difficult events, or maybe an ally reward from one of beckett/commanders dailys.
---
If it were crafable people will accumulate too many.
---
They‚Äôre the same thing. Serums just give you that particular mutation
---
If I learned anything from the military.... first name is always pvt
---
After 3 times, that's the only dialogue I get.
---
Yup 5 lunchboxes, i had it happen to me at a queen 2 days ago,  like 8 people popped them and everyone lost thier bonus exp
---
Give us Pipers great great grandma
---
I have one unyielding leg but I have struck out so far on the arms, very disappointing. There should be some way to buy a better chance with scrip or something. Or select the primary effect.
---
If they are close to wayward they could be helping new players.
---
Because they're low level and have nothing else to sell. Or maybe they're selling stuff for other people to scrap for mods, it's not a bad option if the price is real low.
---
You should just be able to breakdown/scrap a vanilla weapon anywhere in the world through the pip boy menu.
---
In the older games you could repair a weapon through the pip boy, so I don't see why not.
---
Edit: maybe the scrapper perk could add this effect. Like having the perk adds a tool kit that allows you to scrap anywhere anytime.
---
Lmao!
---
Bloodied Faster fire rate faster reload .50 cal. Complete ripper man. traded a two star set of Unyielding AP combat for it.
---
I don't even bother worth that anymore, just waiting for that magic purveyor roll someday.
---
And get rubber from Grafton gym. Mix with the glass you should already have tons of, and you can make marine recon helmets to sell for your daily 1400
---
I remember having a similar issue in a quest in Fallout 4, there was an overlay or menu or something that meant i couldn't read the subtitles.
---
They never fixed it (though fortunately there was a work around for that one)
---
Simply put, they don't care.
---
I drop chems. Gotta give ‚Äòem their first taste for free.
---
Correct, you have to read the terminal to get the evidence.  Terminal has password.  Password in the diary.  Reading the diary SHOULD give password, bug is that it doesn't.
---
Whoever has the mask is PVP active against anyone else in the school
---
Some folks don‚Äôt know the nuances of effective vendor strategies. Some folks use it to incite interest.
---
You‚Äôll want to run some damage perks if you‚Äôre gonna go full health and no Junkies. Max out the heavy weapons cards, use stabilized for sure for the armor pen, toss in bloody mess and a rank of tenderizer too. Adrenaline would be great too if it worked.
---
No sorry, pc
---
If you haven't already buy the two plans for secret service under armor and shielded underarmor. The benefits are really great including four strength.
---
Rip, ok
---
good to know my dude, glad we both got what we wanted :)  
---
without your help i surely couldn't realize what i need to do to solve this! ty!!
---
Oh cmon, you dont want the NEW 900 Atom Cap-Bag???
---
It removes the weight of caps and has no size limit!
---
My camp is built very close to the wayward and directly on the road lower levels often take to Morgantown airport and I often have some lower level modded guns for a couple caps for them to buy . But I also typically have multiple legendarys also for sale
---
https://xbox.fandom.com/wiki/Gamer_Zones
---
Humans used metal coins for thousands of years.
---
Caps arent so bad, theyre fairly light.
---
Not for you.
---
Every time I open my map it displays as 720, but as soon as i open the atom shop it reverts to 10.
---
And there isn‚Äôt any nukes on my server so idk.
---
Its been stuck for about a day now, and I know that I completed some challenges cause i just switched to pc.
---
no we have a limited trade screen.  
---
The current trade screen only trades items for caps. No items for items.  
---
If I want to trade a Fasnacht Mask for bullets, I have to put a 0 caps price tag on the mask and the other player needs to tag the bullets for 0 caps aswell.  
---
Hence people drop stuff when trading items for items.
---
As a Hoosier myself, it would very interesting to see Post-War Indiana. Heck, maybe even find my house in the game if it‚Äôs not covered in rubble or has a random Super-Duper Mart over it. However, FO76 already has the biggest map Bethesda ever made and it still doesn‚Äôt run as well. It would be interesting in the future if they could finally move away from the east coast a little bit, I think we already got the point that founding fathers were a thing.
---
Thats why i dont play anything on pc anymore.
---
just power armored boy scouts who want all the shiny stuff
---
Doesn't stack as they're the same thing, however using the appropriate serum negates the negative aspects of a mutation for an hour (not worth imo, but the option is there)
---
What‚Äôs another name for Caesar‚Äôs wire? A roman cable. (Just funning ya. Carry on. üôÇ)
---
You're right. Whether or not they don't, I'm soap-boxin'. S'gotta be said.
---
If you mean get 3 marsupial bonuses by taking the serum three times, then no. The serum will simply negate the negative effects, and taking another will just reset the timer
---
Or agree on a price and buy it then have him sell it back 
---
The game doesn‚Äôt encourage trade for trade on items it a vendor trade system
---
Idk the exact date but meat week is another limited time event like fasnacht
---
The event doesn't have good enough rewards honestly. 1-2 legendary drops is about all it offers, I can get that in one run through of West Tek. 
---
 I solo it every once in a while, but overall its a worthless event.
---
I reckon if they did that they would have to make it so that if you scrap it in your inventory you get less resources than doing it at a bench
---
It only snaps to the prefab.
---
What rewards does it give?
---
Try deleting all your ‚Äúsaved‚Äù items all the way to the left if you haven‚Äôt? Just re-did my camp today and didn‚Äôt have a problem
---
HA! yeah. I gave her a nice clean pink asylum outfit and i was horrified. HORRIFIED! Dirty tramp.
---
I've noticed a bug since they changed the workshop icons... It no longer tells you when it's owned by a player!
---
Yeah that would work, you still could scrap to learn mods, but lose out on 50% of the materials.
---
Wow. I think I‚Äôd be recreation for Overwatch and Underground for 76.
---
Are you looking for one? The plan for one? Or asking what's the best use of the weapon?
---
I have no saved items. I just checked the stored tab and there's nothing.
---
Either is fine
---
Some themed flag and weapon plans and a bloodied chef outfit and hat and grill masters outfit and hat. Idk exactly what this year's is rewarding tho
---
Efficient
---
Nope.  I had to google it lol.
---
oh noes. my 14 caps i paid to travel there!111!!!!1!
---
the roadmap does say "new companions", and i assumed that was referring to allies.
---
then again, i kind of just assume nothing they announce is set in stone anyway so
---
What system are you on?
---
Nice.
---
I see that this thread was from a few months ago. Do we have anything definitive on eagle eyes with legendary trait?
---
In the settler tent there‚Äôs a small table with screws, a wrench etc and I often times wish I could just scrap stuff on it lmao
---
Bear arms, stabilized, and one gun army are must haves. Get the Final Word from Beckets quest. Grab dodgy and action boy, that's all you really need in agility. If you plan on using gauss minigun or any energy weapons or holding a lot of cores I would recommend batteries included. Pain train rank one let's you sprint out of sticky situations.
---
Totally, would love the idea if there wasn‚Äôt a ban hammer already swinging looking for a target üò•
---
58 isn't crazy if you think about it.  bethesda has shown they will put rarity weighting on certain items they consider superior.  dont give up!
---
Caps are also in limited supply and notoriously hard to forge according to NV. Ideal for maintaining a stable value and low inflation.
---
Yikes! I'm on PC, and the process takes like 2 seconds with the perk card loadout mod.
---
Most likely wont be banned for it. Much like no one was banned for the previous faction exploits
---
Report it, ignore it or take advantage of it. Your choice
---
you can stack mutations 
---
serums give you mutations 
---
so yes
---
Yeah Bethesda don't care about bugs that harm players, only hotfixing ones that help us!
---
Same here! I just hope this guy that was harassing me a few months ago lost his account. He didn't make it to my vending machine first and went off on a 5 minute rant about "I'm a dup-ahhh (english accent), do you understand me?!?!" Insulting me because I actually wanted caps instead of trading, etc. That is seriously the next thing Bethesda should fix is the trade system, it's completely set up for scammers and they've done nothing about it.
---
since you made the switch, how does your damage per shot compare, bloodied commando vs normal rifleman?
---
What if I want the PvP?
---
Geez I get 10,000+ caps fairly regularly from selling junk scraps to other players. I‚Äôm surprised how many people buy 700 steel when it‚Äôs so easy to come by
---
Only snaps on the garage. And for me it always spawn closed when in fact it's open, so I'm not even using it ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
The rewards, XP, and notes are always beneficial
---
But, I get ya. Do with it what you will fellow dweller
---
Ps4
---
No PS4
---
Seems to be bugged after patch 20. I did it fine before that but on another character it just doesn't work as before. I've seen other people also say it's not working for them either
---
Cant help you then mate, sorry
---
I agree with Spidertrax and LadySavastano.  When I first heard of FO76, I really wanted to play it because I am from West Virginia, but I did not want to play a multi-player game, especially with PvP in it, because of previous bad experiences in other games.  I just started playing FO76 in January, because I happened to see something online about the FO 1st option.  I probably played for six to eight weeks by myself, on private servers, before I finally decided to try visiting the public servers.  It turned out the public servers were nothing like what I had read and imagined, and I have never had a bad experience there.  However, it is still nicer for me to play on private servers most of the time, because I am much more used to playing solo games.  Like LadySavastano, I just visit the public servers once in a while, to get rid of excess stuff through the vending machines, to help out new players I run into, and to do events like the SBQ event.  If you can afford it, then I strongly recommend just giving FO 1st a chance for one month, before you decide to quit completely.  The biggest benefit is if you use FO 1st for a month, then cancel the subscription, the extra scrap you load into your scrap box during that month will still be there for you to use, but you just won't be able to add more back into it, if you are not an active FO 1st member.
---
Yep, the 300something had the mask
---
whitesprings. for any and every level it's a good xp spot. make sure you're always always always ALWAYS, in a building team as well
---
Its cool no worries
---
This is a known bug though from latest hotfix. Many people are not getting atoms after completion of challenges and the atoms just show up a random number.
---
Yup. And daily's are super easy. Most are literally 
---
1.pick up item.
---
2. Some weird middle step.
---
3.give/ deposit item.
---
I think if you were doing this repeatedly and maxed the rep within the first week, maybe you would get a ban.
---
But not sure how this would lead to a ban now as everyone has had time to hit max rep. I'd say just go for it, how are you to know when it's right/safe to do the daily?
---
Just couple days ago gifted j25 handmade(lvl15) to a low level player
---
Hold up. I thought one of the whole points of the Legendary Perk system was that it was account wide. I have 20 characters that I play across 4 accounts. But each account has one that I've been grinding towards 300 in preparation of Legendary Perks to share with the others on the account.
---
I had specifically planned to get to +5 SPECIAL in a couple so that my other characters were significant boosted.
---
Is this not how it works?
---
If you‚Äôre on PS4 I can teach you how to speed run it‚Äôll take like 10mins for a silo
---
Damn if only i could've read your message earlier, i just saw him in Fort Defiance after finishing Line in the Sand.
---
If you ever need help.  I'll assist you.
---
You have to find the item in your misc section and delete it , but I highly doubt this will get you banned or reported
---
It seems to average about 4-5 scrip per daily.
---
Night and day. I'm staying in nerd range unless I'm taking a pylon in encryptid or gathering ore at radiation rumble. But but I'll run through westek and one shot the super mutants so I can collect more ammo than I use. If doing an event and sharing the xp it's easy as switching weapon or taking some radaway so you don't kill things as easily. My old fill health Rifle man took time to kill a scorchbeast but with my bloodied commando I just vats, hold down the trigger and with concentrated fire the hit chance goes up to where I can miss bullets but still take down a close beast in one mag. The unyielding buffs to stealth allows me more sneak attack on the Queen and the intelligence boost has me levelling up faster than I ever did before.
---
The imposter is the only strong one. Now Mirelurk Kings, that‚Äôs another story
---
No, but I did think Julie (the DJ) was the same voice actress as Rose until I read that they were 2 different people üò¨üòÖ
---
Yeah Ik thx tho
---
I dont understand how that's fun I could maybe understand an adventure player just camping to get rewards but cheating like that is super weak
---
Is there a way to fix this or do I have to wait till they fix the issue in a patch ?
---
hmm. well i guess that makes the decision easy lol. thanks for the help
---
Heart of the enemy, raider and settler, photo of opportunity give 8
---
Queen of the hunt gives 7
---
Same happened to me. I still have that stupid battery pack in my inventory. Not my fault I killed a random raider and picked this up. And, I already hit ally anyway. Still auto completes every day after talking to ward. So? Hassle free bullion notes? I guess?
---
Nope. If your best character is lvl 300 then there is no more benefits since the only worthwhile thing is giving more slots based on your highest character lvl. So in reality having many characters that equal to let‚Äôs say lvl 500 (100 lvls each) will net you only the bonus having your main as a lvl 100. So if you spread your levels within characters instead of grinding on one then rip.
---
That's for all allies, difference is in named ones (and romanced) gives the lover's embrace but it's the same buff.
---
For the first and second idk but for the 3rd pa only uses regular fusion cores
---
It‚Äôs worse on final fantasy online
---
What system are you on and what level? I get to play 2 nights a week because I have a family and work full time, so I know the grind. But I can help you make a ghost build, that will serve you well if you dont like big guns
---
someone get this man a nuke asap
---
Sorry don't got those ones. I did get bird bones naturally tho lol. Brahmin milk takes rads away without taking away mutations.
---
So I‚Äôd need to carry both Ultracite and normal F. Cores to use a prime laser Gatling in power armor?
---
That‚Äôs where I look for after fighting SBQ, provided it‚Äôs in the blast zone and it usually is.
---
i thought intelligence doesnt affect xp?
---
I'd say one thing to remember when going bloodied, grab toxic goo at westek. Any time you go down and get revived or die and respawn you lose rads which takes you out of nerd rage. As a full health build I was always trying to avoid all rads but now I find I'm chasing sources of rads during events
---
intelligence has a flat bonus to your gained XP with each point in to it
---
Barbarian
---
You could try sending a ticket to bethesda and showing pictures of it. Sadly, in my case and many others they are just providing the same copy paste answer regarding SCORE even if you don't mention it. So either send the ticket and wait for "something" or just wait for bethesda to actually address the bug.
---
‚ÄúWe are  SO the baddest gang in the Wastes!‚Äù
---
- Butch
---
Yes
---
When was the last time you played? There were budget bugs fixed, but it's been a couple weeks. They were easy to do without knowing so a lot of people were over budget.
---
It's it's recent I have no idea other than to say you may have still been doing a budget glitch without knowing and now it's back to normal for whatever reason.
---
They buffed it and is bullet sponge.  It‚Äôs acid spit can sneak up and get you.  Getting it out in the open is funner.  It‚Äôs Wendigo spawn drop screws which is never a bad thing.  Overall it‚Äôs fun with a group as an extra after SBQ.
---
Thanks for the quick info on at least one of my question. Though dang, that sucks that I have to carry more stuff.
---
So much worse than duping, but no Bethesda only care about duping....
---
You can get the plans from the Phoenix vendor but I belive.thats the vendor in watoga if it's not that one it could be the vendor but in the burrows
---
Eh people will just switch servers to not deal with it
---
Was it? At least bloodied and junkies requires some semblance of strategy and planning by the player. TSE was just an easy button.
---
For the low cost of your firstborn child
---
I love my SMG. It deletes 10mm ammo like nothing else.
---
HAHA! Risks and rewards are built into the game mechanics, not established by players who dont know how to be a good medic. Obviously they deserve to be on a team, however destroying one or more of your most fragile teammates means your a crappy medic. If your a real medic there are better cards for sharing such as making stimpacks more potent, autostim, etc.. Sharing sunkissed is ideal for niche scenarios else your wasting potential. Radaway and decon arches are all over.  Sharing it constantly does little to nothing on average.
---
Ruining other peoples builds for no reason is just rude, it's not like they gain anything personally from sharing the perk.
---
I and my friends always just treat it as a normal co-op event, taking turns on who gets the mask!
---
Dropping as a reward will work too!
---
(Bethesda Reads this)
---
Bethesda: "you got it!"
---
Plan: Lunchbox
---
required materials: 5 lunchboxes, 2 steel, 2 Adhesive, 5 plastic, 14 stable Cobalt Flux
---
Not everyone is always looking. AFK much?
---
Ah ok. Thanks. Do you know the difference between them besides the color of the laser? I can make normal ones so I just wanted to know if there is any benefit to the Ultracite.
---
Also for plans just gotta scrap them to get the plans have no idea about differences
---
Who made you fuhrer of the anti-fun police?
---
They had posted it on a fallout 76 xbox group on FB. I'm sure it has to do with the newest update since it has not been heard of like at all on xbox. Someone said in the comments they got it from project paradise. So if the Thirst Zapper has been in game for PC and the game has the ammo then I'm assuming eventually we will gain access to it? That's my main question .. is the Thirst Zapper going to be an available item? Great troll weapon for thirsty boys
---
I think its purely random. I do that event at different times in my day and I get Eugenie and Kieran more times than any of the others. It may be cooincidence but my money is on random
---
I came back not too long ago.  What is the deal with lunchbox openings?  Why would you save them or open them with other people?
---
Go online for PVP, under the current setup.
---
.
---
Not saying one or the other is better, just that it‚Äôs my opinion it‚Äôs odd a pve mechanic (defending workshops from npcs for scrap) creates a pvp interaction between players. 
---
Private worlds are a good step in this direction, and they‚Äôve said it‚Äôs upcoming that workshop permanence in private worlds will happen, but I would love to see workshops being 100% pve and wayyyy more focused on cleverly defending your workshop from 7dtd style blood moons (and getting rewarded for it! More WS budget materials per wave?). I think the current pvp hunter mechanic is really swell and is the other end of this spectrum to balance this out. 
---
Or I dunno, make WS default pve unless you build a radio tower/symbolic item, which enables pvp and puts your workshop on other players maps, while rewarding you high risk/high reward style.
---
Edgelord.
---
UGL drops extremely rarely from scorchbeasts. I think only from level 80 ones. For reference, I have seen it drop twice across over a thousand hours and many hundreds of scorchbeasts killed. The plans can be obtained from cranberry bog events and a few others like powering up power plants. The drop rate in all of those is ~0.1% so don't hope on it, used to be the white whale that people grinded months for. You can now get it from riding shotgun, and I believe the drop rate is much higher from there. They dropped from the duped christmas gifts, which is where the majority of current plans exist from. They used to sell for 12-20k caps before those gifts, now people are handing them out for free
---
It has a black paint job, fires green lasers (except it's bugged and using the beam focuser turns them back to red), has a slightly higher fire rate, and I think also deals a bit more damage. Iirc the ultracite gatling laser is a straight upgrade, while the ultracite laser rifle is a trade-off. It's treated as a separate weapon, so you need to learn the plans by scrapping them, and it's a real pain. I needed 18 or so scraps to learn the final plan
---
You used to be able to use ultracite fusion cores in power armor, but that got patched out fairly recently. Right now their only purpose is in either a gatling laser or ultracite gatling laser with a prime receiver
---
Let me try something...
---
(throws rock at sun, misses sun)
---
damn synths
---
Chinese stealth suit the whole thing you won't have to kill much. Make sure you got a lock pick LVL 3. You can get through it quick that way.
---
Too each is their own.
---
Even if they did get into it by some cheat engine they would of most likely gotten banned and the items taken from inventory correct?
---
You just join another public team or make your own. It's not that deep, fam!
---
Roughly 2% extra XP per point of intelligence.
---
Lol, that would be just like mgmt for them to do that.  Smh.  They can mess up a wet dream.
---
 Although I agree with the reasoning behind it, it is their camp and their vending machines. 
---
They could sell 30 propaganda posters at 1k a pop and it's still no skin off my nuts. I'm out a few caps..boo-hoo.
---
You can trade it but it can't be dupped cause it cannot be sold to a vending machine. The scrip machine makes it tradeable.
---
not really sure myself.  3rd quarter I thought.  Could be wrong.
---
More likely than not hearing a nuke announcement will make then look over to see where it's at unless they have sound off or not wearing their headphones
---
Outstanding, soldier.
---
More like, 200 atoms each or 1500 atoms for 10.
---
Who cares, duped items are part of the meta. Diablo 2 flourished off of this. It's not like you can go around killing other players with it. You stand to lose nothing vs these people. Stop trying to be such a hard ass. These same old shit posts in responses to these people who have lost real world time and invested lives gets real fucking old... it's literally a fucking sadness post and you f'ers troll all over them. Like you never broke a "rule". Bet you've got a speeding ticket. Hope you sweat your ass off over every penny and got the full brunt of the law when you did too.
---
When I built the house and majorly played was the start of wastelanders. Played a little bit when the Faschat event came back, and now I started playing again. I've been on and off with the game basically.
---
Edit: My friend also built his house at the same time I built mine, he went to budget limit, and was able to scrap some stuff and his budget did go down.
---
The Stabalized perk is pretty good, it gives more accuracy to heavy guns while in power armory, it‚Äôs in intelligence
---
Sylvanwhisper I'm sure that that would only happen .010 percent of the  time..none the less I have hundreds of hours and only dropped my 2nd nuke a few days ago.if your on xbox I'd be glad to host a private server just so you could drop a nuke..try not to sweat it.i know a lot of ammo stims and time went into that.its not cool what happend
---
omg... i really dont undestand when i post something really usefull to help u out and no one says a word and these topics got upvoted.. I really dont give a sh!t about karma but what is wrong with this community?!
---
Riding shotgun seems to have the highest drop rate for the plan, in terms of using it it's pretty eh. Just a slight upgrade over the regular gatling laser, it's a good weapon with the right legendary effects but so is anything
---
People are too sensitive.
---
so it‚Äôs confirmed that it **only** snaps to the red rocket building? 
---
and yeah a lot of doors appear to be closed but it‚Äôs actually open and you have to open to door again
---
I had this guy yesterday using aimbot on a 100shot/sec crossbow (no reload). 
---
Luckily I recorded the session.
---
That one too.
---
Scribe Helen and Knight Russ?
---
Saw one guy on Xbox get hit (was dead on his camp with him afk inside) earlier today
---
I think it‚Äôs mildly immersion breaking to stop your questing to defend a workshop, succeed, and then defend it 6-7 more times *from the same person seeking revenge*
---
I mean, you‚Äôre dead. If a player attempts a WS steal and fails they shouldn‚Äôt jesus back over and over and siege you.
---
Ah. Thanks for the detailed info. Yeah I got an Ultracite laser pistol from the preveyor but all I read was slightly increased fire rate and green laser. 
---
I take it to get mods for the normal Gatling laser is to just scrap them? (All I have is the one that ups damage but lowers fire rate to like 38) 
---
And you‚Äôre saying if I am going to use a Gatling laser grind for the Ultracite one?
---
The game is only improving for me, the fast travel bug is the only one I've encountered, other than one where I died and when it would tell me to respawn it would just teleport me to that spot instantly, still dead no loading screen.
---
But other than that the game runs a lot smoother than it used to and it doesn't error out nearly as often as it used to
---
Just don‚Äôt buy it. Plain and simple. 
---
I mean sure, it‚Äôs annoying, but wasting all the materials just to nuke them seems unnecessary.
---
Fallout 76: Road Trip...

... please apply for driver's license at the Charleston DMV...

"Thank you, your driver's license is being sent to your address, please wait 7-12 weeks for delivery... error, courier not found. Please resubmit application"
---
[edit: meh]
---
Big fucking deal. He traded an item that was duped. Curious man, how old are you?
---
Number thresholds are a myth, you can't just toe the line by staying below a certain point. They write out random numbers like over 100k in ban emails to provide a reason, but their flagging system is far more focused on how quickly and how something is obtained
---
My C.A.M.P. is literally all my crafting stations jammed into a bathroom that isnt a map location lol
---
while radroach can kill u no question other stupid mechanics..
---
Yep. I just completed a challenge for 80 atoms and got none. This game is a joke
---
All I'm saying is they're trying to help (most likely) and I see a lot of these complaints - the problem is at Bethesda's end not giving people the option to turn off sharing - however they've as much right to their build (and choice of shared perks) as you to yours at least in a public team
---
Basically no, they didn't reduce budget but you likely accidentally went over budget when building, by swapping out flooring or roofs.
---
Just keep deleting until you're under budget. It sucks. Remember some items take up vastly more buget than others.
---
In team play I use a bloodied 10mm for tagging, then switch to my primary weapon when I need instant results.
---
Were you using the contemporary set or asbestos roofing?  They originally didn't take up as much budget as they were supposed to and when they fixed it some people (including me) went over budget.
---
(nukes own camp)
---
Nuking things is fun
---
If all of those are from the same person, they're 100% duped. If you took three large stacks of duped items from the same person, it might be a bit too late to do anything. They flag your account for review/suspension after picking up items, so throwing them away won't necessarily help anything if that's already the case. Plenty of bans in the past were on alleged "vigilantes" who picked up stacks of items people were duping and threw them away somewhere else
---
You guys are like those idiot puritans of the 16th century carrying around pitchforks in your little gang of idiots yelling witch or something. Nothing he did affects you. Theres is no open PvP. And don't cry economy because you've already stated you don't trade with duper's anyway, so what's your argument?
---
Correct. Demo expert will increase damage for explosive shot.  However, over the years the explosive shot has been nerfed
---
I remember my first encounter trying to get to vegas the easy way... I also remember figuring out the ammo glitch and using a small portable nuclear arsenal to wipe them out of the mojave.
---
I had no clue what to do how the game worked or anything and yet I think my build is perfect for all around play. 15 STR because melee and carry weight was everything when 400 lb stash box. 8 PER 1 for each rank of rifleman or commando. Why one of each rank, because 30% boost is 10% more than maxing out one rank. I have 5 points to swap in whatever I may need at the moment from picking locks to harvesting veg. 5 END for a little bit of protection and food boost. Used to always run good doggie because making food was a PITA. 4 CHR. Just enough to run solo, mostly for pet taming needs, best vendor prices and cheaper FT. 8 INT 5 is probably enough. Might move three to END if I feel like it. 9 AGI but that‚Äôs more like 6 because 3 is always on thru hiker. I‚Äôm a drink hoarder. And lastly 8 LCK for the mutation cards and 3 serendipity which works only when the server isn‚Äôt laggy AF. 
---
That‚Äôs my build. I spend more time than I‚Äôd like to admit swapping cards. But that‚Äôs what you gotta do.
---
Oh, I was using the contemporary set. That's probably what it was. Thanks.
---
Edit: My house is also pretty large so I'm probably going to have to scrap my house and restart from scratch
---
(todd personally calls you)
---
"You stole fizzy lifting drink!"
---
Turn the damage indicators on.  If it‚Äôs two sots with a dragon and a couple sniper rounds, no it won‚Äôt be enough.  SBQ has incredible damage resistance.  That probably less than a hundred total damage on her
---
Gulpers are cool. They just vibin‚Äô in their ponds.
---
The account would have been flagged, but dev room bans take a while, they could have just given the items to someone else
---
Yeah. I am always almost solo that‚Äôs why I focus on solo builds, but yes. With intro of public teams, I guess you don‚Äôt have to have anyone with you anymore to be considered team.
---
Yeah, it's just the door. There's no surrounding walls to make it a wall/door like the garage door, so it can't snap to anything else.
---
Does a little bit weaker damage but fires faster, not much of a dps difference
---
Because Ram, it‚Äôs a dead meme like the 150,000 Americans dead from COVID. It isn‚Äôt funny anymore.
---
Fort Knox is in Kentucky not Tennessee.
---
I turned on numbers. Theres one more sbq coming. I will post results then.
---
I have the same bug. Everytime I log in I get the notification and I can complete it and get rewards. Would have been nice if it happened before I became fully allied
---
Its on the auto delete list so i doubt itll be available. Ill have a look at the esm in a couple minutes and see if any of the cola ammos now have new references they didnt have before, if they dont, they cant be dropped from mobs but i havent had a look yet so if they do, i could probably tell you what can drop them
---
that's 8% more xp for a full build team, more than well rested or a leader bobble ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
And I assume prime is the best receiver for most guns if you can make the ammo?
---
Sorry you had to experience this. The bigger picture is there are people who behave that way out of either immaturity or general disrespect. Just remember their actions are a reflection of themselves; they‚Äôve got real-life problems they need to address. 
---
But there are plenty of players who are the exact opposite, and we‚Äôll be glad to help out.
---
Now that you‚Äôve made it to launch control, it should be easier on subsequent runs since you know what to expect.  If you are on PS4 and want to run a silo again, I‚Äôll be glad to provide you with the ammo and some useful buffs if you want to solo it, or I can tag along to help (level 355).
---
It cant be deleted in my case. Its in the junk tab but it has the diamond quest marker on it and cant be removed
---
Ah, that sucks. I might just wait till they increase budget. If they don't increase it anytime soon, I'll probably just redo my entire house.
---
*hey there all you cool cats and kittens*
---
It worked for me when I was in a public team by myself
---
Let a higher level on the boards know the players gamer tag.  I know I‚Äôve done a few silo runs and dropped a nuke on these camps.  Most leave the server, but sometimes the player isn‚Äôt paying attention.....
---
They have expressed zero indication that they plan to increase camp budget. Bite the bullet and do it. Or just delete two lights.
---
Has nobody ever tried using lasers in pistols and not rifles, I feel like BE laser pistols are just as powerful for pistol builds as the rifle equivalent is to commandos
---
For PS4 I'm sure there was a place anywhere mod, and if not, you could rug glitch them to hide the holes!
---
I agree. 
---
I did find some solace in the fact that fans have posted the transcripts on the wiki:
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Tales_from_the_West_Virginia_Hills
---
(Click any individual one and you will find the transcripts under the holotapes info)
---
I'm slightly more frustrated knowing that the transcript text is out there and they could just copy and paste it to run as the holotapes play, but that hasn't even been done.
---
If you‚Äôre deaf, why are you playing the game, you can‚Äôt be mad at a company for not giving a feature to players they excpect not to play?
---
I‚Äôve never had any trouble with it.
---
That was a really shitty thing for that other player to do, it's understandable that you are so frustrated. But that doesn't take away from your accomplishment. Silos are a bitch, and getting that far is a big deal!
---
What's the point? The player is killing all the mobs in mid air, unless you are on their team you do not share the loot.
---
I get the event reward true, but this event is great for XP and loot farming, not any more.
---
There‚Äôs so few deaf people who would play the game. Having subtitles in the vast majority of instances is enough
---
Never played it.
---
For like damage per shot I suppose yea for the most part 
---
Some receivers give armor penetration which may be better in some circumstances, like against Mirelurk queens, maybe against the upcoming colossus boss
---
For scorchbeasts yeah prime will probably be best but not using prime isn't a huge loss I've found
---
If a player enters the silo first, the silo should be locked down until they launch the nuke or leave
---
He aint lying about that.  No TP was funny until it started turning into something history books will be warning future generations of.
---
Well this got dark quick. GG
---
Swap weapons and swap back
---
You can shoot them as well
---
Happens to me all the time, my main is a shotgunner
---
The way I got the Ultracite Gatling Laser plans was to do events in Cranberry Bog, finally dropped from Line in the Sand.  
---
I recommend doing Census Violence since it pulls from the rare drop list twice that has the plans.
---
Shouldn‚Äôt have anything to do with your cards
---
In my experience they have, regularly I find a built up but abandoned workshop laid as a PvP honey trap, they reset it by server hopping away and back again every time they win and take it from you!
---
I‚Äôm really not sure but I first noticed it when I switched cards
---
Got a 1 star bloodied the other day been trying to get junkies
---
Thanks bro
---
Yeah I‚Äôve been trying to make a shotgun build it seems pretty op
---
Ah ok. Thanks. I‚Äôve been so worried that my ammo stockpile will be worthless or dramatically less because I have to make Ultracite ammo.
---
Yeah I don't use eagle eyes because it doesn't stack, it caps at 50%.
---
The 50% vats crit legendary is great though, you don't waste cards.
---
I'll probably get a jffr tommorowüòÇ
---
My local store has a huge sale on paper products... I think if you want to reflect the times make it cheaper. Or maybe sell some damn masks.
---
Blame the government's lack of response!
---
I‚Äôve suggested that Bethesda make the combat rifle skins available for the Fixer and the answer I got back gave me all the information I needed - we‚Äôll pass this along - aka piss off, that‚Äôs more work than we care to do.
---
Ah thanks for the advice!! I‚Äôm planning on doing a lot of events know for the score so hopefully I can get it
---
Oh yea it's a great time doing it. Been doing all the daileys as well to get the script
---
About 6 hrs into plag when I just hit lv 15, I had a high lv player drop by and drop me a full set of raider, excavator, t45, t51b all at 10 lv increments. I held onto those and used them as I leveled up and once to lv 50 made a set of X01. I then passed on the favor and gave those armor sets to the next person I saw at lv 15.
---
It's the brotherhood of the traveling power armor
---
Why would I be talking about that?
---
I‚Äôm talking about Marsupial and Speed Demon.
---
supermutant bcz it easy to kill and gives u more xp.
---
there was a purge ban, not to long ago.
---
I get the feeling that there's a lot of the salty trickling back in, buying back in just to get banned again.
---
The days of halo 3 shit talk have ended. I'll miss the ole wild west days of xbox live. "I still fucked ya mom though" brought to you by my 12 year old self.
---
If you're on Xbox you can launch one on my private world. I'll even supply the key card. No chance of anyone stealing it
---
You can do it on your own or I'll, or a team will help you through it, and whatever nuke zone you want to create
---
Wait, legendary crafting? Haven‚Äôt played in a long in a long time...
---
No, emergency protocols and bloodied heavy is a good way to go.
---
I'd probably go with something like this, subject to slight tweaks depending on what works best. Damage avoidance and reduction is the name of the game for bloodied builds. 
---

---
Yea isn't the minimum amount of damage you're supposed to do is 1000 for loot? That'll be tough even with a dragon especially if she's in the air. 
---
Let's say my non primed bloodied gauss minigun does 290 damage and I do 61 damage if I'm getting constant headshots. I still gotta hit her at least 17 times to get to 1000.
---
Nah, you should be fine, the game never has much of a dps check anyway haha
---
I quit making ultracite ammo when I realized how much stuff I wanted required huge amounts of flux, and thought it would be better used elsewhere then letting my gun do slightly more damage for 30 minutes lol
---
I suppose so.
---
The EP seems to be an amazing mod for PA.
---
Yeah pretty sure. That or because I fast traveled irdk
---
What expense in development time?  Ditch all the fluff, make survival mode simple PVP enabled adventure for the players that want more suspense.  The extra development time they put into the original survival made it worse in my opinion.
---
The weapon rewards attracted people that hate PVP just so they could complain
---
The top three players getting map markers ruined the suspense of surviving and made PVP feel less natural
---
The aid dropped on death was a wild percent and neglected most players run weight reduction perks and carry all of their aid because it's so heavy in stash
---
It is truly the best.
---
What do you mean by ‚Äúthey‚Äôre the same thing?‚Äù
---
So Marsupial and Speed Demon can‚Äôt stack because it‚Äôs a Serum?
---
Power armor is good until you get a close to god tier armor set + backpack
---
I don‚Äôt want to sound harsh but if you look at it from their perspective, you can‚Äôt blame them, when at most a couple % of their player base is even deaf or partially deaf, to them it‚Äôs wasted money and I can‚Äôt blame them
---
Careful, Bethesda support have taken to locking any ticket that even mentions challenges!
---
What? You're saying that Bethesda doesn't expect deaf or hard of hearing players to play their game? There's subtitles in the game already. Additionally, in case no one told you: people with disabilities deserve to play games, too. A simple addition to an accommodation that's already in the game is hardly a burden to the studio.
---
Once placed it can't be moved or scrapped since it's not intended to be put in camps, you're stuck with it forever.
---
Dosent seem bad
---
What if you place another camp?
---
Real shitty take there bud.
---
I‚Äôm saying that they dont want to waste money  on a very small percentage of the deaf player base
---
Wait... the combat rifle? or combat shotgun?
---
Sometimes the ghouls will linger on the edges of the event to the south, aggro them &amp; typically the next spawns will follow suit.
---
It's something, but I wouldn't call it enough. "Enough" is everything subtitled.
---
Who really aren‚Äôt a lot of their profits
---
Money please
---
I only used it once, after i killed a player who attacked me for no reason.
---
 Davide 93 Hs AKA Mr. steal\_yo\_girl
---
I have that same bug, every time I log in I don‚Äôt have to even go anywhere it‚Äôs straight away just go talk to the guy, quest done. I unselected it in the dailies part of the Pip-Boy and it‚Äôs not notified me since although if I select the daily again it just skips straight to handing in the quest :/
---
Probably, but there is no incentive to ever do so. Pistols in this game suck, both as a category and individually. By turning your rifle into a pistol, you're crippling your build and overburdening agility. Even with 15 agility you can't make a good stealth autopistol build, but with 12 agility and 12 perception you can make a very good stealth commando build
---
This is all about money for them dude, theyre a massive company, realize that
---
I‚Äôve been running a few at workshops all day. Made an obscene amount of ammo by placing 35 at Wade Airport. Plenty of space. They don‚Äôt cost any mats to place, but you need a fusion generator for every 5 factories.
---
I‚Äôm also a filthy casual lady who struggles through the silos. If you are on ps4 and want to team up, my username is same as here. I like helping out shooting things!
---
How‚Äôd you do it? Just activate 1 after the other or did you need Starched Genes?
---
Thanks, I‚Äôm not too worried about any challenges other than score but I saw it and was wondering how, thanks for the help
---
Solid. You can't expect much from a company that typically relies on DLC like "Unofficial Skyrim/Fallout Patch" to come in full swing, but still. Like it's already there! Just finish the damn job!
---
You‚Äôre twisting my words and not realizing what I‚Äôm saying
---
Same as other weapons, most are learned from scrapping and a few of them through plans. If you're going to be using it then the ultracite is better, but that depends on how much you want it. It's a rough grind to get the plans legitimately, and it's not some god-tier weapon that justifies it. The fixer is comparatively better and easier to get
---
It is bad, if you move your camp it goes into your storage as an invisible item that can no longer be placed or scrapped. You lose a big chunk of your budget forever. Just look at all the people talking about it on the youtube videos about this.
---
I think they just need to get rid of the whole not getting rewarded for not doing enough damage idea. I think if you were involved in any way at all you should get something. Leave the rng there but come on we can't all be the same bland bloodied and junkies builds.
---
You have lost your mind. The subtitles are there already, what "profits" are they missing out on?
---
Made a post about this 13 days ago urging Bethesda to fix this before the double xp weekend, but no. I never open lunchboxes anymore in public, only with friends on a private server when we farm.
---
Has to be a bug in your favor. I swap characters every day to the one best suited to get the challenge. I‚Äôve never seen a completed challenge reset like it did for you, and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not intended. Ride the wave!
---
Oh yes pretty good
---
I already had the eagle eyes mutation. This is on a bloodied lever rifle. I have another one that is 15% meter and +33% to hit. I‚Äôll just use that one. 
---
Subtitles are a standard thing, everyone uses them, I‚Äôm saying they‚Äôre not gonna go an extra mile to add anything more, because they know that if they do nothing more, they won‚Äôt lose any money
---
That is thanks to players placing their tents in choice locations blocking the scortched spawn ;) for some reason the wave all spawn in a group by the generator
---
Shotguns only really do good damage if used with VATS. That's #1. #2 is definitely get all nine shotgunner perks, and seeing as you have an explosive one, demo expert as well.
---
I would actually use a scrap kit....if it let me scrap weapons and armor pieces that are actually weighing me down.
---
Oh thanks for letting me scrap the 3 wrenches and one loose cigarette that I picked up....meanwhile I have 47 moleminer gauntlets that I am lugging halfway across the state!
---
I guess you mean combat shotgun?
---
A few tips:
---
-VATS is better for shotguns, besides the regen bug, just regularly firing shotguns is just a mess
---
-The enforcer perk in agility adds limb damage that is semi bugged and increases damage
---
-Explosive affect is not good on shotguns. It causes the regen bug more often, and the damage boost is always minimal and is not worth the slot or the rapid deterioration
---
Use vats headshots. four leaf clover in luck and concentrated fire in agility. each of eight pellets per shot counts towards four leaf clover. you will be vat critting ever other shot. shotguns aren't great outside of vats. instigating shotguns are great for farming solo with vats headshots.
---
I've been sitting on 119K 5mm for months, nothing has happened to me.
---
Uhh could you dm how you do this, I wouldn't mind one
---
And the fact that you can‚Äôt trade them means you either had to dupe materials or you will be grinding for that set for years
---
I see, thanks for your input!  
---
I create a new character every day for the Lvl Up challenge and this is the first time this happened. I do enjoy it though :P
---
Fortnite all over again lul
---
I don't think it's got a thing to do with money, weirdo. I think it has everything to do with straight up oversight/laziness. It's as simple as a copy/paste.
---
Went from 241 to 260 within the couple of days.
---
(Todd logs out of his level 45 toon)...
---
(Todd giggles)
---
It's not useful
---
Almost anything else is useful
---
It will not help you in match or after the match. At most you'll get a little satisfaction if you down or kill your attacker who immediately looted your bag
---
So I'm on Xbox and the game just got added to game pass and theres a huge influx of new players. I have my camp right down the road from the wayward so I can give a few thing to the nobs fresh out the vault.I run a bloodied biuld so as most know bloodied have alot of rads. Well a lev 5 that I had just given a few stims and some .308 rounds and other odds and ends drops  2 radaway for me and I give the thumbs down and heart emote to try and say no thank you, he proceeded to get on the mic and call me a stuck up asshole and asked if HIS stuff wasn't good enough for me. Hahahhaha I've never been cursed out for NOT taking something from someone
---
"If you‚Äôre deaf, why are you playing the game"
---
There is no twisting this bud. Its just an ugly thing to say.
---
I've had that happen to me before in my first time through a silo and it does absolutely. Thankfully that is a minority. These days if I see someone in a silo that appears to be struggling I may go in a kill some robots for them and be ready with stims to keep them alive but I try not to do any objective so they don't lose that feeling of doing it and know how to do it in future. If they ask for more help or want to do it completely solo I respect their wishes.
---
If you're on xbox I can throw some ammo your way or provide help killing robots. For the most part I think you'll love the fallout community as apart from the odd few I think it's easily the best community around.
---
It's definately happened when I get downed for me multiple times, I thought that was intended?
---
Most likely either the lunch boxes will end up on the ATOM store after the season ends or be a regular fixture on the seasons rewards.
---
A combat rifle (perks in perception) will not work with a shotgun build (perks in strength). I'm just going to assume a typo though. Hardened receiver is the best (tweaked if you want automatic, but I wouldn't on a shotgun). Range Is garbage on shotguns, either have a secondary weapon, or wait until your up close. Other than that, yeah, perk cards, legendary effects, mutations, addictions.
---
RiukoDark for me, this has happened for a few days now, 520 atoms so far that i gotten from challenges are split onto my account and i am forever stuck with 1020 atoms that ain't gaining any atoms at all, i play on the Xbox PC platform and it's really annoying that this is happening.
---
EDIT: it's currently 730 atoms that i cannot gain as of july 20th. :/
---
No problem :) if you hadn't posted this, I wouldn't have bothered to try!
---
Does your username mean you're a dummy with a thick skull? Cause that's a pretty fucking dense way of thinking. It's 100% fair for a deaf person to be upset about a company not including more accessibility to them. Especially one as simple as adding a few extra subtitles.
---
For treasury notes Heart of the Swamp takes under 3 minutes
---
Lmao!!!!! That‚Äôs awesome!
---
Why I carry a Gamma Gun, to re irradiate myself if needed, just happens to be Bloodied as well.
---
Haha! If only.
---
Theoretically you should be able to, but they'll probably start snapping if an edge gets too close to the beam. Same thing happens in reverse: if you're trying to place the blueprinted beams near a floor or foundation, they'll try to snap if they get too close.
---
Edit: if you're talking about snapping upper floors to them, I doubt it would work. Upper floors are extremely picky and I've never found a way to place them without them being attached to a staircase in some fashion. Flat roof pieces might work if you're willing to compromise.
---
I love this
---
I don't see a problem here, why wouldn't they make room for their friends? I mean not to be rude but if you aren't the group leader of a public group you're basically just a random who's leeching on for XP
---
Unless you're like talking on mics with them and actually interacting and then you get kicked, it's not a dick move
---
You can join my private world if you want. Mostly everywhere is untouched and I've got ammo and food being produced
---
You can join my public team for the XP boost too. I normally dont talk via mic often but I can help/inform when you need it
---
Proper term is ‚Äúunsarcastically‚Äù
---
I always carry my bloodied gamma gun around just to repel annoying players. It's a show stopper for sure.
---
Lol! Oh, you must be the one who reported me! üòÜ‚ù§Ô∏èüòçüëçüèº
---
Toss grenades
---
Carry atleast 2 guns- each with different types of ammo (I always suggest a shotgun scorched carry lots of shells) and backup melee. I wouldn't worry too much about legendary weapons until you get past 45-50. If you aren't planning on using stealth a power armor frame is great for extra carry weight and no fall damage.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what I want, kamikaze explosive build.
---
I just want to be able to craft fireworks. They do nothing but look kinda cool so why are they so damn rare
---
Preserved instamash is the only food that can be produced without radiation at the workshop. It really does suck that the other foods aren‚Äôt radiation free.
---
I'm solo,and I'll so do whitsprings
---
It's not gonna help you or give you a higher survivability, but I guess if it's what you want. You need a grenade in inventory, and the equipped one will take prority to drop 
---
Have fun
---
This is part of why I refuse to play with minors, or even be in a party with them.
---
Wait, so where is the toxicity? Another example of clickbait!!!
---
The next time it happens and you‚Äôre in the middle of combat, quick wheel to a new weapon of course pause half a second because Bethesda‚Äôs shit is jacked And then swap back. Always fixes it for me whenever I‚Äôm loading my quad like a 95-year-old
---
Don‚Äôt you have to pay to access private worlds? I don‚Äôt have that currently. Time‚Äôs are tough rn financially wise for me.
---
üòÇwill do. Thanks!
---
 üëçüèª
---
Kicking myself for selling the legendary one I found earlier.
---
This is GREAT info, thanks!!!
---
I‚Äôm already doing that. I carry a 10mm, a pipe pistol, and a shot gun. I know I‚Äôm a lousy shot, I always have been. So I keep running out of ammo like it‚Äôs nobody‚Äôs business lol
---
Holy shit, same thing here I have all the SS parts unyielding, awesome 3* rolls, except the left leg. I don't if I made 58 pieces but I did a lot. So frustating spending all those modules on this.
---
This I can confirm, although with full SS gear the extra rad damage is negligible
---
The insult bot knows how to hurt us. The thing I love most in 76 is my camp and he called it a pile junk and my friend doesn‚Äôt have a dad and the insult bot made fun of how he left. How does he know?
---
I had the same thing only mine was a level 46,i kept giving him the thumbs down emote as he kept trying to walk to the terminal so I then started shooting him. If I stopped walking in front of him he'd start edging towards the computer again.
---
New player question, when you Nuke a player's base is it destroyed and they have to pay the material costs to rebuild it?
---
Yeah, those are annoying af.
---
Turn damage numbers on. She has really high DR. I doubt you are doing that per shot.
---
Yes, but I subscribe to it. You dont need to pay if play on a friends private server
---
I can allow 7 people (that do or do not subscribe to F1ST) play on the world as long as I'm in it
---
It is OP, if you‚Äôve got a shotgun or piece of armor with the magical effects. Something I didn‚Äôt learn until after 250, Blocker. It completely makes sense, but I never thought about it. Make sure you put three points in blocker...nerd rage and 4-leaf clover
---
For some reason, i thought it was Samuel
---
God I miss those days... I'm not one to trash talk, only if I'm super annoyed by someone. Still kept it on underground so I wouldn't get in trouble though, just in case. But now you can't even call someone a butthead without most likely getting a comms ban it seems. Obviously over exaggerating but might as well be true.
---
It's not bad XP either, although sometimes bugs out and the heart takes forever to open.
---
make sure you also have max level inspirational in charisma, even on a team alone(public team just create one) you'll gain 15% more xp
---
It‚Äôs super annoying.
---
Uh I just saw someone that had it at their camp and I got in the room cause I photo glitched in the room and was super shocked
---
I dump stuff all the time since I will be over weight most of the time.
---
Ive gotten hate messages for using it so I'm happy with it
---
Get lead belly 3 and laugh in the face of radiation.
---
I scrapped more stuff and luckily I was able to spare my camp from the scrapping bench. I finally got budget to place the sink and ammo converter. I forgot lights take good amount of budget and I scrapped some unnecessary lighting. Thanks.
---
I‚Äôm not familiar with game pass, but do you have Xbox gold? Because you need it to play. Or Xbox game pass ultimate which includes gold.
---
The Centerian
---
Ya I have it for 4 months
---
If you're on PC I can help you do a nuke run. I've done the silo a million times and happy to help. I have ammo too if you need it.
---
Justice for Jangles!
---
Bethesda should either do double SCORE for a couple weeks or just extend the event a couple weeks
---
No idea. Make sure you are connected to the internet?
---
I am as well I feel your pain. I used VATS alot with my shotgun. Grenades are also fun to thin out the herd or might I suggest swapping to melee? I had lots of fun with a sneak/ melee build.
---
I think they should rethink the PvP workstation thing, especially now after reading your experience. I‚Äôve had a lot of trouble with people claiming the workshop when I‚Äôve owned it but not actually taking it off me. Its still in my name and I still get called to defend it but when I turn up to do the event I get 1 shot killed by some invisible dude camping on the workshop. I don‚Äôt get it, I‚Äôm the kind of lady who claims a few workshops and doesn‚Äôt lock anything so anyone can have anything they want. I just like to do the defend events tbh. Thought it was a one off but it happened twice the night after and once tonight. I‚Äôm not sure if they are just exploiting something but I‚Äôve never had the problem before usually someone claims it and I just let them keep it. I both love and hate workshops lol
---
I'm in! Thanks dude! :)
---
That would make sense, the condition of the non broken item, will be combined with the broken item and like half of the item durability of the non broken item condition will be the condition of the broken item?
---
My one question I'm still confused on about leveling up, and if it confuses vets, I'm sure newbies will be worse, is separately putting points in your SPECIAL and selecting a card from a different category.
---
This seems counter intuitive. Like, if you're picking Concentrated Fire or Action Boy/Girl, in your first few levels, wouldn't you then put points in your PER or AGI in order to fit the cards levels in ? Why would you put points in say STR then pick Concentrated Fire ?
---
I‚Äôm almost done maxing out my nerd rage and still trying to get bloodied guns.
---
Thatd be awesome! My GT is Sathaenis
---
I rolled two bloodied gauss shotguns in a 5 buy roll. I got a 3* unyielding chest piece on the first roll but no weight reduction on it so I had to script it since My current robots unyielding piece has ammo weight reduction.  Now I have spent 30x2 modules trying to get a bloodied gauss minigun and no luck.  What else do I have to do but grind 150 script a day and keep trying.
---
Dude, the best roll I got in this game was a 3* bloodied ffr fr in the first try, not kidding. I couldn't believe it.
---
See I tried using Vats because that‚Äôs what got me through Fallout 4 but it‚Äôs not the same or something on this game lol
---
Have you added the future-tec skin to your CAMP if you have it unlocked in the legendary run? Saw a thread saying it was broken and you couldn't see camp on the map or fast travel to it when using the skin.
---
PS4?
---
Thats why you keep a bloodied faster fire tesla rifle just for them.
---
Almost happened to a friend of mine the other night but she used the glitch to pass a certain part of the silo and the person couldn't get through in time.
---
To be honest, Stick to the Ash Heap, The Forest and the Toxic valley until you are level 30 or so. Many high level players are up in the Savage divide and some areas might be harder if they are near something like the White Spring Resort. 
---
Also test if you like rifles, automatic weapons are shotguns. You'll know what path to go once you have a preference.
---
And your bloodied... damn you‚Äôre going to really do some damage. I‚Äôm not bloodied but I love nerd rage. It has saved my ass literally hundreds of times
---
If I was the type of player who actually stood a chance at winning, I‚Äôd believe you, but me dying is an inevitability so my approach is to take anyone down with me no matter the cost
---
I would love to know the answer to this, following
---
Keep starched genes unequipped while taking serum. As soon as you‚Äôve taken it, apply starched genes and NEVER remove.
---
Yeah but I‚Äôm going to do a heavy PA build and I posted how I got a ton of F. Cores so I was wanting to use them.
---
Oh, thanks for telling me!
---
Any new purchases with the gold would be welcome. I am at 5000 now and nothing interests me.
---
Appreciate the post, Cyber. Reported to the team üëäüèº
---
I noticed I get Aries the least but As long as I don‚Äôt get that bitch Libby. I‚Äôm happy
---
I am a newbie so i have no idea
---
The server probably didn't recognize that you were at the event.  Did you fast travel to a friend?  That seemms to be a common culprit.
---
True. I didn‚Äôt know Ultracite ammo used flux (or at least Ultracite F. Cores). I have like 0 flux after modding my PA
---
Not sure about the XP but sometimes even when I do enough damage to loot the SBQ body, all I get for a reward is 3 gold bullion tickets, it sucks lol

Too many beers. I Should keep my unpopular opinions to myself I guess.
---
I have on my heavy weapons character I think. Haha. Officer on Deck I know I have.
---
You bet. Enjoy.
---
Still better than those preserved pies.
---
I wouldn't worry too much about it until you get to 50.  Then find a decent legendary weapon.  What are you looking for semi or full auto?
---
Fair enough, I get ya. I don't necessarily like NW, but I've always been good at FPS's so I usually place in the last 10 every match
---
Yeah after such a grind for reputation there is now no use. Legendary modules and vault steel would be great as an additional gold bouillon purchase
---
Thank you, ugh I need more caps lol I just dropped a lot on a few serum plans.
---
Yeah sorry, PS4 üëç
---
My first attempt I was too low-leveled and ran out of ammo while trying to repair the pipes, had to retreat. Second time I punched in the wrong code at the very end and couldn't launch anything. Third time a thunderstorm happened and my power got cut-off just as I reached the end. Fourth time, I snuck around in my Chinese Stealth Suit and suddenly heard shooting and commotion behind me - some level 300+ player decided to follow me around and then launched the nuke by himself at the end. I quit the game for a few days to relax and went back to try again when the server was quieter and finally launched a  nuke.
---
Don't give up, it will happen for you lol And if you're on the PS4 and need help from someone who loves carrying around a  giant Plasma Gatling Gun that tears through those robots, message me lol
---
My chest took about 30 try‚Äôs but my other leg took 10ish. Their both 1 star as well.
---
And plans to craft all weapons as Legendaries. I would pay a lot of gold for this, plus the modules.
---
Yeah consoles don't have that options.
---
Wow thank you, what‚Äôs your gamer tag so we can link up sometime. Mine is : Espada Muerta
---
Mate, 50 is a long way off for me! It took a few months to get to 25 before this weekend haha
---
This happened to me Friday. Everyone had a good attitude and we had fun.  Then all spent 5 min going through the literal piles of bodies and goo leftover in the middle
---
I was not aware that was an option
---
I meant the Marsupial mutation, and the Marsupial serum are the same thing.
---
However having read your edit: Yes, take as many different serums as you want, the mutations will stack - with only one exception, you can only have Herbivore OR Carnivore mutation as they're mutually exclusive.
---
They should just keep it at 400 gold bullion a day(for gold bullion treasury note vendor)
---
I don't really play socially but I'm happy to help otherwise, I'll empty my ammo stash out for you as I dump it at the vault regularly anyway and make a bit extra in your preferred type (please say 0.50s lol) - but I won't be on until 10pm or so BST, send me a message if you're interested as I'll swap tags with you then
---
With great power comes great responsibility 
---
In this case remember to let others tag otherwise enjoy the high damage
---
Yea I haven't finished my power armor yet, which is dumb because I'm a heavy armor PA build lol
---
But I'm also trying to build my rad shower for my camp, which also uses a variety of flux to make
---
Which might mean something if they even had a chance to actually get a shot off. I tried to level up some new characters and get some decent lower level legendaries when fasnacht was happening and it was insane how hard people camped the spawn and wrecked it immediately for experience that didn‚Äôt matter to them and a drop that at best was worth 3 scrip. Letting people tag stuff wouldn‚Äôt hurt anyone and wrecking it immediately is just a dick move.
---
Ya I doesn't slow down time like it did in 4, definitely a change, it's more like an aim bot now more than anything.
---
Okay then.  Google where to find plans for a lever action and make a level 40 one of those.  Or maybe like a handmade if you prefer full auto.
---
Oh there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôll be online then as that‚Äôs roughly 6am or so for me haha. I‚Äôll be snoozing. Thank you for the offer though! I really appreciate it!
---
Build your camp near a (safe) water source (dirty water gathering from the pump/sink eats so much time). 
---
and Keep your camp simple, you can build it up, move it later when you have ridiculous amounts of extra material.
---
make a Tinkerer's Workbench asap, you can craft ammo and  "Bulk" items from it. Bulk items help to reduce stash weight, and make items like Raw Cloth able to sell to non-player vendors for easy caps. 
---
Plant about 10 tato plants when you can. spoiler: &gt;!There's a repeatable quest at Hemlock Holes  that sometimes retriggers very quickly (literally that requires 5 tatos each time), it's just nice to have a quick source!&lt;
---
I honestly don‚Äôt know.  if it‚Äôs like the other terminals like at mama dolces, it won‚Äôt let you access the terminal if someone is on it.
---
SS isn't worth it tbh. I have much better sets of heavy combat and leather.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm doing a PA heavy build. I‚Äôm only level 48 so I‚Äôm using T-60 with assembles core and calibrated shocks (my AP goes from 0 to full in ~5 seconds. I have Lom√© wanderer and AP boy(?)
---
To late they outsourced there actual QA department to moders years ago.
---
&gt; It's lazy, insensitive, and - again - wrong.
---
Why can't you find a transcript of the holotape online? In fact let me google "Curse of the Wendigo transcript" for you. Here you go, the whole thing in text.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Curse_of_the_Wendigo_-_Part_1
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Curse_of_the_Wendigo_-_Part_2
---
In a massive game with sub titles for everything else it seems extremely petty and entitled of you to call Bethesda lazy, insensitive and wrong for not having complete sub titles for just the radio dramas out of literally thousands of different tapes and logs.
---
Oh!  You may also want to take a look at your perks and stats and such and really start to optimize for damage in every way you can.
---
Aw no worries, this game really needs a mail system - good luck!
---
&gt;  it is their camp and their vending machines.
---
It's funny to me because I've seen people also say 'It is your nuke and you did the silo run, so you're allowed to nuke whatever you want.' If people want to nuke other players and their camps then that's within the rules of the game, as designed by the developers and even showcased in their trailers for the game. Same way you can overprice garbage in your vending machines to earn the ire of someone angry enough to drop an ICBM on your house, or create a base that flings other players off a cliff to their death.
---
I got a Bloodied one star gauss shotgun on my first roll and I was like this is good enough for me, I‚Äôm not bothering to make anymore.
---
You cant get banned this. It has been going on since the wastelanders dropped. Soak it in.
---
I agree! Lol thank you again.
---
I got an unyielding +1 Endurance +35 rad resist Raider Leg but it's so ugly I put it in my vendor box. Professionals have Standards
---
Yeah I honestly prefer playing without it now lol it confuses me when I accidentally click it.
---
Why? So you can get sick of hearing their 4 lines that they repeat every 30 seconds? I just want a dog for my camp. No more talking or singing things in my camp!
---
The food Ive produced at Sunshine Meadows has always been the "clean" non radiated variant which makes it useless for recipes that call for pre war food. I dont know if it applies to every single type but I know the Fancy Lads snack cakes and Sugarbombs defnitely are non radiated because I made a batch of them up once when eating cakes and sweets were part of atom challenge dailies
---
U got a mic?
---
and here I am with nearly 200 treasury notes that I can't turn in :/
---
No i used the ‚ÄúJoin Event‚Äù button to get there but what you‚Äôre saying sounds like a reasonable explanation just not sure how to confirm i‚Äôm at the event or not lol guess it‚Äôs up to Bethesda
---
Similar on ps4. It just stopped working, but i am not at the end of the subscription either... emailed support, waiting for their answer...
---
Yeah, I've maxed whatever perk boosts damage to rifles, was thinking of maybe maxing the expert perks as well.
---
Does the Gauss rifle get grouped into those, or would that be under energy weapons?
---
How about a Front Sight?
---
Yeah I do
---
I‚Äôm up for helping if I‚Äôm on. My GT is: shadow pavement
---
Its annoying I agree. if you go up the steeple of the church in Flatwoods it can spawn up to 3 x pkts of Sugarbombs there. You might have some competition now though because everyone is grinding xp hard. From memory I think there may be some on the roof of the red rocket there too but youll need marsupial to be able to get up there
---
That would be nice as well
---
There really are people out here who believe that this is a suitable substitute for literally a copy/paste from what I just know the devs have as a script saved as a .docx file on their server. What's petty is you downplaying an issue with something that the community - not Bethesda - provided, and with a copy/paste at that. Thanks for charging to their defense though, I'm sure you'll get an attaboy.
---
Confirm you're at the event by whether or not it is in your quest tracker.  I've been burned like that a few times myself, now I always look.
---
glitched them into blueprint, rebuilt them at their camp. Todd would be furious.
---
Was wondering why there was a top of the world nuke. Didn't seem like the most advantageous place to nuke, with the hills/cliffs etc but never saw it before so farmed it anyways.
---
This will kill you.    
---
I made 3 SS chests.  One nocturnal, but with sentinel perk.  The next two ... unyeilding.  
---
Also made 2 plasma casters.  1st was one star two shot.  The second, bloodied 3 star.  
---
I've never seen anything like that little streak in this game.
---
Just did this event for the first time and ive never had so many legendaires at one event.
---
(Wooby noise)
---
It's a lack of Quality Control. The Mole Miner Event where you.....rentlessly hunted unarmed Mole Miners to Murder them and take their Treasures, that was wildly insensitive to Deaf People as you could only track them by sound or happen upon them by chance. There should be an ADA mode for all games to accommodate the Deaf. Or if you are like me and mainly play with the sound off, just out of convenience
---
Amen
---
Do expert and master too, and I also recommend tank killer, bloody mess, stealthy &amp; covert operative.  I can't answer your question regarding gauss rifles, I don't use them... sorry.
---
Gotcha, thank you :)
---
One thing to note is that if you die AFTER the event finishes, within maybe 10-15 minutes (uncertain of the time), then the game takes back then stable flux you were awarded. If there is a player with a Survival tent there, get it in your stash as quickly as possible.
---
I traded mines for a croc bag to me it was worth it
---
I'm about a day or two away from renewal. Bethesda said I have to talk to steam so that's where I am now. Frustrating
---
Yeah it took me a few weeks to really get a grasp around the special system and perk cards, but I like it as it allows you to be able to pick a perk, but if you realize you don't need it say 10 levels down the line or later in the game, you can invest into another card to replace it or even reallocate perk points/special points I should say. All in all, I love this new way of choosing perks as it allows you to make mistakes and adjust as need be in certain situations. There is no build tree/path that you must stick to where if you invest in pistol perks because that's all you have early on, then realize you prefer rifles, you're out of luck (pun unintended). I enjoy the variability and versatility in this new system.
---
search nukes and dragons, can plan your build there (which perks and stat points at what levels, etc)
---
I just want an actual bath I can throw The Wanderer into, that woman is DIRTY.
---
Yeah I was wondering if I needed to boost my stealth a bit. Cool, I'll check those perks out, I'm pretty sure I've got tank killer sitting in my card set
---
You don‚Äôt even have to be deaf to want subtitles. You could be playing while your kids are asleep - finally having a moment to yourself. I don‚Äôt wear headphones because I need to be able to hear when my kid stirs, and my tv is muted. I have subtitles on for everything.
---
Do you have a melee weapon? They are very important early in the game. They don't need ammo, and the perk cards are available early in the game. I loved the baseball bat. Get a heating coil on it and go to town on the bad guys.
---
That is one fine insult right there
---
Search up magic shotguns for fo76.
---
Basically you need your shotgun to have a specific legendary effect OR one of your armour pieces to have a specific legendary effect that makes all shotguns magic.
---
Even with that, or without it, shotguns aren‚Äôt good outside of VATS, due to enemies health rubber banding back upwards after each shot.  (Doesn‚Äôt happen in VATS.
---
Your explosive combat shotgun is perfect for crippling groups of enemies outside of VATS so get the enforcer perk and shoot their legs.
---
Due to being VATS reliant you need plenty of points in luck to get grim reapers sprint and the like.  You need action boy and a few pieces of AP refresh armour.
---
I also have the perk that makes shotguns weigh next to nothing so I carry four around for different situations.
---
- my quad, fast reload pump action shotgun.  (General use)
---
- bloody pump action shotgun for bigger enemies.
---
- explosive combat shotgun to cripple mobs in events like radiation rumble.
---
- an anti armour pump action shotgun with the magic effect needed for when I‚Äôm in a hazmat suit
---
There is a mod for Fallout 4 that allows them to snap and it doesn't have any issues. I'm sure Bethesda could do it for 76.
---
No more South please.
---
Check out Angry Turtle on YouTube https://youtu.be/c1bsLevJAdU
---
Seriously I miss survival mode so bad. If you didn't take yourself too seriously it was a fun time, it was fun to get into scraps with each other. You can play evil characters in older fallouts, now we are forced to play good characters only :(.
---
I would prefer a Chemistry Station. So I could craft Stable Flux right there next to the Nuke Zone in my Hazmat Suit
---
Doesn't help when you're using them in a recipe.. turning sugar bombs into brain bombs, need the non-irradiated one
---
Awesome.  If you need anything else just reply to this.  üòÄ
---
I‚Äôm so hyped to get this build done. It just seems like such a grind to get good bloodied guns. I just started so I‚Äôm still pretty far behind
---
Look up Angry Turtle‚Äôs video on YouTube about ‚Äòmagic‚Äò shotguns. There are certain legendary effects that increase shotgun damage in VATs to about 4 times what it should be.
---
Correct my gametag is FAKHANNA
---
Ammo should only be 1 cap per round at player vendors if it's the standard ballistic types. What you will also find now in camps are the Ammo Convertor machines, which anyone can use! The conversation rate sucks, but if you have a quantity of an ammo type that you don't use then trade it in for credits and then buy ammo at a later date when you have amassed some credits. 
---
Happy to give help and guidance on XBox, GT: TheNutrixx (just drop me a msg mentioning this post)
---
You know, I‚Äôve always hated using melee but honestly they have to be right up on me for me to be able to shoot them anyways. I haven‚Äôt played any games in over 2 years so it‚Äôs taking some getting used to again.
---
Is .50 used for the 50 cal or mini gun?
---
I once got attacked by a an Assaultron, tried to run away and was attack by crickets. DIED and left that dropped loot behind, then the next location was those Floater Aliens pieces of shit. Rage Quit.
---
Steam/PC
---
Thanks mate
---
Ban hammer coming in
---
It's ridiculous that they never seem to care about this sort of thing. The words are already written down in the script, how hard is it to put them in the subtitles? Proper subtitles and colour-blind/limited eyesight friendly settings should have been standard for *years* by now.
---
Had an ‚Äòargument‚Äô with bsda support a few days ago (bunch of bugs/atoms missing etc) and i kinda asked what is the point paying for first... maybe they had enough of me?Lol well i guess they probably send me to sony then...
---
I would definitely go 15 in Strength. You don‚Äôt need awareness as it‚Äôs kind of a useless perk. Agility and Luck are good go have relatively high on any build because they have some of the best perks for doing damage and preventing damage. You‚Äôll likely need at least 8 Intelligence if you want to use Power Armor all the time for the perks that increase fusion core use.
---
I had one in Nuclear Winter once, that is where it shines.
---
That usually happens when your internet connection drops out.
---
The cheating isn't actually getting worse. The public cheat program people used for this sort of stuff is dead and Beth has finally implemented a basic anti cheat. 
---
It still happens, of course, but it has objectively decreased as of late.
---
Didn't realize fo76 was free.
---
I'll try that next time, will be fine timing, they spray the mob as it spawns in a tight group in the air and they die instantly.
---
I tamed a level 1 guard dog from a random encounter and the god damn thing never actually showed up at my camp. One of my worst moments in this game. :&lt;
---
'I shoot dead people' ... 'They're everywhere'
---
You clicked, I win!
---
I guess I don't understand the meaning of 'public event'.
---
50 cal, so converted hunting rifles and the like or the light machine gun
---
Doesn‚Äôt the lmg use .308 rounds
---
I‚Äôve played against people like you in almost every fps, Gun is up before me and your bullets all hit true and kill me even though I‚Äôve dumped tons of rounds into you before your gun is even up.
---
Sometimes I get lucky and be that good but that is rare.
---
You're not alone.  I can down a scorchbeast in less than a mag outside VATS, but it's multiple mags if I stick to VATS only.
---
The problem is, there is a bug right now that is overpowering high rate-of-fire weapons.  Seems to be severe for hip fire, noticeable but less severe in PA, and missing (at least for me) in VATS.  And it's not even consistent withing those categories, so it's hard to say exactly what's going on from fight to fight.
---
Do a search for 'magic damage' and you'll see a lot of people talking about it.
---
Now, the issue is...is VATS doing too little damage, or is hip fire doing too much (or a combination of both)?   That I couldn't answer without some experimenting, and I'm too busy grinding a stupid board game to take the time to do it.
---
I am using the phone text service which seemed super fast. They respond immediately back and forth. Steam just got back to me and said its Beth problem. So back to square one.
---
Yeah, otherwise a full vanguards set is you‚Äôll need for the game lol
---
Commando also has Railway
---
I live in uk. All we get is email(unless i missed something) :/
---
Got bloodied 3 star gat laser, 50% limb damage and increase vats critical meter,  Idcfor the vats stuff as i dont use it and i mean this thing rips through anything, I can farm power plants on PS for fusion cores then run silo solo. And could even do SBQ solo if i needed to
---
Combat helmets still have their armor tiers as the rest of combat gear, but it doesn‚Äôt provide stats, purely cosmetic
---
I built a power armor guy, not because it was meta, but because I wanted to use it. This game is supposed to be fun. Can't be too fun if you're worrying so much about whether or not it's the best.
---
With the scrapper perk you get 10 plastic every laser rifle or pistol.  Clear out west Tek, Huntersville and the satallite above westek and you will get hundreds of plastic each run
---
I share a gaming computer and it looks like atoms awarded to one steam account are disappearing on opening the atomic shop.
---
They are then appearing on the steam account that originally installed fallout 76.
---
I didn't even know that was possible.  Interesting.
---
A shotgun can oneshot 90% of enemies in game in vats if it's Instigating, or if it has one of these effects: 33 vats, 50 limb, bashing damage.
---
To obtain the same (bugged, we shall see for how long) effect you can also apply braced to a piece of equip.
---
Outside vats they aren't great unless you're a meter away from the enemy.
---
Must have perks (imho):
---
Shotgunner,
---
Expert Shotgunner,
---
Master Shotgunner,
---
Concentrated Fire,
---
Skeet Shooter,
---
Lone Wanderer,
---
Gunsmith,
---
Action Boy/Girl,
---
Adrenaline (apparently not working at the moment ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è),
---
Gun Fu,
---
Grim Reaper's Sprint,
---
Bloody Mess (if you can cope with looting issues)
---
The rest depends on personal taste/needs.
---
I never remember to activate crits on vats so I just gave up on those perks. üòÇ
---
Ya I would like this as well. I dislike going into photo mode just to do emotes when it should be perfectly usable outside.
---
I have never used one. They sounded pretty useless when they were announced. I have some I guess I should use em up to get them out of my stash.
---
It really depends on the situation. When its in long and extremely long distance- Gauss rifle, medium to close in the air-railway rifle&gt;lever action&gt;hunting rifle with vats. When it lands (if you have cryolator that helps everyone , including you-but ) for pure damage: unarmed or shotgun. Bloodied builds are working wonders fyi
---
Thanks I'll check it out now.
---
I hadn't heard this.... so in essence, if I was in full buttressed ss armor and I  wanted to possum upgrade my backpack for high capacity carry weight, losing 60 DR wouldn't be that big a deal?
---
Maths.....
---
For non-automatic: Lever Action Gun or Handmades are also great. Fixer is too once you‚Äôre 50. Honestly even a combat rifle can be good with perks and mods
---
A bit extreme
---
It does! What's the other one with the little ammo box you wear when it's equipped?
---
I must play waaaaay different then most as I‚Äôve never had a plastic problem, don‚Äôt even know what it‚Äôs really used for?
---
My ‚Äúmust haves‚Äù (and I technically have plenty as I hoard) are ballistic fiber for armor repairs and screws for weapon mods and repairs. Don‚Äôt think anything I do uses plastic.
---
Run!!!!!!
---
Guess you don't lol
---
The .50 cal machine gun?
---
Why 15 in Strength? And if I take out Awareness, should I keep Perception at the current rank, or lower it by 2?
---
Bro im right there with SS and thorn.....
---
Well that would make sense wouldn't it lol, I only snipe with them don't ask me about the big guns...
---
Probably wouldn‚Äôt feel stale if they could follow you everywhere
---
Assaultrons and crickets are both so hard to deal with it‚Äôs insane
---
Oh ok, I started this week and base what gun I use on how much ammo I have
---
I can see why you say that, but also, I'm 28, so I have no business being friends with kids on the internet anyways. I'm not mean to them if they do join my party if one of my friends plays with them though.
---
Yeah they die in midair alot, they don't have much hp 
---
But with grenades, and especially one of the grenade launching guns, preferably the auto grenade launcher, I've gotten full xp from them even if the explosion just hits their corpses 
---
Seems like they're still taggable for a second or 2 after death
---
Rename it something.
---
Rename it with a Z as first letter. It will be last in your inventory if you don't sort.
---
Yes.  This makes me so irritated.
---
I had 35 at a workshop earlier
---
Every time I've done a nuke lately he's there.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f36768b&amp;d=sq2s22sx2s32sr2p02ip2id2ee2c13cu2lr2ls2lt2a72a04ek1lk1&amp;w=l12
---
Take a look at this build I made for you and let me know what you think.
---
15 strength to make use of all the heavy gun perks. And if you are interested in using VATS, then you only need 3 for Concentrated Fire as most other perks in Perception won‚Äôt be as helpful to you as a heavy gunner, especially if you don‚Äôt want to run mutations. Since you aren‚Äôt running mutations, I left Intelligence at 6 so I could pick the best PA perks, and still have enough points to put in Luck and Agility to make the build tankier and give you better damage output. One Gun Army can be trade for Grim Reaper‚Äôs Sprint if you want more criticals in VATS. If you have any questions I can help you brainstorm this build to bettersuit what you want. I can tell you why I picked each perk too as opposed to others.
---
My guess would be cranberry bog or the are with the water park
---
You can convert a hunting rifle to use the 50cal and then make them 100+ a time at the tinkerers bench, no worries about running low then, I don't use the big guns because I like to sneak and they're a bit loud üòÖ
---
What are you using atm? As I have a lot of spare shotgun shells - I typically sell them but can spare a couple of hundred for free
---
Maybe not boring, but it's the first thing EVERYONE recommends - especially a low health build overall (Unyielding, nerd rage, bloodied, etc).
---
I've been having fun with an Instigating DCG, full strength unarmed build - can one shot everything from the shadows (except the largest bosses) , but I also wear a full SS suit as sneaking everywhere gets boring and sometimes I want to run around and bezerk everything! Higher DR than many PA's. Instigating is fun on your own, but with others I lose the bonus, hence I have other damage modifiers.
---
It's not bloodied, but I don't die if a gnats fart brushes past me
---
The only other headgear with "armor" is the tattered mole man head.  It gives 1 DR. 
---
The combat helmet has a material slot for the different types of combat armor (each one a different colour, but it is a cosmetic change only) Learned by scrapping various combat armor pieces. The same applies to the metal helmet as well, materials are unlocked by scrapping metal armor pieces.
---
I would use the ammo converter but I have to spam A (on Xbox) just to get 30 ammo points
---
I‚Äôm thinking of making a rifle build + the Chine Stealth suit, is that good?
---
Also a water pump, even the hand pump. Why have a cooking stove for food, but not a way to collect water ?
---
Solid enough. I‚Äôd lose ground pounder for tank killer/Glow sighted and drop 3 points in weaponsmith for an extra 3 in strength for blocker.  And right now adrenaline isn‚Äôt working.
---
Can't remember exactly where, but there is a cratered location, I think near Charleston. And a bomb definitely hit there
---
Yeah I was annoyed to find the ones the faschnat bot finds don't work.  üòë
---
The nearest Nuke strike was D.C. (Fallout 3 setting FYI) and the Appalachia region didn't get hit directly.
---
Wasn't that because of the dam getting blown up though?
---
Bottom text
---
Oh and U need to find another point in agility for gun fu. Just one rank of it
---
Ughh that's a shame. This happened to me at lvl 200 too, I got passed the laser grid when someone came in and got trough the grid at the same time, but they went to the storage area and to the door just before the damaged star cores was open so they passed alot of the quest line to do a quick launch. I didn't know that I should be checking that door on a public server so I went to repair the pipes and destroy the mainframe like a sucker and they stole my nuke. I too play alone I don't like other players because they insist on using a mic, so I was lvl 101 my first nuke launch, it gets easier with practice, now lvl 205 I usually am done under 15 mins if that storage door isint opened from the other side. It sucks at first, but you will lose count of how many times you launched.
---
Huh. Wonder why China decided to knock a whole state off their kill list.
---
Got any atom shop paints you can put on the pieces?
---
There‚Äôs 2 big Craters in the savage divide near the giant lift thing and defiance
---
I believe it wasn't directly hit
---
I hated melee too, but it's really the only way to go early in this game. I got my hands on an Instigating, faster swing speed All-Star baseball bat, and surprisingly it was a blast beating the crap out of everything.
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs been a glitch for a while
---
The ammo converter is just painful in terms of user interface. I've always liked stealth in FO so I guess I'm biased but I think it's a good build, and you don't really need the CSS, with max sneak and one chameleon piece of armour I can avoid detection by most everything - but not assaultrons sadly
---
That's LIFE... (that's life...)
---
Tank killer is listed in those perks. Does it work better with glow sighted compared to ground pounder?
---
It‚Äôs a nice weapon for sure.  Barely got a shot of on the horde each wave.
---
The marine helmet and the tattered mole head offer plus 1 DR
---
Only two that I know about.
---
it doesn't in my experience.  also the one that gives u bonus xp for being on a team doesbt work either.  seems like very stupid planning.
---
two people playing the game in our house on ps4 wired in with super fast fibre broadband, one or both of us regularly get disconnected so clearly its a server issue.
---
My Bloodied Heavy PA build is pretty tanky, especially with the hidden health regen from life giver. It also puts out massive amounts of damage
---
Uh buddy
---
You can get an interpolator from literally any robobrain corpse 
---
Press the jump button while examining one, it should show a prompt too
---
Sorry concentrated fire. And swap tank killer/glow sighted depending on running a nuke zone or not. Lose ground pounder
---
I've taken serums with starched genes active. No problems for me.
---
Um, the Robobrain Interpolator isn't an item that spawns in the enemy's inventory, it's something you harvest off of them with a separate button prompt like the Viable Scorchbeast DNA. The prompt should be whatever the jump button is on your console.
---
Not a data miner, but for me it mostly seems to be about time. The body disappears at time X and turns into a meat pile,  then at time Y, meat pile disappears to leave loot behind.
---
Or a number...I like to have it at top of the list. Example...1. T 60 Nuka Cola. (Skin) 2. T 51. Camo
---
Near water.  Set up as many water purifiers as you can. Easy caps.
---
It‚Äôs more of the wasted time from loading screens. If the camp is lame then it‚Äôs just like wow whata waste of time
---
Yeah, I always run around with canned dog food and some water because of this. AFK for a few minutes and you starve and can't fast travel. I have speed demon as well, which makes it worse. But flip side, I save a lot onstims because of healing factor.
---
Google is your friend for building a good character.
---
I like to "adopt" low level players and help as much as I can
---
?
---
You get caps from those?
---
From a fellow fly off the handle get banned type ...you can repeal the ban by responding with a 250 character "essay" on what the ban taught you and how you'll be better next time.
---
It's hard but fuck those fucking shitbird players like that!
---
I'm aware of how to get it in the quest... I know it's possible to get it outside of the quest via the method I described... this is what I'm asking about.
---
Ok thank you so much for taking the time out of your day to answer my questions, have a great day/night and rest of your life

To be specific Appalachia was never directly hit by the Nukes, this is why there's still trees and plants in the area only 25 years after the Great War, However Appalachia was affected by the shockwaves of the Nukes that hit the other states like Maryland and Virginia. It's not like China had an unlimited supply of nukes so they only aimed for places of major interest
---
Perks like serendipity and ricochet, and blocker are much better than perks like evasive.
---
You get a chance (which it turns out is really high with full luck AND unyielding armour) to avoid all damage or all ranged damage.  
---
Dodgy is okay for ones that get through as is blocker.
---
A flat percentage chance to take no damage or a flat percentage damage reduction turns out better than a high DR.
---
I see.
---
So, I know you can't get additional slots from other characters' levels, but you can still share the perk itself across the entire account, right?
---
So, if my level 300 character has the +5 Charisma legendary perk, will my other characters get access to that as well?
---
I'm aware.  I've been told that it IS in their inventory (even if you don't see it) and has spawned on the ground for a few players to pick up as a normal item.  This is what I'm trying to trigger.
---
No problem, you too
---
I don't think the items being on the ground will work with the robobrain interpolator since you have to actually hit the prompt button to extract it from the robobrain corpse after you kill it.
---
What would be a good combo for full hp build? Unyielding is for Bloody build only I guess

---
I definitely wouldnt use the word pointless, but finishing returns are correct. 
---
It specifically comes up when people talk about Vanguard-ing ss arnor. Damage reduction percentages are actually better. Like zealot and exterminator, etc.
---
More DR is always technically better. But at some point, its like having 5000 gummy bears,  and you can either have 10 more or you can have better damage or a qol....
---
I personally like to sit around 400. At one point I had 700, and when I switched to damage red over more DR, I could really tell the difference.
---
Basically yes, but sometimes it just disappears and leaves no loot.  Something is specifically causing certain bodies to leave loose loot.
---
The marine armor helmet doesn't have any DR.
---
My tank/Melee would have to disagree...
---
yep as mentioned below its placement of the tent between the car out front and the gap in the wall, funniest thing i saw during was when the scorched all spawned above the generator someone blew them all up and they all just flew across the screen in a big ball and landed like that near the asylum building. Its fun to use the fatman for this event on a private server though otherwise everyone else would lose out on xp.
---
Vanguard is one of good ones for full health.
---
for all of Fallout the Deathclaw has always been my favorite, but as for 76 i love the Megasloth. such an awesome addition to the bestiary, shame they aren't going to exist outside of 76.
---
Ah well turns out a friend wanted them. Plus I dropped them near my base and now i wasnt able to find them so idk
---
I know of at least 2 people (on console) who claim to have had one that they were able to display (and you can't display the quest one). This is the only method I can think of that would allow that to happen (similar to Ward's quest items).
---
I'm starting to think not all servers have all legendary effects on their drop list. Which means you shouldn't craft any usss armor until you see an unyielding drop happen on that server.
---
Ah well nothing happened yet so I'm happy. And I wasnt able to find em after an hour so idk
---
I already dropped them and I cant find em anymore. But I have 50 of both for sale
---
Yes I'm on xbox
---
I don't think it was hit directly because I remember the bombs only targeted major cities and west Virginia dosen't have any I think the nuclear fallout was what caused the mutations. Although I think at least 10,000 bombs dropped on America they were all low yield beneath 1 megaton  so I think alot probably fell around west Virginia  like in Washington and in Pennsylvania. The nuclear fallout was absorbed by the plants and animal's mutating them into what they are now.

That‚Äôs just Todd checking up on you

Oooooook, that's kinda dope

I've never found bloodied to be a good pair with a melee character
---
How many deaf or hearing impaired people play?
---
Idk man, I'd say get rid of em
---
Mr Five by Five!
---
I got rid of basically all of the maps except 50 for both personal use and sale
---
I dropped all but 50 of each
---
I love tapped a level 160 with my gat at SBQ(level 49) Every high level ofc was sitting up on a floating survial camp saving ammo. I pulled out Gat laser and ended doing most the work after pming everyonr to get down. I managed to graze this dude in full power armour. He proceeded to chase me down half a mile and kill me. Bruh.
---
Ah ok
---
This. Atom Shop paint should remove Power Armor from the list when scrapping.
---
To be clearer... this is how I believe it is possible to get a non-quest version of the item, during that part of the quest.
---
I rename mine like this #T-51b POWER ARMOR. I like having them at the top of the apparel list, sometimes I need to jump into it quickly and not having to scroll down is helpful.
---
Wait till you come across 4 level 70+ fog crawlers at Dolly Sods. Now that is scary and frustrating lol
---
Do you have any general advice for leveling with this build? I not new but also not very informed on the ins and outs of this game.
---
Tell that to a sting wing
---
People could of dropped him the plans
---
it was probably a duper on an alt
---
Running 50 at airport currently, not a good idea for camps tho they bug out if you scrap it or move camp. Workshops only is best, airport best choice as lots of flat areas.
---
Wow thanks üôÑ
---
Really? I how would I be able to verify that?
---
today was weird i did the watoga high school halloween event and the mask stayed on afterwards
---
There's no pvp in the game if you have pacifist on, FYI
---
Not new. I saw something similar 2 or 3 months ago.
---
All legendary perks are already unlocked. You get them for free but you can have 6 or 7 slots to fill those with legendary cards. You unlock slots by your highest lvl character on not your levels added up as a whole. If someone upgrades a card to any level and then you swap characters they won‚Äôt be able to get that card the same level for free but instead need to sacrifice normal cards too. What I want is a system where if one of your characters max a card then all your characters can used the max one too.
---
pro tip: you don't just get them off brood mothers but get them when you scrap gauntlets as well which frequently drop from Miners in the ash heap or during uranium fever
---
Armorer lv2 and lv3 reduce your junk cost and increase durability of your created item.
---
but thus is not my point, I'm discussing whether Intelligence point itself or armorer perk affect the durability of  legendary weapon  abd SS armor crafting.
---
I think the link does a pretty good job at showing the Leveling Map at the bottom typically. 
---
Generally, focus on STR &amp; AGI at first. Don‚Äôt worry about Luck Perk Cards, get those after level 42. Cause then you can pick LCK: Bloody Mess, Class Freak and Starched Genes. You can max out serendipity as early as possible because it‚Äôll help when u are low health.
---
What's even better???? I had a perfectly flat section of train tracks, in my camp, that I was dying to put the train car. NO Fing GO, intersects an existing object, finally got it to place by turning it 90 degrees and moving it close to scorch who snipe it. 
---
When it breaks can't jump on the broken pieces either.

---
Been a bug since launch, it's the only way to collect the mask as a collectible. But, it has restrictions in use
---
Will I get banned for possessing these? Should I open them?
---
It never is quite cut and dry, and there are countries out there *(great example being Australia)* that have governing bodies and consumer laws companies must adhere to. Not everyone is fortunate enough to be covered by such laws, following the terms of service is the players best bet if they want to stay within legal rights. Creating chargebacks is a great way to risk *(small risk)* losing not only your Bethesda account but also your Xbox Live or PSN account if paid through those services.
---
Learned that through Blizzard when I created a chargeback for Modern Warfare *(same story, jerked around)* and lost my account in the process. It's not a system to be abused lightly, which is why I didn't recommend it to OP.
---
Didn't mean to come across as denying such resources exist aha
---
Unarmed is way better than one-handed, especially after you add mutations
---
I want a friendly Super Mutant for our camps
---
hey let me help you out! what ammo do you need?
---
Tbh I'd open them, you shouldn't get banned for that
---
Ok, thanks
---
You won't be banned
---
Too many presents duped and used to ban the users, dupers, and holders
---
Shotgun, my bad
---
I think There are 3 locations you have to tame your animal at(and spawns are random) to get it to become a camp pet.  There are some YouTube videos that show where/how.
---
m8, both the handmade and lever action are very good rifles for rifleman build, and best of all they are both maxed at level 45. so, 5 more levels will get you there. once the double xp ends try using other xp boosting items. take a nap at your camp before venturing and if you can eat canned meat stew, available feom the feed the people event, they both add a bonus xp. 
---
I was leveling up my mule this weekend and completing riding shotgun event got me from 48 and a half to 50. so I guess that would be a nice event to farm xp, weapons and caps.
---
happy to help but in the future mayhaps research a bit for solutions before advocating to remove entire playstyles.  Some people actually enjoy pvp, and the game provides options like pacifist mode to help those that don't.
---
the exe for steam and the beths launcher are different maybe something got installed incorrectly, glad it‚Äôs sorted now
---
Oh
---
I want more dead spooky trees for my spooky camp.
---
This is the best advice. Use vats to hit the legs and time the laser. Use cover and run if you have to. She has to recharge after she shoots the FULL stream.
---
&gt; Perception affects your VATS hit chances and the ability to detect stealth movements.
---
I've got 15(+4) PER and a 95% Lever Action Rifle that would like to have a word with you about this üòÇ
---
Op have you sent them a ticket? It's more likely to be noticed by the right people if you do, I don't think Bethesda tech support gets to read everything that gets posted on reddit
---
I'm bloodied and vanguard keeps coming up, that or assassins üòí
---
Congrats bud!
---
God that‚Äôs impressive man.
---
Scrap all weapons and armor to get plans to modify them. It‚Äôs the only way to learn 90% of the plans for them. If you don‚Äôt have a permanent camp area yet or don‚Äôt mind rebuilding just loot a place and pick everything up to scrap and place a workbench wherever to scrap it.
---
Would rather have new more interesting dialog and or the ability to have multiple companions whether or not we're still limited to 1 daily.
---
Ok, let me put this straight. After a bunch of testing I can say that:
---
*It works* at 100%. Checked it on mobs I kill the most and know how nuch xp they usually give, and it really does. Just yesterday I was getting 2600+xp from a lvl 68 super mutant vs 2300+xp with 75% buff.
---
But! If someone opens another lunchbox in your team near you, it stops giving any bonus xp. It still says 100% bonus xp in the status window, but it doesn't give any. Checked it after someone at a public event opened three boxes in a row while I was at 75%. I started getting the regular 1300+ xp from a lvl 68 mutie after that which was kinda sad but I only lost 1 LB that way. Me and two of my friends used 1 LB each prior to that. After that a fourth guy joined the team and we ended up at the same event where they supposedly decided to make everyone a favor opening three in a row for everyone to rejoice... Only to bork up out already present buffs.
---
Also,I can confirm that when the time of the excess buffs passes and you get rolled back to your initial bonus, you start to get the right amount of xp from your non-glitched buff once again. For example: you already opened 3 lunchboxes in a row for 75% and a teammmate opens 2 more boxes near you half an hour after you opened yours. It makes an overflow beyond 100% and for the next half an hour you won't get any bonus xp from it. After the buff you applied falls off in half an hour, it rolls back to 75% which your teammate boxes gave you and you will proceed receiving 75% bonus xp for the next half an hour.
---
The giant sheepsquatsch plushie.
---
You got that right.
---
Zealots Mole Miner Gauntlet with +40% swing speed and +1 Strength has been working phenomenally for me. 1,900 damage per head hit when sneaking and I can usually get off about 10-20 hits before being detected.
---
‚ÄúI like you aries, but you‚Äôre freaking me out‚Äù
---
I just came to disagree about the combat rifle being inferior to the fixer, the fixer is purely a vats gun but the combat can be used much more comfortable as a run and gun commando weapon for people that like to aim down sights on automatic fire.
---
Yes the damage on the fixer is a little higher but if you're a commando and don't use vats it doesn't matter as you won't maintain as many hits as you could with a combat rifle. 
---
Before you downvote try it yourself...
---
I definitely think vats isn‚Äôt calculating damage property. On my stealth vats rifleman i could one to two shot most enemies without critical hitting. Now it sometimes takes three or four hits. Outside of vats I get better damage. Iv not changed anything with my perks and my weapons either. 
---
From what little i tested today. It looks like the game could possibly be showing the bullet hit but not registering the damage. Maybe its related to whatever bug is causing the vats accuracy issues. 
---
Iv also noticed since the duping hotfix. On my heavy gunner sometimes my guns make the firing animations but nothing comes out. Its done it on my gatling gun, gatling laser and gauss minigun. So maybe the hot fix busted something
---
Are ya running the ammo making perk plus super duper?
---
I've tamed dozens of different pets and this dog was at the Cranberry Glade marker, the same place I get all my pets from. He just never made it home. :\ Sucks too because in dozens of deathclaws and sloths that was the one and only dog I've ever seen.
---
Don't feel bad, I was level 150 when I realized I could scrap things at Power Armor stations.
---
*unzips pants*
---
Sludge fucking Lung
---
I have just tried with below status on crafting normal combat armor:
---
4 Intelligence without armorer  perk
---
4 Intelligence with armorer perk
---
around 30 intelligence by equipping unyielding set and with  mutation with and without armorer perk
---
the durability length is definitely the same and only varies among extra condition.
---
not having tested with PA yet because  T65 is not a legendary item and I dont have the plan neither.
---
Tired of making new character, i mean try new games like cyberfunk and more of real world activities.
---
LMAO PVP in Fallout 76 was highly advertised until foodies and crybabies ruined it, idiot
---
Always I never craft ammo without it. The legendary perk for ammo will help but I feel like it still needs a slight buff.
---
They were probably waiting for it to land, supposedly it lands quicker if you don‚Äôt shoot it. Yea you accidentally hit someone they won‚Äôt hesitate, it‚Äôs petty.
---
Saw over 15 at power plant when passing through.
---
I‚Äôve been trying to do the dude with minigun without PA, it not just looks silly but is also squishy af in SBQ fights, I frequently die without apparent reason lol. PA, although lacks legendary features and carry less weight, is still tankier than normal armors in boss fights, especially with Emergency Protocols on the torso.
---
Maybe. Also, maybe the legendary mirelurk kings.
---
I appreciate you. I haven't quite yet, but plan to. Not really coming to Reddit specifically to make changes, just voice the opinion.
---
I really wish the cryptids were beefier encounters. I feel bad with how badly I slaughter some of them despite how menacing some of them look.
---
Sheepsquatch is pretty balanced all around tho. Nice and beefy but not a slog to deal with.
---
Bruh, 74 pieces of SS RIGHT Legs and only ONE two star unyilding armor (+ 1 charisma).   
---
 It needs to be tradeable. For real.
---
crafting flamers yields more fuel than actually crafting fuel
---
The Overseer recording in Wastelanders (the one that starts The New Arrivals) also doesn't have subtitles, and that's a key part of the plot.
---
Yeah we know üòÇ
---
I love stealing kids candy at the monster mash. XD
---
I hope you do get around to passing it on to them, my hearing is failing so I can relate 100% I usually have to mute my party chat if I'm doing story stuff with holotapes.
---
I‚Äôve had mine in small places as well and they‚Äôve done that lol. It‚Äôs annoying!
---
Metric aside, it's about accessibility. That's like asking how many paraplegics go to restaurant before you decide to build a ramp. It's hurtful, really.
---
Yes sir.  I got 6 purifiers going.  30 caps a run. It‚Äôs not fast caps but if you stay on top of emptying them you can bank caps while grinding.  Or store the water and cash them all in later
---
Why in the world do you think deaf people can‚Äôt or should not be expected to play video games?
---
You should pass it up as well! The more tickets, the merrier.
---
They should add that to the fallout first tent, then put the one we have now up for permanent sale in atomic shop.
---
Shit, I bought it just before reading this.
---
I hadn't noticed, but I certainly don't doubt it. It sucks.
---
Oh man. I feel like I‚Äôve stopped by this base before, thought it was brilliant. Either that, or deja vu. Small world. I was on my way to Site Bravo and this camp was the closest.
---
Looking for cyberfunk also.
---
Yeah, but you can counteract it by eating food that adds rads right before trying to travel. Not great, but it works most of the time.
---
I already submitted one months ago but maybe it's time for another.
---
Remember in fallout 4 that Deathclaw that was living on a Terrace in one of the skyscrapers? My son tricked me into going up there for treasure, when I got off the elevator and got ambushed, I let out a yelp, buttered my cheeks and jumped of the side of the building to my death, all in slow motion
---
Man we really need more cryogun / cryo grenade users.
---
I got a zealots fast reload Cryolator,  can't do much damage but gluing her to the floor for just that much longer vastly speeds up the encounter.
---
But seriously, do you at least remember the name if the holotape?
---
While it had cool lore, it was a good idea, and it had some fun mechanics, it was still a mess in implementation. I did the raid 1-2 times a week until its removal. So I didnt grind it out like some did. I participated in it when I felt like it, and had a team to do it
---
It was fun no doubt, but it got repetitive after the first few times at each difficulty level. And the numerous amounts of bugs in the mode led to a sour taste being left in most people mouths. Two of my friends were victims of the inventory deletion bug. And never got reparations for it. I heard some people did, but I have no idea if there is truth to that statement
---
If it wasnt such a mess overall, I'd agree with you that it was some top tier content. But personally I still believe Nuclear Winter on launch is one the best content drops. It was a good imagining of the battle royale. And even though  it's only gotten 1 major, and a few minor updates, it's still a competent mode in it's own right
---
you never forget your first scorchbeast :D  
---
  
---
my first ws quite the same story. was quite forced into the fight, took about 30 minutes and i ended up with like 4 bullets and 0 aid items left and got just crap from her. but it was so satisfying to down an enemy in a hard fight.
---
You got some low CHR. I sell my purified water for 5 caps each so one run with my 6 purifiers gets me 150 caps.
---
I think they will add plenty of extra dailies, weeklies, and double score bonuses throughout the season to help those that can't play everyday. I wouldn't worry too much IMO.
---
Oof that would be a shite situation to have one of those spawn near the bush you‚Äôre hiding in...
---
If you are on a team or you can join one when in the bug and a team member FTs to another event it should release you and let you respawn.
---
Are you serious?! Nooo, that‚Äôs not a thing is it? Haha.
---
Get after it!
---
I haven‚Äôt tried that how much does it yield?
---
They added assaultrons in last update too
---
They're horrifying and I love having them in there
---
Same! Damn right leg is the only piece I can‚Äôt get
---
everytime you craft one it makes it full ammo, I forgot how much exactly, I think flamers hold like 300? you get a full clip for each one you make
---
Still waiting also been a little over a week
---
Damn... well at least it's not just me who's been forgotten lol
---
once I read that your fast travel spot is related to where you placed your device for the first time. changing its position change where visitors spawn. but I cant confirm all this. It needs further clarification...
---
They were in the Morgantown map from the start. I haven't seen one in months thankfully. It's awful to spawn and have her kill you quick
---
A lot of people don't realize you can farm legendaries from the hordes! It's so disappointing when you've gotten around 4 straight, then some goof shows up and kills the low level alpha for a trash legendary. Try to hop on world chat, but usually too late.
---
&gt; Why can't you find a transcript of the holotape online? 
---
Why should anyone need to?  We all paid for the game.  Googling for dialogue doesn‚Äôt seem like a great gaming experience. It‚Äôs not like this is a special request... as you point out, the game has ‚Äúsubtitles for everything.‚Äù  Someone wrote the script for that radio drama, so it‚Äôs already typed up. Why not add the subtitles?  It‚Äôs not just a mistake; someone chose to display ‚Äúradio drama plays.‚Äù  So it does seem lazy. And hopefully we all understand why subtitles are important; skipping some does feel insensitive, and wrong.
---
They removed it for a reason.. people weren‚Äôt playing it
---
Charleston hearld exclusive: the motherloade
---
Sorry, put the phone away for my own sanity for a few days... No, I am still having this most infuriating problem with no end in sight. Opened three separate tickets, the first two were closed from Bethesda‚Äôs end with no response even, and the second got bumped to devs after they told me to fully uninstall and reinstall the whole damned game and that didn‚Äôt fix it. Now, I‚Äôm just sitting here with Bethesda‚Äôs dick up my ass, hoping it doesn‚Äôt last another 10 days. Any luck on your end? (I ask before I read the whole thread... haha!)
---
It doesn‚Äôt prevent the mutation? I never knew that.
---
My problem is still here too, for the record....
---
It's still stuck in your stored, eating up storage space. You can't delete it from the storage tab either, because it doesn't show up.
---
lol I was like 110 or so before the run began and now I am 205... Maximum xp builds and grinding are a hell of a thing hahah
---
I've made over a hundred chest pieces.  Not one.
---
Plenty of nocturnal ones tho.  And all the other ones that nobody ever wants, or uses, and that Bethesda should just remove from the game.
---
same here. i moved the device and like OP said, i also keep spawning in different places. someone please help!
---
Lmao I hope they surprise us with ACTUAL companions, maybe during expeditions. Notice how they didn‚Äôt call it allies in the roadmap. May be overthinking haha.
---
NEW POST WITH FULL TEXT, sorry must've hit upload while I was trying to copy it and deleted the whole entire post. My bad.
---
I got a mutant horde in the bog. Got around 20-30 kills for exp then some prick comes in and kill it in TWO SHOTS from a gauss shotgun. So he sucks, and he is an ass
---
You'd be better off making a list of stuff that isn't broken.
---
I do the same for my fellows üíú
---
But it always sucks when you realize the supposed low level you are trying to help out is actually just some level 300s mule account, and you get laughed at üôÑ
---
You can't stop stupid. Educate 1 and 2 more dumb dumbs will take their place. Stay ducked and hope no one shows up.
---
I try to tell them &amp; give the them thumps down for shooting but it normally never works. It‚Äôs a public game, so really can‚Äôt control how people act... you just hope they know what ur doing.
---
I loved doing vault 94 with my friends
---
If its wasted money to them to add some basic fucking subtitles to a holotape as it plays, then there's no real saving them.
---
Make a new character?
---
West Virginia was never hit. I'd assume they wouldnt nuke WV because there wasnt a tactical target in WV other than the silos. Surely China wanted to hit things that would really affect America such as federal buildings and larger cities. Also could be that destruction couldn't be absolute on account of the mountainous terrain. But ultimately I believe they didnt nuke WV just because there wasnt any key tactical targets within the state.
---
I main a stealth vats rifleman. Level 40 i would focus on getting a lever action. The plans should be buyable at watoga train station, the brotherhood robot vendor in watoga or the brotherhood vendor at whitesprings shopping center. Its the protectron in the room with the bear skin rug, hes standing right next to a mr. gutsy. 
---
Your gonna want to craft them and scrap them to get mods. You can do it now or wait until you get a maxed super duper in luck. For a chance to craft two for the price of one. I would at the least scrap a few to get the Hardened receivers and do the rest later.  
---
As a back up rifle I recommend the hunting rifle. It still does fairly well at that level.  Combat rifle/ fixer is a great secondary as well but with ammo being a pain at lower levels i would go with a hunting rifle as a backup. It runs different ammo and still does good damage. Also A lot of people say not too but the pipe revolver with a stock and the pipe bolt action with a stock also make good alternative weapons. Its not something you want to use as a main but its great for a fall back weapon. 
---
Now when you hit 50 you‚Äôll want to track down a legendary instigating lever action. Anti armor works as well but instigating is the best. Lever action  will be the best in terms of damage unless you want to use a gauss rifle which does count for the rifleman cards. It does ballistic damage, not energy. 
---
Personally i carry both but tend to use my lever action more. Ammo is more plentiful, reloads faster and doesn‚Äôt have that stupid charge up function. Also much better fire rate for when things hit the fan. 
---
Avoid two shot semi auto rifles. Inaccurate and just not worth it. Explosive can be a lot of fun, i have an explosive lever action but the upkeep cost is crazy bad. So definitely keep that in mind. 
---
Make sure to get maxed starched genes and class freak in luck. For mutations at the very least get marsupial to jump up onto buildings for better vantage point and if you can handle the increased food/water upkeep speed demon for faster movement speed and faster reloading.
---
I only started playing after Wastelanders, so I missed the vault raids, even if they were as broken as people said they were, I still find it stupid that Bethesda would remove any content from the game when its already lacking so much.
---
It depends on the day really
---
My whole profile was suspended, that would require me to make a new xbox account, and 60 bucks. I've already shelled out tons of money for atoms points and fallout 1st
---
lol.
---
This item on the ground thing happens to me all the time, I think it happens when you kill stuff, leave the body there till it turns into a pile, leave and come back later and instead of piles there‚Äôs the items on the ground from the pile after the enemies have respawned.
---
I noticed this happening in my private server, killed the mole miners outside of black water mine so I could use the benches, by the time I was done using the benches the mole miners were piles. Didn‚Äôt bother to loot them. Went on about my business and came back to the mine hours later to repair something and in the place of the piles was the items that were in said piles.
---
I also noticed this happen during Fasnacht. Killed the radtoads and eventually after doing so many loops of Fasnacht I noticed the rad toad eggs and random junk from the toads laying around in front of the restaurant.
---
(Actually found a clean red plate and a rad toad egg on top of it perfectly on the ground because of this, it was really neat.)
---
Then go over a 100k on 556 and see what happens
---
The Motherlode project was before the bombs fell. The Scorched didn't exist until a while after. The subtitles might be glitched out, but what actually happens in that tape is that the guard yells about the reporter having a gun, then the reporter is confused for a second before trying to call out that his recorder isn't a gun, but the guards shoot him.
---
In the exact same boat as you man. They go three and four days between responses and every time it's a new person who can't help. They also gave me the reinstall email.
---
What's worse is I just found out they applied FO1 to a totally separate account my SO uses that was bought through Bethesda. My account is on steam, fo1 was purchased on steam INGAME. But somehow got applied to the wrong account? Makes no sense. Haven't heard from them about it in four days now.
---
It‚Äôs like.. an obvious thing too. If I come up to a pile of bodies and a character twice my level... I should maybe take a moment to think
---
2020 game no text chat also, and PC mod is broken for some days üòî
---
Agreed.  I'm at 787 DR with only 1 SS piece, all Vanguard.  When I switch to my unyielding set(500ish DR) it seems like I can take roughly half the beating before getting into trouble.  I'm gonna keep pushing my DR as much as I can, 850 at least, only things that hurt at all are Gutsy's with their BS AA guns and the Imposter Squatch.  Rads too, but once I finish off my SS set that should be less of a problem.
---
Ah there‚Äôs one giant ass crater in the game, near one of the giant rail tower things leading out of the bog. It‚Äôs a place to nuke for the colossus.
---
Knowing how videogame development actually works, it's most likely a handful of people giving their feedback about bugs that really need to be fixed and then being waved off by management.
---
bethesda: no.
---
üò≤ I've been checking the wrong sundew grove. I've been checking Overgrown Sundew Grove not Sparse.
---
I‚Äôve never seen one thank God I didn‚Äôt know they were roaming the circle
---
I just want to point out that SuperDuper works with SS crafting so if you aren't already using it, do that now.
---
1: prior to the war, I'm unsure when. 
---
2: the scorched started after the coal fire started (if you sneak up on then you will occasionally hear them say things like 'warm again' )
---
3: you're correct, the region that 76 takes place in was mostly untouched, at least compared to other locations.
---
4: can you be a little more precise on what parts you mean?
---
5: the area has low rads to begin with, Infact of I remember correctly you can find notes and holos that imply the rads are going up as polluted water and such flows in.
---
Launch a nuke in private world, solo SBQ fight, got a 3‚òÖ junkie powerfist then put it into legendary machine at Watoga Station for 40 scripts.
---
-The motherloade was developed pre war, that holotape is from a pre-war journalist, that interaction was pre-war
---
-The scorched were around pre-war. Its caused by a fungus that grows deep deep underground. It also causes the growth of ultracite. Scorchbeasts were even developed pre-war, it was a military experiment, it wasnt the same as it is now though. 
---
-Appalachia wasn't hit hard by the war, if at all, the plauge only started to ramp up after the Enclave released the scorchbeasts in an effort to cause the United States defense system to enter the highest defcon level to gain access to launch nukes
---
I know this doesn't answer all your questions, nor does it fully answer every question. The wiki for 76 can help you answer everything
---
They pay them to cheer in their crowds, reddit would be super easy to do it in.
---
Something to play while you wait. You ain't missing much without fallout 1st
---
Check all the way in the back, where you got X-01. There was a longer thread about it here at some point.
---
Man lvl80 and you just hide in the bushes lol
---
Are you going for rank100 or you just log in quick for the score point
---
Nah, I didnt dupe, but I did grab stuff from my friends who did, so that's why I was probably flagged.
---
‚Ä¢ Complete the Wastelanders main quest line ASAP so that you can start earning gold bullion (used to purchase special items from different factions and some factions require you to earn alignment in order to unlock said items for purchase). 
---
‚Ä¢ Make sure to scrap legendary armor/weapons that you don‚Äôt need at the Legendary Exchange (located at train stations, train shaped icons on the map. These stations also have a NPC to buy and sell things from) to gain scrip. The scrip can be exchanged for more legendary items at Rusty Pick, essentially a recycling process. Figuring out which legendary rolls are worth your time can be difficult at first so I use(d)  https://fed76.info to help determine their worth. The values given may not be all that applicable since the market for selling items is in poor shape, but it‚Äôll help you know what is worth keeping/selling and what items are only worth scrip. 
---
‚Ä¢ You can level up forever so don‚Äôt stress too much about picking your perk cards but you stop getting special points at level 50. After 50, you get to choose between picking a perk card or reallocating 1 special point. 
---
‚Ä¢ Your best place to make friends are at events that are constantly taking place throughout the map (ones with an explanation point are best as they reward scrip for completing them) and joining teams. You‚Äôll eventually find players that want to do stuff together. My strongest bonds usually happen when I find players that also have a mic. 
---
‚Ä¢ Fast traveling costs caps. it is often helpful to travel to Vault 76 or your camp before traveling to a location, as you travel for free to both of these spots. Your camp can be placed almost anywhere, I like mine in the bottom right of the map as 76 is kind of up and to the left but enemies are harder there so stay in the green part of the map for a while. You can also fast travel for free on teammates and players on your friends list. This requires a little bit of planning but very helpful when playing with others. 
---
Uhhh. If you need something, it usually doesn‚Äôt hurt to ask for it here. Some players will offer it for free or tell you how to get what you‚Äôre looking for... but I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre aware at how ruthless people can be, so try google a few times before coming here. 
---
Yeah. I‚Äôm basically a newb myself so idk if this was all that helpful but feel free to message me with any questions. üôÇ
---
youre the typical cry baby trying to defend being a troll with no life. Many fallout fans wouldnt even touch this game at launch because of players like you. Idk what foodies have to do with anything at all here scrub
---
Like others said, you weren't actually in the event for some reason.  Happens to me all the time at Free Range in the forest and the SBQ.  Just have to rejoin through the event marker.
---
Did you dupe?
---
The question though, is exactly how long, and under what circumstances.  Sometimes there's stuff, sometimes there isn't. Do I have to wait X minutes/hours, or until X other enemy kills?  Does there have to be no players in the area during this time?  If I go back to check do I reset the clock/counter?  Is there a window where if you wait too long it goes away?  Does the server load need to be high (like during the big events where everyone is killing things more often)?  Just trying to reliably get it to work and having no luck so far.
---
And here I thought I was doing good at rank 37 ¬¶,)
---
No I didnt, I just grabbed stuff from my friends who did
---
They're so bizarre too, because they show up as a Friendly dot on your compass until they decide that it's time to kill.
---
Always been an issue - suck it up and spend the caps or risk not having participation credit.
---
My boy always put the tent up for this event every time it spawn we get 10k per wave.. 
---
I wonder if it a ban-able offense
---
That‚Äôs really good information. All I really pay attention to are the red blips
---
From what I heard, they put the rock over the door deliberately because people were glitching their way inside it.
---
Same for me. Very frustrating and has caused me to die many times.
---
Anybody try putting on the amusement park worker outfit to see if that fixes it?
---
It doesn‚Äôt annoyingly
---
Same i wanted the excsvtor paint so I lvled up twice
---
Not sure... I‚Äôd say try killing something, wait for it to become a pile, then leave the cell for an hour and come back and see if the items are on the ground. There was about an hour in between each Fasnacht and that‚Äôs when I‚Äôd noticed it. If an hour doesn‚Äôt work try waiting 2 before coming back. It kinda just happens randomly honestly.
---
Yeah, that's how I thought it was supposed to work. That every character gets the leveled up card. That sucks that it isn't that way, and definitely needs to be fixed.
---
There are a number of unhelpful subtitles in the game.  It's unfortunately not just one if I'm not mistaken.
---
I'm not hearing impaired, but I always put subtitles on in my games just to have an accurate transcript of what's being said.  That's one of the uses of subtitles besides just being an aid to people who might be unable to hear.
---
If your subtitles aren't an accurate transcription of what's being said, then it's useless to have them when a large amount of text has a less-than-helpful transcription as simple as "Radio drama plays", and it's also probably very unprofessional.  It should definitely be fixed.
---
Shame guess i'll override T-51 or X-01
---
This is sweet, if I were to walk by I‚Äôd totally think it was just another game POI.
---
I know that now.  I was talking about what I "knew" about the game before I started playing, just based on things I had read online.  PvP is still a thing if you claim a workshop, but I don't do that on public servers, because I have no interest in PvP.  As I wrote above, "It turned out the public servers were nothing like what I had read and imagined, and I have never had a bad experience there."
---
I found my new 3  star furious plasma gatling right when I hit 50 its became my new main just shredding everything solo'd a legendary sheepsquatch with it.
---
It was on a private server no one else was on it and i logged back in in under a minute the power armor wasnt on the ground where i crashed
---
I don‚Äôt see how it was my fault though i didn‚Äôt ask for the game to crash because i tried to drop my power armor
---
I love public teams. I was always a solo player and it wasn‚Äôt until recently that I got into teaming up and wow, it‚Äôs so much fun and has helped build the community (for me at least). Especially for events which I never tried doing before since I was so low leveled.
---
It does NOT work like you think. I bush hide a lot in NW and I found a nuke grenade. Made it to the last 5 alive and a team of two was beside my bush. I ran out and tried punching them with the intention of dying and dropping a nuke grenade at my feet to maybe get a cheeky kill. Perk only procs when you get downed, which means it‚Äôs completely worthless when playing solo because when you‚Äôre not in a team you die instantly instead of going down.
---
I was very pissed off about this. First time I tried having fun in this sh*tty game mode and the perk doesn‚Äôt work properly.
---
I could run dead in the water daily and still not be sick of it
---
That has been since launch of the game. Have "lost" multiple clears for this.
---
Best is to go in crouched and never, ever stand up. That way no one can see in the map.
---
Also check map frequently and if you see other players in the silo, hold back and see if they participate in clearing enemies. If they do, try to invite them to group. If they don't participate or accept your invite, go to another silo or switch servers.
---
If you do what you do then how can you expect people to be okay with you being a piece of trash ? The game itself would be better off without an entitled bum like you that does nothing productive
---
You can
---
As someone that just picked up the game (game pass pleb here) and is coming from 400+ hours in red dead online I am absolutely shocked at how nice people are, over at rdo 9 out of 10 times you say hi to a random veteran (or newbie for that matter) you get shot in the face, the first couple of times someone got near me in f76 I was terrified, but they kept giving me super helpful stuff and I was so confused and grateful
---
I should add- even if im underleveled for it i dont mind, just looking around mostly
---
Different strokes for different folks
---
Few of my friends loved the raid. But I guess raids from different games I played (destiny for example) have kinda set a high bar for me
---
H20 - top grade purified liquid.
---
Guessing it was to keep wastelanders stable and 76's hard drive requirement smaller.
---
Scorched beings might've not. But the plauge was, the fungus was. Which is why scorchbeasts existed pre war as disease carriers
---
Serums
---
Once you hit the robovender cap limit, that's it for them for the next 20 hours. Dailies and weeklies are your only other option unless you can sell to players from your camp vending machines

In September with patch 22

Oh its still a blueprint. Bit instead of finding it in world yoy find it behind credit card machine :)
---
Not really if the game didn‚Äôt crash as a result of me pressing the drop button i would have never been logged out and i would have been able to just pick it up again
---
Yeah, I was talking about that haha I just tried both floors and roofs and neither would let me place. Both snap, but it remains red. Pretty upsetting turnout heh

Go to https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10 there are two buttons on this page, you want to click "Update now" this will download the update assistant and get you to the latest version.

Hey, sometimes you have to pick pumpkins, not always that easy./s
---
It is fine as a commando weapon if auto pistols need more weapons they can add new ones.  I do agree it needs more mods.
---
I've had this bug happen a few times. Sometimes things that aren't free will show up as free on the Atomic Shop, though you won't be able to claim them.
---
Restarting the game sometimes makes them appear normally.
---
Can‚Äôt you sell the plans that you purchase? I‚Äôm sure people would trade some 3 star pieces for certain stuff over in marketplace? I‚Äôm sure this isn‚Äôt the amount of work you‚Äôre looking to put in but üí©
---
Come on how much easier can they make the game?
---
Get a gatling gun as a starter weapon when you hit around level 20. Uses 5mm ammo. does decent damage but the slow fire rate allows for more accuracy  and less ammo waste. The .50 cal and plasma gatling work great too. Don‚Äôt waste your time with gatling lasers until later levels when you have plenty of fusion cores to spare.
---
I both agree and disagree here. But I mean, I wonder how you set off their detection system. I came across some items from questionable sources, but no ban. I did get rid of them ASAP and kept 2, but sill
---
No offence but you can‚Äôt expect devs to fully cater to every minority. There‚Äôs too many to keep up with.
---
‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt I be a trans woman ghoul!! This is discrimination!! ‚Äú lol
---
You are definitely not the only one.
---
You cannot sell or trade anything bought with gold. Not even plans
---
Stims, excess amount of chems and whatever I can get my hands on.
---
So you‚Äôre telling me that i should be afraid of my game crashing every time i go to drop any item, you‚Äôre an idiot mate the game crashed because i pressed the drop button you cant tell me that i asked the game to crash its not meant to happen its a bug
---
I just spent 10 modules making a SS Left leg and got a really good unyielding roll, I go to put it on and realise I already had a great left leg and was meant to make a right leg instead... derp
---
Mireluk Kings ae my number 1 nemesis.
---
Camden Park is good around that level.  15 or so level 20-30 Scorched and the dailys give mad xp.  Not much danger, vendor bot right there to sell all their guns to and Mr. Fuzzys everywhere.
---
* bethesda i have nothing to do after reaching rank 100 during 3rd week out of 10, please fix*
---
I mostly sell my extra AID items.
---
I think the rank 100 inferno set that overrides the model should
---
No it doesn't. It'll make the sound and show the animation pop up, but it doesn't create an additional item, it's the same for the gauss weapons.
---
Ok, thank you!
---
I was in my early 500s and climbed up to 620+ during the double-xp. Just finished the season yesterday, getting 1.5-2.5mil xp per day and seeing those levels rush forward at the speed of sound was pretty damn incentivizing to play the game last few days.
---
Gonna be quite a downer to get back to regular 660xp for a lvl 68 supermutant without the double-xp buff and the lunchboxes (the rest of which I will definitely keep for the next event) vs 2600+ I was getting with all the buffs on...
---
I don't really think I will continue play until new content drops since daily challenges no longer give any progress towards cosmetics after level 100 of the season.
---
Any weapon ‚Äúnon stared‚Äù and H2O.
---
I server hop whenever some try hard with a legacy weapon he mooched off his friends tries to claim my workshop, last I checked you have to claim the workshop all over again if the owner server hops
---
I wish it came back kinda like the burrows
---
Been grinding west tek burrows and my god, the burrows is awsome
---
If uranium fever is on the weapons there are easy to sell out the vendor. Otherwise I sell excess radaway, radx and super stims. Usually get plenty from events. Purified water is also a great choice at your camp
---
:(
---
kinda bs for you to say that a deaf person should just google the transcript. they shouldn‚Äôt have to do that in the first place? and if you disagree whatsoever... nuh uh
---
Some people are actually trying to do the event and not farm it for legendaries. Everyone‚Äôs allowed to play the game the way they want. Not how you want them too.
---
Someone pls explain in detail. After reading the comments, I get the feeling that the horde alpha just makes babies with magic.
---
Anytime!
---
Sweet, thanks
---
Thematically it makes sense. The Great War was really around oil and the like. The main component of one of the fastest ammo consuming items in the game
---
So you knowing participated in spreading duped items. What‚Äôs the difference?
---
Atom skin
---
My point in asking was there is no way he could know. Most people who are hearing impaired (like myself) or deaf don't generally play with too many people, if anybody else at all.
---
I think it‚Äôs like a damage amount has to take you into the negatives or smthn
---
Horde events normally mean: Kill the Alpha and the event is completed. However, if you don‚Äôt kill the Alpha, then the horde will keep spawning, enabling you to farm XP &amp; legendaries.
---
Purified water from my 6 industrial purifiers, scrap that I don't need, food that's about to expire, extra stimpaks or rad aways if I have over 100, all drugs aside from grape mentats.
---
Blocker helps, but I'd also take a radaway as well before facing ghouls. But now I just use a bloodied combat shotgun to deal with ghouls on my melee build.
---
I may be wrong abput the scorchedbeast, I know the Enclave had two sets of projects on them. If I remember it correctly the bats that would become scorchedbeasts were encountered pre war in the AMS mining sites. As the AMS sites had ultracite veins that were connected to the underground caves where the scorched fungi subsided. The Enclave then had two different projects involving them. The first project was just exposing the infected bats to radiation, and something to do with ultracite. That mutated them, it was shelved after. Until they resumed it and made them even bigger and more dangerous to trigger a DEFCON response
---
So yea, the scorchedbeast didnt exist pre-war, but its pre-evolution form did, as well the plauge/fungi itself
---
I‚Äôm sure YOU aren‚Äôt there main agenda.  Just wait. They are poring over data logs for a lot of people who duped or bought duped weapons. Buying a duped weapon is the worst part as it was a good price and all but rules are rules.  I don‚Äôt trade or buy weapons because of this.
---
Mostly Chems, i hoard a lot of them as i use the Chemist Backpack (Or traveling pharmacy as a perk) and sell most of them, i do still leave some for me or my vendor.
---
Usually the 20-30 shitty legendaries I'm left with at the end of the day and all the stimpacks/radaway I earn.
---
Looks good just need a bow with increased VATS now.
---
Dat ass
---
To be fair with the legendary run we are there for the XP, the grind is real.
---
You won't get banned, lol.  The same thing happened with 'Stings and Things' a while back and 'Play Time' still does it.  Not your fault you want to clear your quest board and it keeps coming back.
---
yeah, no, it's still actively happening. I literally just caught someone. Do you have any proof of anti cheating system happening? or is this statement just based on anecdotal evidence?
---
Gotcha
---
I literally acknowledged that in my comments. This isn‚Äôt a rant post, just a How To post so those some people can learn.
---
I store them in my stash and cash them in right before I log off.  Going for the big payout
---
Loved it and a shame raids are closed and we have a few vaults with no content.
---
I‚Äôll say I‚Äôve had one asshat try to steal the silo from me. Didn‚Äôt happen because I was more than willing to let the timer run out, and silo lock up with no launch. So neither of us carded. They finally left, and I launched. I have run in to silos after people have been in for awhile. I‚Äôll usually go see if they are ok, and try to help out if I think they need it. Then I give them a thumbs up at the end, and let them launch the nuke. It‚Äôs theirs, and I wouldn‚Äôt take it.
---
Oh for fuck‚Äôs sake. I said in one of my emails with the support guy, ‚Äúdoes Todd Howard literally want me to beg? Well here I am. Please, please, may I have the content that I paid for?‚Äù
---
No response....
---
And my wife unintentionally rubs her 1st in my face by dropping her tent for me when we‚Äôre out and about and I have an over encumbrance problem. ‚ÄúThanks babe, but my stash box is full...‚Äù I say...üòÇ
---
This is eerily close to the RP in my head too. ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
Yea I'm sure that's the reason.
---
Confirmed by wiki, bombs dropped 77, scorchedbeast was created 83
---
Yeah itd probably be best to get back up on health before dealing with stuff like that, even with full health they were extraordinarily difficulty to deal with with my power first. The way I'm build now makes it so I just go into combat with all my buffs instead of leaving with buffs cause of all the base and rad damage I get from them. Of course the big downside of this change is the spontaneous and brutal deaths I experience.
---
Max out Pack Rat , Traveling Pharmacy and Thru-Hiker. Scrapper is good, Gunsmith is good. Don't spec more than 1 rank into each damage card ( Rank 1 gives 10% , Rank 2 is 15%, Rank 3 is 20% , hard diminishing returns. ) Have fun, do quests and explore.
---
those fuckers are the real threat of the wasteland fuck the scorched plague.
---
Its a shame, I had heard about the vault raids before I started playing and was really looking forward to getting high enough to give vault 94 a try, I wasn't even aware they had been removed until about a month into Wastelanders.
---
I think its more about him having a opinion on a game he hasn't personally played. Its stupid I know but what are you going to do?
---
Yeah that will be maybe 2 double exp in the future lol.
---
I used to wonder why so many people had a water farm but I get it now late game when I'm always using thru-hiker 3 and using water to heal. Why not sell off the excess.
---
It hasn't been fixed, nor will it probably ever be. It's a latency issue, not a bug.
---
That is amazing! Hope I run into you in game at some point!
---
The mask stays on.
---
It took me a minute to realize you meant literal hackers and not just people who have the perk to hack terminals

you sure take a long time to say nothing.

Who knew the real threat of the wasteland were things that were literally scorched instead of a plague named after it.

---
I always spawn a little to the west of my camp, about.. maybe 30 or 40 feet outside of the circle.
---
Seem like we are going to be on an endless grind of seasons and that is going to be a key reward, the odds of them making the craftable seems like zero.  If anything they may become an item (purchasable with atoms ) I would prefer not\_
---
Started out hiding in Bushes just to get the S.C.O.R.E.
---
Then I saw how easy it is to level up like that, so I figured I'd shoot for the moon and get the Hellfire Power Armor since it's my favorite Power Armor in the entire Fallout universe.
---
You lose the uny bonus in PA, aswell your backpack carry capacity. Use calibrated shocks.
---
Yes but I would only do that once you have Settlers to the point were they are also saying make a choice. Because it is easier to earn rep with them this way. Once BOTH are saying make a choice then go ahead
---
It is solid for XP, but my god is it annoying.
---
Still you need the selling perk, makes it so much more worthwhile. I usually run out of vendor caps, so I buy stuff just to sell more stuff.
---
Try r/marketplace76 using the format ‚Äú[PC] W: B Power Fist H: whatever your best offer is‚Äù

I us√© all this weekend, and pay user 10k for open 4 near me, and westek westek and Mor√© westek, 2k XP for supermutant level 68 I up a lot level and score
---
Excellent work!
---
You sure do take a long time to say nothing.
---
My issue is not my carry weight. Right now it is under the max value and I still walk insanely slow.
---
Using grenades or a flamer may simply char it rather than cook it through. If you must be eating weird post apocalyptic bugs you'd want to cook it right through. Not that that would get rid of the rads but hey.
---
You have a fusion core with you, too?
---
Try and find you a non-explosive. And I didn‚Äôt see anybody mention this one yet, Blocker. I didn‚Äôt find out about having blocker until I was over 250. And I also use level III nerd rage, and I‚Äôm not bloodied. From what I‚Äôve heard everyone says it‚Äôs a perk more geared for bloodied players, but it‚Äôs saved my ass more times than I can remember. GL man
---
Yep, just shoot at your feet and rads for days and most people don't know the Gamma gun in Fallout 76 does Ballistic damage as well as rads and Bloodied makes it nasty.
---
One does not speak of this in public
---
Fat mans and missles are weak as hell...
---
fat man's are not a good weapon and neither are missile launchers, it's just one robot and if you cant kill it go level up somewhere else and get better weapons
---
Will be a problem until bethesda does something about it.  You should get loot from all legendary enemies that spawn if you participate in the event.
---
Yep they ruin NW
---
Bro you're a life saver I just took it out and put it back in and I can run again!
---
Semantics !!
---
I get this with my fixer too, it thinks they're dead and exits vats, then I have to go back in and kill them again
---
I've been going through way more ammo lately

That's my full health pa heavy gunner build. I run vamps most of the time and junkies for big fights
---
I've never seen a troll reply to themselves so many times before.
---
Are you on Xbox? If so, I'll run a silo with you and I'll make sure you drop your nuke...
---
yeah do you have a fusion core in? sounds like your problem to me
---
Honestly you should only use purified water to make Adhesive, and sell the rest. 
---
My best advice? Plant 4 tatos, 4 mutfruit, and 8 corn. If possible use the Green thumb perk and super duper perk. That way you get 8 tatos, 8 mutfruit and 16 corn each time.make adhesive until you run out of mutfruit/tatos, then use the remaining corn to make corn soup with boiled water. You should end up with
---
4 to 6 adhesive and 8 to 12 corn soup. If you dont need adhesive at the moment just make corn soup. Since soups fill both food and drink bars, it frees up carry weight so you can stop using thru hiker.
---
yeah, at least they fixed a majority of the other issues in adventure mode, but nuclear winter has kind of become the elephant in the room. It's like I said, I actually enjoy NW, I love finding a group that just clicks and kicking some real ass, but judging that we're still being team wiped by hackers under the floors and the fact the title still has the word "beta" on it, it would just be nice to see a roadmap. Am I right?
---
just means someone else has been there who's a lower level, if you try a private server and go those places you can see the level enemies you'll spawn
---
If you‚Äôre trying to take them out using the same weapon you use on everything else, it‚Äôs probably not going to work. Frag grenades. Pulse grenades. Or mines. They are deadly and meant to that way. Requires a little thought and tactics
---
I agree. I actually made a CAMP blueprint that can be easily put down at site or workshop that simulates a Survival Tent with workbenches: [https://youtu.be/sQVTgM\_emzY](https://youtu.be/sQVTgM_emzY)
---
Have to work on your build. Your not one shotting everything at level 19 or surviving high level attacks at level 35. Once you have your build and half decent weapons you‚Äôll be obliterating assaultrons and wondering how u ever struggled. Keep up the fight.
---
I had one in as well as 11 extra fully charged but what I did to fix it was drop all my cores and pick them back up
---
The last sentence in my post is literally 'it still happens.' 
---
Anyone who is aware of the cheat tool these people use are aware that the tool is busted and Beth's anti cheat implements in update 20 make it hard to recreate. 
---
Any cheaters you're seeing now are using the old tool (almost instant ban) or a paid exclusive tool, which makes cheaters naturally more rare.
---
Kmj
---
Plus for 1 DR, you're better off using the headslot for a mining helmet with the bright mod.
---
An adhesives farm sounds legit. If I wasnt using carnivore to max out exp gains with canned meat stew I'd eat the produce on the fly.
---
Id say crossbow can beat gauss shotgun, over 300 dmg in 1sec  combined, hitting chest only with 3 bolts
---
10am EST on July 20th
---
Glad to know it wasn‚Äôt just me lol
---
Those two weapons suck. Pulse grenades and mines do a shit load of damage to robots
---
weird? I've never had that glitch happen to me but I don't use PA all that often, glad it could be resolved :) üëç
---
Aah in that case make equal number corn mut and tatos. I'd still get the green thumb perk to double the produce you pick, and super duper 3 to increase your crafting output. Adhesive is always a good source of income too if you put it in your camp vendor.
---
What's your platform?
---
What do you mean "paid exclusive tool"? And I'm pretty sure the only reason said player probably got banned was cause I reported them :P that's not really an anti-cheat software.
---
Ummmm are 10 weeks or 11?
---
Glowing blood and food. Make sure hard bargain is maxed and equipped as a perk. Cooked food is most under rated source of income.
---
I like being fairly close to a train station. Right now, I'm located near Pleasant Valley Station. I get a lot more vendor traffic there than when I was by Sugar Grove and National Radio Research Center.
---
Mainly purified water from my camp (i collect each visit during  play session and build it up in my stash for the next day). I also build up stimpaks and other meds from events and just keep them in my inventory until i log on the next day and sell them all.
---
If i'm a few hundred caps short after selling all that, i'll collect weapons as I do a westek run or whatever and then come back and sell those.
---
Uss shart
---
is it still possible? i like battle royal but still didnt get out of adventure¬¥s closet:)
---
I suggest the blocker perk, I'm bloodied so I used to get one hit by them and whitesprings was always a nightmare, but level 3 blocker they do half the damage and it's really really useful, I suggest redirecting some strength points into that perk
---

Also just found this person who is seeking out new players to help them along
---
Air wookies could be the tree wookie
---
Is Charisma a dump stat, then? If I don‚Äôt care about caps and I am picky about what perks I share, could I get by with 3 in charisma?
---
Lmfao. They can be quite alarming. They used to give me hell until I got my favorite tse shotgun which can put them down in about 5 shots. 
---
But I remember with my regulars...they were nearly impossible to kill before they killed me.
---
end of the day, all my chems, any serums out of player vendors that are 300 caps or less, since you can turn a profit on them to the robot vendors
---
JuST uSe aNoTheR BUild
---
I ser what you did here! Mr Cayde
---
Mostly junk Chems I can't sell or don't use. Rad-X and diluted Rad-X since I rarely use either and acquire dozens of extras quickly.
---
Any food about to turn rotten when I'm in the trading menu. Excess glowing meat. 
---
Sometimes I half my Radaway Stash if my weight is creeping up. 
---
Junky weapons if I don't feel like scrapping.
---
It doesn't take me much to hit the limit.
---
whats a good base price to sell bulk adhesives?
---
Usually im giving advices to fresh players, but right now i want to only say one thing: git gud lol
---
Here have your dummy back.
---
When it comes to cheat programs, ones available for free or to the public don't usually last very long. In the case of Fallout 76, the 'free tool' has been available for years without trouble.
---
Since update 20, that 'free tool' is now non functional. Not only that, you *will* get banned, almost instantly, for using it.
---
So anyone still successfully hacking at the moment is either using a modified version of the free tool, will will result in an automated ban, or they're using a separate, lesser-known tool that the public doesn't have access to.
---
Glowing blood is very good if you frequent radiation rumble often. I've never met anyone who consumes them.
---
I‚Äôm having the same issue. When I spawn I just start running so I don‚Äôt get stuck in my camp
---
Only thing is you sit on air when you use it!
---
Usually im giving advices to fresh players, but right now i want to only say one thing: git gud lol. Okay okay, use enforcer perk 1 point + shotgun, target head to get rid of laser, or legs to make asaulttrons laying on the ground, with sentry bots target fusion core on their back, one shot kill
---
If the new ally quests are just as terrible and boring as the current ones, no thanks.
---
man, you didn t gave me a single argument in the whole conversation so you might have to reconsider yourself üëç and no, saying you deserve it, it s cheat is not an argument.
---
i feel sorry for you, i tried hard to create a debate and speak like an adult but there is no point, you are just a hypocrit liar who can t give me argument but telling me i m an idiot
---
i m trying to make an analogy so you can understand, dw i ll adapt to you, i ll use simple words: in some countries, women go in jail because their child die during their pregancy. It s the law, and people like you are saying that they deserve it because their child died. Do you think they deserve it? do you think jews deserved what they got during the WW2? it was the law in germany.
---
i m gonna be very clear so you can understand, i do not question the ToS and if there was cheat or not, i m questionning the action bethesda took comparing to the impact this have on the game.
---
I've suggested proper subtitles be added before mostly because it's easier for me to read subtitles than listen to a radio drama.
---
Agreed, i recently got my bloodied 10% dmg while aiming and faster reload lever action and the difference between that and every other rifle ive used is night and day!
---
I usually dont sell bulk so I'm not sure. And its been a since I've sold them at all cuz I'm trying to get rid of all these plans I got from marathoning fasnacht, but I'd say 10 a piece for individual adhesive. If they sell quick go up a little, if they don't sell for a while go down a little.
---
This is a fallout game...
---
The whole series is incredibly political
---
Haha where are you at so far?
---
This has changed as I've leveled up through the game. Started with cooked mothman eggs, then stims / purified water, then marine tactical helmets, now it's serums.
---
I'm a mixed bag, I will kill you for stealing my workshops (sorry) but I'll hunt you down and throw free plans and ammo at you afterwards. I need those workshops for materials to crunch out the .308 and fusion cells.
---
Skeleton from Halloween!
---
The fixer  and handmade with crits and f/33 handmade are good for snipers, use the explosive when you get detected.  That‚Äôs my two cents at least.
---
I'll probably be keeping the ammo after they release the ammo converter update though, sorry. I'll drop some one star legendaries for new players instead.
---
Out of the list, I'd personally use the furious vat accuracy handmade.
---
I wasn't mad. Just disappointed. After everyone left some high lvl tossed all his low Legendarys and the random team mate helped me sherpa it all to his camp. üëå
---
By scrapping ultracite and regular laser guns. Rifle and pistol share the same mods.
---
Well I am 63, was at 28 when it started. My internet went out though so probably won't wven get to 65 now.
---
Guns dropped by enemies in harpers ferry. Free and easy.
---
So you don‚Äôt need it for the quest apparently, what for then?   Perhaps you should modify your post to indicate you‚Äôre looking to find a quest item on the ground, not just the general idea behind loot piles
---
I honestly really should, but some do catch me off guard too much regardless and I do need some extra strength for weight management given I am a casual mixed style player. 
---
Best I could do is blocker 1 and maybe 3 if I'm pushing it.
---
yeah I have no weight reduction perks, I am completely min maxed to do as much damage as possible with rifles and heavies and to also tank as much damage as I can
---
I can't tell you how many runs I've done in westek to grab the laser rifles off the mutants and when I scrap them I never ever get any mods.
---
Sure, I want to display it, but that part isn't relevant to my question. Let's just assume I want all kinds of junk to be laying on the ground... what exact series of events makes that happen?
---
Legendary Perk Card #1: "in Todd We Trust!"
---
Perk: Nothing. You Lose.
---
Except maybe the Imposter Sheepsquatch  but at least then you know it can only get you during Encrypted.
---
Yeah know what you mean pretty difficult recommend plasma laser if you want to get them off your bac :)
---
Let me know when y‚Äôall are planning this. I‚Äôll try to make her up a fuck ton of ammo. 
---
OP, which kind of ammo?
---
Edit: I forgot to add that I‚Äôm on PS4.
---
You have to scrap ultracite to get ultracite mods. 
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GSBbydRo8dbqZP0iXdGXg3RYat8k4qljPcW50tR_El8/edit#gid=1792554793
---
Use this to see what mods you can learn by scrapping and what comes from a plan.
---
Yeah that's fair, I have the attention span of radrat so I like using different weapons so that involves holding said weapons, their ammo, and supplies to keep each going. Though I did have the idea of keeping myself healed but like drinking a bunch of toxic goo in an emergency to deal more damage/boost special. Would give me some use for the goo.
---
I hate the whole racing to the launch tube thing in nuke silos, its incredibly annoying. My first nuke launch had other people inside of it but somehow it let us both launch nukes, I guess because of a glitch? I've had people "help" too and it just was annoying because I wasted a bunch of ammo getting there only to have the door locked in my face.
---
I hate that Beckett won't do chems, what a sober loser. He's apparently drunk all the time though, so it makes zero sense.
---
Yeah, David nuked the Summersville dam as revenge for what he believed to be Rosalynn's death. Even though the flood he caused killed her.
---
Even for normal lasers tho I never get anything üòÇ
---
Furious handmade sounds like the overall option... But, i'd equip int perk "Demolition expert" to see if the medic's explosive dmg increases its base damage (like w/ gauss weapons)... but yea, probably furious
---
If I‚Äôm ever short on wood I make a trip there with the Woodchucker perk equipped. ü§ô
---
&gt; Men suck.
---
Why the blatant sexism?
---
Lol fat man and missile launchers are like 2 of the worst weapons in the game
---
Gotcha.  Well, from what I‚Äôve noticed, you‚Äôd need to kill an enemy, or tag it and have someone else kill it.  Then you‚Äôd likely need to leave the server and rejoin it.  It should appear on the ground where you killed that enemy enemy
---
On the other hand.  I‚Äôve noticed in radiation areas where there are just fluid and masses lying on the ground.  I never did anything.  So something else is a variable there
---
&gt;My issue has been finding legitimate new players
---
If you're on console you can bring up their profile and use the "compare game" thing. If they're actually new they won't have many achievements.
---
For the Americans out there he means a pacifier
---
I'm so sorry for your loss ü•∫üòÅ
---
found it, its fo76marketplace, thanks for the heads up
---
I recommend using the automatic barrel mod on the weapon less damage but higher figher rate :) hope this helps
---
I wouldn't want them to be easy either. Those 2 weapons are your major issue, they are not good. Pulse grenades are great and a weapon with good fire rate could work.
---
So following advise on the lever action, have scrapped a couple to get a semi decent, just verging on 100 DMG now, so a good 30 above anything else I had.
---
Need to go screw collecting to build and scrap for more mods.
---
Great community here, really appreciate the advise!
---

---
I've pretty much been in the same situation. The first banwave I knew some dupers and they gave me some stuff and I got suspended. after a while I created another account and continued playing with the new account, roughly 12 months later I emailed support asking if I have been suspended long enough and can I be unsuspended. A few days later I tried my original account it was unsuspended....so maybe give it several months
---
Thanks, that reminded me to re-aqiuire rank 1 rifleman perks and save myself 6 perception points
---
I love peoples creativity especially the 76 community. Its amazing when you go to peoples camps and see stuff like this
---
What's the point of them? I got 3 but when I opened them all I got were some lousy status effects like +5% damage against super mutants.
---
We were playing it a lot but it got extremely unstable and glitchy, tons of bluescreens and most players left. Bring it back and support it and it would find a following. Honestly I think Pvp in general doesn‚Äôt fit Todd‚Äôs ideal for the Fallout community. And he doesn‚Äôt care what the base players want.
---
The only thing that can "help" with junk is to pay for a subscription - Fallout 1st, which offers unlimited space for JUNK (only).  
---
800 stash is all you get, other boxes only let you access this same stash.
---
Fair. It's a shame if that's how they are picking players. Moreover, if true that buying from players got folks in trouble beyond just the dupe, would show how flawed this process was.
---
And how much is that? And what currency are you answering in?
---
tbh you took to long, they is a large group of high level players that can nuke it about 5-10 minutes and they have literally nothing better to do than speed run silos and queen fights then do encrypted. They probably got tired of waiting like i do and just decided to go in there and nuke it
---
build a tinkerer's workbench, craft-&gt;bulk the items. it'll help. scrap everything you don't need, (junk, armor, weapons). 
---
and you can sell bulked items to vendors (like cloth, rubber, etc).
---
also, see if you have 40mm grenade, missiles, mini nukes, in your stash (they're really heavy. and don't keep tons of waters, sodas, alcohol in there either.
---
sometimes having lots of chems/meds adds up too. keep what you need, sell the rest. (fyi those 200 diluted radaways might be better as caps)
---
RNGsus
---
I read your original post and replied to that. It says nothing if the sort. Like you said you say it in your comments. 
---
Maybe you need to learn how to make a post that gets your whole idea across? And I went and read your comments. Not really seeing you acknowledge that. 
---
And maybe you need to pull the rod out of your butthole. I never said you were ranting.
---
When todd stops laughing at our hopes and dreams
---
Saved. Sounds like a great idea.
---
Ok thank you, I‚Äôm not at the stage where I have more than 10 missiles and 40mm Grenades each tho and I don‚Äôt take alcohol and I carry all other things but this will still help in the future
---
Pc
---
&gt;Have thorn and solar already?
---
&gt;
---
&gt;They are always 3*, much better odds.
---
Not really. Your odds are still 1 in 11 (or is it 12?) for the primary effect. The only good thing is that they're guaranteed 3 star, but since you need 10+ pieces of vault steel you're also burning 3 times as much scrip.
---
Some do. The bot brings you both
---
Noooo you cant kill the legendary
---
*haha legendary drop gear*
---
I feel you. 80 rolls into the gauss shotgun, yet to find a bloodied one :)
---
Furious 33 15 handmade for sneak commando
---
If you're on Xbox I can help out! Or at least make you a fuck ton of ammo and get you a new card if you still want to solo it.
---
I never had anyone high level help me when i was starting so i thought i'd set an example...I helped a level 10 and a couple of other low levels as well!!!
---
You don't even want 1 missile, they are weak af.
---
40mm nades are fine, I keep 96 at max though, you don't want too much.
---
Break everything you can and you would, bulk and sell extra junk.
---
Keep no food no drink no aid items in your stash, they pile up and waste space, no point in keeping what you are not going to use.
---
The crazy part is that they get banned for like a week and not even that they can just make a new account
---
I hate this things so much. That damn lazer beam is accurate af.
---
I'm not one of them but I do have to laugh so hard at the priorities on display. Tons of bugs broken things and hackers singlehandedly destroying NW but omg we have to ban those guys making items more accessible!
---
Are you guy also facing away from your camp when you spawn also?
---
This is the norm in private servers, if you are in one.
---
*damn... everything ok at home bro?*
---
Food is great, you can make hundreds of steaks from all the Meat you can loot. Easy money
---
I misunderstood that someone had sold the won plan to a robot vendor. The Fixer plan is won during the Encrypted event. :(
---
Ok ty
---
It sucks but nw is your best bet. All the paints but the inferno work on ultracite
---
Its gotta be a visual glitch. I check that page daily and only the lunchbox emote was free
---
there is nothing to do about that. if u ve placed ur camp recently u can have this problem. For me the problem was solved after few days of suffering. All of sudden I started to spawn at the same spot out of construction area. But i am not sure if it works for everyone.
---
There are two ways to 100% avoid this problem:  bunker camp (u will spawn above it); floating in the air camp (u will spawn below it). The second option has to work but few times I appeared inside this floating camp. Maybe someone knows better how to avoid this problem.
---
Awesome. Took me forever to fight a Scorchbeast, taking one out is a great feeling.
---
Fact: 100% of people who ingest dihydrogen monoxide, will die at some point
---
awesome, thanks, i will give it a try
---
That‚Äôs your comeback? That‚Äôs the kind of thing someone says when they go back and read their own comments and realize they were wrong.
---
Maybe you need to ask yourself if everything is ok with yourself.
---
Thank you for the advice
---
Am I tripping or has this exact thread been posted before?
---
Side note regardless learn how to do the power armor clipping glitch. A buddy of mine has launching a nuke down to a 7 minutes or less science.
---
Lmfao.... it just works....
---
yeah I used to run around with like 30 or 40 weapons at all times but I got better armor (without weapon weight reduction sadly) and I realized I could do more damage and take more damage if I re did my perk setup, so over the course of like 20 levels I completely changed up my build and I rarely die and I do insane damage to just about everything
---
Always scrap your junk, unless you want to collect something. Bulk junk with tinker's workbench but not every type, some bulk weight more than normal junk. Armor/Weapons, just scrap the ones you don't need or convert to scrip legendaries of no use. Throw away ammo you don't use, they always take a lot of space.
---
[Here's a good weight management guide](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1CMHez8jQUjRcTUDOWjXKNor9yFnr23iPgo84d58_VrY/mobilebasic)
---
There's absolutely enough deaf people in the community that subtitles are sort of expected. The option being there at all should justify the need for *everything* to be subtitled.
---
I have been scraping junk but I didn‚Äôt think making bulk junk was worth it. And thank you for the guide
---
Don't keep any weapons you are not carrying and using (unless you are keeping them for scrip/sale). Always break down your junk. Don't keep to much of 1 junk. Max you really need is 50 of each at 1 time, maybe a bit more steel. You'll learn what you need and don't need. I'm level 345 on my main and have a solid 150 pounds of stash space free most of the time
---
I've done this twice in the last two days we need a lock option for items
---
Check your stash.
---
Anytime! The guide explains what junk is worth bulking and many more stuff!
---
It will just say offline, they have to physically remove you.
---
Again. Everything you are saying is literally have nothing to do with what I posted. Not upset. Never told people off. Acknowledged that I can‚Äôt control what people do in a public game. 
---
And you showed up as captain obvious.. ‚Äúwell people can play how they want...‚Äù like yeah duh.. 
---
But sure go off my dude.
---
There isn't anything in my stash
---
Think of it this way. They are infected, they have no skin, and they load ammo by hand. There is almost certainly gonna be some bodily fluid on the bullets that hit you and penetrated your skin. So infection via bullet makes sense.
---
And there's your answer.  You and your friends can get fucked and then get lost.
---
Dude, you are not thinking straight. If they benefited from Guerrilla (agility) they would eat special points and you would not be able to use them without sacrificing stealth, which is something you seem to be after (asking for suppressor). You want to degrade it. 
---
The SMG is perfect as it is. Raw, noisy, kicks like a mule. A real weapon for the real drunken commando.
---
I am attempting to get the chest atm not happening can feel my soul being drained from my body with the  knowledge I need 3 more pieces after
---
I had a level 100-110 attack me because i hit em by accident in uranium fever he ended up killing me so i killed him after that then he kept trying so i kept killing
---
Don‚Äôt bulk your junk it weighs more than when it‚Äôs loose
---
The perfect combo also includes a tyre, which becomes the seat. It looks awesome, if set correctly.
---
I'm curious. Do you have a build link at all?
---
I‚Äôm confused now
---
(puts all souvenirs into inventory)
---
(scrap all used)
---
[edit: somethings off with the masks not being found, check old campsite?]
---
I always wanted this
---
I started a shotgunner a while ago, and the main issue I had was keeping ammo stocked. Crafting shells just needs tons of plastic‚Ä¶
---
So you basically need to make a hybrid build (I chose melee) to save ammo dealing with weaker enemies.
---
I dont know if there's proof of this but I've always known to equip gunsmith (or science novice, expert, master for energy) before scrapping if i want mods. 
---
I read somewhere once upon a time that you can only unlock the mods that you have the perk to make. It's been a long time since I worried about mods so I never notice anymore...
---
Just picked up a BFFR tonight running around at 393 ish with marathoner, dead man‚Äôs sprint and ground pounder, some of the most fun I‚Äôve had clearing white springs in a long time
---
It's the very definition. You are comparing, hopefully jokingly, making sure hearing impaired people can keep having the same full experience as everyone else, to the davs catering to every minority ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt I be a trans woman ghoul!!"
---
one is a real and reasonable request, and the other is an exaggeration that know one is asking for here.
---
no I do not, but I could tell you all the I guess "all rounder perks" obviously you have the weapon damage perks for whatever weapons you use, like heavy gunner rifleman, etc. the main perks you want are, blocker(max) , ironclad(max), fireproof(max), bloody mess(max), nerd rage(max), and if you happen to use power armor (if you're bloodied), make sure you have emergency protocols, when I enter my power armor with my perk setup I am literally unkillable, especially if i drink a quantum, it will out heal any amount of damage you can take, I can out heal Tesla spammers in pvp, hordes and hordes of mobs, anything. but I dont normally use power armor which is why I'm getting all unyielding SS armor along with ironclad, that max ironclad gives a LOT. of resistance on top of whatever armor you're wearing, and the SS armor has the best resistances already, I've seen people pushing 600 of each resistance with a full set
---
The ‚Äúfour horsemen of the apocalypse‚Äù sets included Ultracite PA but were all kinda ugly imo.
---
If the price is to good than it‚Äôs suspect I suppose.
---
I used to be you, then, I realised it is not about selling a lot, but about selling smart. Find a set of Unyielding armor and lower your health to 20 percent, or lower. Also, equip the charisma perk for better prices. Do an event, like Uranium Fever or A violent Night. Collect all the Chems, junk and weapons from the bodies and sell while wearing the Unyielding set of armor (which will push your charisma to 20).
---
That's 1200-1400 right there. Fifteen minutes.
---
Excess Stimpacks and RadAway, topped off with excess raw junk.
---
Thankfully for me it's 5 weapons at most, I've curated my stats to a point where I can swap out builds for some quick fun. Only reason I've been sticking to bloodied fist is cause I don't have the gauss shotgun yet, any good rifle (sniper or otherwise), or any good heavy gun. So I may have the perks but bloodied is what works.
---
I scrapped every single weapon they dropped, thousands of steel and hundreds of other scrap.
---
i had this issue with 2 porch foundation pieces. i couldnt move them, scrap them or store them. the way i finally got rid of them is i blueprinted the pieces and they were removed and stored as a blueprint. then i scrapped them.
---
Yeah i have one where i have to kill certain enemies and the only one not check off is "defeat the scorchbeast queen" ... Which I have done multiple times. There are a few others too, the locations one, there are several locations I need to discover in certain areas that i have discovered and can fast travel to that aren't checked off in those challenges. Kinda sucks ngl
---
Didn‚Äôt set that perk yet.  Working on it.
---
I haven't noticed anything like that since I can scrap a melee weapon and get a mod without ever putting a point into makeshift warrior but it's worth a shot thank you.
---
I pretty much always have it set, cheaper to buy any thing, more profitable to sell
---
They wiped some accounts with duped items. Not everyone.
---
super stimpack, cooked glowing meat or any meat bcz i am vegetarian, glowing blood, 1\* 2\* legendaries bcz i cant scrap them.
---
The masks are the killer. I've changed camp 3 times since leaving to get perfect build area. I had all the fasnacht masks that are hard to find for my fasnacht dedicated part of museum.
---
yeah I can swap in/out one handed perks, two handed, unarmed, bandolier, any of the weight reduction perks as I have them all maxed like strong back etc. but I only put them on if I just made a trade or somehow became overencumbered
---
Got thousands of scrap left. Only really built base of my stored stuff just now anyway.
---
Try to restore power to a power plant.
---
Never electrician. Never.
---
There‚Äôs only a few junk items that weigh less when bulked at the tinker work bench and it‚Äôs not very noticeable. The fallout 1st scrap box has made the game so much more enjoyable for me if you don‚Äôt mind spending a little money, if not drop or sell any junk that‚Äôs not needed, you won‚Äôt need hundreds of glass, fertilizer, asbestos etc.. it will help save a lot of space. I also keep maybe 3 or 4 weapons in my stash besides the weapons I have on hand, scrip all legendaries you don‚Äôt need and drop or sell the rest
---
Called "trail firework mine"
---
hours of distraction
---
(update) masks are apparel. Duhhh. Got them at least. Just all my junk display stuff missing
---
Me as well
---
Then don't fast travel. Walk there.
---
How do you manage to keep ammo stocked?
---
I tried a shotgunner a while ago, but I was constantly low on ammo because it just takes so much plastic to craft those shells‚Ä¶
---
I'm down for this, 100%. Especially if it includes hanging plants and window planters
---
Yea that makes sense, I always try to thank them how I can, so I‚Äôll just take it from now on and send lots of hearts their way. When I get better gear and stuff I hope I can return the favor to other new players just as much :‚Äô)
---
Drop your ammo, missles, nukes etc
---
Who is to say what is good merchandise? Maybe they have the fedora I am looking for. Maybe I want sunglasses, not a nocturnal robot leg.
---
11.99 GBP.
---
Seems like I'm doing similar, but just don't have Blocker nor good armour yet. I need to get to work on that. Thanks for the overview.
---
Shout out to the people selling mutation serums for 250 caps. Made the mistake of thinking decontamination shower didn't affect mutations and lost the 4 I worked for. Joined a build team the next day and someone was selling all 9 mutations I was looking for at 250. Had to sell almost everything I had still cause im new and still figuring out the economy but that hero saved me countless hours and caps.
---
Travel Agent, Strange in Numbers and either Tenderizer or Suppressor is all you'll ever need from Charisma
---
yeah if you're having trouble with melee enemies blocker is a must, it reduces melee by 45%
---
Why would you get rid of that? Even if you arent a junkie build there are people out there who would pay a fuck ton for that
---
Guessing you missed the +25% xp buff (1 hour) then, which stacks up to 4 times.
---
And hits everyone in the area.
---
Lunchboxes are FANTASTIC. Don't waste 'em. ;)
---
That is not a whole lot but it looks like it adds up quickly. I might consider that next year but this year being in my final year of high school and no job I think $23 AUD is a tad too much for my budget. Well for my money situation I can only afford it for 3 months
---
Hey are you on?
---
I mostly try avoid being hit, but those bloody fast ghouls that seem to descend on you just as you've used your AP hurt heh
---
Yeah fallout 1st seems the way to go but it is out of my price range so I think I will just need to be stingy with what I grab. Thanks for the advice though
---
I‚Äôm not banned. But I‚Äôm wondering if my friend is. He suddenly stopped playing right after the ban wave. And he would definitely play at least some of the double xp weekend
---
Maybe changing lone wanderer into tenderizer 1 and inspirational 3?
---
Since it's super easy to get in a group rn and we need exp for the legendary run?
---
What an ASSinine attempt at a pun...
---
I buy the generators, advanced power connectors, and power armor stations to hand out to low levels.
---
I prefer to play solo, but I do switch out cards if I end up in a group
---
life isn't fair and you can't please everyone
---
‚Ä¢Stuff you put in the stash can be only accessed by you

‚Ä¢Scrap your junk

‚Ä¢Drop your 40mm, misses, mini nukes, etc.

‚Ä¢Scrap/sell weapons you aren't using or selling

‚Ä¢Use or sell your chems if they are in the stash

---
So how do you get the slanted walls to have floors on the forward part of the ship? I assume you use roofs? How do you get them to place?
---
I'd like to get the NW ultracite paint which is Overseer Level 60. I think it's called Outcast.
---
I will usually help build their camp and next to a junk extractor
---
Bloodied str build here, they kill me more more often than anything else in the wasteland.  I use a shotgun or "efficient" (not really) heavy weapon on them.  VATS and gun-fu with a bugged shotgun feel fun, if you feel this is dishonest, does one shot punching stuff do to all the food buffs feel good? I also sneak more often with them just so I get the drop on them.  Hopping into powerarmor with EP on chest also works (though I'm auto encumbered the second I have to strip my unyielding).
---
This is just my first day trying to start this build so I haven‚Äôt had that issue yet but I‚Äôve noticed my ammo supply going down. Do you have a certain build now? I gave up melee because you basically had to be touching the enemy in order to actually do damage even though I used a super sledge which realistically should have better range
---
Yup, latency/net code/Bethesda bugs and programming. Add it to the list....  
---
I feel the pain of being killed due to it though. Happens way too often and not just with shotguns.
---
I‚Äôm not totally sure how it works but I‚Äôve come across posts where people have potted plants in the farmable tiles and then replaced the farmable tile with a regular floor tile and then placed empty pots on the floor so it look like their crop are in pots
---
I went from 260 to 445 lmao
---
ya i love posts like this. Dude KNOWINGLY and WILLINGLY accepts a bunch of duped items from his scumbag buddies and than has the audacity to complain that he got suspended and Bethesda is taking too long to deliver a verdict.
---
i might do that, i've got nerd rage 3 already on my explosives guy. How much does 20 charisma pump up prices?
---
Uranium Fever. Loot all the weapons. Take all the glowing meat. Go outside and cook glowing meat steaks. Hobble over to whitesprings station and sell all weapons and glowing meat steak with Hard Bargain and grape mentats. Max out my caps this way once a day.
---
Took it easy and went up 30 levels myself 250 to 280 ish.  I have more legendaries then I can unload all week.  The weight management sim kills the fun of this game due to the daily cap and scrip limit :(.  Also just hit ally with Raiders, no bloody but I think 15 out of 20 gauss mini guns I've crafted are magic (vs everything but the queen)
---
Oh I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs plenty of trans people that would be interested in more catering !! Just ask Twitter lol
---
Pretty sure that you get kicked after 10-15 min but if you sleep on a bed you get to be afk more time
---
Damn, I‚Äôve only been playing for like a week or so and the only time I have been able to go 10-15 mins without losing server is walking into a wall in my camp. But I‚Äôve done that like 3 times and been sent back to the menu twice from it. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a simple way to do this cause people have to take some breaks but not lose workshops, teams or continuity..but then again it is Bethesda
---
You absolutely have my updoot OP, I agree 100%. I have tinnitus, so I usually have music playing outside of my headset to keep the ringing to a minimum, so I use the subtitles to catch what I may miss hearing.
---
If only we could craft legendary effects onto our equipment instead of having to worry about the lousy RNG gods.  I would gladly spend at least 1000 scrip per legendary effect to build the legendary equipment I want instead of compromising.  
---
The crafting system should be changed so each piece of equipment has 3 legendary slots that we unlock for the standard legendary effects.  Of course, such a system would mean that trading these equipment would no longer be possible like the current Gold Bullion equipment.  If Bethesda implements this crafting system, then duping no longer becomes profitable.  Why should I buy a TSE Handmade Rifle from a duper when I can make it myself.
---
It's an ambitious game, Bethesda's reach just exceeded their grasp a bit on this one.  It's still worth the meager $60, for the amount of time I've spent enjoying exploring Appalachia.  There are some cool new world artifacts like the megamansions.  They combine the retrofuturist aesthetic of the series with a relevant backstory - the mining magnates built them to live above the pollution they unleashed with their wanton mining practices.
---
You mean that meme that even Bethesda has pretty famously stated themselves? Yeah how could players ever think that when the company said it lol.
---
I ran into a middle aged lady right outside the vault. She had never played a fallout game before and a vet was helping her out with simple stuff like just opening her inventory. I was around level 14 but I still dropped her my custom pipe revolver. :)
---
Glad to see more of these posts pop up. These hackers need to stop if Bethesda wants to keep any new players we got from the Xbox crossover this week. Even they're noticing this bull and are speaking out. Hope devs give this attention when they get back Monday.
---
There's an overkill limit for big hits and things like poison or RAD damage apply to you too, so you can get insta gibbed fairly easy against tough enemies.
---
I‚Äôm about to check this out cause I want to take a break before a final double count grind
---
Westek weapons and glowing meat steaks 95% of the time.  Sometimes stimpaks, drugs, or bulk scrap when I need to get down to 50 again.  Also marine helmets if glass and rubber are out of control again.  Those 1400 caps haven't lasted more then 10s passed me logging in over 3 months.  I own 1/2 the mutation serum recipes.  Not sure what I'll do when I run out of those to buy.
---
&gt;There's been anger about the plot retcons, ranging from the origins of  the Brotherhood of Steel to the existence of Deathclaws en masse in  this region 
---
Nothing about the Brotherhood's origin has changed, and Deathclaws existed already. Fallout 1 says the master "perfected" them, and that's literally all that's said on the topic.
---
Stop this, the only scary mob in this game is the ballistic Mr Gutsy. I can punch an assaultron to death in seconds but a Mr Gutsy ballistic round will sever my head in 3 before I can say "Another glorious day in the US Army"
---
This happened to me recently too, first time I'd ever had a nuke stolen from me. I didnt even know the person had come into the silo until I made it to the launch room, where they were finishing the launch prep and didnt even pay me any mind. 
---
By that point I had a headache so I just did the angry emote and got off.
---
If you're on xbox OP, I'll take you through a silo and provide the keycard.
---
I believe the second floor is effected by the nuke so you can get a lot of materials from the high spawn there.
---
or queen reward,  but I don't think that ever happens, they are very op
---
While I don't disagree per se I do have to ask why anyone would care. So they leveled a bunch how does that affect you?
---
Good for the dupers being out but I was talking to a noob and he said hed been playing for 3 days and didn't know weapon perks existed and didn't know you could repair weapons and i think i contracted a terminal illness
---
I didn't notice that, but I think it was during double xp weekend so I should've paid more attention. 25% extra xp is pretty cool.
---
About New weapons. First year we got Fixer, Sheepsquatch staff/club/crook and tenderizer, this year we got Gauss shotgun, Gauss gatling, plasma caster and unarmed melee weapon (can't remember name). So we have gotten lots of new weapons so far.
---
But explosive two shot mini gun.
---
You guys came about at the same time BGS gave the exploiters the boot.     
---
         
---
Welcome!
---
Huh, I wasn‚Äôt aware of this but... I also work full time and suck at PvP
---
During the Fasnacht event, you‚Äôd often see folks crouched spinning in circles. What they did was use an elastic band or something to wrap around both of their analogue sticks. This meant they kept moving despite being afk. They used it to claim participation rewards but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôd work for nicotine rewards too!
---
I wasn‚Äôt aware the NW paints worked! The outcast would look amazing on Ultracite... but I suck at PvP...
---
Congratulations OP! Break well deserved!
---
Agreed... the White Walker or whatever it was called was the most decent looking
---
Same. But hiding in bushes and avoiding combat is the quickest way to level up in nw. You can get to 29 pretty quickly and grab a couple paint. The outcast at 60 takes awhile but looks pretty bad ass imo
---
I was always wanting to play 76 but with work and school I couldn‚Äôt necessarily justify buying a game with the reception it got. But honestly I am enjoying it so far early on, a bit different with multiplayer now but I enjoy the learning curve. I‚Äôve never been into exploiting games, especially mmo so I‚Äôm glad they did a sweep
---
Do you know a good build?
---
Bethesda is helping you quit
---
High capacity mod hits energy and rad resists.
---
Seems like a lazy way to fix a bug
---
Hmm... you do be makin points... time to sit in a bush for hours.
---
When you realize that you dropped over 100s of nukes and haven‚Äôt gotten anything better than mutant slayer
---
Have you got a high capacity backpack on? The stealthy -Rad resist stat in it means ghouls will do quite a bit more damage to you with it on. 
---
If I‚Äôm not paying attention I can easily get wrecked by glowing ones or high lvl ghouls in seconds when I‚Äôm wearing it.
---
I think it‚Äôs a fake one tbch
---
Yes it still works.
---
Gauss rifle damage is boosted by Rifleman perks yes.
---
I see you Bethesda
---
That‚Äôs super helpful! Thanks! Incidentally that‚Äôs pretty close to what I had set up on n+d.
---
Im guessing you have it facing the wrong direction. If you are on PC, DM me ill help
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Overseer_rank#Rewards
---
There's. The reward list if you didn't have it
---
Yeah, I just watch TV or do something else between bushes. Was able to grind a lot out with my new born, since we'd just dance or she'd nap while I'd play lol
---
When You Realize All Of The Cool Prime Mods Are No Longer Rare Thanks To Duped Presents
---
I want an ally I can tether so they won't run up &amp; down incessantly
---
Now all they have to do is shoot their stupid head laser at 100% accuracy
---
You need to get a feel for it. If the ground contours in the wrong way in front of the instrument it‚Äôll block access. Move it around until it work, you‚Äôll get a feel for where it‚Äôll work.
---
Happy to help! Been running this build for over 150 levels now. With one gun army pointless atm I'm running good with salt. Also adrenalin is currently broken but they are working in a fix for it. So I just threw some filler cards in there for the moment
---
Edit, also if not using a gattling laser I'd drop power user
---
Just drop them it RDO for a few hours a week, they'll learn about the hackers real quick.
---
i just want a skin for the fixer, so i cant accidentally sell it to a vendor or the legendary exchange
---
Indeed
---
May I bring yo your attention the stealth assaultron. Armed with two swords for hands and a head laser. Did I mention it was invisible
---
When Uranium Fever pops off you can be afk outside above the mine (I don't know how far but I was near the robot.)
---
Have you gotten an email from them? They should tell you
---
Well, the alpha in Project Paradise isn't guaranteed that either. Out of 4 events in the last few days I've been in, either with a group or one other person where it I completed it, I've "walked" away with 3 walking canes and a baseball bat, I think maybe 2 of the canes were 3 stars, but seriously, a walking cane 3 times??
---
I think that one of the last times I did Scorched Earth, I got a 2* lead pipe, wow, thanks!
---
Thank you good sir, I might take your advice. As much as everyone hates the bushmen.
---
I am an AFK master and the timer is 30 minutes haha. Rubber band or get booted
---
September :( it‚Äôs on there right at the very bottom
---
Leather coat
---
Personally I use the fashionable raider oitfit
---
Am i the only one who got utterly screwed out of lunch boxes. Twice ive earned them as a reward on the legendary grind and they do not show up in my inventory. I have earned them a total of 4 times and only been rewarded twice. Its so frustrating.
---
Why not send them a message?
---
Right. My other two toons are commando and shotgun and both are crazy high level bloodied. I wanted to do something totally different, and figured since one of my mules has a ton a anti armor and furious heavies I may as well put them to use, but never had a clue on how to do this build type. 
---
Got up to level 20 tonight on him and was a little bummed to see that I won‚Äôt get any perks for the build til later on. Glad I saved the perk packs from the legendary run.
---
That I will take a downvote any time of day, if it means I get my message to a bad conversationalist that makes an effort to look past the form of my words.
---
Only the vocal minority hate on Bush wookies. Most people don't care at all haha. Just turn off team fill and no one will have any issues with ya
---
I finally made it to 100 yesterday so am glad to be done with nw outside of the dailys haha
---
That L-shaped chem bench...I used to always put that thing in a corner. I don‚Äôt use the L-shaped one anymore. I use the one that looks more like it‚Äôs a brewing station
---
Does a radium rifle factor into PVP against Bloodied builds as radiation is not there friend. Or is FFR and a 120 minimum damage all that matters?
---
You probably just have the instrument not in the centre of the stairs just try to get it to work when it's above ground
---
Yeah heavys are hard to start out since you don't get perks till like the mid 30s it's a pain
---
Furious will be better than aa, since running stabilzed gives you aa already. Aa would only add something like 12% extra damage. I'd really recommend vampires heavys, those are my walking around guns and I still shread and never have to heal haha
---
you must be new
---
The Blocker perk is currently broken, otherwise I'd strongly recommend switching Barbarian out for Blocker. Anything else that offers % damage reduction is also better than additional DR once you're at more than 300 DR. E.g. if you don't use VATS and don't sprint during combat, Dodgy in Agility is good. If you're a low-health build, Serendipity in Luck is pretty much a must.
---
I've been playing since the beginning. Watched when one person used a free weekend to make his character really fat and flew around the map (it was a double XP weekend). He went up 200 levels in a weekend. 
---
I've seen those who would mess my squad up now getting racked. It's nice. But the baddies will always be in front of bethesda attempt to stop them.
---
Focus on surviving. Try to find crumbs of fun within the mayhem. Don't feed them with posts like this (they love this shit). Just find some good squad mates talk about life and make top ten.
---
3 star means 3 star item, not a shit 1 star
---
Man I remember my first snally. That was some real shit right there. I miss those times haha
---
So do I but sometimes I cant place it the way I want because it doesn't quite fit or the foot of the L would work better on the other side.
---
Yeah me to I remember mine at Charleston with my first encounter with the grafton monster also
---
I pretty much have team fill turned off cause I‚Äôm useless at PvP and don‚Äôt want to burden a team haha
---
I'm on PS4 -- didn't think about the direction I'll try that. I had it with the back facing the top of the stairs maybe that is wrong?
---
They literally do this with almost every single thing that needs fixed. E.g ‚Äúaw energy weapons are dropping with explosive effects, lets stop them dropping now and we‚Äôll say we‚Äôll fix it later. Economy? Ah it doesn‚Äôt matter, just do it‚Äù. ‚ÄúAw the vault raid is buggier than a shit filled mattress? Let‚Äôs just do away with it altogether fuck that endgame nonsense amarite?‚Äù
---
Icon is random. Now it shows [something else](https://imgur.com/kjjpKXs).
---
RNG is an endless source of enjoyment. made a whitespring run some days ago and got 3 legendaries. all 3 were 1* golf clubs, two in a row nocturnal.
---
Congrats!
---
[https://imgflip.com/i/48tf39](https://imgflip.com/i/48tf39)
---
It does work when above ground so it's not that.
---
I guess that‚Äôs why they have two options. There‚Äôs been times where the L-shaped one definitely works better. I wish they had an alternate armor bench
---
I've seen this in NW. So done running some software. Dude was bloated like this flying around the map and killing everyone.
---
Imo no because its hard to keep up with ammo and while its cool it doesn't really have the damage to justify the ammo cost
---
Now that's a new approach to PVP.
---
the way i see it is its not really your fault.
---
you tried to place your PA and for some reason the game mechanic wouldnt work. so you tried to find a work around (which admittedly you should have just closed the game and restarted instead of dropping the PA) to fix it and the game crashed costing you your armor.
---
and the second one is just bulshit. that never should have happened. id be pissed too.
---
Nice, that‚Äôs a good one
---
3 star means you might get a 3 star, but surprise, here's a shit 1* item for your troubles, even though you expended all of that .2mm EC ammo you just crafted, enjoy your 1* Supressors Golf Club!
---
My like 2nd queen gave me a TSE 50 cal. I was so happy. 
---
Now I‚Äôm getting fucking weaponized kitchen utensils and things you‚Äôd find in bar
---
same here, i only smoke on the balcony. usually, i fast travel to my camp and put my char in bed for that time. so i go on with a fresh lovers embrace and never got kicked for inactivity.
---
My setup is raider outfit, SS helmet for the flashlight, SS backpack, and the jet pack. Looks dope bc the raider adds a sleeping roll to the raider outfit for the SS backpack
---
Mine does 270 a shot idk wym
---
Its worth if ur a heavy build
---
This is also what happens to me (Game Pass PC, don't have other versions of the game). Showed a high number (think it was 580 or something), opened the atom store and now my balance is 110.
---
So it appears to be some sort of incongruity where the client "thinks" the player has more atoms (that is, the correct amount) until it connects to the store and the balance gets updated with the wrong amount.
---
Thanks Bethesda!
---
No, just the base ranger armor. Current month's bonus is the bog wanderer set.
---
It's a glitch
---
Ahhh I gotcha, so June was Desert Ranger, this month is bog
---
Buy some carnivore serum from me! 299 caps special price for u my friend
---
On PC, would gladly clear a silo for you to launch one if you would like.
---
Glitch. People been doing it for about a week now, it‚Äôs not supposed be at camp, but you can blueprint it.
---
It's worth it if you get good legendaries. Ammo cost is too high to use it all the time.
---
I feel your pain. I run out in the Cranberry bog and a find legendaries out there, the other day several of them were dropping 1* Nocturnal armor pieces. I left that server after I realized that's all I was going to get.
---
Or hop on an instrument
---
I don't have shit from dupers, don't want shit from dupers and they absolutely fucking deserve to be banned and I hope it's permanent forever and always. Fuck 'em all. 
---
They're the fake moralists, all these "Bethesda is evil for charging for stuff and we'll bring them down by exposing the flaws in the game, muah ha ha." Then turn around and sell the stuff they dupped. Fuck each and every one of them.
---
I have a fair few things where I zone out for like 30 mins (just my shit mental health) or just leave the room and lose interest randomly. Once I had my char in for around 45. The server usually crashes for me before I get booted
---
No, June was the atomic paint for scout and wood armor. 
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_1st/Rewards
---
Desert armor was May.
---
Yeah but you can only make 20~ bullets at a time and personally i find it hard to control the fire rate. When i used it with my bloodied it only did 70 a shot to sbq but i think i was doing something wrong. In the end it depends on if you're going to use other weapons but personally id just wait till that legendary perk that lets you make a lot more ammo
---
Like all Beth ES/FO open world games the world building is far and away the star of the show.  76 Appalachia feels like it was built with care and is a pleasure to explore.  This aspect shines especially the first 50ish levels, but still is able to hold it's charm and appeal over the months, years.  The basic beth combat system with all it's foibles is also here, which is satisfying enough to keep you coming back, despite it's shortcomings.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Improvements?  None.  It's just basically fallout 4 (with like at least half of it's assets ripped straight from FO4) with buggy, wonky, poorly balanced multiplayer and predatory monetization cobbled halfheartedly on top of it.    
---
I would even say the base building aspect took a hard step backwards with fewer options, and more asinine restrictions in comparison to FO4, and I don't just mean the more limited base size.
---
What platform? I‚Äôve got some extra nuke codes on Xbox.
---
Yes if you have a constant supply of steel and sorry i forgot the other part of the cafting item
---
You could try using instigating weapons and use stealth armor to get sneak kills.  Use sandman at night for extra sneak damage.
---
hey man, I just want to let you know that Better Criticals only does +40% of the weapons base damage.  so not as good as it seems, perhaps invest those three elsewhere.
---
Critical Savvy also isn't as good as 'Grim Reapers Sprint'
---
otherwise, very cool build. have fun!
---
Enjoy our newest feature! Periodic Game Crashes included with Patch 20! You can experience up to 3 forced intermissions within 2 hours of gameplay!
---
im a melee build and one weapom i always liked since i first saw one is the Mr Handy Buzz Blade. i just never used it because i never found a good one... until yesterday. I got one from the purveyor that was 3 star and rolled just right for my build. im loving sawing enemies up its awesome.
---
Thank you! I will switch those out and see where else I can invest Better Criticals points
---
Ok so maybe this is a thing -- should I be able to play it while the stairs are completely out of the ground if it is positioned right?
---
I can get it to play if the instrument is just going into the ground but when I get off I don't clip in. If the instrument is under ground the play action does nothing.
---
I have opposite problem. I seem to have actual hit chance of 100% for anything past 50 meters and 5% hit chance for anything closer than that.
---
Maybe she does start out friendly..... until some player uses a cheesy pickup line. She then decides it is time to watch the world burn...
---
Us console players have to hold our buttons down for a few minutes, you guys have it good
---
is this spoilers?
---
Wow Bethesda This Game Sounds Fun
---
omg.. really?
---
No it does not.
---
And to use the tent, bring up your favorite wheel.
---
I love it. I hate. And I mean hate. How many I‚Äôve made to still be getting horrible ghoul slayers and medics.
---
I just want a B1025 but that‚Äôll never happen
---
Your tent is an extra free fast travel point. You place the tent using the shortcut wheel, iirc.
---
You‚Äôre not you when you‚Äôre hungry. Have a snickers.
---
So basically it can be used to eliminate almost all fast travel costs to and from a general area you're trying to loot/clear/etc?
---
Right I have seen the option to place (can't because I don't have 1st atm) but when you get 1st, do you have to go pick the tent up somewhere, or is is put into your inventory? And does it weigh anything?
---
Uh... hating on thieving assholes is absolutely me.
---
What's the point of the meat pile disappearing? Wouldnt individual items cause more server strain?
---
Nothing.  Haven't regularly sold to a vendor in a long time.  At a certain point, once you have all the non uber rare plans caps are next to useless (outside of travel expenses), and I keep at or near max off of dropping all the excess ammo I pick up on a vendor at base.
---
You get/use the tent in your quick inventory menu.
---
The trots...lol
---
Yeah we can click and move the mark on the slider, but it is impossible to small adjustments...
---
Im just saying, let me type numbers and hit enter then it adds the item.
---
We'll both those answer conflict. It's like I tell my friends and newbies..." It says, it's does this and that, but it's never consistent so who knows?"
---
We on console can type, we all need this. It‚Äôs so annoying when selling a high tier item for 25k caps to just hold down the stick for a few minutes and hope they don‚Äôt cancel the trade
---
Redeeming qualities:
---
No flying motorcycles with homing missiles
---
More PVE focused community
---
Enjoyable
---
Improvements:
---
Good graphics post Wastelanders
---
Right I know how to deploy, I'm asking if when you buy 1st, if you have to go pick the tent up or craft it or something, or if it is added to your inventory on purchase. Also, does it weigh anything?
---
I use psychobuff for extra damage. Also, I always shoot in close range and watch my crippled enemies die slowly. üòÑ
---
It's not an item. You just move it like your camp, but I don't think it charges you to move it. You can just keep placing it as you travel without worrying about collecting it.
---
No weight and it‚Äôs just in your inventory
---
A really good tip is to stay crouched as much as possible, especially in the control room.  There tends to be way fewer robots that spawn.  It'll help you conserve on ammo too.
---
Does that cover the first time you ever place it though? Sorry for the questions, I just know Bethesda is noriously buggy and want to ensure that if I do purchase 1st I'm not sitting here thinking I have a bug (which would be reasonable to expect with them) when in reality I just didn't know I needed to grab the tent the first time or something silly like that.
---
lol someone downvoted my idea and didnt say why....
---
Fuckin reddit.

no prob, I highly recommend Gun-Fu. your strength is also a little low, so try get yourself a backpack or some marsupial serum so you can carry more junk.
---
cheers.
---
I got a 1 Star nocturnal lead pipe the last run I did
---
Thank you :) I might buy a month of it just to see how I like it, we'll see.
---
Ok yes, but when you fire the round, the ‚Äúexplosion‚Äù or detonation in the barrel produces a massive amount of heat which engulfs the round and ejects it.
---
That coupled with the lore that they are only semi-conscious and they aren‚Äôt actually loading the gun, or its from pre war and they are just golding it for a really long time.
---
The round or tip should be bullet free.
---
Even if they are loading it the explosion from a missile should destroy any biological material (and our character for that matter, but we will skip the fact that we can take a rocket to the face and walk away) from the projectile.
---
Not sure on PlayStation but on Xbox, we can use the bumpers to move the slider in chunks instead of just using the D pad Ôøº
---
Blocker is broken? That actually explains a lot. This is on a low health build. I only have 3 strength that's always been invested in barbarian; recently though I've had 1 point in radicool to boost my strength since my mutations have cost me several points. Is there something in endurance that would help?
---
I new I was saving my Guns &amp; Bullets 5 for a right time. I now have 156k steel as a result of using this for a few weeks.
---
I‚Äôll have to try that...
---
Once you get it, and you get that scrap from your stash to the scrapbox with no weight limit, it‚Äôs hard to go back to playing without it.
---
I'm not deaf, but I do have Hyperacusis which makes it harder to hear things when there are other sounds happening in the background. Because of this I tend to turn on subs for everuthong. 
---
I will join the support ticket bandwagon and put mine in tonight!
---
That's very useful info, I will stock up on Molotov and grenades to try, I really didn't think there was a way to get a tag in this situation, could be quite a fun challenge.
---
Do dupers take something away from you?
---
It's a crazy plan but it might just work :D
---
It helps to at least get you close to the target price and then use the D pad for fine-tuning. I didn‚Äôt learn this until a few months ago myself
---
Ha ha üôÑ
---
everything you dont need, game keep us swimming in lot of junk with limited capacity . So, sell everything you dont need.
---
I usually sell grenades , legendary  weapons, drugs and bulked junk, still carry about 500lbs with full 800lbs box :(
---
If you didn't know the heads stack, you can already make custom animal heads with a bit of tweaking the placement.
---
Yeah that's the other big reason I am looking at it. Do you get a plan for the scrap box as well, so you can place one at camp? Or is it only in the tent?
---
it aways have been
---
Yeah thats what I was getting at, when the hit chance is low and the enemy is far away, it can act like a sniper, then they get close and all of a sudden it can't hit the broad side of a barn, Despite VATS giving it a higher hit%.
---
I have a complete set but i still  roll for unyielding sentinal ap refresh or unyielding ap refresh and a weight reduction perk.
---
I just beat a queen and got a ghoul slayers pipe wrench üóø
---
No, it does not work that way. If you have 1st, you use your favorite wheel and you can place your tent, like your camp module.
---
I could be wrong but don't you have to use a bethesda.net account to play fallout 76 even if its the steam version? I think it just ignores steam family sharing if that's the case
---
When you build a new camp and you need to build new walls ect. Then it will take the stuff of your stash first before it's using stuff out of your scrapbox. I had a gigant collection of rare junk displayed, moved my camp and build new structures. After that I noticed I scrap unfortunately all my rare junk with this new camp build. Sucks reaaaaaally hard.
---
You don‚Äôt even need a plan, it‚Äôll be under stash boxes in the build menu
---
Nocturnal bash damage agility anything heavy
---
Literally an insult
---
Former FO4 players who didn't play FO76 due to the lack of a single player experience seem to be joining in big numbers. I've only started about 5 weeks ago. I find the game really good but there is a learning curve that has to be picked up. I didn't realise that you could change your perk cards around during play. For example I always had lockpick equipped at the expense of rifleman. Now I have more damage available and only equip lockpick when faced with a need to use it. For me it's a much better system but until you become familiar it's tricky.
---
Nice, good to know. I may grab a month, yeah. Don't think I'll get the full year though, as I tend to play a game to the ground for a couple of months and then burn out on it for six months to a year after that, and maybe repeat when I return.
---
Okay, just making sure about that first placement, thank you
---
Well yeah. If you cared about 3 stars then riding shotgun has a gauranteed 3 star and potential 3 star legendary blood eagle spawns. At some point you just hit critical mass and stop caring about most legendary spawns, though. It's usually around the point you start stockpiling and crafting bullion gear and you just scrip that garbage instead of bothering with the wild legendary. Honestly, I'd rather get scrip at this point than more legendaries from legendary enemies. Would rather have the option of playing Mrrgrrgrr's gacha game for legendaries or investing into bullion gear via buying legendary modules instead of collecting junk legendaries.
---
After you pay for one month, don‚Äôt forget to go in and cancel it. When you sign up you either have to sign up for a year or sign up for a month with recurring billing I believe
---
It cuts down on costs substantially. You can't scrap weapons or armor but can scrap junk at the tent. Super handy.
---
I would guess they care more about being treated with the same respect as everyone else, and not being use as a prop for a False equivalence.
---
You can scrao junk at the tent? I thought it just had a junk stash, not a workbench to scrap at.
---
It was ages ago when I tried Fallout 1st, but I'm pretty sure the tent always places for free and can't be picked up.
---
To tell the honest, it is more than just another free travel point. It has a scrapbox and a stash (and a cooking fire, a bed and an instrument), so if you ever find yourself overencumbered, just pop it up, srcap the junk and voila.
---
I've been failing a lot of basic events lately. I'm so used to then just working out that I've stopped doing the work. Now it's line 10 lvl 10 players and me at 450. They don't have a clue how to do it and I'm in the corner conked out on chems.
---
Yeah, I usually wait a full 24 hours after initial purchase  before I cancel the recurring payments for a sub service, to avoid any cheeky cancelation of service while they keep my money. It's happened before.
---
&gt;It's\*

Oh POTTED plants. That makes so much more sense
---
And yeah, I've seen people plant them on a farmable tile and then replace that tile with whatever flooring to have the look of potted plants
---
The scrap box automatically scraps the junk
---
Just lean a book on the joy stick and spin in circles WEEEEE
---
So for example if I throw a thing of duct tape in there it automatically becomes excess adhesive?
---
Ebba vi nduvi cazzu ha jiri prufissuri du cazzu va... Trovati nu passatiampu
---
I get what you're saying and I'm not saying it's a 100% chance, but there should be a possibility that the bullet/tip has enough genetic material on it to transfer a virus or bacteria. The end or the barrel or the place where the shaft rests could easily be contaminated and not be cleansed by the round firing or the explosion made by the round on contact.
---
What do you mean its a glitch and not supposed to be built at the camp? The plan can be bought for  750 bullion at Ally rank for Raiders?  [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:\_ArmCo\_ammunition\_construction\_appliance](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:_ArmCo_ammunition_construction_appliance)
---
Do PC players not have a friends list they can send messages to? If not, that‚Äôs dumb. Serious question btw.
---
I don't think it's intentional.  It was probably a bug that was introduced with Wastelanders (or at least surfaced more frequently since).  There has to be a specific trigger or series of events that causes it, I just wish literally anyone knew what that was.
---
ü¶Äü¶ÄJMods Won't Read Thisü¶Äü¶Ä
---
Jagex has support? Could have fooled me. To stay on topic, I like the way RS runs their DXP because I don't like hard grinding all weekend and burning out monday.
---
No he is talking about the one from the munitions factory/ not the one you buy from raiders.
---
I can fit doors with left or right hinges, but it is sometimes pretty fiddly to get them to snap in.
---
I agree with all you say, as always must be to do with limiting server load with more world items than absolutely necessary.
---
Blocker perk and rad resistant backpack/secret service armor. I‚Äôm bloodied and they don‚Äôt damage me at all running this.
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:\_ArmCo\_ammunition\_construction\_appliance](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:_ArmCo_ammunition_construction_appliance)  uhh....
---
Hmmm buying and trading is allowed. Duping the weapons and then selling and trading them to get cash or god tier weapons is not. One set of people who buy the weapons have done nothing wrong. The ones who duplicated the items have and should be banned. It‚Äôs pretty simple.
---
If you're on ps4, I'm more than happy to run as support, take all the fire and weaken them so you're not wasting too much ammo!
---
No nothing, im just saying if talk shit about dupers you cant buy duped stuff from them... This have no sense
---
Family sharing won't work as Fallout 76 uses a 3rd party account to login and authenticate. Your friend will have to buy it or use your bethesda account with the bethesda launcher (This may only work if you bought the game on [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net) and had the free steam copy gifted, probs wont work if you bought directly on steam), no way around this afaik.
---
Guess so
---
Heavy weapons like I've been using a gatling plasma recently
---
Get elastic band put on stick and around handle of controller lol you'll spin in circles and won't time out
---
Not that. The ammunition factory like a mineral extractor you can build at a workshop, but it's AFAIK not an item to be built at a CAMP
---
Yeah, each pellet and each explosion will proc the healing. It's a great gun for staying alive
---
Cheat than, right?
---
Exactly
---
Wrong ammo factory, there is currently a glitch where you can blueprint the ammo factory machine from its workshop and install it at a CAMP.
---
Pretty much. They blue print it when they take over the ammo factory then build it in there camp. Not something they're suppose to be able to do
---
Weird all my stuff was still there. Guess im not a cheater.
---
Soooo bad. All my ammo has gone too that I had in vendor. Nothing in stash either üò≠. Oh time to spend another 10 hours collecting. Never moving again
---
Sell your surplus for 1 cap per % of charge.
---
That‚Äôs a fair price and an easy to follow metric.
---
Yeah, you get enough upvotes and actually get a j mod to look into your issue for RS. Here the upvotes just get your ticket pushed up the stream, never seen em actually fix anything though.
---
Sure, so if i sell drugs and you buy it from me you are right and Im wrong? If you buy this shit you know what are you doing
---
Ive gotten it close but i find the bar moves faster the more people participate in that event
---
What some people are doing is getting 1 month of FO 1st (switch off auto renew) and spend the month cramming the scrapbox with junk.  You can still access that scrap after 1st has expired just can't put more in.
---
On PC, once again I'm getting used to a stuttering, audio crackling 'crash to desktop'.
---
The good thing is with public teams being a thing I am re-joining the same server every time, so that is definitely a good thing.
---
Ohhh yea. Torso was super Quick for me, like the 2nd or 3rd roll, Arms were in between 5 and 10 each, the left leg was like 10-15 rolls, and the right leg.... ah Jesus i lost Count. Then I got a 1* uny and went on to the Guns. Bloodied 3* gauss pistol on the 3rd roll, bloodied gauss minigun and the 15th roll or so, still no bloodied gauss shotgun but a nice AA and a Vampire one, then a quad ffr 90rw plasma csster on the 2nd roll and a bloodied bloodied 33%vhc caster on the 4th... then went back to the right leg, "First roll", 3* uny with rww and +1 int :))) Hang in there, you'll get it eventually :)
---
That‚Äôs what I was hoping, I tried carrying a vamps explosive handmade and the healing was great but I was still doing too much damage for public events.  Thanks for the info!
---
Does it come with the future tech bundle?
---
Assuming you mean people who just build punjis on you, fair enough. I'm yet to come across any griefers like that myself, but I look forward to the next time I come across a proper trap camp, takes some serious imagination to use this games building feature to be able to trick people into dying.
---
Neither of these names are members of BOS so I guess it‚Äôs just what they want them to be name and their rank for if they were Ally‚Äôs.
---
You get more xp from survival. Hiding in a bush is a more effective option.
---
Shoot, just saw this! I was on &amp; still am -- Nuclear Winter then, screw farming in Adventure right now for a few minutes til I head to bed. I'm in Pacific Standard Time so it's 1am here just to give you some reference. I generally hop on around 10-10:30am.
---
The game does seem to bleed scrip worthy legendary crap and stim packs, those just give me my easy 1400 daily caps at the robot vendors.
---
Yea nah even when in power armour those fuckers are deadly
---
Oh it‚Äôs fine
---
lol I had a guy try it with me the other day you had to try and get past some shelves and they had traps so you get stuck and die. He almost got me, I traveled away and back and ran into his base before it loaded. Everything on sale was 30k each....
---
A dog, an eyebot, and a reprogrammed Liberator would be fantastic companion choices
---
Yeah it really sucked because today I got all the junk I needed and just needed to buy some ammo real quick so I went to a local camp and they killed me at their vendor and stole all my junk. Really just ruined my hard grind.
---
Try using the personal terminal, I've had pretty good results with it in the past.
---
Yea maybe possible i suppose and like you say slim... but be we all know we are actually just trying to make up a reason Bethesda didn‚Äôt consider this and lower the possibility to something other than what it is now...
---
Hey did Sofia tell you about those nightmares?
---
Well then yes, you can get both or all of the different mutations. Generally when people say stack they mean of the same benefit. Your wording was kind of vague in the question my bad
---
Wawa is the only way. Join the cult of H2Oüôå the only way to survive the wasteland is by staying hydrated!
---
They have them back up in the PTS so hopefully no more delays we will see. Apparently you need to be level 1500 to max just one perk which sounds ridiculous, can‚Äôt try it myself I‚Äôm on console.
---
Meh I don't care about diseases enough to want to lower the contraction rate. A simple antibiotic or disease cure takes care of it and they aren't that rare
---
Aw shame, thanks for the reply man!
---
True about the doors, but they each open in an opposite direction. So it's not quite a mirror.
---
I dont see how adding mirrored camp items would increase world items though?
---
Never ever visit a camp with junks, many things can go wrong and trap is only one of them.
---
No. If I buy drugs. They‚Äôre illegal. Stop trying to justify it. The correct analogy is if you forge money and spend it in a shop the shop keeper isn‚Äôt getting prosecuted for the fake money. You are for creating it
---
How the hell does this violate rule 10?
---
Only info I can provide is that if any molemen touch an extractor it slows the bar from filling. Ideally you should have enough people playing to prevent ANY molemen from laying a finger on them.
---
Rad-x diluted and glowing blood are your best friends, use before fighting ghouls, 175 rad res. There is rad shield consum also +300 res, but i dont bother to farm those
---
That works for regular armor, but not power armor. I've done it once a few months ago. Still not sure how it happened. Plus you can scrap the frame, and immediately have all those individual pieces in your inventory.
---
Ok that may be why it never gets to 100% then. They frequently get tapped by Molemen even if they dont go down. Doesnt seem to matter how many play. hell half the time no one bothers to repair them when they go down much less stand there and pop molemen before they get to it
---
Ive seen it get close but never all the way. Ive been in a few now where theres considerably more players than usual. If player numbers affect it then im wondering how many need to be playing ot get it all the way. Im not even certain if it actually matters anyway
---
I see your Assaultron and raise you one Colonel Gutsy. Don't get how they are so accurate with so much damage, fire rate, and can cripple.
---
Is that the blackbird power armour paint from the atom shop?
---
&gt; I see your Assaultron and raise you one Colonel Gutsy
---
**no string bets, please!**
---
_^(I'm a pointless bot. "I see your X and raise you Y" is a) ^[string](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/string_bet) ^[bet,](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/string_bet) ^(and is not allowed at most serious poker games.)_
---
Don't they have to pay for the new account? How is it worth lol
---
Most people do that event just for the xp, weapon drops for crap, and legendaries, 100%ing the event is rarely considered I feel.
---
No they keep the game all they gotta do is make a new email and Bethesda account since they don‚Äôt do ip band or hardware bans
---
Just for that last sentence I will keep sunkissed shared. 
---
Entitled bloodied players who think they deserve to be on a team more than anyone else, and everyone should cater to THEIR playstyle, even though 3/4 people would benefit from sunkissed. You kick as many people as you want as a leader - but if you‚Äôre not you either suck it up or make your own team.
---
Yes that's correct any Junk items you put in the Scrap Box is automatically scrap down to it's base components
---
So if Im at the vendor bot buying duped b2525 from my friend im not a duper? I dont think so... People selling b2525 for caps are dupers, people that buy that gun knows where it came from (sorry for my bad english)
---
Fireproof is good against Scorchbeast screams and helps against self-damage from explosive guns as well as car explosions.
---
Adamantium Skeleton might be worth it if you find yourself crippled a lot (should mostly apply to melee builds only).
---
My bloodied character runs with Radicool and Life Giver (for its interaction with the Speed Demon mutation).
---
There's very little else in Endurance that isn't QoL, very situational, build-specific or downright useless.
---
Dont let them. It's a troll attempt using a glitch. The ammo machines are the ones from workshops, which can be glitched into people's camps. However once the machine is placed it cannot be moved or scrapped, so it PERMANENTLY takes a large chunk of your camp budget. And if you ever move your camp it cannot be placed again. Odds are they would have placed as many as they could so you would have lost a large chunk of budget.
---
Just saying that you cant talk shit about dupers if you buy shit from them... No sense
---
I have mine set up over a cliff where you have to walk along a conduit to get to them. they are stacked so you have to jump.on top of each one to get to the next. (I like old platform games). I have a stash box at the entry to the conduit to remind ppl to stash their junk before trying to get to the vendors. I also have a stash box at each level of vendor. the entire base floats and is built like a giant cage made out of conduits. I diddnt build it to trap ppl and have them lose their junk, I built it because I like to build weird shit.
---
Oof. Great. So even if I move my camp that part of my budget is gone?
---
Huh, neat.
---
pretty much. I have no idea how full completion affects the reward if it even does anyway. I havent found any info on it
---
I gave 3 PAs one excavator biuld up for carrying capacity, and I have it renamed to show what the capacity us with and without percards. I also have two X01 PAs one with leg mods that regenerate AP and a chest piece that increases regenerate speed, and the other same leg mods but a chest piece that regenerate AP upon damage. I use all 3 very frequently for different things I do so I name them appropriately for the activities.
---
Always stash your shit before going to a camp, it‚Äôs pretty simple
---
Word.
---
Deploying camps/killing stuff is easy enough. 2-3 rounds tops.
---
Once the double xp ends, the overseer rank gain will be one of the worst challenges yet.
---
Friend, invest in a Shotgun, preferably an Explosive or Gauss one, and the Enforcer perk.
---
One shot at the ground at their feet should take out their legs, and another shot or two at their face will get rid of that laser.
---
You can even go the extra mile and also take out both arms, then back up and watch the thing self-destruct.
---
This also works for Gutsys, but requires a little more accurate aiming for those noodle limbs.
---
See now I respect that build, this person just had no scrapbox or stash openly and had all their doors locked accept vendors and I went in to buy ammo and boom dead. And they just hide there i  stealth behind a door and come out when the person dies to steall their items.
---
If you move your camp the machine can't be placed again, but wont show up in your stores camp items. But will still take up a chunk of camp budget. I do not know if putting in a claim will help, it may even lead to a ban if they think YOU are the one that used the exploit to put the machine there in the first place.
---
I just slap a prime on any gauss mini I get because the ammo you can make is like 200+ per craft. It doesn't make any sense to not have it primed. Then again, I have thousands of each flux so maybe it's just easier for me to maintain it.
---
I always use the light footed perk and sneak through the traps. Has become a habit at every camp I visit.
---
I usually try to but I was overecumbered and this camp was near by so figured I would stop buy and grab ammo and stash the scrap but they had all doors locked but vendor so Ijust went to vendor not thinking anything of it and boom dead smh
---
Get through the Settlers+Raiders quests to get the bow frames (explosive, plasma, poison, etc) and also the chinese stealth suit helps. 
---
use Nukes snd Dragons to build a perk (obviously a lot in perception (archers, bow before me, etc), agility stealth perks, covert ops too, Luck for Bloody Mess, and if you use explosive frame bow, the Demolition expert (int) adds some damage
---
How does radicool and life giver interact with the speed demon mutation and doesn‚Äôt getting crippled stagger you? Shouldn‚Äôt adamantium skeleton be essential? (I‚Äôm a commando pvp build)
---
Wow. Great. Screw those guys lol
---
I only bulk stuff that I have over 150 off, bulk until I get down to 150 of all my scrap and then sell the bulk
---
Some camps when I figure out where trap is set I just go to the side of it and avoid it and buy from vendor. This one was just hard to move due to so many objects being around it. Should have known better but wasnt thinking about it.
---
Yes 100% because u know what your doing. And those people got banned. Buying it for caps or trade is totally different. What they should have done is the minute the dupe went public. Shut down all the servers. Fix the problem. Roll back the servers 24 hours to delete all the duped weapons from circulation and subsequently replace all the items/caps traded. And then banned everyone who duped before that point in time getting rid of the duper‚Äôs doing it for money and in the process of banning the accounts getting rid of hundreds of duped legacy legendarys and outfits.
---
Does this only apply to private teams or can they do it on public teams also?
---
The real reason I made this post is that this person and others do this to new players too who havent even really understood to store items and they just rob them and creates a toxic communtiy right off the bat.
---
Remember when Bobby pins weighed so much that someone left a box of Bobby pins on Todd Howard‚Äôs desk with a note that said ‚Äúweigh these‚Äù
---
Yes you can. They created the problem. Without them there‚Äôs no duplicate weapons so nobody can buy them. Do you tar everyone who‚Äôs ever taken drugs. Going back to your analogy, with Colombian drug barons?
---
You can only build on others camps in Private teams. Public teams are safe. Private teams have little use now
---
Glad you enjoyed it thankfully they become less spongey as you get better weapons and level up
---
LMFAO!!!
---
The legends are true!
---
Well said!! They have to delete all of that duped weapons if possible, it will be a "punishment" for dupers and fake moralists
---
Good to know. Thanks for the replyüëç
---
seems it bugged. i saw like hungred same topics before urs so keep in mind u r not alone. send a ticket to bethsda and I wish they will compensate ur loss. cheers.
---
I mean they have been saying they'd "look into" text chat since the game released but haven't too so i'm gonna take the wild leap they don't really care sadly...
---
High Level Mirelurk King
---
one tough SOB that any level player has to take seriously.
---
There are now dedicated Archer perks under Perception, the Rifleman perks no longer affect bows. 
---
Generally, you‚Äôll want to max our Perception and Agility for all the Archer perks and stealth related perks. From there, you can pretty much do as you like.
---
It‚Äôs not now tho. If they had rolled back the servers they could. Bear in mind pretty much every Tse weapon was duped a year ago or more. Caps. Ammo flux etc a few months back.
---
I agree with you and I dont see anything wrong with duping.
---
If that's someone's name in the title you'd better be safe than sorry and delete this thread before a mod wakes up.  Doesn't matter how well known a hacker someone is or if you even post a kill cam video of them flying through the sky aimbotting, the mods will hit you for witch hunting.  Speaking from experience.
---
If you need a nuke running buddy I can gladly help out. 
---
I am on PS4 btw.
---
If I read the quest data right, you get slightly more caps (20 -&gt; 40), XP (200 -&gt; 300) and nuclear material (1 -&gt; 6), but the bar has no influence on the random quest reward drops (gear etc.)
---
got the achievement on XB, played solo.
---
I play it windowed so I apologize for the shit stain you are about to see:  
---
Here is me completing a quest at 1:26 am and having 740 atoms very cool:

Crashes right after the image and then, when I open it back up at 1:27 am, my atoms are back down to 410.

---
I promise you, if i do another quest, it will go up to 780, crash, then revert. it's like it is half aware that  I have the atoms.
---
So many people offering to help from every platform. Brings a tear to my eye. I love this community.
---
Ah thanks for the heads up my man
---
The myth is easily explained.
---
It stems from a ban shortly after the release where one dude got banned because he had over 100k ultracite ammo.
---
Plastic is used to make shot gun shells and to bulk items for sale to vendors.  I run a rifle and shotgun build so I go through a lot of plastic
---
Rule of thirds is probably a good place to start (it‚Äôs more of a guideline). You‚Äôll see it everywhere once you understand it though. NV loading screens‚Ä¶
---
Yeah that might have been me, the mountains behind got me about 280 raw fluorescent (iirc) though, never seen that much in one place
---
Yes, but the game is not free to play. After creating an account, they would still need to buy the game.
---
I've been crafting the chest piece for almost a month now. Ghoul slayers, mutants, and weightless are all I ever seem to get.
---
2mm EC is made from steel and lead.
---
As someone who has grinder this event 100s of times I can tell you - yeah actually it can. Usually there has to be a lot of people (it usually can get to 100% with ~10-12 people) 
---
As for rewards - not impactful. I had no idea what it did until reading the comments but considering the fact that I‚Äôm using that event to get my 1400 caps anyway it really doesn‚Äôt matter

If you‚Äôve done Dailys and weeklys even missing the NW one each day you should be around level 42
---
FOV slider to the right for landscape shots
---
FOV slider to the left for portraits and personal shots
---
Makes a big difference
---
Use the shoulder buttons.
---
Use the R1 to go higher and L1 to go lower, not the arrows.
---
thanks mate, good to know. Seems like I won't be getting this mothman backpack, hopefully a cooler mothman item comes out later. Im going to bed.
---
Yep what he said. If it starts as a weapon at level 5-15-25 etc then it caps at 45. If it starts at 1-10-20 etc then it‚Äôs 50
---
Normally doesn‚Äôt bother me that much bumping into a hacker now and again. But when it‚Äôs the same hacker three games in a row and you still haven‚Äôt gotten the daily nw challenge it hits a nerve. Don‚Äôt care if this kind of post is frowned upon or gives hackers pleasure. I feel better because I‚Äôve called them a shit cunt. Which they are.
---
For the scariest robot in game on I always take great pain to avoid direct combat with is a level 50 Mr. Gutsy the one that uses ballistic rounds. Those suckers almost always can 2 shot me (I run a bloodied build so my health is always at like 20).
---
No. We don't any means of sending messages :/  
---
This way we have to rely on third-party software. But some players have Discord, others might prefer Steam Chat or Mumble or Element or whatever. Pretty inconvenient not having an in-game mean of sending a message.
---
Happy cake day btw!
---
The wiki has transcripts of all the holos if you want to know the lore. https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Tales_from_the_West_Virginia_Hills
---
Apparently you can‚Äôt scrap or move them once you place them down so yeah that can‚Äôt be good for camp space
---
Leather coat, 100%
---
Thank you. That info is very helpful
---
The only other way is to grind normal xp. You get 100 score per 10k xp
---
The Speed Demon mutation has a side effect where it heals you up to your largest HP bonus when you move and aren't getting hit. Life Giver is just the most convenient "set it and forget it" way to get a decent amount of bonus HP.
---
As for Adamantium Skeleton, I run without it and yeah, it can get pretty annoying sometimes. I don't usually farm places that have large ghoul populations, so it's rarely life-threatening, but if I did then I would definitely put that perk on.
---
The alien guy is just a timer. He moves one space per day, and when he reaches the end the season is over. That's all he does. 
---
For advancing quickly, the most you can do is either a) buy ranks at 150 atoms a piece or b) max out your intelligence and experience gains and just *GRIND*. There isn't a quick in game fix to advance quickly on the board, especially when you start hitting the last section that takes a ton of score to go up one level. 
---
Buying ranks is a bad idea too, until the last day (or week) of the season. You want to buy them as close to the end of the board as possible to maximise your atom-per-score.
---
Niceeeee yeah I love the SS helmet man.
---
Ah yes! I‚Äôm surprised, I actually would‚Äôve thought people wouldn‚Äôt like the look with the leather coat. But I suppose it makes it look ‚Äúgrim reaper-y‚Äù
---
Im facing the same with the torso only need one star too.
---
I miss ED-E!
---
They are people not props !! People are so rude online !!
---
Ok thanks for the info. I guess Im yet to see 10-12 people join it. At least I know its possible. Im glad Im not the only one that uses that to get my caps limit. Its perfectly placed for it
---

I actually did forget my first, and whenever people say that I will never forget it, I get sad.
---
The costs are pretty nominal.
---
you must learn how to manage your inventory when we have that 800pounds limit. Take closer look on ammo, thats the true pounds Eater. If u have FO1 scrap box its really easy.legendary armor like 1star just throw to the garbage, theyre worth of 3scrips, if u dont use them just toss them, that same can go with legendary weapons star1  
---
edit:every ammo is heavy AF when u have thousands of them, if u have perks on reducing ballistic ammo by 90%, take every ammo with you, if not then just toss them, if u dont use that type of ammo just throw it away, and if u wanna sell some , people are interested ALMOST only for .45 or 5.56
---
NPC's are beyond dumb and useless. If you watch them, some will just keep doing what they doing while getting slapped sideways by ghouls.
---
a 1/4 solo event completion is not difficult. Enforcer, gauss or explosive shotgun, and DO NOT repair turrets and you sorted.
---
If You are on XB1 I have a B2525 Pistol that I got from a stingwing while doing the queen, I rarely see pistol builds so if You want is Yours.
---
Okay, so first of all, how?
---
If you have FO1st, there is literally no reason to even come close to capping your stash, unless you're keeping a whole bunch of weapons, armor, chems, and ammo types, that you don't actually need.
---
Missiles, mini-nukes, railway spikes, cannonballs, 40mm grenades... just dump those. No-one buys them at a rate worth selling, and they take up huge space.
---
Weapons/armor that you don't use... just get rid. It's nice keeping some named weapons for sure, but if you're a commando/melee build, why the hell you wanna keep a 50cal machine gun? Sell or scrip.
---
Chems... again, sell to vendors whatever you don't use regularly, and get the Travelling Pharmacist perk to turn them virtually weightless, and then cary what you need.
---
I'm absolutely bamboozled how you can be hitting stash cap when you have FO1st.
---
That's definitely an accomplishment. I've been playing since launch and have yet to launch a nuke.
---
I unfortunately had already let them on my team by the time i checked this post and they did the glitch. Rip me. I'm putting in a ticket with their usernames. Might get banned i guess, pray for me boys.
---
I always try to flee, their beam attack is ridiculous.
---
The other day I caught a level 12 player fighting a level 24 Assaultron in the Ash Heap and knew I had to help out.
---
ignore all replies, people are stupid 
---
nukes didnt directly hit appalachia.. nukes hit appalachia everyday!
---
sbq spawns, white spring and many random locations will be hit today and tomorrow
---
Mine too until I used a bloodied .50 against them.
---
This is one of the reasons I‚Äôve yet to launch a nuke. I‚Äôm not a big multiplayer person, and I rarely ever join teams (unless it‚Äôs for a daily challenge, after which I just leave the team) and I know how some players can be about raining on people‚Äôs parade like that. I really couldn‚Äôt care less about the overall plot of the game, so nukes were never really one of my priorities, but it‚Äôs still annoying that even that far into the game, it‚Äôs still that infuriating sometimes.
---
When the assultron goes for a melee attack i always think their trying to nipple twist me
---
i ve played a lot of online games and never seen that devs SO SUUCK. it is the most bugged rpg ever. it would be good for them to keep u and like u in the game by givin this backpacks or whatever u like for free. i started kinda change my mind about b@n wave they did... actually they have to fire some \*\*\*\* who cant did a decent job just once.
---
Toddspeed, resident.
---
Everything on Google says ‚Äústack‚Äù as in one on top of the other, lol.
---
You‚Äôre fine.
---
Aw man.
---
RNGsus hates you I crafted 60 in total (torso, 2 legs 2 arms) and got unyielding for each.
---
Hey
---
I‚Äôm new (started this week, I think I‚Äôm around lv 12?) it‚Äôs also my first online experience. Can I add you when I‚Äôm on next?
---
And another crybaby üòÇ
---
One of the simplest ways to get daily sum from vendor: Marine tactical helmet
---
You don‚Äôt need to spend another $60 just sign in OG account then sign in new account on top and you can play FO76
---
Honestly who drinks purified water tho üòÇ
---
Cool idea, as a bloodied sneak with a BE, I really like the 40% dmg increase.
---
Thanks for the idea!
---
I'm 4 months into my full year subscription and have no regrets. Saves $60 with the full year over monthly. Averages to just over $8 a month. Worth it for the scrap box and survival tent alone. The private server is great for scrounging and gathering and the $16.50 a month in Atoms is just icing on the cake.
---
Yes i know but thanks for saying i forgot lead
---
The awe wears off unfortunately.
---
It‚Äôs good to bring to a SBQ fight. I personally find the wind up time to make it annoying to use against most enemies, but when the queen lands it does a bunch of damage. 
---
I was lucky enough to roll a Bloodied on my third roll, I forget the other slots. The ammo is expensive, so I pretty much only pull the gun out for boss fights like a sheepsquash, a mirelurk Queen or a scorchbeast. It absolutely shreds a regular or legendary SB.
---
The real reason for killing SBQ is for the repair kits.
---
Favourite it üòÅlittle love heart will be next to it
---
hey there, there is a Deathclaw Matriarch on a cliff just south of West Tek.  I kill her and get a hide every second kill. hope this helps
---
edit: spelling
---
Congrats! I love seeing stuff like this happen, I‚Äôll probably not get there myself (I‚Äôm only level 81 atm) but I always like to see others succeeding.
---
Even for the none deaf players it's bullshit.
---
You can barely hear half the dialogue anyway.
---
So it's just badly done all around.
---
"16 times the accessibility"
---
good job!
---
That'll be the next port of call as the bass has been hopeless.
---
Seems like a visual bug tho. Sometimes I see less atoms in the main menu, but see the full amount if I go to the shop.
---
It is automatically in your inventory once your subscription is paid for. There is no crafting, you don't have to find it anywhere, it weighs nothing and can be placed almost anywhere. It can't be placed in no build zones. If you're using it to hoard scrap in towns or settlements, etc you have to leave it on the edge of town.
---
Overall it's probably the best item in the game.
---
Go through the wastelanders quest line, the two side ally quest lines, and make sure that you do all the missions for foundation and crater before you make your choice on who to side with. After that the focus would be on accumulating treasury notes for gold bullion to get some new plans and hitting ally rank with foundation and crater to get the best items. This should level you up a bunch and get you some new legendaries/scrip to try to hopefully get something good from the purveyor.
---
Excuse my ignorance. How can I add you? I'm looking in the social tab of the came a can't find an option
---
it's definitely not properly random. I feel like there's a rotation even that it goes through by time as you can do three quick and they're all the same shit, or wait and they're different.
---
I feel you. I had a similar experience: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/h0lxtj/more\_evidence\_that\_yall\_are\_the\_best\_community/ftovf6y?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/h0lxtj/more_evidence_that_yall_are_the_best_community/ftovf6y?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

If you don't mind using mods, check this one out: https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/148
---
Thank you!
---
You will know when there are enough people because you will literally not be able to go elsewhere. You‚Äôll basically just be locked to the spawns of the mole miners as will everyone else in order to even attempt to get xp or caps. That place was certainly not designed for more than like 8
---
Hey I feel you on that, sometimes I just needa step back but then I get whacked with the anxiety of losing a shop or a good team. I guess I just haven‚Äôt played enough of 76 yet to get a hand of the online aspect
---
If someone found duped plans inside of a container somewhere etc... Would they be banned if they used the plans I'm without knowing they're duped?
---
By use I mean learn the plan or trade them. Some people legitimately drop random plans and don't know the value of them or just enjoy leaving a gift behind for someone random, while also shedding off weight.
---
I know plans don't weight much, but having a fair amount adds up &amp; some people don't pay attention to the trading aspect of the game or know it yet or care to know it.
---
Can you use the public team xp boost in a private server?
---
not fixed i just got fucked by this
---
Would you be able to PM me a picture of the Outcast Ultracite paint? I can‚Äôt find a photo anywhere
---
Meanwhile in my camp walls won't snap into place when there is clearly fucking room for them to
---
Yeah after one limb I bought the power armour and switched to a PA build. It's ridiculous RNG. If they could be shared across characters that would help but nope.
---
Most amazing build I've seen to date... why did this not get gold or something
---
Thicker then a bowl of oatmeal!
---
Anyone know why I get 1730 atoms free every month?? I do have fallout first. Do they give you free atoms?
---
Do the wastelanders stuff. Remember that you can join both sides and have no consequences with the other. The only thing that changes is the final mission. Raiders start out hostile but have 2 dailies and settlers have only 1 daily. 
---
When you get to the choice to steal the gold, distribute the gold, or whatever else there is, steal the gold.
---
I don‚Äôt play with people so it‚Äôs no issue to me, just annoying to kinda zone out and forget I‚Äôm starving in game
---
Behave. Video game is hard ;)
---
Ah yes The first SB i remeber mine its was long ago. During the beta me and my two friends were vibin in The whitespring and out of no where it appears an major fight with The whitespring security and us against The SB
---
Took quite a while even with the reinforcements it felt epic running around The resort taking cover while shooting The monster. Reviving The fallen while another held him off stim after stim, bullet after bullet until it meet its bitter end
---
yes. 1650 atoms must be.
---
I use a .50 BoS recon rifle for sniping and the Fixer for everything else. Gun Fu plus the Grim Reaper's Sprint make the Fixer godly for room clearing. 
---
I'm on ps4, if you'd like I can make the BoS rifle for you, fully modded with silencer, scope and .50 receiver. Hell, I'll make you a level appropriate one and a level 50 to save for later.
---
Works on the small campfire as well
---
Yeah I pointed this out for the mole miners event, Bethesda really isn‚Äôt inclusive.
---
and reduce ap costs by 50%
---
Yeah, it really sucks. I find the holotapes really hard to hear and the subtitles are really small or (in this case) non-existent so I'm usually that person stood still somewhere while I try to listen/read or hunt down a transcript online.
---
try using the camera with a zoom lens, its a good way to get up the nose of beasts

And on infinate cool down
---
Absofreakingloutly. Such a happy little guy in his spiffy lederhosen, always singing, always happy to see you. Whenever I stop at my camp I always say hello and sing along with him.
---
I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs just my imagination but it feels like the camera seems to have better quality than the actual Photomode, feels kinda bad since I don‚Äôt think you can edit previously taken photos
---
If you go to rank 60 in that link I sent you there's a pick. It's that paint job, but on the ultracite armor. So it keeps the same shape, but has that paint scheme
---
Back in my day, sonny, we only had a 400 lb stash limit, none of your fancy FO1st scrapboxes or legendary machines, *and* we had to walk uphill both ways to the vendor.
---
No problem! Hope you get some nice shots!
---
Well maybe not die as just because you die doesn't mean you won't head back to where you were
---
I took photography a couple years ago in high school and I remember the teacher trying to cram the rule of thirds into our heads constantly but ironically I seemed to have forgotten it, thanks for the note!
---
Oh mate, that'd be amazing if you could! I'm not sure what I could give you in return?
---
What rads on bloodied builds ? Better stock up toxic goo
---
Yeah I might have to start sharing it now
---
Yeh I‚Äôm laughing too. These noobs keeping it fresh
---
lol..yeah I reckon Ive seen around 8 or so there and that was pretty crowded as it was. 12+ would be horribly cramped. As it is Ive noticed more people have started to camp on top of the spawn points which is kinda shitty but what can ya do
---
As far as I can tell, my atoms from challenges do get added to my steam version of the game. However, I do NOT get a notification when I complete a challenge. The atoms just get silently added to the pile.
---
Just to check, I went back onto my account through the bethesda client. There's 540 atoms sitting on there that shouldn't be. Just fucking fantastic. I zero'd it out for a reason x.x
---
It just works.
---
I don't think that they are armor piercing. At least my melee tank, can literally tank them like crazy.
---
Don‚Äôt dupe.
---
Okay cool, sometimes the paint schemes are unique per power armour.
---
Don't even worry about it. I'm a huge hoarder, I have more than enough scrap to spare. 
---
You on now? PSN: Twiztidjuggalo73
---
The Whitespring 2: Electric Boogaloo
---
OK good to know that you didn't lose them!
---
When was the last time you logged into your account through the Bethesda client? 
---
Maybe if you haven't logged in for a while then your steam account is still the 'primary' one which receives the atoms for challenges. I only recently logged in through the Bethesda client and that is coincidentally when I started notice them go missing.
---
Meant to say "shouldn't be" 
---
Now I have 1500 on steam, and 542 on bethesda... sigh.
---
That's really shitty. They must be a Hunt player. But hey, I'm in the same time zone. So if I can help, let me know. I can make some ammo or guns or we can take down whatever nob tries to take it. Let me know :)
---
the prewar food is kinda useless when u set up ur buffs from food. u d rather hunt down some SB for meat or harvest plants than eat some sugar bombs. It could be usefull as well but not in case when u need certain ammount of buffs on daily basis. so u r right. meadow factory is useless.
---
No problem. It‚Äôs probably a good thing to forget, or at least not stick to totally. You know fudge the edges of it.
---
jfc how does that even pass qa???
---
Add it to a growing list of premium level content that is broken. The sloppiness is getting worse. Was reading earlier that the future tec camp machine skin you unlock is also broken and will cause your camp to be completely invisible on the map, hence unable to be fast travelled to and your vendors wont appear.
---
The good thing is that you can still spend them I think? But yeah you will only be able to buy 500 worth on the Bethesda client instead of something worth up to 2000 which is your overall total.
---
I loved pre wastelanders and I love it post wastelanders.
---
This games such a good product. When you have passionate people you'll get bitching and griping etc.
---
However, in the late afternoon walking through the Forest area and the soft soundtrack kicks in, you stop and take in how good this game actually is. Visually. Atmospherically. 
---
I've always felt- accept F76 for what IT IS rather than *what you think it should be* or making comparisons to other Fallout titles. As a standalone it's an amazing game.
---
People talk bugs, but in ESO I got stuck in walls or terrain due to poor programming ('fearing' effect) and had WAY MORE BULLSHIT RNG TO DEAL WITH than in F76. Maelstrom arena weapons anyone?? In my mind, ESO is much more of a hideous cash-sapping 'business' than F76 yet it gets treated like the elite cousin of F76.
---
Did you have atom shop paint on it when you dropped it?  If you did and dropped it, it gets destroyed instead.
---
Yeah, I zero'd it out when I switched to steam to avoid situations like this.
---
Cool, I've sent you a friend request üëç
---
I sell everything I collected the day before like grenades, food, chems, glowing blood/meat, golf outfits etc and then I make up the shortfall with marine tactical helmets that I  craft at the bench cheaply with the super duper perk on. 
---
I normally sell at Pleasant Valley Station because there's armour workbench there and I can just make what I need there and then.
---
Probably the only thing that might go close would be a junkies build. Without one of those meta builds you arent going to get close to matching damage i dont think but Im not an expert
---
just open them i found 3000 once took like forever to open, i‚Äôm not banned
---
I like that. You definitelly know what youre talking about, its written very detailed.  
---
Im using bloodied all the time cuz its the best meta out there atm BUT talking about  nerfing bloodied is suicide on this subreddit. Honestly, u wouldnt even know the difference between damage when they remove for example adrenal reaction mutation (another 80%+ damage when youre at 20%hp) because you will be still 1Hitting almost anything
---
Yeah
---
that‚Äôs so weird i‚Äôve done it on ps4 and never had the issue, playing on pc now
---
Ever since Wastelanders dropped. I bought the contemporary building set with the last of my bethnet atoms and then uninstalled it to download the steam version. Haven‚Äôt used the Beth launcher since.
---
The closest you'll get is junkies with 5 addictions. Even then, you still won't get the same damage as Bloodied.
---
No
---
Lol might as well just say you duped.
---
Can we just stop for a second and admire that somehow shit got so fucked up that a camp module skin broke the camps ability to be seen and interacted with.... I mean, isn't it just a *texture*??? How is there any relation ya know?
---
Yes I was at one today
---
i got all the weight reduction perks and im throwing/not taking any ammo i cant use. And no not missiles or mini nukes. Im hoarding some legendary weapons, sure and some armor. And some notes, some of the misc, etc and im trying to sell my mods (only 25 or so) and selling some weapons/armor/plans/serums. My char is kinda all-around, shotgun,melee,snipe with the help of perk loud out manager. I really dont want to throw away legendaries that will give me precious scrip and i think that is the real issue with me :)
---
Pick up a Gatling Laser and start burning through those bad boys!
---
Tried to do it but gave up after a while, I prefer the other method with pa ;)
---
I went from 771 to 803
---
PS4, but appreciated!
---
Careful, she doesn‚Äôt know her pistol is loaded
---
 just imagine all your camp plans, atom shop items ect.. I don't care about the gear. I can get some new stuff. But specific event plans or rare/ time limited stuff for my camp and all puchreased stuff from atom shop. If I still have my plans and atom stuff I would be happy to come back
---
Cheers mate, not throwing away low star legendaries are the issue with me, i guess.
---
Try logging into the account through the bethesda client. (Will require you to install it again) your points may be there. 
---
Atom points are separate across all clients. So there's a different total for the bethesda client, game pass and steam. It may be the same way for you. 
---
Found out I'm missing 542 atoms off my steam account that is  on my bethesda client despite not having used it for that account since I switched to steam.
---
Still working as of today. Just discovered this and was glad it happened üòÇ .  double XP weekend and less running around trying to kill them as they lag. The tick rate on this game fluctuates often,so it's nice to cause a big murder bath.
---
"Romanceable"  LOL, sure, lets pretend that's what it is.
---
All the NPCs got stale and boring the third time you get within their fucking trigger range.
---
Hoagies, nuka-tapper saves and it's slippy out, yeah!
---
I fucking loathe going anywhere near NPCs.  I get a dozen goddamn stupid voicelines just going to the fucking bullion machine every day.
---
Just started the game last week as part of the XGP   
---
I get my atoms added from challenges (got about 560 now) but as soon as i enter the shop it gets reduced to 150 and stays at 150 in game until i complete a new challenge :/
---
The mask stays on during sex.
---
I find near pleasant valley station to be a good spot. Close to a vendor bit at the station. Fair bit of traffic from other players. East of that station are plenty of spots with water to set up purifiers for drinking as well as selling to the vendor bot at the station. 
---
If you look up the spots with resource nodes. Just south eastish of the station, one of the spots with water has an acid node in the water, so you can set up an acid extractor. Right by an old row boat sitting in the water by an alcove in the rockface. Good spot and still a quick walk to the station.
---
Nothing comes close,  damage-wise. Junkie's would be the next best thing at 50% bonus instead of 100% (not counting the Nerd Rage bonus).
---
Other than that there's legacy energy weapons (I'm seeing a suspicious increase in explosive Gatling plasma gun usage lately) or "magic" guns (certain legendary effects plus an effective fire rate of 200 or more equals glitched, obscene damage). The latter glitch might get patched out at some point; I've given up on Bethesda ever doing something about explosive energy weapons, though.
---
Some people are just assholes.
---
Sadly, only Bethesda can do something about this like, for example, locking down a silo once a player enters barring anyone from entering the same silo until the player who is currently inside quits, succeeds or dies for the 10th time or so.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇü§£ü§£ü§£
---
It's is not a bug, it is a ,,feature''!
---
i‚Äôd say above is correct it‚Äôs probably on bethesda‚Äôs client not the steam one, it‚Äôs a pain in the arse, i have 2 accounts one in steam but can access both on bethesda client , caps differ from both
---
rofl seems like he was waiting 
---
add me on psn: Owl_No 
---
i can help u
---
It can look suspect to Bethesda for sure. I don‚Äôt think anyone really know why they were specifically banned. The emails for the banning and the accounts being released are all pretty vague generic emails. I‚Äôd start dumping gunpowder and lead for a few days and work through you extra ammo. I get if they told us what they look for we‚Äôd all dance around those rules, but not knowing makes us all scared we have something that will hurt ourselves
---
Lol i was there in the beginning too mate, i ve been playing since beta. And yes even finding a vendor was a bless in those days :)
---
It always been bad. Wastlelanders possibly made it worse. 
---
I remember remarking on why my character looked so bad when standing in the inside of a station, compared to the outside.        
---
      
---
This was the first few days of launch.   
---
The interior lighting engine is just really really bad in some zones.
---
Holy moly. That's incredible.
---
Commando not rifleman
---
It would look shifty if you were to transfer a large amount of anything into a different account. I wouldn't transfer all the ammo in one go.
---
Radium rifle is non automatic though
---
Its honestly mind biggling isnt it? Like it actually takes actual effort to fuck shit up like that. So many atom shop things that have been released lately have been bugged. They re released the Camper recently and STILL didnt fix the fact you can walk through the walls. These are things people pay actual money for and even though the legendary Run stuff can be freely earned it still counts as a premium item in my book since you can pay to advance levels and unlocks. To release free stuff thats flawed is one thing but broken premium content is just bullshit
---
I'm actually glad this exists. It's double XP weekend and the latency makes it difficult to tag enemies when they are separate running around.
---
It's not always laggy like that, but when it is, I'd enjoy causing a blood bath like this, instead of chasing scorched lag.
---
No, Fo76 is NOT hard. Even terrible games like rust manages to create infinite-seemingly stash, and bethesda does terrible job in very annoying things.
---
when you enter listen for gunshots or robots pissed off, especially if your at the end as they respawn and it‚Äôs a good sign someone else entered
---
Farm legendaries each day. I do five loops of west two and can have my daily script. Trade in the garbage and dump the extra. Any worth caps I‚Äôll bring home and sell off. 90% or more a absolutely worthless garbage.
---
Wow that sucks. I hope Bethesda hears this.
---
There is automatic receicer which count towards commando. And non automatic which count towards riflemen
---
I reported him over a week ago and he's still not banned. I provided video evidence.
---
Yeah perhaps enough time has passed that you didn't encounter the whole two wallets thing. Still it's annoying that you don't receive a notification either.
---
They would be duped into oblivion,  I want a legendary perk for the confetti explosion
---
It's things like this that show the devs working on fo76 don't have the right mindset. They still think of everything in single player terms, so many of these things are badly designed for MP
---
There's a lot of nonsense like this. The biggest offender to me is voice chat only to this day.
---
absolutely agreed

Reached level for unlocking leather ghillie .

Why Am I not surprised ? :D
---
I had a really hard time to to manage my stash when I was low level even with Fo1st.
---
I had to learn which food, chem, ammo, weapon, armor need and how much they weigh.Like you do not need 100 canned dog food or 500 stimpacks on you.
---
Rule of thumbs scrap all non legendary weapons/armors sell all chems you not planning to use (check their effects). Keep few food and grow some (melon is a good one for starters).
---
And if it is still not enough have some mule alt characters. Like ammo/plan mule, weapon/armor mule, chem mule etc.
---
Yes, they need to remove the 150 a day cap. It's insulting to the fans, limiting how they wish to play the game.
---
It's not like buying weapons with scrip is actually an effective way of getting what you want, i see it more as a small reward for playing the game. So having a 150 a day scrip limit, spoils the fun for me.
---
If you don‚Äôt play ps4 I‚Äôll give you 5000 caps for free it‚Äôs fine I have over 20k
---
The dogwoods act like that for me too. It's distracting. The only texture in the game that does that to me.
---
I just dont see why they would use the same game files for an add on for Fallout 4 in fallout 76 without having the plan on having it available to players at some point... it seems like things that haven't been accessible eventually become available for players in the game so why not the idea of the Thirst Zapper? And that would be awesome
---
If they have a hard copy it's not really a problem
---
Interestingly this is why the fixer does more damage than the combat rifle. The fixer is just a combat rifle that scales to 50 when the combat rifle stops at 45.

What rads is cleary for full hp builds...  in what world would bloodied ever use something that gives -6 rads/second
---
At least a hundred rolls for the chest and no Unyielding. I managed to sell one of my leg pieces by accident so bought the SS plan and my first roll was Unyielding.
---
With what ?
---
They dont all spawn all tge time. Its intentional but its stupid.
---
Sorry if it‚Äôs a noob question but what is ‚Äúb2525‚Äù?
---
no it makes your steam account a bethesda account that automatically logs in.

grab your steam login details , go to bethesda.net and you can login

Hey there,

 &gt; &gt;You can't seriously expect anyone of us to believe that you've only just noticed hackers in NW.
---
 &gt;Of course not. But that's why we, as community manag...
---
Future tip, you don't have to uninstall one to install another, you can just move the folder to the other platforms game folder
---
All it is, is a way for you to see roughly how many days are left in the season.
---
If you beat him you should unlock everything
---
If you lose you will not unlock everythimg without atoms
---
Ah let me see, Your gonna turn me into a pot ?
---
When he reaches the end the season ends... that's the whole point of it, you have to beat him it's like the time limit.
---
Zorbos is nothing but a fancy way to indicate how much time is left, as he advances by roughly one field per day. So if you beat him to the finish line, congrats on unlocking all 100 ranks. If he beats you, you'll have to pony up some atoms to buy the remaining ranks or go without the rewards that you didn't score.
---
You people are so fucking hateful üòÇ
---
Give me a community full of dupers over you disgusting fucking animals any day.
---
OMFG how dumb
---
Yeah. I admit I've wished I had a bench for scrapping in my tent - many, many times - but the tent itself feels like a cheat and it makes things very easy.
---
Isn't the whole purpose of a game to challenge you, entertain you and create memorable moments? (It's debatable to some players if F76 succeeds at this but I enjoy it) 
---
If everything is too easy we get none of that and we might as well be playing Candy Kitchen.
---
Zorbo only reach rank99 at the very last day. He never reach rank100.
---
Even if you scrap it by accident it only scraps the chassis and  not the armour. That just goes into your inventory. So it's not exactly a big deal.
---
I've sent you a DM with the video links. Usernames are in the Video Title and Footage. Thanks for the quick response as I've seen many people mention these hackers.
---
Several people say that, but what are the odds it messes up some weird directory and may end up adding atoms to your bethnet account ü§î
---
uff.. it happens. if u on PC we can launch one together but i am kinda heavy build so u could be so nice by not hating us for a moment. as for silos i can explain that players dont have a lot of time now bcz of double xp weekend that is why no one cares that much about the whole route. faster time does matter so u can do it in 12-15 minutes or even less. so dont be that mad bcz someone robed ur would-be first nuke.
---
Uh, I checked my Bethesda account to see if I have any Atoms there, and saw I have over 5000. They transferred my first membership to Steam when the game released there and gave me a year of atoms upfront, but apparently they kept giving me the monthly atoms on the Bethesda launcher version.
---
*sighs* *unzips*
---
I really like exploring new nuke areas. I LOVE Morgantown. I use bloody mess and killing scorched. Near the SBQ makes me loose 75% of the looting ops.
---
The scorch in this area all were high level and dropped the fluids/ mass I needed and agree the or a was abundant. The terrain was my only problem with that area. Cliffs and hills make it interesting, not bad, just an added "figure out a path." 
---
My favorite is still Morgantown.  Right on the interstate sign leaves an open fast travel, but still gets the majority of all the flora and glowing ghouls fill the streets and all the scorched at the airport turn high level.
---
i have a gauss 2 shot limb damage, base is 570 damage
---
As much as I hate to say it, Bloodied really needs a nerf. Ive made two alts with the purpose of NOT making them Bloodied to vary things a bit but as soon as they got their hands on a Bloodied weapon, there's just no going back. Subsequently they are both now Uny/Bloodied.
---
It's either that or Bethesda puts the work in and completely revamps and rebalances other prefixes but we all know that is NEVER going to happen. It sucks.
---
You spawn north of your module. Move it. I have mine placed perfectly so when people fast travel they spawn up a slight rise and can see my sexy camp in full.
---
Your on easy baby mode for obtaining strangler heart
---
A good number of players grinded the vault 94 raids for their steel, and i can tell you its a lot tougher than cashing in some scrip at the purv
---
it's still an exploit, tho.
---
Yeah exactly my point, mate. Cheers
---
There is a perk card under intelligence that allows you to craft power armor parts for less materials, every little helps and all that...
---
Back in my day we walked up hill both ways to Vault 94 and you didn't get to pick what plans you got; THEN you had to grind all the damn materials.
---
Wash your mouth out !! Good riddance to the dupers !!
---
Did you previously have these weapons that were duped?
---
First entry under doors, scroll to the right. It's included in with the bungalow door and the train door.
---
Damn...wish I would have checked there is an S ton of scorched there.
---
I guess it would be kinda cool with the basher perk and a shredding minigun without ammo (basically a makeshift chainsaw).
---
Aside from what, it‚Äôs arguably the worst secondary effect you can get on a legendary.
---
Oh noes. My 14 seconds i spent travelling to the camp!!!1!1!!1
---
You can buy it again by server hopping. I don't understand why Bethesda even made there a limit on the vendor, all it did was force me to server hop for two hours of load screens to buy the 180 vault steel.
---
I swear to god they can't do anything right
---
I never claimed this "grind" was hard. But in all honesty i'd rather do the vault raid now and have something to do instead of waiting 24 hours for 6 days just to craft a single piece of armor...
---
Wait, can you clarify that? If you‚Äôre crouched in sneak the entire time, you don‚Äôt show up on the map?
---
21 time / 2 hours , maybe he just felt bad for you and thought he was helping you out
---
I play on console so fortunately i have not encountered hackers in NW. But I am curious tho, what happens if there are 2 hackers in the same match does it just go on forever or something? If both hackers cant be killed then how does the match end?
---
They specified in this one...

They say guy exploited and violeted the rules... but how can we know for sure what exploit and what isn't? How can I know was those can chimes designed like that purpesly or maybe I exploited and violeted the rules by disarming and picking them up...
---
So I can buy them all in one day ? Okay well thats something surprisingly user friendly
---
Looks like my suspicions are being confirmed. Hopefully this will start bringing some visibility to the issue and it's possible cause.
---
Wait can someone explain this to me? I've heard conflicting deals about this and I just heard about it. So if two people do a lunchbox it nullifies it?
---
the damage model of this game is rubbish.
---
Was this on Xbox mid-afternoon eatsern yesterday?
---
That is a thought but im annoyed due to finally getting there and then the nuke was taken
---
He‚Äôs not hacking he‚Äôs just a skilled player and knows his movements to fly like a bird
---
will try it out but this feels lile the last middlefinger todd shows you before entering in your deserved strangler PA
---
It hasn't been changed yet.
---
They do give a good amount of xp now, they used to be an absolute waste of time
---
My Gatling Plasma i turned it into a prime and made it my scorchbeast killer gun
---
I will say that I was very disappointed with Bethesda over listing the camper for sale again. I got a response from Beth directly saying they were working on the collision mechanic for it (as I commented you couldn't hang pictures in it anymore).
---
I couldn't believe my eyes that like two weeks later it was for sale again--and I checked in my CAMP and it's still busted. 
---
I still support Beth and the direction they're taking the game but it does degrade the morale a bit. To know it doesn't work and sell it again kinda isn't cool.
---
Aww sorry to hear that üò¢ I saw the cat there before I knew what the spot was. Sorry for assuming you were "doing it wrong"
---
Same here! Level 137, no launched nukes and not very far in the main quest line either lol
---
Pretty sure he means getting through silo
---
Yes i know what he meant
---
I still haven't got the "kill scorchbeast queen" challenge. I'm level 350
---
I wouldn‚Äôt sweat a glitch that adds a few extra cans. I would worry about a number of bullets that looks suspect. Bethesda may think your going to sell them on eBay. I doubt you would, but they might. The alarms I don‚Äôt think are a bug as they show up again if I disconnect for longer then 4 minutes in my server hops.
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox I‚Äôll run you through a silo
---
Hmm yeah should consider you on a team or not that's weird.
---
Is that a steam thing?
---
The grind is non existant anymore on it lol,  it used to take 50+ hours and unknown hours of prep time to make 1 set with the raids. Currently you can make the set without going out of the way/just through normal gameplay.
---
Dont get me started on the plan rng, where now you can just buy each plan...
---
Now onto the numbers,  5 a day imo is fair due to the ease of access to steel now.   Most raid teams would only get 7/day after putting in 1-3 hours of work on something you need to go out of the way for.  Only teams dedicated enough to run expert would get 12/day (very few teams in my experience
---
Or you could always abuse an exploit/bug and server hop to reset the vault steel
---
hopefully soon, next patch one hopes
---
'It was coming right for me!'
---
niether am I. I was given the thing like, a year ago dude.
---
I want full mnk support since this is mainly a pve game
---
My pipe pistol from lvl 5 will give them a run for their money if you want to trade ü§î
---
Alternatively; other builds should be buffed up to be competitive with the incredible synergy offered by low health perks, mutations, and bloodied/yielding prefixes builds.
---
I think there is a huge misconception about builds, here's my 2cents.
---
The builds exist and are made by veteran players not because they want to flex damages (maybe some does but not the majority) but because they are Efficient. Nobody likes to waste 1000 bullets vs a mirelurk queen or some high level mob. Learning about them and trying some would speed up your game and be more efficient in completing events and doing your own thing. I only know 4 thus far, the stealth build, bloodied, junkies and tank melee (and they interact with each other), there are tons of videos out there.
---
I repeat it's not about being the best, don't be afraid of using heavy guns or shotgun, or whatever you don't want because it's seems that you run out of ammo pretty quicky and take a good time to replenish them by your own words. Investing 2 hours farming lead should get you enough for an entire week and more.
---
So imagine that you can go to westek, kill every super mutant with 1 or 2 shot max, probably use around 200 rounds, that is a very good positive balance, and you probably did it in 15min and you can happy loot them all. 
---
Also probably the dude didn't know that was your first time and wanted to finish quickly, the thing is a chore when you did it 50 times or maybe it was indeed and asshole i don't recall ever entering a silo with a person inside but this could happen.
---
I'm sorry for your situation, but i think you can enjoy the game more if you invest a little more time in building a strong character. Sorry if i sound rude, i'm not english.
---
July 23rd a double legendary run score event is due to start.
---
I assume you mean 79. 
---
Did you do the pawn shop hidden quest or wastelanders questline?
---
Need to do wastelanders quests to get in.
---
FOOD. Clothing. Stims. Radaway. Grenades. Asbestos. Bundled scrap i dont need.
---
I just want to be able to fish, grow all the food/med plants, and raise farm animals. Even if they have two heads.
---
I have gone through phases where I thought playing for fun means doing what I want to do. The difficulty is if what I want to do in a game doesn't lead to good results (even if not the best results) it may not be the best game for me. A game can often be infinitely more enjoyable if you just play the best possible builds. There are options for example in this game you can go PA or no PA. I don't use PA since it makes me feel slow and clunky but it makes others feel big and powerful.  
---
Also set up a lot of purifiers/a water farm and sell to the vendor to get caps up to 1400 per day and use the caps to buy ammo from vendors.
---
Yeah, those weapons/armor will be doing it alright.
---
Gotta cut those losses, man. If you held it for a week and haven't touched it, get rid.
---
Of course it is, why would I waste my time saying it's not? You're some stranger on the internet, why would I care to lie to you üòÇ
---
Snap a half wall to the bottom of the wall you want the roof on. Then you can place a roof in between the top wall, and the added bottom half wall. Then just remove the half wall.
---
That instilled confidence.
---
It can benefit from both depending on the receiver used. The mods on the other hand are a grind, i have 20 out of 45 unlocked so i built about 20 rifles and after scrapping them, i got one new mod plan.
---
And yet with the resistance bonus ontop of it you're still able to walk into a nuke zone without a hazmat suit or a stealth suit. So its a situational card.
---
Why would I scroll through 40 aid items to find food when I can have a mod that lets me filter for only food?
---
Modding is not about cheats or things that help us kill poor console players.
---
Pfffft!! 
---
Erm no, nothing like it used to be!
---
It's based on how much gold and scrip you have now.
---
Where as back in the vault raid, you had to learn the plans, which was an RNG reward. And that's IF you managed to pass the raid, spending all your ammo and stims just to survive.
---
I doubt it's an issue truly. Thanks to ammo machine, ammo perks and super duper it's a pisser to gather thousands especially of you're a semi auto rifleman.
---
I was sitting over 20k 5.56mm this weekend which i entirely sold off thanks to the xp event. Heavy gun users need like five times that to have a big weekend.
---
Dont worry about it! :)
---
Pretty sure that dude was a bit of a liar
---
very nice
---
I agree, I really prefer this over the rest. I just join a match, hide in a bush, and afk until fire reaches me while I do other things (like work). Repeat this a few times and I am done. 
---
Afk mode ftw
---
Codes are locked to Bethesda account
---
Zorbo wins all your legendaries.
---
Also pick the right combo for your weapon. Crossbows are good with a vats build, but try to find vats perks and faster reload perks for your weapon with speed demon to further increase your reload time. If you have Concentrated Fire you can also get good damage from limb head shots. 
---
If you're going for Bows or Compound Bows, they're not very accurate in VATS so you need 33VHC or manually aim and use 10% damage while aiming.
---
i feel you, i crafted 6 chests today with the scrips of the last 2 days and got like 4 bolstered ones and i'm crafting some almost every day no fking luck.
---
the only good one i have is a junkies gauss shotgun and changed from bloodied to junkies just so i can use it lmao
---
Or at least just let us use the scrapbox to scrap weapons.
---
Server hop should reset vault steel amount. Works for legendary modules.
---
The big question is why DOESN‚ÄôT shame get through your PA ?
---
Kind of sad that people still do this... That being said if you are in Xbox, I'm more then happy to help you out!
---
I want more life stuff for sure. More plants/garden stuff, fishing and farm animals are all on my wish list.
---
You've gotta be bold with those heinous bitches. Get right up in their face. Their melee hits hard, but not as hard as that laser blast. If you're up close they won't use it.
---
I'm 800h in, lvl 331 and launched exactly 1 nuke myself for the quest. Saw People come and go because After you launched a Couple of nukes, "there is nothing else to do". 
---
So uhhhh take your Time and dont feel Bad about it ^^
---
lmao i got a chameleon chest yesterday with int or agility i don't remember... the thing ended up as scripts, but no fking unyielding yet reeeeeeeeeee
---
If your on pc i'd love to help you out with Some Guns, and ammo if you like. Or just back you up on your next nuke launch ^^
---
Nothing fairs when you are deaf.
---
Looking up the Wiki isn't a suitable replacement for a matter of accessibility. Imagine being deaf and playing a silent game that's part of a franchise you love, only going off subtitles, then you get slapped in the face with something like "(radio drama plays)".
---
That's a really good idea. Thank you.
---
You mean the map fragment hunt with the 6 clues revealed by blacklight?
---
I got my full set of unyeilding SS last night and now I want bolstering almost right after the first queen
---
I didn‚Äôt even know there was Mobs at this event I thought it was lvl 300 try hard
---
Exclusive
---
Bloodied, 25% faster fire rate, 25% less vats cost
---
Or b2525 for short üëç
---
But like who asked
---
Aww damn, I am Xbox, that would have been awesome! But thank you anyway :)
---
Imagine you roll 1000s of times to get a perfect full set of SS, then steel dawn arrives and there's a shiney new brotherhood reacon armor crafable legendary set. Which works like the stealth suit, but has all the benefits of legendary gear.
---
What would you do?
---
Stock options allowing it to be either a Commando or Guerilla weapon would be preferable. They should also consider giving the Gauss Pistol an auto upgrade, losing the ability to charge individual shots but making up for it through faster fire.
---
It's not like either change would make Guerilla overpowered. It's by far the least powerful weapon spec right now. Sure, you could maybe make things work with a decent auto Laser/Plasma Pistol, but there's little reason to do that instead of using the rifle versions of either.
---
While we're at it, let's finally get a pistol perk for armor ignore, and possibly allow the hunting rifle and double-barrel to be pistol-gripped.
---
Edit: Maybe give the Alien Blaster an auto upgrade, as well.
---
i got one that does double damages if full health and was pretty good till i got access to the gauss shotgun, i used it as a heavy sniper with some mods lmao godd shit i like it more than the minigun
---
I read the changes in ammo machine with happen with update 21 but it's bethesda so I'm not holding my breath lol
---
That is the pawn shop hidden quest. 
---
You need to complete the actual wastelanders main questline.
---
No! Not my tire irons!
---
I can help with nukes if your on Xbox
---
You need to do the Wastelanders quest; talk to the Overseer and the leaders of the Crater Raiders and the Foundation Settlers to start towards putting a team together to break into the vault. You may have to do some other quests with them first leading up to it; I think you start with getting them vaccinated against the Scorched plague.
---
Unless you're 24/7 on PA or wear mining helmet. Then the insult would be invalid.
---
(Todd laughs like the elon meme)
---
We only finished the hidden quest.
---
lvl 314 here and apparently I've only killed 1.
---
Bloodied would be a good way to go for Mac damage. But to maximise damage and the build, you‚Äôll likely have to venture into mutations. I was never going to use them, but they do improve things lots.
---
Hey Guys Todd here,
---
So the reason why the spikes go through the power armor is that the soles of the power armor are actually not made out of steel but made out of rubber. You want steel boots? Pay 1200 atoms to unlock them!
---
Bet where is it
---
True that! But I'm poor and have almost no FCs and loathe the design of some of the mining helmets.
---
You got to leave the game and join a new server it happen to me when I tried to take the bed from a trader
---
I thought this was just me, i have 800 on the map but as soon as i open the shop it goes to zero
---
I was so confused for a moment there
---
This would render scrap kits worthless although you can't scrap weapons with them. Bethesda would lose money. Todd would flip his shit
---
Whale whale whale what do we have here.
---
Then you know what you gotta do lol
---
Cool thank you
---
Agree. If you have a feeling where the center of the storm could be, you might as well use the time afk. It sucks for others, but it's quite effective.
---
Surely you still register your copy to your account? 
---
Or perhaps you mean the console version? I always forget you can play this on console.
---
Server hopping re sets the steel.
---
Also imagine having to war your steel threw the raid. A max of 12 steel a day, if you could complete all 3 difficulties. My team could only do that in 1 out of the 3 weeks, the other 2 weeks we could only get 6 steel a day.
---
Now that was a lot of grind
---
It's not about appeasement, it's about handicap-accessible products with very basic tools used universally in entertainment since 1980. Subtitles and closed captions are 40 years old, and a standard.
---
I can only speak for myself here, but I think scrap kits are worthless.
---
Lost armor and under armor the same way. One minute it's there next minute it's just up and vanished.
---
what mod and what exactly did you write into the ini?
---
All of the tickets! Thanks, friend.
---
They have the talons mutation
---
You only get 200 if super duper activates and thats still 5-10 crimson flux per 1000 rounds which isn't economical when you need to make 10k rounds to last a while. That's 50-100 crimson flux
---
One wasteland will scale Appalachia to player levels, that's about it. Will be nice, but I'd love some beefier enemies
---
And it was snowing... In game and irl
---
Are you joking? Place 2 camps?! Use 1 stimpak? Buy a console... Master Race problems...
---
The gauss rifle is a rifle and covered under rifle perks.
---
Especially the nocturnal ones.
---
Wow I need these wounderous skills then
---
Two Wasteland will make Todd laugh as our frustrations grow
---
Oops yeah, I meant console.
---
Yeah there's definitely nothing fluid about the game but the tool tips go a long way.
---
there you go again whining about them being removed from tables
---
I can't imagine hacking is an issue on console?
---
I remember seeing this listening to the Mothman Cometh tapes. [Radio drama plays] is useless and a huge cop out. If I can figure out how to submit s ticket, I will do. Not hard to type out a transcript in subtitles.
---
This also makes me think that they should have a transcript available to read in the pipboy tbh, my hearing is okay but I find it hard to concentrate to the stories sometimes, so I rely on the subtitles, and it's very easy to miss a line with the time you have. It would also make sense to have a plain text transcript for handwritten notes too, which I know I've seen some games do.
---
One option to help the grind a bit is to buy vault steel at a pretty early stage before getting plans and storing it till needed. This is what I do with legendary modules, I purchased a few every so often and kept them in my stash till I needed them. 
---
I dont buy them all the time as they do add up in weight, m guessing vailt steel does too (i don't buy t as I have zero interest in the strangler PA) so jus watch that. But you can buy it so you have i ready for  when you get the plans.
---
When does double XP end? When today's dailies reset?
---
Kill 9 creatures? Level up?
---
There are still cheaters with the godmode glitch and apparently there is a way to use scripts on xbox.
---
it just works.
---
It is known to screw up your camp budget so I‚Äôd avoid this one.
---
That seems a little off tbh, I remember it costing way less than that for 10k, idk though, I have switched to a plasma caster for most things.
---
u can report him bcz it is a glitch or just "shhhhh" :) bethesda is the best
---
You are right, it won't double the number just give us a choice, I wasn't thinking it through.
---
How about the player that initializes the event is the only one who can press the button unless they leave the area/server
---
Are you a commando or rifleman? Instigating will be nice if you're a perked rifleman with a gauss rifle or something. Commando... I don't think anything will come close other than junkies however AA is respectable but you'll never do the same damage again
---
Well hero perks get remembered, so These are the perks that never die
---
[edit: had to pickle the beast]
---
Yeah, Layers of Fear had a "Press X to view as plain text" option, which was so helpful. It most certainly is a cop-out, and it hurts.
---
I do this one every day and about 50% of the time there's no mutagenic waste spawned. It seems to happen most often when the waste is in Grafton or Willard Corporate Housing.
---
 https://imgur.com/AheLWPD for picture proof
---
9 creatures was removed. Lvl up? Yes, takes 10 minutes to lvl up from lvl 1 to 2, use a New char.
---
Aww
---
Oh man. Thankyou.
---
Ahh yes because everyone is level 1
---
I know what game with flying motorcycles with homing missiles your're talking about... Yeah, we won't talk about that game...
---
Megasloth. It's just so versatile!
---
How about a middle ground? Buff some nerf some.
---
Serendipity and unyielding is way to good. Im fine with bloodied damage out put. But completely avoiding damage 45% of the time....and a crazy bump in special....you get 75 carry weight, 75%melee damage, 15%hit chance bump in vats, further enemey detection, cheaper prices, 30% xp,more items from scraping, almosy invisible while sneaking, 150 AP, and 27.5% extra crit meter fill before hit from a set of unyielding.... and thats on top of the 160% damage buff....
---
Hell I just speced back into bloodied to speed up my progress leveling from 220-300 (246 now) and its stupid good. The whole glass cannon argument is shit, i think I've died one time and that was due to lag/rads not showing during the SBQ. Thats without sneak perks,lone wanderer or dodgy equiped... serendipity and being virtually undetectable keep you alive extremely well and with little effort. Its a tad OP.
---
**Edit:** 
---
**Always get downvoted for speaking against bloodied. But thats fine, i just try to look at things from the full perspective not whats best for just my build. People need to step back and look at the big picture sometimes. A small buff for other effects is welcome (although some need a complete overhaul),  but if you bring everything to bloodied level this game will be even less of a challenge than it currently is, where is the fun in that? Meeting in the middle (as is with many things in life) is the best solution to create a truly balanced meta.**
---
The "you're only a minority of players" argument is absolute bullshit. Accessibility needs to be standard, available to everybody across the board. You don't get to say, oh well there's not many people who are deaf so you don't matter.
---
Do you know of anyway to check your atom wallet on Bethesda without installing and logging in to the game? I made the switch to Steam and don't want to have to download the game again just to check. Thanks!
---
That is correct. While sneaking, even without chameleon, you will not show to other players in map. Exception is your Team mates. 
---
Your toon will stand while accessing computers, but that is in total a short time.
---
How many hours did you invest in that lvl 800?
---
No, it‚Äôs a feature.
---
Does the muchine pistols perk affect smgs
---
Yeah as other people stated you can buy more than 5 a day so my biggest concern is out of the way
---
It's not like you're alone on the server. Welcome to online games!
---
Fingers crossed for a pickling station and pickled recipes in the next update
---
Double score weekend? Has that actually been confirmed. Because that would be fucking brilliant.
---
yeah I can only imagine the pain you had going through that tedious raid... Kinda happy that I dont have to do it that way
---
That‚Äôs a good idea!  I plan to start stockpiling my Lunchboxes now.  I just don‚Äôt have any friends to do that on a Private World though.
---
I would pay 1000 atoms for some of the robots and talking objects from Old World Blues to come back.
---
I think at this point everyone can agree that the janitor and a monkey could do this work
---
Well I'm never sleeping again thanks!
---
Dude, you have 5 character slots, use one to always be a new char... thats what I do. not that hard.
---
Damn! Talk about an awesome camp! Huh i might actually move my camp near ATLAS Observatory too.
---
I currently have my Brotherhood outpost/recruitment center on the bridge right next to The Wayward, but I'm truly considering on moving it now.
---
According to the game, I've played for 1247 hours. However, if you count time I've spent looking stuff up on Google and planning, it'd be more than that.
---
Yep i am aware of that
---
Did you claim them at the main menu?  If you have multiple characters they are put into the inventory of the next character you log into, same with other rewards like Caps and Scrip.
---
If not you should file a ticket.
---
I can't imagine they sell many
---
Hey! Not sure about that one, I don't think so. It would definitely be annoying to have to re-download the game just so you can empty your other 'wallet'.
---
I think there is some way to transfer the files from your steam install to the Bethesda install but I've never done it so can't comment further.
---
Do you think I can be bothered to start a new character every day theres a level up challenge
---
Yes. My camp is my attempt to rebuild and looks like a small town. So having things that make it look more alive and active are on my list
---
It‚Äôs a pretty good feeling, huh? I passed him yesterday too.
---
Or just use 
---
    bSteamEnabled=0 (1 for steam)
---
In your Fallout76custom.ini
---
It seems more like a built-in "keep them coming back every day" system that Bethesda implemented than anything else.
---
Thx for the fun story m8 ü§£ i may wouldnt be laughing about you if you would just ask for tips on how not taking 2 hours and wasting all your ammo and aid for just a simple nuke... there are great ways to do the silo the legit way by using no ammo at all or not legit ways how to skip parts in there but no you just more like to cry on reddit instead of thinking about how to improve yourself... so yeah i laugh about all crybabies on here ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
Easiest wat to CYA(cover your ass), just make sure to save a video clip whenever you make a large amount of ammo as proof it was obtained legitimately.
---
That's exactly what it is. It's insulting.
---
Okay, if you have discord you can pm me your username and we can be friends, I can help you out with this. It's been a while since you posted but like the other guy said, you can post your build from nukes and dragons. I'd post an example now but I'm going to sleep.
---
Short answer:
---
Heavy guns usually want power armor because of stabilized. From there you want to probably aim for a junkies weapon since bloodied is low health. Heavy guns also typically want to avoid VATS perk wise because Ap uses up fusion cores and heavy guns use a lot.
---
I go around buying junk when I get near max caps. There's not much else to spend them on that wouldn't be a complete waste.
---
Their site didnt even allow me upload the video for like 10 hours then i just quit.So i feel you and i dont know why they aint doing it probably because some people have been unfairly banned as well they have a lot of email to deal with. But is it that hard to detect someone flying through the map but its easier to ban people who dupe (not that i have done it). And yeah those hackers have been reported hundreds of times nothing changes.
---
Just put
---
    bSteamEnabled=0
---
In your fallout76Custom.ini
---
Remove it or change it to a 1 to get back to steam account.
---
I see you havnt had bad connection on an old console before
---
Wel then you wont have the Challange! Its your problem. I am bothored to lvl up everyday in Adventure
---
This is the way.
---
I absolutely adore the fearless lower level players!
---
They could probably have sold some if they could scrap weapons as well. Why not even add the opportunity to scrap legendaries for scrip. Suddenly it would be a viable option to throw money on.
---
With ammosmith you can only make 106 ultracite rounds in a craft
---
No longer works in conjunction with canned stew though
---
**Coming next to fallout 1st**
---
I would guess type, so combat, marine, wood etc...
---
It was for a set of light or sturdy or heavy. Now it appears that they‚Äôve change it so that you can have mixed light, sturdy and heavy pieces as long as they‚Äôre the same armour type
---
The one where when you get up there, it slithers over the ledge to attack you? Near Faneuil Hall, I believe.
---
Huzzah!
---
No, it is a Legendary Run reward
---
better inventory and glowing items 
---
and the file has:
---
 \[Archive\]  
---
sResourceArchive2List = BetterInventory.ba2,  *Glow.ba2*
---
no its atoms not score, i get score perfectly fine
---
k ty
---
Boom roasted
---
Ship looks amazing, just like a real three master. I wanna visit and come live in that ship
---
what is sarcasm
---
Shoot the legs
---
No.  Lunchboxes work fine up until a certain point, that being when you get the +100% bonus because if you or someone else opens more beyond that it completely nullifies the buff for you and everyone near you.  It basically resets it to +0%.  The buff should stay but it just breaks instead for it‚Äôs entire duration.  You can tell because of the significant XP difference and you will have more than four Lunchbox bonuses active excluding the XP.
---
So basically when you get that +100% XP bonus you want to avoid areas where tons of people tend to go to, like Scorched Earth.  Or like what the other guy said, just play with friends on a Private World to completely avoid it from happening.
---
It‚Äôs not a bug, it‚Äôs a feature. All about the element of surprise. 
---
Will the perks work? Will they not work? It‚Äôs a dangerous game. Bethesda likes this.
---
Would love to see that üòÇ
---
If Zorbo wins he comes to your house and deletes the game. If you win, Zorbo answers Bethesda's backlog of raised tickets.
---
It just has to be the same type. Angry Turtle did a video on legendary perks and that was one of the perks he covered.
---
Nice work üëçüèº!
---
I run into the thing too often, now when I see It it gets a facefull of lead because it will inevitably interrupt me at the worst time.
---
It was a neat first couple of encounters though.
---
If you could click once, get the virtual keyboard up, click the exact number you want to sell for, and enter - i'd argue it would be quicker for console players as well.
---
New luck perk card : Roll the dices.  
---
Gives or removes a random ~~glitch~~ feature at random.
---
Having run a few silos (not solo) I was relieved to learn that you couldn't actually have a nuke "stolen" as in once you put in your keycard no other player can finish the launch steps. Also, for us it helps that we would be game for either white springs or SBQ and that's 90% of people's choices generally. Only way I'd be pissed is if someone came in and launched it at my camp, lol.
---
It took me over 100 crafts to get a Bloodied Gauss pistol, for the sake of collecting
---
I aint crying tho just saying that my nuke was stolen
---
They removed it because the playerbase wasn‚Äôt pvping  at all 
---
Even in the current adventure mode ppl don‚Äôt really pvp over the workshop
---
Personally nothing is too scary with a 3 star bloodied shotgun as long I can lock onto it with vats... but those damn assaultrons love to go invisible right when I try to lock onto them. And if they hit my low hp havin-ass with a murder-beam from its face I don‚Äôt stand much of a chance.
---
:) e-slave...
---
So you want your level 2 alt to walk out the vault with next to no SPECIAL stats but a full set of legendary perks. How in any way is that either reasonable or logical??
---
Same boat
---
I settled for Uny/Int/Fall Damge on mine, since all I really use it for is jetpacking when I'm outside of PA. 
---
Saves me from having to use Bird Bones, i guess?
---
Sorry. 20 seconds\*
---
&gt;So its a situational card.
---
People are not going to waste 2 levels worth of coins to swap in/out a card for 20 minutes.  Mot when they can throw on the stealth suit or PA set up to aid bloodied
---
Interesting, i assume both hackers would have a laugh and maybe let the other kill them. Or they just kill themselves. Maybe they try to break the other's Godmode with hacks so that they win. Who knows
---
tefuq is going on man i just wanted to help
---
One of my accounts was on suspension and investigation from January 2019. 
---
It was just lifted and allowed me access two weeks ago. 
---
Could be worse.
---
I'd suggest using Cloudy01's Fallout 76 Mod Manager  
---
all the steps you need:  
---
1. Download this app  
---
2. Unzip it anywhere  
---
3. Run and specify path to your FO76 Data folder (if it won't autodetect)  
---
4. Click install mod and specify .ba2 mod file or archive (it depends on mod iteslf)  
---
5. Wait a little bit until status bar will appear and will show that it has been installed  
---
6. Click save settings  
---
7. Wait until "You may now launch FO76" message in status bar will appear  
---
that's it.  
---
"Launch Fo76" doesn't work if you're using steam.  
---
This mod manager doesn't work for all the mods (only for those, which need a single ba2 file, check instructions on every mod, you're going to install)
---
I know and i thank you for offering :)
---
I like contracting the blight, it takes me back to my days adventuring in Vvardenfell.
---
Since "glow.ba2" is in italics, I guess you have some chars there that don't belong.
---
Why are you talking about adventure
---
What about the ones that have built in unlimited stealth boy functionality?
---
The only warning you are about to be laser roasted is the hum that you can't figure out where it's coming from and the sound of it's metal feet running up on you.
---
I think 3 alone of them would have been able to stop the Chinese advance in Alaska.
---
hey sorry I didn't see this; I'm not sure if the purifier sizes matter for the production; the best way to test this would be to place size one, wait maybe 20 min to see how many it produces, remove it and do the same for another size, repeat; then place 2 different sizes down and wait 20 min to see how many is in each and compare with individual results. Hopefully that makes sense :)
---
At the end of the legendary run, the last 2 lunchbox rewards are 6 and 9 lunchboxes, respectively. These rewards have a different image, an image of stacked lunchboxes. This looks suspiciously like the stacks of repair and scrap kits sold in the Atom shop....
---
Because you say you wont brother to create a New char to lvl up on NW... I have to create a New char Everyday to lvl up on Adventure.
---
How many hours have you put in?
---
And you only started when this season started?
---
Its ultimatly your problem. I got you an easy solution, you are just too lazy.
---
The nuke nabber is a butt head.
---
I know you said you avoid certain builds and want to play for fun but the game is also quite unbalanced and some of the most fun weapons are unfortunately the most underpowered.
---
It might be worth looking into a backup "magic" shotgun to deal with the unbalanced enemies such as the lv52 gutsy or Assaultrons.
---
Why? Just do events or dailes while in a team, plus its double xp
---
Thanks for this. I have hundreds of hours in other fallout games and thought I knew everything. The last few days I was angry my 1 Endurance character was always diseased. Now I know how to fix it.
---
If she is on PC o can show how to do quick nukes.
---
Zorbo vs a player who spends atoms.
---
‚ÄúHehe he will never catch up.‚Äù 70 days later at the end. ‚ÄúHuh I never seen him this entire time guess he gave up.
---
Vault dweller walks into the room. ‚ÄúO good your here. Didn‚Äôt know when you‚Äôll show up‚Äù
---
‚ÄúWhat! How! When!‚Äù
---
‚ÄúCalm down zorbo with enough money anything could happen.
---
Or do a west Tek run for example
---
Plan: Pickle Rick
---
Requirements: 1x funniest shit ever seen
---
Well why Dont you create a New char then?
---
No I just use my level 128 character
---
I think the holotape is one continuous stream of audio though, so it's not that easy. In traditional holotapes it works just like regular dialogue so you'd be able to have normal subtitles. I'm not making excuses, but it doesn't seem to be as simple a fix as everyone here is saying it is.
---
Thats right üëç
---
I've been losing atoms on challenges lately too and I have never purchased installed or played the bethesda.net client. Not saying you're wrong just wondering if you have any thoughts on that?
---
I got 2 unyielding bits on my vanguard tank and 3 vanguard bits on my bloodied build.....add to that even though they both know the plans and are both my characters I can't even trade them....and I'm beginning to thik unyielding thorn armour doesn't even exist.
---
My personal bane is prizebot. That jerk gets up in my face, takes the camera control, and waits till I'm doing some open air event. 
---
It damn near killed my on encryptid once. It just blended in the swarm of gutsys and didn't get gunfu'd by vats. Another player killed it and saved me.
---
Cool thx will look up the video - thought they had only done the first version of the perks. Might just plan for both just in case lol
---
Thanks for the info. Im using xbox app with gamepass. Any difference there
---
Claimed them while playing on my main character.  Tickets never get answered anyway so i don't bother.  Just wondered if its happened to anyone else.
---
On PC here. Would say the same, i know for me it takes about an hour to run the whole silo. Would love to assist
---
LMAOOO
---
Good catch, but no, I just coppied it from the web instead of from my file
---
Lol sounds like me a few days ago, level 21 with one star knuckles trying to make a name for myself in the wasteland haha
---
I duped legendary modules. 
---
It took thousands of rolls for a set. Probably like 10k.
---
Yeah. No doubt. I can kill Assaultrons all day with my two shot shotgun but Mireluck Kings can go to hell.
---
Update if support gets back to you. This has happened to quite a few people.
---
Nukesdragons.com has a Wastelands fine dining nutrition calculator. You see bonuses, duration and what you need to craft.
---
The cans are server based, so if you go to another sever they are back.
---
That's good information to add to the mix thanks. Maybe it has less to do  than I thought with having been logged in on that client at some point.
---
It's definitely possible that it was just a code change in a recent patch. I.e the client was modified to send atoms to the wrong back end wallet under some weird circumstance as I don't think it's happening to everyone (well at least it doesn't seem like there is too much of an uproar just yet).
---
The more information we can provide here though will help others and also guide Bethesda CM's to passing on the right information to reproduce.
---
From JANUARY?!? 2019?!? Holy fucking shit, a year and a half! My standards for the Bethesda team are *low* but HOLY FUCK
---
Honestly - have no idea.  
---
But it looks to that it shouldn't matter, unless you're on PC. Just find the Data folder...  
---
and make sure that your ini files are located here:  
---
C:\\Users\\&lt;your user&gt;\\Documents\\My Games\\Fallout 76  
---
That's of course if I understand you correctly and you're playing on PC.  
---
However, I'm pretty sure there should be a hard way to install mods on actual xbox
---
Of course man.
---
That's awesome, thank you for that, will give it a try!
---
hehe yes, it's pc
---
DO you use a custom ini too? Im tempted to try it on the defaut ini to see if they work
---
Over the weekend someone dropped a nuke to do scorched earth. I was like I don't give a fuck if it's hard ima get the ton of XP you get cause double xp.
---
Well some cuck muffin decided dropping a nuke in the cranberry bog again was a good idea. Everyone was so busy trying not to die to the new nuke we failed the event because we didn't have the time to kill the queen.
---
I know this may be a bit of a pun but someone needs to regulate these nukes. stuff like this and ops thing need to not happen ever cause of the work people put into doing these missions and events
---
Unarmed is the power level way! Specially if he has a team mate sharing starched genes!
---
Killing WS invaders is tedious. They respawn over and over and over. There should be an option the boot them after the 30th kill, or mute their attack. I shouldnt have to put up with and endless wave of the same idiot. 
---
Side note: who plays fo76 for pvp? The pvp is clunky and awkward. The balance is crap, and the controls are weak. Its slightly better in NW but seriously, if your after pvp, go find a pvp game that was build for it. Like rust.
---
My junkie stealth commando 1 taps most enemies (glowing ghouls, scorched, super mutants etc) with a headshot, one short burst to the torso also does it.
---
It's enough damage to get the job done without all the micromanagement of a bloodied build.
---
Do you find him singling you out insulting?
---
Is it up to date though?
---
In the corner of my eye I saw him... Shialabot
---
I use a stealth rifle sniper build.  Lever action rifle is my go-to for most trash and standard mobs.  For end game, scorch beasts, and the like find yourself a nice Gauss rifle and toss a prime receiver on it.
---
they stack in inventory......
---
......
---
.....
---
..... but i dunno about effects
---
That would be amazing
---
Chameleon deathclaws are pretty damn close.
---
What makes me laugh is thier logic to defend themselves.
---
They agree the dupers doing so to sell the duped items are bad, effect the game and cause crashes. But none of them got banned. Because they all use alt accounts and move their duped items to mule accounts. 
---
But the ban was targeting people with duped items in their account. Which would mean all those mule accounts with duped items should have been banned. So they want us to believe there are thousands of mule accounts loaded to the brim with duped items. 
---
They also say that thousands of innocent players got swept up in the ban, because of picking up duped items found in the world, or legitimately buying them off of a players vendor. One even went so far as to tell the story of a great 14 year old that lost everything in the ban sweep, because someone dropped a duped item for him. 
---
But dupers doing it for the money, aren't known for their random generosity. They don't just go around dropping the very thing they make money off of. So they bad dupers are both ruining the game, ruining the market, and being very generous at the same time. 
---
These innocents never have come and posted for themselves. I've yet to read a story where someone says, I legit have only earned items in game, or bought legit from a players vending. How can I know if an items was truly duped or not in a players vending? 
---
None of them can provide any proof or evidence of what criteria or method Bethesda used to single out players that duped or had duped items. 
---
They have tried to scared the rest of us with tales of 50-80% of the players in the game being banned, and of empty servers. But again, not true. One gave a story about a facebook page for players losing thousands of members, and only 30 left. A group of PvP, who quit in the recent change where pvp would only be between the two people, rather than between one player and the group. Because they were using that tactic to grief other players. So the facebook group was promoting duped items, so as to out gear regular players. 
---
The best bullshit was this. I was being Robin Hood, giving players the stuff they wanted, which because of the way the game is made is impossible to get. Except for the fact people can get it. It's just they can't play the game without having ALL the best gear, because they really suck at the game if they aren't over powered. It's that simple. You see them at events, spray bullet everything. 
---
Or it's Bethesda's fault they cheated, because the game has bugs.
---
The fact is this. Hackers will ALWAYS succeed in hacking games. If you talk to anyone who works computer programing and design, they all say, eventually someone will find a way. 
---
So hackers who dupe will always find a new way. That's not an excuse to do something you KNOW is wrong. 
---
And that's it in the end. They want us to ignore the fact that they know they did something wrong. Because they can't play the game unless they trivialize it by being able to lazily kill everything without any risk.
---
Ran into him the other day.
---
&gt; You have a face only a mother could love...
---
&gt; Except your whole family died in the Great War.
---
Holy shit.
---
Yes, but I also noticed, that Fallout76.ini also was modified.
---
hell no, already have free spawn, sleeping bag, both stashes. No pay to win please or make it free for everyone.
---
The Schorchbeast Queen does less dmg to me then charred fucking ghouls
---
The main reason to care about this is that world objects (anything you pick up that's not in a container) are shared between players. If I spend time clearing a location and then someone else swoops in and picks up all the valuable junk in there, I'm going to be annoyed. Even more so if there's a world object that's more valuable than junk (like a rare plan).
---
I don't agree with the level of anger this player showed, but I definitely see where it could be coming from.
---
The first 76 Centaur!
---
The invisible ones with blade arms are my own personal nightmare. They are relentless.
---
The other grind is getting calibrated shocks and core assembly / emergency protocols... All very rare plans from SBQ. That or buy them from another player for lots of caps... I've killed the queen more times than I can remember... Still no calibrated shocks. And the other two (CA / EP) I was lucky enough to find in a player vendor for 1000 caps each ü§£
---
I got calbirated shocks once and I gave them to a friend of mine for free.As for the emergency protocoll and core assembly I still have to eait for them to get dropped...
---
me too. i had a team of level 17 -19's steal my workshop while i was at radrumble yesterday. ( i can never have enough acid)
---
they only tried to retake it from me 3 more times after. eventually I showed them secret service armour set under my ratty dress. good sports that got all my legendary scrip and lots of spare chems as a thanks for the lols.
---
THIS^
---
I did one solo yesterday and only one wave of enemies spawned? That can't be normal?
---
Oh my god! üòÇ
---
Also, we should have access to SSR settings, at least in the .inis, but they've for some reason kept that off limits, tweaking SSR could maybe at least have fixed some of it.
---
Joke's on them. My camp budget is 3 walls from maxed out.
---
yeah, someone made a post about that right around the launch of wastelanders, how almost all texture maps had been downsized, might be whats messing with the shine too.
---
i thought u can really stack anything if ur in god mode? didnt they patch that?
---
try using flamethrower to light them
---
I hate to say it, but I kinda hope you're not right cuz I have never purchased the game through the Bethesda net launcher nor do I intend to and if I'm losing atoms I should be getting, and Bethesda doesn't have a great reputation for making things right, I'll be a little annoyed
---
AAA title, B- engine
---
Only you can mod your Strangler PA pieces. You can't ask your friend - neither a chassis hosting the pieces nor the pieces themselves can be dropped / traded.
---
Dude, its your problem, you know the solution, I only agree with the cheater part.
---
Sadly I have to tell you it is a known bug.
---
the vault suits too, so Im guessing someone switched the contents of the radiation showers with baby oil.
---
Btw if you are flexing a 128 char you must be New to the game...
---
I'm just asking about a detail dude, chill out.
---
I use a heavily modified .50 hunting riffle with instating for general use 
---
.50 ammo is super easy to get so I don't run out ever and for though enemies I use a prime Gausse (???) Riffle 
---
and for sneaky times I use a silenced lever action rifle (I haven't unlocked the silencer for the hunting riffle)
---
I'm never going to find a usable explosive weapon...honestly. This last week I've done the queen 6 times, fought 8 legendary scorchbeasts, 3 level 90 sheepsquatch, and a bunch of other odds and ends of legendary creatures, most of these at least 2 star, some 3 star - my tally: 4 shovels (one 3 star), 2 lead pipes, 3 pipe pistols (okay, 2 pipe pistols, 1 revolver), 2 assassins pool cues, several pieces of leather and robot armour and 1 piece of combat armour (1 star hunters leg armour).
---
That's just this week since I've been playing a bit more than usual to try and do a bit of the season. I know I can't finish since I sometimes have to work late, but wanted to see where I ended up. 
---
I don't know where everyone finds these 2 shot explosive shotguns etc. etc. I must be doing something wrong :-)
---
Do the weeklies count as well, or should I do them immediately?
---
damn. i could have sworn stacking different chems was still relevant to this day.

We are getting One Wasteland in [September](https://i.imgur.com/l1gV15q.jpg), which scales every enemy in the world to the player. Low levels will be able to fight in previously high level zones (to what degree of success, I don't know), and us high levels will finally be able to return to previously low level zones without falling asleep. This also means that low and high level players can fight together.
---
Or another new luck perk: 
---
30% increased chance for your perks to actually work
---
I'll take the performance improvement sure, but I never had any issues to begin with, with performance, I dont mind a game getting tweaked over time, most MMOs are never how they start out for long, but this is too much for a Triple A title, and we're expected to just roll with it, what happens with the game when the next big update rolls out? what gets removed or downgraded then?
---
He would probably get banned
---
Scribe Halen and Knight Rhys were BOS NPCs from Fallout 4
---
I dont think 76 supports ray tracing, that'd do the trick, but that doesnt matter much if they're downgrading anyway, what happens when the next big update rolls out?
---
It‚Äôs not, you are correct. In fact I‚Äôd have a dozen if I wasn‚Äôt banned... ;)
---
Yup, the farther along I get, the more I find them a nuisance. I'll be minding my own business, try to do some fiddly thing or another and then hear the wing flap and screech. Ugh, here we go again. I once had a camp near a fissure site and it became so monotonous fighting them that I had to move. It would feel more worth it if I encountered more legendary ones, but they feel few and far between.
---
Unfortunately it could also be because the game is just not graphically optimized at all. It's so poor that I get massive framerate drops even on a PC that was top of the line when the game came out.
---
It could be that a PS4 Slim simply cannot handle both rendering the game and connecting to the servers at the same time, because the game is just that poorly made.
---
Could also be the PS4 servers are worse than the PC ones that I play on.
---
I‚Äôm a filthy casual on Xbox I‚Äôm not quite silo ready (barely level 50 if I remember right) but I do have I believe 2 more experienced people who might be willing to help out! And I mean I‚Äôll tag along and provide dumb jokes.
---
I love lamp
---
Subtitles would definitely work for these, too. 
---
Movies, even with tons going on, successfully get subtitles. At worst, sometimes bits of superfluous dialogue are removed or edited to fit all of the relevant dialogue onscreen. And even though there is constant sound, not all the sound is necessary to be described, just the stuff relevant to the plot. For example, subtitles can totally just say "(speaking Russian)" if the audience isn't meant to know what the Russian speaker is saying, or "(alien noises)" rather than describing the exact noise in detail.
---
News TV is live captioned and that's not ideal due to the delay that happens but it still works.
---
There's even people online who volunteer to add subtitles to random educational videos and YouTube videos, or to transcribe lyrics from lesser known artists from their videos - I've done quite a bit of this myself.
---
Audio description is also a thing, where rather than subtitles, descriptions of what's happening on screen are added between dialogue for the visually impaired. 
---
If all of this is possible, it's definitely possible to subtitle these (in comparison) slow moving holotapes.
---
they literally called this a lighting "improvement" when wastelanders came out, its nice to know they treat their fanbase like idiots.
---
Happens all the time. Hate assholes like that
---
Strength Bobblehead
---
Happened on my 2nd ever attempt. Working through the silo with my friend and alarms start going off. Even used the silo state holotape to make sure it was fine 1st. Waste of 1k caps
---
I have robotics expert and stealth for next time I decide to try. Should at least speed things up
---
Oh man. This is exactly what I wanted!!!! Fantastic news. Thanks bud
---
I remember my first insult bot encounter it was like 3ish days ago I was walking in the ash heap for a quest when I heard him, I stopped confused and saw him so I let him come up to me (since I like those encounters), and when he insulted me I was literally left speechless (don't ask me which insult I've forgotten at this point)
---
I guess you haven't talked to Ward lately.  By which I mean, that quest needs some visual cues that come in way before you hit 85 or 90% on the signal strength.  I've had the quest bug out and not provide updates on the signal strength and had to do it by the sound of the radio.  Not fun, no idea how a def person would be able to do it.
---
Take a screenshot with stuff in question in inventory/or standing at a location or killed enemy (not loot until done the photo) and take a screenshot of the challenge page that it hasn‚Äôt updated and send it to support. They sort your atoms out but challenges won‚Äôt update
---
With no shoes
---
Gotta get that double xp from those things somehow. Why waste the bullets?
---
That leaves then only the placement of the ini...
---
You did put it in /users/%user%/Documents/My Games/Fallout 76/ right? And you are not using the steam nor the PC-Pass version, right?
---
Because nobody cares about NW
---
I placed my camp near "the top of the world train station" near the water so it's easy to farm caps plus a lot of people have their camps in the area so people are more likely to be in the area so I can sell a lot of stuff in my vendors
---
You can stack Overdrive Daddyo an one more i keep forgetting which
---
CONGRAAAAAATULAAAAATIONS!
---
*BLAM*
---
neat, more steel scrap.
---
Gamepass is a whole different beast, I have not yet heard of anybody using a mod there.
---
Lots of people I should imagine.
---
Such a valid point.
---
Thank you for raising awareness of this.
---
Yeah I'm asking about the lamps on the train car! When I saw it on the atom shop I  thought it looked nice and hoped that these kind of details where taken into account since it's an exclusive pure cosmetic item that belongs in a bundle that costs 1500 atoms!
---
Oh yes even better so you can actually level it up. "It just works" seems a really fitting name.
---
Watching level 25 and below players run up to an SBQ with just a board or sledge always gets me smiling.
---
Go get em you crazy bastards
---
Yea it's still working.
---
Yeah I know that but right now I far away from the armor anyway so that doesnt bother me all that much
---
I heard yes
---
You can't.
---
later, chump.
---
It won‚Äôt let me. It‚Äôs greyed out.
---
Some people like it that way, man don't judge
---
Definitely fixable but still annoying.
---
Not flexing, just telling you what level I am and how it's not hard to level up
---
there's god mode, then there's todd mode
---
The dialogue from the holo tapes gets canceled if you blink while it plays and it‚Äôs at like .0000000012% volume to start with; they really need to figure this shit out.
---
I just deleted my local saved games after the fourth disconnection. What's going on?
---
thought it was just me :-/
---
Same with Lode Baring.
---
Just to add balance; I had a high level (&gt; 400) player basically clear out the silo for my lvl 80 ass and they let me launch it for my first nuke. 
---
Like everything, good and bad exist but it‚Äôs unfortunate that was your first experience. On balance I think FO76 has one of the least toxic player bases among similar games.
---
Should there be a solution to hackers when they shouldn't be there in the first place?
---
You can pop another herbivore serum and continue using the meat based foods. Lasts 1 hour.
---
We get Legendary Perks in Patch 22 and yes your Levels for unlocking them are retroactive.
---
Here's the roadmap by the way: https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/4mPsYvLByiH9sFAAOEcMAq/6a81bc94d42fb2489f1eb5e445efa29f/76_S1_FullSize_CommunityCalendar_EN_1920x1080.jpg
---
i read that in Morty voice
---
I have a bloodied vats crit Gatling laser, what are u offering?
---
Baby 76 players want their baby game to be even easier fucking pathetic
---
Maybe there‚Äôs an issue with the internet in your end or in your area.
---
Even tried taking the stock off and still is a commando gun.  Guerilla is terrible because the perk shows an uzi type gun. But best we have like 4 auto pistols instead. 1 of which is the pipe gun. 
---
Currently trying a 10mm auto pistol and with max perks it has terrible damage at any range, low size magazine and eats ammo.  What a waste of perks. 
---
Now spending about 15 perk points to respec as a sniper
---
I didn‚Äôt play on Thursday due to me wanting to play a different game with some friends (I only have one friend who actually plays FO76 and even then he‚Äôs grinding out a different game for the battlepass), however so far, I went from level 25ish to level 90. I‚Äôm going to try to push to level 100 today!!
---
Lol! Me too!

---
Are Nuclear Winter cheaters still a big problem? Not trying to be contrarian I'm genuinely curious what other people are experiencing.
---
I remember them being quite common prior to Wastelanders, especially on the double XP weekends, but I don't think I've had a really egregious cheater who's flying across the map for a few months (I'd estimate 50 games). I don't know whether I'm getting lucky, or there's more people playing.
---
With Class Freak perk the downsides of mutations are decreased.
---
Marsupial is.. Honestly in a lot of ways, game changing. You'll find yourself jumping up buildings, mountains, holes in the floor. Need to escape a ghoul pack? Jump onto a roof.
---
For the jetpackless, it's amazing.
---
Just buy a serum for it from someone's camp.
---
Good to know, thanks
---
Railway rifle works in vats, I think that's about all.
---
I‚Äôm on pc, I would love to give you some ammo and run a nuke silo with you and let u launch it... if ur on pc let me know... most of us wastelanders aren‚Äôt bad eggs like who ever stole your nuke
---
They're live in the PTS right now and planned for patch 22 in september. You can look up what the perks are and how to upgrade them, but they're still two months out so expect some things to change.
---
I get your preference may be different but you might want to check out T-51b since Ultracite in lore (from what I've seen on wikis and stuff) is modified T-51 in looks but T-51b (at level 50) has the DMG resist of Ultra and Energy Resist of X-01 but has very little Rad resist (which makes its very poor for nuke zones but amazing for tanking) and has alot of skins
---
Go find a real girlfriend
---
I avoid carrying to much stuff.
---
Sounds like their sense of empathy has either eroded by extreme prolonged exposure to the anonymity of the internet, or their anonymity has allowed their true personality to surface.
---
Or to be blunt; another individual suffering from Anonymous Social Syndrome.
---
The best thing to do when someone shows you their A.S.S. is try not to laugh at them. That tends only to trigger them more, and will just try to shove their A.S.S. in your face more aggressively.  
---
It's best to completely ignore them. Don't make eye contact, and don't respond.
---
Todd sings his remixed blackbear song, "Cluck you and you and yooooo-u-u"
---
Do those audio perks to find collectibles have any kind of rumble component that deaf people could use?
---
I feel like I see legendary ones pretty often. Maybe one out of four times though usually just 1*.
---
I hear you on them being a nuisance. I always just think "here comes the attack that does nothing but make it hard to see"
---
Do you have any Bushwookie tips?  I am terrible at competitive multiplayer.
---
Oo yea I have that perk on and the one to make sure I don't lose my mutation. How many caps will I be spending about? My cap budgeting is god awful lol
---
Pretty sure this guy still is playing.
---
300-500 usually on PC
---
Huh, I wasn‚Äôt aware of this... gonna have to try and get my hands on some T-51 now. Though I quite like the actual look of Ultracite.
---
I want to know how many days in a row "rank up" is going to be the SCORE challenge.
---
Not a new bug . It‚Äôs happened for me before , back in March
---
I've noticed alot creatures like mirelurks will kill me, but getting shot by a scorched or super mutant might only down me
---
Ballin! Thats where I am so ill hunt around later when I pop on for it. Thank ya much!
---
I am, just stopped buying atoms all together
---
Any update?
---
Those crazy bastards are the best.
---
Well its not Hard to lvl up on NW either
---
When you go bloodied and max out your damage perk cards, you won't need to waste so much ammo!
---
Entitled fucking Pve players, I play the mode a lot and the hacking problem is not as bad as it was when wasteland lanched.
---
Brave souls, I had a level 45 in regular armor follow my SH PA ass into B Wing to collect ore. I was tapping my radaway to control the rads and I saw him just flop over into the water instantly dead.
---
idk, glowing gulpers really give me fits for whatever reason.  
---
Mirelurk Kings can sneak up on you too.
---
Yes, they are lamps, they should take power to light, but sadly don't. They just sit there quietly in the dark
---
play music instrument
---
And vice versa, some emotes such as flag planting would be great for screenshots!
---
Same here! Picked it up when quarantine started and haven't looked back. Someone was at my camp today and while I was repairing armor I got the cap jingle bc he bought a 3* LMG I put up for cheap. I ran downstairs and he was gone but then I went out on the porch and saw him pull the gun out in front, clearly checking out his purchase. I have him the thumbs up, he gave me one back. Exchanges like that make the game great!
---
Na when bethesda spend half the time fixing these exploits or disabling features instead of adding content to the game it affects the community. 
---
So as the guy said above - fuck em
---
The nw challenges have been ridiculously easy
---
u/ladydevann pleaseeee it just makes sense
---
All I could think about when you mentioned the scorched was 'where scorched a pre-war thing, or a pre-pre-war thing.' I hope someone gets the reference.
---
I wish they had work benches that would snap together.
---
yeah I like the look of Ultracite but if you want here are the stats from the fallout wikia
---
T-51b:DR: 454
---
ER: 454
---
RR: 305
---
Ultracite:
---
DR: 453
---
ER: 393
---
RR: 393
---
While the resist change from Energy is like 60 I feel that Rad resist really has no use to me outside of nuked zones so ultracite is probably still best for nuked zones but outside of them T-51b is better
---
Amazing job!
---
Maybe in NW?
---
But I don't want to place my camp 4 times and run into the storm. I just want to shoot ghouls and complain.
---
Same as these lads, im on ps4 I‚Äôll help you run silo and make you ammo, weapons etc.
---
Leveling up is easy.
---
I just played myself last night. Did a solo silo run, when I got about 3/4 way through i found a power armour chassis in the corner of the tinker bench room right near the bench, it had a bunch of power armor and a couple fusion cores stored in it. It was at that mo.ent I realized that I could easily have this silo run taken from me and made sure I was the only one there, obviously can't see chineese stealth people.
---
I agree with most saying it should be a private interior and the only way you can enter is if your in a group together and the player gives permission. It should be whoever enters first becomes the silo general,  and is the only one that can use the targeting system. I say let them use keyword and cose cause it would be funny if someone joins the group comes in with tou to try and steal the nuke launch, only to insert keycard and code and then go hit targeting system and it has a message "only the silo general can use the targeting system"
---
Happening on the pc gamepass version as well. Missing about 500. Whatever hotfix they did for the SCORE is when it started to mess up. Worked fine before that.
---
Thank to your comment I found this post:
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hokpg3/mods\_not\_working\_for\_game\_pass\_version/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hokpg3/mods_not_working_for_game_pass_version/) 
---
It seems I need to use another name for the ini. WIll test it tonight
---
Mirelurks worked for me when doing that challenge. They also worked for the semi aquatic creatures challenge. I‚Äôm on PS4.
---
I am tracking this bug for almost a week now. This happened when ~~gamepass dropped~~ when the score hotfix was applied as user u/ReflectiveVengeance pointed out, it was fine before that. It also affects gamepass players as well. So we are together in this bug.
---
Yeah I always like helping others and show them that there are plenty of things that occur in this game that are deeper than originally thought to be. It took me awhile to figure all this out and see the direct effects each special stat has, but you can definitely see a major difference when you move stats around!
---
Wait, you still have a budget?
---
Im using the PC-pass version yes. I just read I just need to use a different name for the ini: Project76Custom.ini
---
I will test it tonight
---
I have not seen anybody flying around, but I have seen more than a few instances of a player just auto targeting and shooting other players to death. It's a little more subtle. They only hit with about 85% of their shots... but the bullets fly in directions independent of where they are aiming and shoot thru obstacles (multiple walls, multiple buildings, etc...)
---
I did NW when it started, and I typically don't like PVP, but I enjoyed it. Then the cheaters came, and I left. When the NW challenges became part of the Legendary Run, I tried it again. It looked like the cheaters left for greener pastures. But now they are back, and it's only gonna get worse.
---
I would say charisma is great in team play, even solo play. Team you can use bodyguards and solo you can use line wanderer. So if anything invest 4 points into it and see if you wanna share any relevant perks with friends.
---
*feature
---
Ugh I hate people like this, I'm sorry it happened to you. Are you on PC? I'm happy to help you do it again and I swear I won't steal your nuke! What ammo do you use? If I can spare it I'll help :)
---
As long as there is am option to turn snapping of I'm down for that
---
Well wouldja look at that. You wouldn‚Äôt know where I could find a set of max level T-51b?
---
But they are taller than your character and it was not irradiated in the area
---
I can't find that station
---
I use the armour plated backpack , and carry the additional carry weight one for when I need it
---
Well maybe your VATS is broken? Just find a mechanic...oh yeah none survived the war...RIP
---
The new wendigo colossus, a real boss fight experience. With the sbq I mostly stand there shooting and tank damage and wait for her to come to me. But with the colossus I have to keep backing up because it‚Äôs right in my face kicking me (which does a lot of damage) and doing its scream attack, plus when walking backwards I can‚Äôt go left or right otherwise I hit its damage over time pools. A real boss fight experience
---
You‚Äôre a champ thank you
---
I haven't seen any the past few weeks, on US-East. That being said I have seen a fair few exploits. Invincible sentry turrets for example.
---
My girlfriend has figured out that if she doesn't use a heavy weapon on the queen, she won't be able to loot it. Unless you have a really good build, that's your best bet.
---
I recommend a .50 cal. They pack a good punch and you get a decent amount of ammo when you craft it. LMG's are great, too. But you gotta have your ammo farming down pat for that one. If you can feed the beast it won't disappoint. Prime whatever gun you decide on. 
---
I sell flux for 75 to 100 caps apiece. I've seen people selling it for way more. 200, 300, 400 each. Don't be that guy. Have reasonable prices.
---
I've used shotguns, heavy guns and rifles in vats PvP recently. It all went well
---
I have the HC backpack already isn‚Äôt that a better option?
---
Really hmmm
---
That‚Äôs a good idea I‚Äôm a junkie build but I didn‚Äôt ever consider this
---
And with a pistol build no less. Well done OP!
---
Don't bother coming on here if you're gonna be a little bitch about this game
---
36/45 here. So many rifles... I get a shot of dopamine every time I randomly find one in world... which is like once MAYBE twice a week only to be disappointed in scrapping that one for nothing. I‚Äôve crafted hundreds... 
---
They really shouldn‚Äôt have put it as such bad odds... im still out a few mods for armors other than leather but I don‚Äôt craft those. Too many drops to waste the mats for more rad rifles...
---
Always shows up at the strangest moments. I love it.
---
I've been thinking about this, and may have come up with a solution. But it might not work.
---
Stored items can be placed manually or if they are included in a blue print. See if you can blue print the one at your camp. If not try to blueprint one at a workshop. Then move your camp station so your entire camp gets stored. Now try to place the blueprint of the ammo machine at a workshop that DOESNT normally have one. Place your camp from the stored version. See if the budget looks normal or if the ammo machine appears again. Hope this helps.
---
Maybe they should get a fund together and pay for it themselves?
---
We should be able to enslave that bastard as a collectron so it can rip the shit out of us for keeping him against his will
---
At level 19 I was barely going into the toxic valley and ash heap. Although I guess free fast travel to public events helps now and that wasn't a thing back then.
---
I prefer using the Armour  plated one for a few reasons ,  more survivability, but you also get used to the lower weight level, I automatically scrap stuff when I get close rather that push on until I go over the HC level.
---
NICE! im only level 29.  Missed the first weekend and first full week.  ugh.
---
wouldn't know personally a set spawn, I guess if you find plans in player vendors (which will most likely cost a few hundred caps just for a few pieces) or the set spawns of frames in the ash heap or other high level areas.
---
or if you have the sheer will you can grind 18,000 bullion I think it was for it and all the mods and you can get the T-65 power armor which has 565 DMG and 470 ER and RR
---
Good idea ya I use it everyday currently
---
I‚Äôve seen people say it‚Äôs only the dailies but can not confirm.
---
Nice, my first time I was in the cranberry bog with my main sniper build (before trading was really a thing and my sniper was a hunting rifle) it was close to my camp and I said f it and opened fire, managed to take it down with help of a final vats critical dragon shot
---
Not sure if that was an intended pun or not OP. Either way I'm with you. I want a chicken coop to go with my brahmin pen.
---
A few server hops around Watoga and the surrounding military outposts should net you most of the pieces!
---
Like the mire and toxic Valley. And even the bog. The only one that really looks like any other fallout is the forest. Even tho there's more trees and wildlife I feel like thats and even more accurate depiction of what this area would look like if they only nuked further away that right in the map.. if you  what I'm saying, like the nukes from the war didn't get dropped right on the playable area but maybe further outside the borders and the playable area was affected by the fallout rather than the bombs. It more so confuses me how we had people basically a year after the war out and about walking and doing normal life things this games doesn't make sense with the lore and it bothers the fuck out of me. We have the first vault of the series that didnt have some sick twisted experiment done secretly, with some of the world's highest level political people. Ment to repopilate and civilize earth and they screwed up the lore big time. Wouldve loved for them to have the enclave and and maybe BOS and then a bunch of new eastern seaboard factions. (I find it would be quite possible for the east and west coasts military to stay in touch a while after the war making the possibility of the BOS being more widespread than we thought.
---
If you take a RadX, eat the food, and then a RadX diluted, you can gain the benefits back. RadX doest stack, and diluted doesn't suppress mutations.
---
I hope this is sarcasm.
---
So those are those accessible in any way for those of us who never bought the Bethesda launcher version of the game, aside from waiting for a free weekend?
---
I'm using the Game Pass version of the game, and never purchased the game before that, so I can't log in though the Bethesda launcher version.
---
Dude I ran into my first ones yesterday after hitting level 50 and it was a shit show. I was working on a Beckett quest and had to go to The Freak Show or whatever it is. When I get there I see a Mirelurk queen that I still hadn't tried to kill so I shoot it. Suddenly I'm surrounded by two kings and a scorchbeast and I die almost instantly after running around for a few seconds. Shit was hilarious.
---
No problem. Most long guns full under a single shot rifle and automatic. It just depends on the receiver you put in it. I‚Äôve taken, but don‚Äôt use currently, the commando perks so I could switch to a bloodied commando on the fly if I wanted to.
---
Same over the last weekend. Couldn‚Äôt play for a couple hours at a time. Don‚Äôt bother posting here everyone will blame your internet instead of the servers
---
I‚Äôm... really lazy... and work full time, I barely have the commitment to get the SS Jetpack hahaha. I‚Äôll server hop a bit and try to get some Max level T-51b. Or ask on the marketplace...
---
Really? I went to ash heap by lvl 5 lol not like all the way but I did stay towards Charleston more and I really haven't gone to the toxic Valley at all. Or mire. Only for quests I had to. And I still Haven't completed anything really. I just don't really know whats up in the toxic Valley thats worth my time up there.
---
Which one is the steeped variant? Can only find the +2 strength option.
---
They always seem to spawn at lvl 30
---
Untrue. Diminishing returns on bought items. I clear them out of caps before I buy any plans or bulk junk so I can sell a little bit more to them and get some caps and inventory space back after.
---
While getting killed multiple times a day at terminals waiting for the server to load.
---
A PA frame with a full set of registered excavator armor will take up 10 lbs in your inventory and allow you to carry 100+ lbs in an emergency. Aside from that i dont know of any plant recipes that offer + carry weight. Having said that, i have never bothered to look online to see if there *are* any such recipes for herbivores.
---
I do plan on removing herbivore from my sniper char and switching back over to carnivore just as soon as i can get around to it. I keep forgetting to do so ingame. But i definitely find carnivore far more useful and convenient.
---
That seems dependant on the player who was in the area first alas,since the banwave the servers are mostly low levels so that's probably what's happening here.
---
Best thing for that one or two caps left at the end of the 1400.
---
I mean play another world, or get a private server, no one can say to another what to do, where to be, or how to play the game.
---
That would make sense
---
Blocker is kind of broken right now, not all the time but it intermittently stops working!
---
This. Earning XP was the biggest miss early on in the season. Posts claiming the run is near impossible gave little thought on the worth of XP. Increase your intelligence, add in XP buffs (food, sleep, team bonus, etc) and grind on XP runs after your dailies. Passed LVL 50 yesterday myself, I‚Äôm on about an hour a day and a bit more on the weekends. As for buying ranks, play till the very end and buy only then. The higher ranks are worth more, yet they all cost the same Atoms.
---
Well, sure... if you want to play that way.. But wouldnt you prefer three candidates who are incapable of eliminating you AND contribute to the elimination of those candidates who actually ARE capable of eliminating you ?
---
Because they'd much rather ban hundreds of players who get gifted a duped weapon playing a PvE game mode than ban actual cheaters in a competitive mode!
---
Thanks for the info, I wasn't aware of that :)
---
I think that post was debunked.
---
You're doing good. Grab everything that isn't nailed down and put it in there. Grab workshops on private server and profit.
---
Theyre only an issue when they can infinitely shoot their lasers otherwise theyre manageable.
---
&gt; in the older games you could repair a weapon through the pip boy
---
"Let me slap those two 10mm pistols together and ... voila! The strongest one absorbed the weak one and is now even stronger!"
---
At least, in new vegas, you could craft weapon repair kits at a workbench.
---
It's worse than that, if you do finish any of these challenges you won't get the atoms since the last patch!
---
Steeped Fern Flower Tea.
---
i know just making small funnies
---
but using an elplosive weapon works well for me
---
Stay safe out there
---
I will never understand why memes are not permitted in this sub but  posts like this one are.
---
if you have good things to trade get junk or flux. you can always make caps. Buy junk from vendors

---
grab as much lead and steel as possible. make sure you use the scapper perk
---
Well i always just thought you would remove the working parts from the doner weapon and replace them in your user weapon. At least for guns, not sure how it worked for melee!
---
I just hit 30...don't worry, we'll get there :)
---
I f you remember their name we can launch an nuke on their C.A.M.P.
---
I'd love to hear your reasoning on why you think not wanting hackers is equal to wanting the game to be easier.
---
I don‚Äôt have the plan but I willing to craft you one. 
---
I recently stumbled upon the plan for 1000 caps, felt like I won the lottery!
---
I feel your pain. The first time I launched a nuke (at the whitespring), the game IMMEDIATELY crashed. After about ten minutes of trying to get the game to load, I was somehow able to rejoin the lobby. Once I finally made my way to the nuke zone, I discovered that two level 300‚Äôs had pilfered all of the loot. They killed the deathclaw, harvested all the flora, and scoured the whole area for every single enemy there. It was the worst. So, you‚Äôre not alone in that pain.
---
Also, I too hate running op builds, and so I found that running the silos with power armor makes it a breeze. (Unless that‚Äôs just me).
---
I hate those things so much, especially the scorched one that pop up out of nowhere at SBQ. I found the best thing for them (and wendigo) is a tricked out huge napalmer. It drops them in 2 seconds flat.
---
There are two doors you can glitch through using photo mode 5 mins top and your in the silo room them 5 mins again to launch the nuke if your on your own only a hand full of bots actually spawn in the last room if your on PS4 I'll gladly show you how
---
Ah yea that's how to play the game!
---
See if you can blueprint the scrap box to use after 1st is gone. I literally just thought of this because I‚Äôve blueprinted stuff that you wouldn‚Äôt think you could. Like the ammunition maker at the ammo factory. You can bp that and take it to your camp and it works. So many different things can be done in this game. 
---
I know the scrap box don‚Äôt work if you don‚Äôt have 1st but maybe blueprinting it will. Just a thought.
---
are you sure it wasn't a visual glitch? it's been known to happen..log out and in, hopefully that helps :)
---
If I get another one, I'll just give you it.
---
I started a new char on Sunday, just did a bit of the Wayward and Responder quests, and it felt like this should be the way the game is normally played.
---
Already bummed thinking about playing tomorrow (no time today) and leveling up like a slog again‚Ä¶
---
Yeah I was just over-exagerating the process ... and pointing out that one cool feature is now a p2w feature. ;c
---
I ended up buying a 2 star bloodied ultrice laser from a player vendor. Never really used it tho. From purveyor the best bloodied I got was a 3 star sub machine gun. Of course the other sub machine gun that had explosive was a suppressor instead of the bloodied one. Lol or gotta love that 3 star bloodied crossbow
---
The only bad thing with this event, the regen buffs... It's kinda useless and last 40mn if i'm remember, who need this ?
---
A true dog companion (one that follows you around) would be sick tho ngl they could have 3 types so there arent too many duplicates running around with people like a wild mongrel, Guard dog or wolf
---
This! Confetti/Party Favor is my favorite.
---
If your on PS4 I‚Äôll help you launch it I won‚Äôt be a really big help as my main account got banned for no reason so I‚Äôm only level 43 but just give me like a day and I‚Äôll be level 50+ and I‚Äôll do the enclave questline again I‚Äôll also teach you my way of doing it which can skip straight to the launch prep if you want unless you want to do it legit which is understandable
---
I'm 3 places behind him. I worry that the score grind closer to end will allow him to catch up.
---
Always been 10, but wouldn't surprise me if they extended it due to all the score issues.
---
My personal opinion is the Leader and 'Kick' option should be removed from Public groups. Use a Private group if you want those options. I've watched more folks get kicked for no reason. In turn that causes you to have to wait for the next person to Bond. It's getting abused and will cause folks not to want to use it. I believe this is already happening on xbox.
---
If you don't want someone in your area farming when you are, get Fallout 1st.
---
Build alot of scrapboxes, if the one u have breaks u cant make a new one iirc. I could be wrong though
---
....just....why?
---
Lighting is key. About 70% of the time the lighting is just terrible, another 39% of the time it's good enough for a decent picture. You're looking for that 1% chance where the lighting is just right. You'll eventually get to the point where you can see it and will stop everything to take a good shot. And be quick, it doesn't last long.
---
For jaw dropping action shots turn your hud opacity to 0 and do a screen capture. It won't show in your in game gallery but it's the only way to get those shots.
---
Hey. Send me a pm and I‚Äôll give you my gamer tag. I‚Äôve got a lot I can give you. I‚Äôll be on later though. At work rn
---
haha yeah, ill miss doing the two or three new perk cards every event for sure. gonna definitely focus more on my quest now but if those two pub events come up ill be sure to run them, those are the most fun ones ive done so far
---
Had the same issue with thorn and solar armor. At roughly 13 steel per piece. Didnt think my final grind would be server hopping the rusty pick til I couldn't get another server. Waiting a day and then repeating.
---
Didnt even bother trying to re roll the armors.
---
Bethesda really dont play their own games
---
Have you considered the SS underarmor? When it‚Äôs shielded, it gives you +4 str, +2 per, and +4 end, so imo if you‚Äôre a melee or heavy gunner build it‚Äôs a worthwhile investment. Commando is still better off using shielded harnesses and the like.
---
Underrated
---
Get the travel perk card. Make sure you selling all things at vendors, work on getting hard bargain perk card to 3. Ammo is everywhere, but always use melee weapons to conserve ammo. Check train stations. People dump ammo all the time.
---
I wonder if this has contributed to it not being used a lot.
---
Try and enjoy the game while its difficult
---
Vendor bots have 1400 caps every 20 hours
---
So pick up everything and sell it to them
---
Try and use either melee or semi-auto weapons to save on resources
---
Without 1st you can still take things out of the scrapbox, you just can't add anything to it.  That's a good thought about blueprinting!
---
It was actually weirder than that. I got fallout 1st recently for a month just to try it (don‚Äôt exactly hate it but don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs exactly worth the price either) so when I was at my camp I couldn‚Äôt find the power armors that I was talking about I even reloaded from my private world to public and it still didn‚Äôt show up. But when I went to my survival tent, there they were. I was pretty relieved.
---
I was pretty worried because I‚Äôve heard of this glitch happening before. But then again my gatlin laser never came back but I noticed that disappeared a month or so ago and that really was just like wharever idc but at the same time I‚Äôm now out of a fucking gatlin laser.
---
I‚Äôm not deaf but I usually play with the volume way down when the kids and wife are sleeping. I never really thought about it, but that is so weird that they wouldn‚Äôt have captioned that, even though all of the hototapes are captioned.
---
Except for the ash heap and the toxic valley they are all the natural environments of the area, changed but still familiar.  The toxic Valley is an area where industry was literally dumping and burying toxic waste underground. 
---
The BoS and enclave do exist in the game thought BoS was retcon'd since they weren't technically suppose to exist yet.  Also it's always been Canon that people survived outside the vaults. The world of fallout had very different biology when it comes to radiation afterall.
---
I don't think wastelanders brought any new recipes, but it was correct before that. If bugs cause system to not work, it doesn't change how it's supposed to work.
---
So, to my knowledge it is up to date and correct.
---
Why do you people always get so angry when I roast you, luckily for me your combat skills are as bad as your sense of humour ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
Anyone got a video on the chicken coop, didn't see anything on youtube.
---
I haven‚Äôt gotten a good roll on one either to be able to utilize the mods I do know so I wouldn‚Äôt doubt it. It feels like the learn chances on mods are worse on it than the armors but I think that‚Äôs because the armor is more plentiful.
---
I dont even want to imagine what pain it must be to save uo vault steel and legendary modules just to reroll the armors til you get something good... this game is busting with stupid game mechanics
---
Lead and steel are next priorities on the list after acid üòÅ  Unfortunately I do not really have good trades.
---
The cows walk themselves. You only need to herd them when you start the quest, and when they scatter. You can herd them further, but this only helps you if you wanna hurry up. If you want to get a shot in thr sheep, simply stop herding after the yao guai appears. The distance is small and the cows will get there by themselves, giving you enough time tp set up your buffs and weapons.
---
I've  tried to method above outlined by others and I bought and logged in to a steam version of F76, with a linked account, when I do the bethesda login it just states for me "the free trial period has ended" and I can't find out if the missing atoms are there or not.
---
So I don't think this applies to everyone, probably mostly to those who had it bethesda only then linked it to steam when ti was available there.
---
You can't seriously expect anyone of us to believe that you've only just noticed hackers in NW. Bannng hackers is pointless, but it's all you've got right? You've never made a single successful attempt to defeat them.
---
As others have mentioned, check out your perks... there's one that reduces prices at vendors, and another that reduces the cost of fast travelling. Also, party up every time you play with the new public teams, as you can fast travel to your teammates camps &amp; tents for free.  
---
That said, I'm lvl 83 on Xbox, hit me up &amp; I'll see if I can help you out sometime! GT = ElStev013
---
Strip, only move while crouched. I sit in the bush and watch people taking each other out then scavenge any decent left overs. As long as I‚Äôm in the final 10, its all good.
---
Are you placing power armour (A on Xbox), or are you dropping (X on Xbox) ?
---
I remember those days, we even had to repair are own weapons, no repair kits in those times :)
---
Luck is also going to play a big role in this build (the Special, that is) and you might want to look at investing in Critical Hit perks found in the Luck star to maximise your damage from each hit, since your sustained damage against a target is going to be none-existent. Keep an eye out for any Quad crossbows too as they‚Äôll make your day to day mob grinding a lot smoother.
---
From personal experience I‚Äôd stay away from the fancy explosive frames and stick to ultracite: explosive ammo interferes with the armour penetration afforded by Bow Before Me and can end up reducing your damage output, although I suppose the AoE effect is nice for crowd control.
---
Overkill. Are you using an explosive weapon and not equipping Fireproof level 3?
---
‚ÄúfOr CrEyIn‚Äô oUt lOuD wHeRE‚Äôs mY tOoLs?!‚Äù
---
What rank is it on?
---
I think its more likely a code change, it happened since the SCORE "hotfix". I just tried the methods outlined here, the bethesda account login doesn't even let me check as it jsut states the free trial is over, as I bought originally through steam.
---
So I don't think it applies to everyone, the method of checking bethesda account if you have it via steam.
---
Yeah, we took hemlock holes and Grafton steel last night.  If I hadn't had to be afk to make dinner, I think we could have managed to keep 3 workshops at once.
---
Thanks I'll remember that next time, I thought I had to herd them to the pen.
---
This last time the player jumped onto the the shed and killed the sheep instantly with some blue beam or flame shooting weapon, no one else got a tag.
---
It would be nice if they brought it out of beta before making it feature in their newest content.
---
Remove damage buff cards and frog legs while we're at it.
---
Thanks for the offer but I‚Äôm just looking for the plan
---
I've noticed that all the "radio dramas" give that same really plain basic text for the entirety of the tape.  I guess Bethesda didn't find it relevant enough to put into actual text, which to be fair, is pretty much completely irrelevant to the game, and prioritized other things.  For the audiotapes, you can always see their text on the various wikis at least:  
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Curse\_of\_the\_Wendigo\_-\_Part\_1](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Curse_of_the_Wendigo_-_Part_1)

 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Curse\_of\_the\_Wendigo\_-\_Part\_2](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Curse_of_the_Wendigo_-_Part_2)
---
Scrap all junk.  
---
Bulking Aluminium and Lead will reduce their weights 50% - other junk weight not effected by bulking.  
---
Bulk extra junk and take to vendor to sell as needed. 
---
Don't keep more that 150 steel and wood at a time - you can get those more easily by scrapping guns you collect from running areas in normal play.  And it leaves you more space for the tougher resources to farm.
---
Don't bother keeping weapons and armor in early game.  You will level out of them quickly.  Only consider keeping it if 3 star legendary and at least level 45.
---
Don't keep the heavier ammo like missiles or extra fusion cores (especially the latter unless you plan on running only  power armor, and even then perk cards will reduce the need to stockpile cores)
---
Never store food - waste of space.
---
Wiki says it gives 2, not 4. Or did you mean with herbivore?
---
Got some nice stuff from a couple of high level players ...big thx and greetings from Germany !
---
I was not aware of that, thanks!
---
I think my one is bloodied/faster fire, but i play full health so I‚Äôm hoping to end up with a 3 star furious.
---
With Herbivore, yes.  Sorry, should've stated "It's with Herbivore.".
---
Thank you,means a lot
---
Im gonna sound (not a pun) like an asshole for maybe saying this, sorry ahead of time, but have you tried wearing gaming headphones (assuming you‚Äôre deaf) and turning up the bass? One of my old friends parents are both deaf (both born with it) and he could not just mouth read, but would turn the tv all the way up to make out the sounds and some words for the vibrations. Maybe that could be worth trying with surround sound bass, or bass based headphones.
---
I don't even need the legendary, I'm selling a dozen or two each day to complement my 1400, it's the principle really. Just makes me feel anxious.
---
Have you checked to see if there is a hidden power connector on the train car? The red rocket garage has one that causes the rocket to emit flames and the interior lights to light up.
---
I made land mines for the first time and threw them down between rounds, it was AWESOME
---
He's training to fight Apollo creed, building a solid montage
---
I'm a big scaredy cat lol
---
i love invincible opponents :/
---
Congrats!!
---
 I am only 2 behind him hope to pass soon.
---
I did check but couldn't find anything. I'll double check once I get home.
---
It does, as long as you don't use an Automatic Receiver.
---
I've made over 75 SS Left Arms without getting an unyielding...  
---
Only good news is that this is for my 2nd character who is mainly PA and I already have a full set on the first.
---
Even with my legacy laser rifle I‚Äôve had to empty more than three rounds into something because it literally bursts into flames, turns to ash and then somehow goes back to full health and attacks me again.
---
Usually a combination of excess stims, assorted drugs, crafted stim diffusers and marine helmets. If I‚Äôm in a rush it‚Äôs two serums and some ultracite scrap.
---
Tip: Never go shopping with junk in your inventory :)
---
Yesterday I got 3 pieces of assassins armor and two assassins weapons, does anyone use that anymore?  I am surely not selling any at my C.A.M.P.
---
My first SQQ fight as a low level I only had some crappy 1 Star golf club. Couldn‚Äôt figure out ehh I couldn‚Äôt loot after it was dead.
---
There is a mod for It already. Using It for almost one year now. Its a must have for me.
---
Can you remember which challenge it was?
---
I can still build it and I don't have fallout 1st anymore. I can build it at My camp and workshops.
---
I‚Äôve never had a 3 drop. Crap 2s usually and I have one TwoShot 1 Star sitting as my guinea pig for when I finally get all the mods. 
---
I think the loot pool list needs to be able to be shortened from just ranged and melee from the purveyor even if that means like another 10 scrip or something. RNG has too much of a hold on these game mechanics. If it wasn‚Äôt for the trading subs, I wouldn‚Äôt have a few pieces I have for sure.
---
Edit: forgot asterisk changes to *italics*
---
I can hear your comment
---
**Simple fern flower tea** gives you plus 1 STR and **Steeped fern flower tea** gives you plus 2 STR.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Simple_fern_flower_tea
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Steeped_fern_flower_tea
---
Edit: Chally's milk gives you 1 STR. Chally is a Gram's brahmin. And Gram is a random encounter.
---
Lewes?
---
Scribe Haylen and Knight Rhys were in Fallout 4.(Which is awhile after Fallout 76.)
---
But you said ‚ÄúScribe Helen and Knight Russ‚Äù.
---
Those are two completely different names and aren‚Äôt even said the same way.
---
So, don‚Äôt downvote because you can‚Äôt spell names, lmao.
---
Ok , thanks for clearing that up
---
Initially, stealth chars will want to prioritize leather armor with the shadowed mod and a couple of muffled pieces. This, along with the high agility any stealth char should have will enable a very strong stealth. And stealth is the entirety of your defense.
---
Once you get the evasive perk card, you can stop worrying about the movement noise from your armor all together and remove the muffled mods for something like sleek or w/e. Eliminating the movement noise also allows you to equip heavier armors and still maintain a strong stealth.
---
Once you are comfortable with the character, you might consider looking into the benefits of a low-life Bloodied/Unyielding build. I dont recommend it for your first char, but once you understand what youre doing, Bloodied/Unyielding is the optimum endgame path for pretty much every build. The offensive/defensive/special stat synergies are just amazing.
---
One of the benefits of a high perception/high agility build is that it is incredibly versatile. In addition to your archery, once you get the char leveled, you will be able to buy the perk cards to play as rifleman, commando, or pistol gunslinger without having to change your special points.
---
I would also recommend you go to AngryTurtle's youtube channel and watch his video guides on mutations. The speed demon and Marsupial mutations an particular are absolute game changers for many. I personally refuse to play without them. You can get mutations starting at L5, and AT does a great job of explaining the mechanics and the proc/cons. He also explain how to get them at L5, for free.
---
78. I am at 77 and this level is taking 10x longer than all the others lol.
---
Everyone‚Äôs suggestions of favoriting and renaming are great but I think the obvious answer is to pay attention to what you are doing.
---
Was thinking of doing a build there too. Do the mobs still spawn after placing the camp?
---
To loot the SBQ you need to inflict a certain amount of damage on it
---
Oh jeez. Well good luck
---
I just can not add new stuff in. Only take junk out of it
---
that is actually a good tip :)
---
I sell a wide range of chems and other aid items. I don't really use them much and I get so many of them I end up with 100lbs of the stuff on the regular. Usually within an hour or so of starting to play I'll go do an aid item dump at a vendor and I usually get the bulk of my cap limit that way, and I'll sell grenades, mines, and 1-2 star legendaries to make up the rest if my legendary script cap has been reached for the day as well.
---
A single Blackwater Mine run through and Radiation Rumble will max the 1400 caps for me - glowing food and blood and all the weapons and junk.... with the vendor perk card it just blows through the vendor.  West Tek for weapons works too.
---
&gt; The fact that it costs caps to FT, it makes no sense. 
---
FT in and of itself makes no sense from an in-game lore perspective and is basically only there for player convenience. Mechanically, it's one of the few cap sinks in the game, so I don't mind it all that much.
---
its currently still active.
---
On the map near the top of the world icon you can see some train tracks the station is near those tracks it shouldn't be hard to find
---
How is it fair to have voice chat only ingame.
---
I'm personally not deaf, but was raised with the community. The issue isn't in quality of sound, but total lack of subtitles. With total deafness, it doesn't matter if you're playing the thing through a headset made out of lourspeakers, it just ain't gonna cut it.
---
&gt;&gt;Before you embark on a journey of revenge, dig two graves.
---
Gee. I wonder. Does the radium RIFLE benefit from the RIFLEman perk? Yes if it‚Äôs semi-automatic. If it‚Äôs fully-automatic, then it benefits from commando.
---
In the luck tree there is a perk that gives you an 80% of finding more chems in medical containers (when upgraded). I used this for my first 50 levels. This helps early game (you can sell them to vendors) and gives you a good stckpile for later levels.
---
&gt;And what crack were you smoking during 4? The railroad were the only heroes.
---
The railroad are just delusional. They believe toasters are living things.
---
For the future, if you're planning to craft SS pieces wait till you get a good armor drop from the server first. For example if you're looking for Unyielding then spend your scrip and craft the pieces on the same world on which you dropped some Uny armor. Works same for weapons.
---
However I have no numbers to prove it works. I try to use that rule and I'm having better luck than just spending all my modules as soon as I get them.
---
And they wonder why the rest of us are anti-Fallout 76 PvP.
---
This is the reason i hated fasnact day, and why i refuse to do free range now. Its a completely pointless waste of my time that just makes me hate playing.
---
That just seemed like a toxic response for asking a simple question
---
Just wow.  That is an awesome camp!
---
I am level 42 and expect to be about 10-15 behind when the season is up.  How much does each block cost if we want to buy up to the finish?
---
It's not, and it never will be fair. Text chat is a modern necessity for the deaf community in and out of games.
---
No problem
---
If you use ammo frequently, make use of this next month to get as large of a stockpile of lead, acid, and steel as you can. And you can easily take 5+ workshops on a private world without much worry, even if you fail the defend, all you have to do is hop over there to take it back. The extractors will still be doing their thing as long as their power and them haven't been destroyed. Don't forget that if you have the scavenger collectron, you can set it up at your workshops too.
---
No. One. Cares.
---
Where do you run into it?
---
No.
---
Long ago it would have have been (and I recall was) used as a flag. These days you gotta have 100K as currency for trading at least.
---
I've had this amount of the most popular ammo on a mule for ages now without problems.
---
Especially true once they are at the farm already.  Once they are 50 or so feet from the pen switch weapons and they will walk in on their own.  Doesn't stop others from being dicks, but at least you'll have a gun in your hand when the boss shows up.
---
I really tried to ignore the one shot competition of the sloth but it grated on me each time, and it was *every time* over hundreds of events I attended, made me sad.
---
Yea. Just a thought. It‚Äôs such a great game with a great community. Always trying to help out. 1st is expensive, can‚Äôt argue that but for me having the scrap box is totally worth it because the stash just don‚Äôt hold enough to properly build and hold on to outfits, guns, etc. 
---
the atoms they give could be handed out a little more. But the atom shop is all cosmetic and when I buy I end up redoing my camp. Nearly everything I buy a camp bundle. I‚Äôll seriously spend a whole day remodeling lol.
---
Not trying to be. I mean, the perk says you deal increased damage with non automatic rifles. If the radium rifle you are using is not fully automatic, then it therefore benefits from the perk. I assumed it was pretty obvious and I was being sarcastic about it. That‚Äôs not being toxic. Being toxic would be me cursing you out for being an idiot, even if you aren‚Äôt one in reality.
---
Running around with my SO yesterday and he's like "hey, the insult bot is here" and I start laughing because I can't wait to hear what the bot says to him. I get closer and the bot delivers his line and then I GET THE TICKET! I truly have never felt so insulted. lol
---
Can you make a video showing this off? I'd appreciate it as I know I'll get murdered by assaultrons.
---
So far I have only seen ants once radtoads once and a vengeful mothman. For the most part its pretty quiet. Indo get visited by a lot of traveling merchants though.
---
I wouldn't worry about them. Could be duped but I have made and had thousands of cores and have dropped hundreds of them before. Sometimes you get on a tear making them and then offload them to mules. Rinse and repeat that and sometimes you end up with a character that you just have to clean off.
---
Before fallout first came out I used to make Ultracite fusion cores and plasma cores with the extra flux from queen. Eventually I ended up just giving almost all
---
Of them away and keeping like 50. Eventually I gave those away too.
---
I kept saying 'one day I'll pull out my heavy gunner and use these' but that day never came lol.
---
I'll tell you like I've told everyone else that says "look up the Wiki": it's not an acceptable nor suitable replacement for basic subtitles - a service that's been around since 1980. Your take on the irrelevance of it is your opinion, but I think it all helps play into the overarching theme of the game. Seriously, imagine playing a game that already has subtitles for everything else, then having to find a corner to hide in so you can pull out your phone and read a Wiki article. It's nothing other than insensitive and a huge oversight.
---
Simpler and more intuitive/less rng for players to make power armour simply reduce damage rather than having a penetration system
---
Yea, I'm sure that there's a few auto aim or wallhack kind of cheats but they're alway a little harder to identify than the flying across the map shooting every single player that moves kind of cheat.
---
In my experience (limited, I just got 53 this weekend) joining a team on auto fill will not lead to better chances of success because ironically most of your ‚Äúteam mates‚Äù are also solo players who are bush-wooking for the challenges. They won‚Äôt mic up, they won‚Äôt work as a team, they don‚Äôt really know the maps. It‚Äôs actually a stronger survival tactic to use your team as bait and whilst yes, that‚Äôs a dick move, this is a game mode that supposedly encourages such ruthless behaviour. 
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong: if my team mics up and starts talking I‚Äôll pull my weight because yes, it‚Äôs more fun that way, but unless you‚Äôre going into NW with a pre made team it‚Äôs better to auto fill and solo. I‚Äôm hoping that when NW comes out of beta (pfft) active play and team play will be rewarded far more than it is now.
---
You don't care but yet you had to come here and make a post whining about them?
---
Ok.
---
Exactly. Eveyone can quickly Google which events have an end boss thats a guaranteed legendary, and just avoid the entire event until it shows up. Kill it wit one bullet, then server hop, rinse, repeat. Its the biggest flaw in this entire game.
---
It's a basic function that they overlooked and it sucks. Everyone that's deaf, hard of hearing, or dealing with some other sound-limiting scenario would have to go back and do it again if they want that experience, and that is wack.
---
I mean, I get that. I just wish that it cost a bit less as a newer player. Using it when questing can eat a lot of caps up.
---
Woox??
---
I had a similar experience last night, for different reasons. TLDR, I wasn‚Äôt able to nuke, for reasons outside my control, and it was heart-breaking. I went to bed feeling like I never wanted to play the game again. I get how important this felt, and how much it sucked to lose out on. I hope your fifth time is a charm.
---
Show us where they touched you...
---
Another argument for cross platform saves.
---
Not necessarily. It should allow teammates and respawns from deaths.
---
The scavenger colllectron at workshops is a top tip and I am level 421 and never thought of doing it.
---
Thanks.
---
Biggus Thiccus!!
---
I read that in the voice of Forrest Gump and now I think I love you.  ;)
---
I turned in a challenge the other day for 40 atoms (max ranking up a card in every SPECIAL) but never received it! God knows how many other challenges I've done but not received anything.
---
Only reason I realised was because  I started on a round 6000 atoms, got two of the Legendary Run's 150 atoms, bringing it to 6300, but never saw it go up to 6340 even with the challenge definitely having been completed.
---
I'm on Xbox :) If you are, I can hook you up with ammo, mutations, stims, and can help you launch one.
---
Just randomly laying around. But there is a perk that will show it on the map for you.
---
PA is generally not that great in NW. doesn't seem to provide much additional defense to compensate for how easy you are to hit.
---
Holy cow thats amazing
---
Making it benefit from guerrilla (assuming it no longer applies to commando) will actually hurt it. It will do the same amount of damage, but it no longer has access to the AA buff of Tank Killer (36%). Pistols don‚Äôt have an anti armor perk. They also don‚Äôt have a faster reload perk like Ground Pounder
---
RNG can be very kind or very cruel.
---
I have a character in a full 5 piece set SS unyielding whom I probably spent less than 30 legendary modules to craft.
---
Meanwhile I have another character who has failed &gt;60 times to craft a single unyielding item.
---
This is the way....;)
---
You are moving away from bloodied and NOW you want it nerfed.  LOL.
---
(I secretly and silently agree with you, though I'd never post anything to the effect)
---
My trick is to shotgun their legs out immediately, and then they‚Äôre crawling around, much easier to kill, but somehow EVEN MORE TERRIFYING.
---
BR without proper anticheat is a problem. Yesterday i witnessed the guy who finished with 36 kills shooting through everything with minigun. It is kinda funny how that guy killed more than 10 players within 1st minute.
---
I can understand duping ultracite ammo.  
---
But regular one like 5mm or .50? why?   
---
excavator set and like 1 hour of grinding and you could get much more (with perks ofc).
---
I thought Beckett was his first name. What did I miss that says it's his surname?
---
Sounds like I care my man js
---
If you aren‚Äôt trying to be, why did you start with ‚ÄúGee. I wonder‚Äù which is obviously conveying a sarcastic and/or demeaning tone?
---
I agree its such a pain too walk over to someone elses or my camp when I want to scrap weps and armor.
---
I‚Äôm a bloodied junkie and I feel like the gracious hand of hodd toward guides me throughout my adventure. I feel like I‚Äôve beaten the system or found some sort of bug in the matrix. Honestly such a state of pure joy.
---
Is that even possible? Hahaha congrats man
---
My SO couldn't stop laughing so much especially since earlier she had teased me for leaving my pip boy light on so much.
---
Bethesda is too busy banning 1/4 of their player base to worry about actual bugs.  Like this one that's been around for as long as I remember.  Best part is even if you report it chances are nothing will be done.
---
Bloody junkies....
---
Had a shit load of disconnects this weekend too.
---
Can always drink some whiskey with party boy/girl 3.
---
No mention. All for it. Even if it just gives me a perk to make things explode in Confetti.
---
While some folks will call these pay to win, would love to have some I could drop at an event and I'd be happy to buy a few. 
---
That being said, I think the rate that you get them in the seasons is actually pretty good already. I generally just open them at an event where a lot of people are in close quarters like queen, sheep, line in sand, uranium fever, etc. No reason not to give 10 people the same bonus. 
---
Maybe they could make a less powerful version that only gave 10% and all the same random fun bonuses so people have a little less balance to complain about.
---
What I want as a hard of hearing player is an obvious visual cue for the stupid jukebox.  It makes One Violent Night so much harder since all the jukebox says is activate whether its on or off and no music symbols come out of it when its on.
---
I speced back **INTO** bloodied to speed up my leveling
---
As i was bloodied , went to junkies have been junkies for 6+ months ,prefered junkies but am back using bloodied  temporarily to increase the rate i level since i have limited play time each day....
---
I‚Äôd say you got your money‚Äôs worth out of the game.   Its been a long time that I‚Äôve gotten into a game as much as I have 76.   Congrats on the milestones!
---
Nope it really isnt. Im disappointed too with it
---
Thank you kind internet stranger :) I figured that out eventually lol, also that I needed rads protection
---
I recommend chem fiend and party boy/girl both maxed out.  Alcohol is a good addiction.  Wood armor is not bad for that build so anything full health like vanguards.   for perks, covert op max, sneak at max are great.  Adrenaline when they finally fix it.  Also bloodied mess.Get the chem back pack from the raiders, all chem weights are reduced by 90 %.  Spread your addictions across your specials so you don't suffer to many negatives.  Also, try to only get addicted to what you will use. Any damage reduction perks as well.  eat a lot of wolf ribs because the boost perception, also sweet water blend tea does this as well.  look for other foods/teas that boost AGI or AGI rejen.  Try an get at least one piece of chameleon armor.  Feel free to ask more because I play 3 different junkie's builds on one character and one is an archer.  Oh, have at least a pistol or a junkie shot gun as a back just in case things get harry.
---
This is why I feel like we should be able use Scrip to re-roll effects at the Purveyor.
---
- 500 Scrip to re-roll the major effect.
---
- 250 Scrip to re-roll the minor effect.
---
- 100 Scrip to re-roll the third effect.
---
Its one of the best things about it really. Makes workshops that much more valuable. You can only have the ones at workshops set up to collect raw materials though, it can't collect anything else as far as I recall from my last workshop chain. Still very helpful though.
---
Put a skin on it
---
is Cpt or Srgt.Deadeye one of them? most annoying dude. reported dozens of times. yet nothing.
---
NEEEEEEEERD
---
Once you run these events, you know where the legendary spawns.  Any tag gives you loot, so I just make sure I get one shot in üëç
---
Inside my head I'm thinking wow these people are really bad at everything, surely they must be used to not getting their way by now.
---
I guess some of you still aren't yet.
---
You end up meeting his brother and his name is Frankie Beckett. Beckett can def be a first name and I actually like it as that.
---
150, but there will be a week with double daily challenge rewards
---
I have a mole miner circuit that i run through ash heap region. MMiners tend to drop a ridiculous amount of stuff - especially combat shotguns. And as an unyielding build with naturally high charisma, i find its pretty easy to hit the cap limit on a char with one or two of those circuits and a bit of normal play.
---
Rare drop from sbq and wendigo. Just a rare drop from an uncommonly occurring boss  makes it too hard to get
---
There are so many queues that they're just not paying attention to, I swear.
---
The hackers will always be there. They‚Äôll patch the latest hacks and they‚Äôll come up with new ones. Nature of the beast. The NW dailies aren‚Äôt hard. Make an alt and use it for 3-4 level up dailies. Hide in a bush for 20min will level you almost every time. If you get killed by a hacker, shrug and log into the next match. He won‚Äôt be there because he‚Äôs still hunting for the guy at the bottom of the Grafton Dam. 
---
Adapt and overcome. Or don‚Äôt play and lose 250 SCORE a day. But one thing Bethesda has shown us is all the huffing, puffing and stomping your feet gets you nowhere... 
---
Enjoy your game time, friend. üôÇ
---
I've ran into it more time than I can count in the ash heap, that seems to be to most common spot for me. I use mountains of steel scrap because I like to move my base around and for weapon repairs so I spend a lot of time farming mole men.
---
Once it wandered into my camp near helvetia which was weird.
---
I‚Äôm not deaf but I find it hard to concentrate on audio so I use subtitles all of the time for everything so I‚Äôm with you on this one OP. I will fill a support ticket.
---
serums/purified water/chems I don't use/ lots of radway
---
i have played five games of NW today and in each of them i was killed by someone either a/ flying or b/ shooting across the map. all different people. the cheaters all won the games, obviously.
---
it's a shame really, i'm not doing it for the challenges, i actually enjoy nuclear winter when it isn't a shitshow of cheaters.
---
Same thing for the Mothman tapes a while back
---
https://youtu.be/YfsEoh4UdGo check out angry turtles video on earning zip fast. Herbivore is better for XP but the same process/setup applies. You can use tasty squirrel stew and broiled scorchbeast brains for similar boosts if you can't redo your mutations easily.
---
Dihydrogen Monoxide can displace oxygen in certain circumstances and is responsible for thousands of deaths per year - especially in children. WHEN will the government step in to stop this madness?
---
As said scrap and store everything, unlock all the exclusives in the atom shop, cancel auto renew right now so you don't forget at the end of the month.
---
Ya that thing eats AP for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
---
I just ran into him for the first time last night and I was so pleasantly surprised
---
The wording on calender is "High S.C.O.R.E. weekend - double dailies". That kinda hints it's only doubling the amount of dailies but who knows when we are talking about Bughesda. Personally i'm gonna wait until the weekend event starts before doing the weeklies if i can, just in case. There is no harm doing so.
---
I‚Äôve learned you don‚Äôt even need to tag them.
---
Simply activating VATs on the enemy works.
---
Discovered this as I‚Äôm a melee build and people kill scorch beasts without me hitting them. Used VATs every time and I got the loot.
---
Proceeded to test on other creatures and it worked on them as well.
---
They only apply to dailies.
---
Nah i don‚Äôt have any paints
---
I watched a dude level up 7 times during a single Line in the Sand event. He's gonna have a rough hangover when Double XP ends.
---
Yikes.
---
my first was using a hunting riffle, but I had help and it took for ever.  great feeling.  Wait until you kill 2 or three together that is very cool.
---
I ran this yesterday with my low level alt so I did the herding the others annihilated the boss before I even got close I was rather annoyed
---
Every day, gather up anything you can and clean out a vendor bot and get 1400 caps each day.
---
using brain helps
---
Battle of the titans. Or I should say "shit stains"
---
Thanks for taking the time. ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
I‚Äôve got 17 and I‚Äôm 98.
---
If you are not an able-body-straight-white-male this games community doesn‚Äôt give a fuck about you.
---
Love it! Ad Victorium
---
Yep. The increase overseer rank is the worst for me. I know I can make a new character yada yada but tbh I don't want to do that cause it's just a hassle. And tbh I shouldn't HAVE to do that!
---
Got instantly killed in PA by someone jumping around with a grenade launcher in about 2 shots. Had full health.
---
I would actually love if we found out later in some quest that none of this was real. Not because of issues with the game, because I enjoy it anyway, but because it would be so damn cool if done well! Also could be used to explain the game taking place in a single day and the sudden appearance of lots of people in Appalachia. It's kind of a fun and silly theory but I like it anyway.
---
I have no idea what you're on about, but bad taste buddy. Try again.
---
):
---
the wastelanders daily's give 8 scrip
---
Wow. You the real hero.
---
Lots of rad protection.
---
Actually most players received theirs during several dupe waves/other players being able to drop it. The only way to tell if someone did the vault raids is the golden player icon or vault 94 vault suit
---
Leveling up from 1-2 never counts for me.  I have to do 2-3 which takes much longer
---
Fairly sure that is illegal under the ADA.
---
In fact, didn't some deaf guy successfully sue pornhub on the same basis recently?
---
Even if you only have the Steam or Gamepass version you still need to have a [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) account to be able to display a nickname and not show up as a bunch of random numbers on the map to others.
---
Not sure about in a bed but I've stood around afk for about 10 mins and I didn't get kicked on private world.
---
Get the travel agent perk. 
---
But honestly new players should not be fast traveling, IMO. Spend time exploring. You miss a lot by fast traveling around everywhere. There are a ton of random encounters you only see by walking.
---
Yup a private server would have solved the idiots issue with other players I agree.
---
However not come across players getting kicked for no reason.
---
I stand by my reason for kicking this player who was abusing a random and all the team could hear it.  It is a game and has no place for threats and abusive language.
---
They don't. If you run their numbers through the damage reduction equation, they hit as hard as they should. The problem is, they hit as hard as a Scorchbeast in melee and a lot more often, given they pinwheel their arms and such.  
---
For example: in my T-65, with Lone Wanderer, they hit me for 11 damage. Without? 13. Which fits the equation while doing some rounding. But those hits come fast and frequent, and that's why they seem so dangerous.  
---
The Queen technically hits harder in melee, but she also doesn't swing very often, so it seems like she does less damage because you're not watching your bar bleed out at the same rate.
---
Virgin ‚Äúmeta‚Äù player vs chad ‚Äúfor fun‚Äù player
---
They said update 21 which is due out 8/4.
---
I can‚Äôt stand the fact that we have to pay to fast travel. Aside from that I think the game is amazing. It took me about a year to buy it because of all the negativity attached to it but I suppose if there was nothing to do but run around and scavenge, I‚Äôd be pretty bored too. The wastelanders stuff is very fulfilling. Just glad Preston Garvey don‚Äôt have me saving settlements.
---
it's wooby... they've got him
---
That's a fair point! Suing them won't solve anything in the long term though, as I still want this game to grow and provide joy to people. Cutting their budget won't help that, but making them aware that this is a huge oversight definitely helps.
---
Who's wooby? Who's got him?
---
Im an herbivore myself, what I did was rook all 5 rabks of strong bak, and I only equip it when i need to fast travel. Making a set of excavator PA will increase your carry weight by 100 lbs when you wear it, so te 10 lb trade off isnt bad at all
---
I didn't think about it that way that might create a little bit of a complication in that regard cuz I do have the Bethesda net account that I set up forever ago for Fallout 4 and I use for this game
---
Dont forget the Vault 94 Emote
---
I proudly use that emote all the time
---
Sounds more like someone needs to manage rads more then most of us or didn't get the weapon they wanted or something. Cry cry cry
---
hopefully it's longer in bed.
---
I think that should be a minor perk of FO1st..being able to sleep in your bed in your own world for 1 hour at least.
---
just 'cause..
---
‚ÄúSounds like someone needs their ass kicked‚Äù
---
My goodness take it easy bruh, for Fasnacht the event rewards are the real deal you should be after, don‚Äôt hate a beautiful event because you couldn‚Äôt tag a level 20 sloth?
---
For all of those saying Appalachia wasnt directly hit, there is in fact a nuke crater on the map. For some reason its not an irradiated mess like they were portrayed in Fo4, but it is definitely a nuke crater. It looks as if it landed on some military structure. You can see remnants of metal structural members and jeeps buried in the widely scattered rubble.
---
The crater itself is up in the mountains of the Savage Divide on a high ridge overlooking the cranberry bog.  Its north-ish of the towering monorail transfer station. Im at work right now so i cant link any pictures. And its been a while since i laid eyes on the place, so i cant remember the exact location, but it is definitely there. And its the only obvious nuke crater ive seen on the map.
---
Also, FWIW, there is a random event spawn of an un-exploded nuke that can be found from time to time in random areas of the Forest area of the map. You cut a wire to disarm it and it gives you scrap. Ive encountered it several times and tried different wires every time to see if i could get it to detonate, even as a mini-nuke, but it never does. Its always the salvage. But it does seem that the Forest mas *meant* to be struck by nukes. Probably given all of the vaults, and the Whitespring bunker's significance to the then-US government. We know that there was an active Communist spy ring in the area.&gt;! Based out of the facility underneath Mama Dolce's.!&lt;
---
Take them on your private server. Easy enough to hold down all of them and then loop around killing the mobs when u get a defence. Good x2. Loads of mats and loot the corpses and scrap the weapons with scrapper for a shit tonne of steel.
---
Fuck. Did you crash it
---
My first insult bot encounter was last night.  Im in one of the train stations selling some junk.  When im done I hear ‚Äúhey chump‚Äù I turn around and its just standing behind me and it says ‚Äúnice outfit, I had no idea smelly and eyesore were back in style‚Äù.  I was wearing drifter outfit and a ritual mask.
---
Same.   I leveled up 6 times in 20 min
---
I only fast travel to the closest unlocked place to my destination.
---
How do you know you're banned and not suspended if you don't have an email yet?
---
Ah, in the tidbits I read I kept seeing that shotguns were a bad build and weak weapon in this game? Or does that change with certain legendaries and perks? I‚Äôve gone the big gun route lately (plasma, Gatling, and minigun), which other than events where people pick off enemies too quickly definitely seems to deal the most damage without having specialized legendaries and builds.
---
U can have multiple collections going?
---
It's just the Ark: Survival Evolved character creator
---
God forbid Bethesda ban dupers.
---
On public servers it's 35 min.  I set an interval timer for 30 and it works well.
---
The RNG is cruel.
---
At least the main cheat program has disabled most features in nuclear winter now
---
Knight Moreno?? Did he tell you EL-7 is gold?  Repeat.....EL-7 is gold!!!
---
Radio transmitter on top of dropsite v9 plays this message when you click on it.  Needs to be clicked on every time for good luck LMAO
---
Dang how do you enjoy the radio
---
I get kicked around 15 most days. When you‚Äôre in a team, private team, you can get by with close to 30 minutes if you‚Äôre in YOUR bed. But it does seem to vary.
---
Looks interesting - thanks for providing this. Need more details than what the guide has though - is this for PC, or console? How do we reach you? Just add you, or do you have a preferred process?
---
They really gotta change that to at least hitting it once. I was there before fired a ton on it. Legendary plasma gatling withe Xtra damage to scorch. Yet somehow didn't pass the damage number. Level 100+, full heavy build. Either a bug or just way too high. Only happened once though.
---
if you use that account for 76 too then chances are you might find your missing atoms there
---
lol that's pretty dirty, damn. i got 3 from that one myself. that was probably the hardest one for me to get a lot of credit on since i primarily run melee and the enemies the sb drops are instamelted lol
---
Sadly your request will never happen as much as I want it to as well. 
---
Bethesda only designs for console in mind because pc doesn't make them enough money, so they don't care.
---
Look at all the mostly PC requests we've been asking for for over a year - text chat, full key rebinds, typing in numbers, UI better suited to PC, uncapped frame rates (at least above 60), none of them have been addressed &amp; few even acknowledged beyond lip service.
---
I'd really like this feature too but sadly we only have the save everything PC mod for this.
---
He's an npc held by Todd and his minions
---
Likely wouldn't need to sue if you could talk to the right person.  I don't think that customer service reps are those people, though.
---
My first scorchbeast flew away... made me really sad too because it was a 3 star legendary. That being said I barley got it to regen than his trying to get my bearings when it flew off to somewhere else
---
hahah. i remember too. i ran. that thing was scary.
---
Funniest thing about that screenshot, i've seen that player in other videos/screenshots complaining of cheating - which shows Bethesda still hasn't done shit, there's no way this one player hasn't been reported to Bethesda multiple times by now.
---
Fun fact, they've gone up 13ish levels since the last complaint I saw of them xD
---
The 'Liberty Prime' skin works on Ultracite, but you can only get it from the Atom Shop.
---
If FT was free and didnt have at least one minor down side, and let's be honest even crossing the map rarely exceeds 50 caps, then people would simply zip back and forth without pausing to think.
---
In that case the whole Sandbox gameplay would be redundant and might as well live in a world of gated communities - Fallout Bunkers edition. There's far more to the wasteland than the quest markers, why purposely set out to avoid it, especially early on?
---
Is this on Xbox? I'd love to play
---
I want a rubber sex doll for my ally. No talking, no noises!
---
Entitlement, plain &amp; simple
---
Oh my god... I knew it ... i knew Todd had a sex dungeon.
---
I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about with ‚Äúpeople weren‚Äôt PvPing at all‚Äù my guy the player kill feed was lighting up like a Christmas tree every time I turned on survival mode
---
sounds good, thanks :)
---
Maybe somebody with a BoS PA, would be cool
---
This is true, though I‚Äôm not a big fan of it, looks like a bionicle... just hoping that Vertiguard skin will work on Ultracite
---
You are talking about the Brotherhood of Steel transponder at dropsite V9. There are transponders all around the cranberry bog detailing their mission. These have been in the game since launch and are related to the existing BOS storyline that is already in game, not to the new content.
---
ETA: Full text of what he says:
---
*Knight Moreno to... I guess no one? If any Brothers pick this up: EL-7 is gold. Repeat. EL-7. We've got no idea how many are in the cave. But they're definitely hostiles in there. God help us.*
---
hahaha. u made my monday so funny!!!!
---
"You kick as many people as you want as a leader - but if you‚Äôre not you either suck it up or make your own team"
---
Revolutionary idea! Except that is literally what I did, I left the team and wasn't spiteful despite them straight up telling me they where doing just to mess with me.
---
I will spell it out for you since bias blinds, the intention is to kick the people who insist on sharing just to mess with others not just anybody legit trying to be a medic. A medic that destroys one or more of his most fragile members when there are more beneficial perks to share such as autostim or making stims more effective is a crappy medic. Sunkissed is only temporarily useful in niche situations, else it's a waist leaving it on. The game throws you too much radaway and decon arches are plentiful.
---
Unpopular opinion:
---
Who is entitled, players dont get ANY personal benefit from sharing sunkissed but do it because they can cause tremendous detrimental impact to others. That's just rude. If asking players not to be rude just for the hell of it, then heck yes I'm one of the million entitled members here. Your in a community where the company that provides free things such as the ammo converter and will CHANGE it just because people complain, so get used to it.
---
"Entitled bloodied players" - Who hurt you? You clearly have strong negative bias. Why are so many people bent against bloodied, ive seen large discussio s excitedly thinking of ways to mess with them just for kicks.  Really it just comes of as envy.
---
Please, downvote if your envious.
---
Dirty dupers. No sympathy from me
---
From his previous trades, it seems PC
---
I played maybe 3 hours this weekend. I didn't feel blatantly cheated at any point. I'm not a vet or anything just throwing that out there if you're interested.
---
sadly only seems to work if you have 2FA disabled
---
Probably because someone posts some iteration of this almost every single day.
---
I was on top of it but I didn't press anything, I was shooting at the scorched wifu
---
NW challenges are independent of NW competitive play. Cheaters are a real problem for people who play the mode for fun, but for a challenge tourist like me, I haven't noticed it.
---
I think having NW challenges are a good thing for people who enjoy the mode. Even if I am on there for one or two matches a day, that's more players for the people who enjoy the mode to have matches with. Cheaters are a separate issue: important, but not connected to the challenges, which are fairly easy to just run in and do single-mindedly without being invested in how you rank or whether someone killed you.
---
I find it helps to have low level alts set up for the overseer rank one.
---
Created an alt recently as I loved the difficulty of the game early on (so not sharing items with my main), despite not being lvl 20 yet I fought SBQ, dropped like every bullet I had at the moment, hundreds of .38 and shotgun shells, still didn‚Äôt get to loot, was a little annoyed at that.
---
I feel dumb...
---
Anything that shoots poison damage is insane (mirelurk queens, hunters, etc..). They will melt anyone in seconds if they hit you.
---
Dude sounds like an absolute mad lad, definitely love to see those types of players considering just how respectable they are
---
Ditto. I run a bloodied build and those little pricks make up the bulk of my deaths so far. One swipe of those claws and i'm kissing dirt. They are one of the only mobs that I don't play pat-a-cake  with before I kill them. I hear their calling card sound and the .50 cal comes out.
---
Don‚Äôt forget your cranberry drinks and pies for the xp stacks on top of double xp
---
As a long time Fallout fan (one of my favorite franchises of all time) I was over the top excited for F76.  When it released I thought ‚Äúwell this game is going to die fast‚Äù. I never intended to play this game as it looked so horrible from all the bugs and blatant disregard Bethesda seemed to have towards the game as a whole.  But then it hit Gamepass a week or so ago.  And I thought I may as well try it.  And I am so glad I did.  I am having tons of fun.  I visited a well established players camp and as I was buying a few plans he motioned me to come over to him.  At his feet was a jack o lantern with all kinds of free items in it.  I grabbed a few things and made sure to leave some for others.  What a nice guy!  Ive only had 2 toxic people try to kill me so far.
---
bruh it takes 3-5 shots to kill it and if you want to make sure you get a tag you shoot 2 times, of course he gonna die fast
---
The best advice I have ever gotten on this is to on purpose not shoot the robots along the way and sneak all the way thru the silo. Less robots downed means the security is almost non-existent at the end stage.
---
It just wants to HUGGGGGGG YOU!!!!! with its knife arms.
---
AAE fiddy cal makes short work of them
---
i feel your pain brother i feel your pain
---
Someone else clicked it....it must be clicked.  Doesn't matter who clicks on it, everyone needs to hear!!!  You can be 100 feet away from it and it still plays just as loud too.
---
Yea.. I have lost my faith in trusting what they write anywhere long time ago.
---
Pc I‚Äôm sry my friend
---
Line in the sand event is great for leveling fast too.
---
Level 1-2 doesn‚Äôt work for adventure challenges (I suspect cause you‚Äôre still really making your character) but it has worked fine for me for nuclear winter.
---
Just commenting to agree how unfathomably dumb it is that there are multiple balances.
---
there must be a firm limit.
---
I just ask because there are those days when you *need* to gather resources at workshops, but you don't really *want* to play.. :)
---
Power armor
---
almost forgot, the AID section always carry with you, chems and food/water are another stash eater u can use both perks for 90%weight reduction for chems and food/drink, trust me, u ll have tons of them later. For example, if u stash 100purified water , it has total of 50pounds , but if u bring them with you with that PERk reduction , it ll lower the weight from 50pounds to 5pounds
---
I feel dumb now
---
Dang, I just did that quest for the 2nd time and missed that. Thanks.
---
No problem bud. Brilliant idea though
---
what lvl is it?
---
Take a hard look at your initial comment, check the downvotes, then take a hard look AGAIN at what you wrote. Just maybe you can figure out why you come across as an asshole...
---
It'd be like "I'm Beckett and this is my brother Frankie Beckett." üòê

Thanks I know a few people I talked to wanted to do similar thing so hopefully a few may pop up on Xbox
---
BECAUSE I WAS BEING SARCASTIC!
---
I just get a bit miffed when I see a post where someone doesn‚Äôt put a tiny bit of effort towards finding out the answer themselves. I mean seriously. You asked if the radium rifle is affected by the rifleman perk. That seems pretty obvious given the fact that the RIFLEMAN PERK AFFECTS RIFLES.
---
now I just need to see if I can make heads or tails of how people are explaining how to check it without installing beth launcher
---
Shotgunner perks increase damage coupled with other perks like enforcer and bloody mess make shotguns insanely powerful. A standard crafted combat shotgun can take out a Scorchbeast (not the queen) in a half dozen shots. Add in legendary variations like bloodied, furious, two shot etc. You can one shot a Sheepsquach.
---
Specifically, what kind of resources are you gathering? And are you FO1st?
---
The separate balances thing has been around since steam launched.
---
I am not surprised. a few months ago just on the regular server, there was a dude running around who could just run up to you and you would die. He did not even have to shoot at you you would just fall over dead. I would not be surprised if he was doing it in NW.
---
I feel like in this situation you should definitely get some loot
---
Also on Xbox. If she joins you for a nuke launch, I'd be happy to help and can supply stimpacks and Ammo for her.
---
Honestly the enemy is only a 1 Star so the legendary drop sucks. It‚Äôs the rare rewards you get from keeping all the Herd alive that you want.
---
Make sure you unequip starched genes before using serums and then reequip it. Otherwise you wont keep them or lose them when you use a radaway.

Explosive two shot shotgun and 15% dr armor ....

In Bethesda's engine, in order for subtitles to show up, they need to be assigned to every individual line of dialogue. The cryptid tales aren't dialogue though; they're one long audio file, so you can't use subtitles that way.
---
Maybe my understanding of how the subtitles/dialogue are connected is flawed or flat out wrong, but I really don't see what TV or movies have got to do with this.
---
It is though. It gets passed up if enough weight is on it.
---
they must have eaten a lot of krabby patties
---
it is impossible doing dailies to not complete weeklies if they are pretty much same.
---
It's at the end of his side questline. It's like 12 quests to finish but you get a nice reward.
---
This happened to me, I opened the atom shop and the proper number showed up.
---
I'm not deaf, but deaf people don't really do radio that much anyway. Aside from pushing bass to feel a rhythm. 
---
Fun fact: all-deaf schools have school dances that place the speakers on the floor facing down so they can feel the beat and dance.

Grenades and miscellaneous aid items. Mostly extra stimpacks and radaways

Once you have selected the ammo you want you can just bash X lots of times. Not great but will do for now just to get rid of stuff like missiles and mini nukes. Wouldnt bother on 100s of ammo til its fixed

Does it do anything to catch up or pass him?

Even something worth 1-2k could be traded for junk

You can put a scavenger collectron at your CAMP, and at each workshop you take.

I saw 4 people flying yesterday while completing a nw challenge. After I was killed by one and I realized what was happening I recorded a few minutes of footage showing the one who killed me was going to send it to Bethesda but it wouldn't do much good.
---
When you log into the game you get a 420000 error code. I ended up getting a email a day after.
---
If you can get into watoga without being murdered, i found that place the best for T-60. Theres a few frames to farm but i just used to check the one near the Fast Travel point next to the downed vertibird out of laziness mostly. the others require a bit more effort to get to
---
If it‚Äôs not working and you‚Äôre on a team, have someone share it. Should work then.
---
OK so I tried the thing listed above about the {bSteamEnabled=0} and also with 1 in my custom .ini and it made no difference at all, so I dunno? but you can include that with your info if you want too
---
Rule 9, be careful.
---
the method currently explained here in the post just works if you haven't enabled 2FA on your account. I have 2FA active and it requires me to launch the game with the Beth Launcher so I'm currently trying to see if copying the game folder from the Steam install over to where [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) wants to install it will allow me to launch it with the launcher
---
The fact that there is a system in place and you still need to come to reddit for help is disgusting.
---
Im 62 and run in there make sure i get some shots in and im out
---
Hmm did not know, maybe with my recent alt I should look to shotgun specialize.
---
Lol this is about as active as they ever were 
---
The CMs tend to post on patch days and for a few days after content releases, that's basically it
---
Unless some kind of thread gets a looooot of traction
---
Great weekend for me as well. Thanks to the extra dailies and the 2XP + repeatable weekly, I was able to make up the SCORE points I missed out on during the 4 days I didn't get to play last week.
---
Maybe they should consider moving on to a new game if they have literally nothing better to do in this one.

why would they ban hackers when they can ban like 40% of the playerbase for duping  ü§î  ü§î  ü§î  ü§î \*stonks\*

I got back into FO76 after the Wastelander update launched and have been hooked with the new features but I'm trying not to burn out. I pre-ordered it with my brother and we both were pretty disappointed at launch. He's hardly gotten on but ever since Wastelanders he's wanted to. But then COVID happened and with his job as a CNA and going to school to be a nurse, there just isn't time. 
---
Sometimes I take a minute to imagine what it'd be like with him.
---
I've only recently gotten into the community but I haven't really met any people formally or made a group.
---
My gt is the same as my Reddit. If anyone wants to add me, go ahead. Please just say you got it from Reddit so I don't assume you're a bot or something. Thanks!
---
I loved the Fastnacht event I got some neat prizes, I would love all the events, it is this singular issue that grates my gears, it should have been fixed or ameliorated months year/s ago.
---
Its easy enough to test Lone Wanderer, though i have not done so myself.
---
Equip the card, over-encumber yourself, run around until your ap bar is empty and time how long it takes to regen to full. Then do the same thing without the card equipped.
---
However i *have* tested Inspirational. So, I can say for certain that it will not grant any XP bonus unless there is an actual second person on your team. Simply being on a team by yourself isnt enough.
---
Dude what a piece of garbage!  I ran out of ammo there my first time, too.  It's worth noting that you can make more at the tinker's bench in the room where you have to repair mainframe cores.  If you're on PC I would be happy to make you some ammo or help you run through this week, just pm me your in game name.
---
I was preparing lately to get onto nuke silo solo by myself, that must been very bad experience.
---
What I do before doing such missions, eat up berry mentants to lightup enemies and check map if there are any players around me
---
Its happens, but remember bad experiences are more memorable than good ones.
---
I‚Äôm so incredibly happy that I finally caved and bought the game. The community is great and very helpful to the newbie. I‚Äôm also on Xbox so if you ever want to team up and clear some areas or do some events lmk and I‚Äôll shout my gt over.
---
I have a 12000 caps so whats ur price i wont go over 5k
---
You had me until that last sentence. There are MUCH bigger flaws than people being able to one shot low level legendaries.
---
Ofcourse a server of 24 ppl doesn‚Äôt mean anything 24 ppl enjoy pvping but they look at the big picture here 
---
When you look at the playerbase as a whole and only 5% of the total playerbase is playing in survival mode then that means something. That why they removed it and replace it with NW 
---
it a stated fact in one of their interviews
---
It shouldn‚Äôt cost to FT to player camps. Waste so much hopping around looking for stuff in vendors I can‚Äôt usually buy it
---
If you already have a good heavy weapon, think about waiting. It's fun but the ammo use is pretty excessive. It's great if you need to dump all your ammo on one target as quickly as possible, but the SBQ is already pretty dated. Maybe Big Wen would be a good use, but I dont know how that encounter will work. There is supposed to be an ammo creation legendary perk coming out to, that will help, but you have time until that drops.
---
You are kidding me! Just activate VATS, that would be game changing for me, I never used to but now use VATS to compensate for bad eyesight.
---
Definitely going to test this one out, thanks for the heads up üëç
---
they got full hands of fixing that auto complete dailies , said noone ever  üòâ
---
It‚Äôs gonna be the same UI so even when they update it I‚Äôll still despise it just out of spite for it being a subpar design
---
Interesting.... I always wondered what category  that music was.
---
There are five power armor spawn locations in Watoga that can give T-series PA. Four can be accessed without any fight assuming you‚Äôve done the Mayor For A Day quest.
---
* One is in the center of Watoga by the downed vertibot.
---
* One is on the roof adjacent the civic center, also by a downed vertibot. Climb the stairs to reach the roof of the civic center, then cross over to the adjacent building.
---
* One is in the bus terminal behind a locked door (level 3 hacker or level 3 picklock).
---
* One is on the roof of Watoga Emergency Services building which requires killing a few baddies to reach it. You could skip them if you are fast/sneaky. One of the enemies could be a legendary.
---
* The last is on the roof of the high school.
---
Note that not all locations will spawn or if they do it is not guaranteed to be T-45. If its not the type you want then don't take it. Server-hop and run the route again after checking the locations.
---
No freaking way Bethesda saw my post :O
---
&gt;You can't seriously expect anyone of us to believe that you've only just noticed hackers in NW.
---
Of course not. But that's why we, as community managers, are here to get community reports of them, right?
---
Good point defiantly, I just get heated by antisocial people doing what they do. The *kill everything at all costs as fast as possible*, just not me I guess.
---
This person instantly turned on the cows after killing the sheep launching a barrage of blue flame, all dead. I fancied milking them when the event ended, should have done it first I know.
---
Would rather have no hackers in nuclear winter than duper‚Äôs tbh but that‚Äôs bc I just lost 5 games in a row to hackers yesterday and I‚Äôm still pretty salty
---
Why expect them to reply at all? Its not their forum or website or even account but simply a 'fan' (in the loosest of senses at times) rage outlet. 
---
And tbh there are firms who engage far less either limiting themselves to 'press releases' and offical staments, or in some case barely make a ripple.
---
The suspension and the banned code are the same though aren't they? Did your email instantly say banned then and not temporarily suspended pending investigation? Sorry, I've just never heard of that before.
---
That's okay i never get to loot it. I'm a bloodied shotgun build and my gun does base 500 damage and well ill shoot it with my shotty every time it lands and shoot it with a bloodied ar while its flying and still NEVER met the damage cut. ü§≠
---
If you want to gather lvl 50 T-60 around watoga there are 4 places close to each other which can spawn power armor.
---
1, Watoga middle near crashed vertibird
---
2, Survey Camp Alpha
---
3, Drop Site V9
---
4, Forward station Delta
---
This may spawn T45, T51b and mostly T60 according to the level who first entered the area.
---
I would craft X01 to my alts but these were my easiest finding for me to have BOS elder T60.
---
I believe it's called pharma farma
---
especially focus on farming lead/steel (tin cans) u can find some spots easily on youtube, u ll always need those 2 for ammo
---
I'm sorry, that sucks :(. Whenever people do shitty things in this game, I'm always shocked how emotional I get, regardless of my constantly lowering expectations.
---
You've already gotten a lot of offers, but I'll throw mine in as well. If you're on PS4 and want another lady to play with, I'd love to join up! Get a full reddit squad together to do a few nuke runs :)
---
Just stating a fact. There have been bugs since beta that have been reported repeatedly and just simply aren't fixed. I mean look around at the game right now, people's atoms disappearing or going into separate accounts, hackers in NW that can kill everyone on the map in 30 seconds floating up in the air and shooting randomly, smiley is still broke for lots of people and won't sell gold, score auto completing but not giving credit.
---
If they spent a fraction of their time on fixing the actual bugs in this game, especially ones that have been around for over a year-and-a-half, as they do Banning duper's then maybe they wouldn't have to ban anybody since there wouldn't be anything to exploit.
---
it doesnt matter. maybe u did sbq for the first time and never knew about knight moreno. but it made me laugh a lot!! thank u! :) no mysteries there just same sh!t as ever.
---
Then you missed the point of my last sentence. The fact that anyone can pointedly NOT participate in an event just to one shot the boss and screw every player that DID put the work in is one of thw games biggest flaws. Loot from a boss like that should be a guaranteed part of the event rewards. Doing so would drastically reduce this type of highly toxic style of playing.
---
Best one I ever got was something like..
---
"I heard you put a bounty on yourself so for once in your life you'd be wanted"
---
Harsh but I laughed.
---
Lost a nice piece of legendary heavy combat armor during a silo raid yesterday. Oddly, received a **different** legendary piece of heavy combat armor later on in the silo. Very weird.
---
Yes the codes are the same. My email said I was temporarily suspended pending investigation.
---
This player had a large gun firing blue stuff, I'd never seen the Sheepsquatch melt so fast, I would do everything on a private but I'm enjoying the public teams and the buffs.
---
Just wish people held back for a few seconds. I understand that for them, the end game IS denying everyone else at all costs. It's a pity though.
---
Sorry
---
good call, that would be a major oof-ahhhh for me lol
---
...i have played since beta, that's what makes this embarrassing...
---
It's the only gun that can have 4 viable effects. It also outperforms the combat rifle and handmade with the right rolls. That's the big deal.
---
They banned cheaters just recently and also implemented anti-cheat. It's always an arms race, but that doesn't make it not worthwhile to report. :)
---
Thanks, I feel better to have vented a bit and will take your advice to heart üòé
---
until reset or the end of the day? logged in this morning for a bit but work now
---
I think im radicool enough to take it.
---
There's a performance mod on nexus.
---
I haven't used it myself but it may be worth a peek?
---
That might be plague walker
---
No I didn‚Äôt. I just don‚Äôt agree with you. Inconvenient and annoying? Yes. Biggest flaw in a very flawed, but ultimately enjoyable game? Definitely not.
---
If you still need help I'll square you away with caps, armor and ammo. GT is my Reddit name. Just message me
---
Bethesda has shown they're not afraid to take out the ban hammer. Hopefully they'll do something about it. 
---
On a side note, Bethesda seems to be taking a lot of cues from Blizzard in their development of a multiplayer world. There are a lot of parallels in how the games are structured. By structure parallels I mean things like forming random teams for events is similar to queuing for dungeons in WoW. How multiplayer was incorporated overall. 
---
I only mention the above because Blizzard has done an outstanding job of dealing with cheaters. Dealing with toon theft not so much. Nothing more depressing than logging in to a naked toon standing at a mailbox in Stormwind. You're usually made whole within hours, but still.
---
Of course. The game is fun, it has improved and is more stable. The new content from seasons to Wastelanders adds more flare to the game. Building CAMPS are fun, public teams adds a new feel to the game. I would recommend it. I‚Äôve played for over 2,000 hours through some of the major glitches and it‚Äôs much better now. People may complain a lot about it, but Bethesda has put a lot of effort in making it better. Plus, some just diss the game to seem cool or trendy. I‚Äôd check it out if I were you. :)
---
Personally, I enjoy it. I was in the same situation as you, recently playing the heck out of F04 and wanting more Fallout. I picked it up with Game Pass for PC so I could try it, and I have really enjoyed it. 
---
If you are still undecided, try it on Game Pass, the first month is only 1$.
---
Thats dope af! that and the double score next weekend should send ya home then. i honestly didn't think i would make it past 10 on the season pass but im somewhere in the 20s now. i even have gold but i have yet to actually know what to do with it lol
---
Bitch you haven‚Äôt seen nothing until a fucking 20 ton beast the size of a building comes running full speed at you and bashes your skull in with a fire hydrant bat
---
I've played a lot recently and not had anything I consider suspicious happen. Maybe, maybe last night someone's bullet was awfully well-placed but honestly I think they just made a good shot, probably. 
---
Not saying that shit isn't happening, but it's definitely not (yet?) so rampant that you'll see it a ton.
---
I spent yesterday searching to set my melee character up üò•
---
That was me, or rather I was one of them. I made a new character for wastlanders and did a melee build from the start. Unlike my main oooh that perk looks nice broken build. Got loot form her level 25 - 30, I remember it was 25 - 30 because it was a 2x XP weekend and I went in at level 25 and came out level 30.
---
I put in a ticket with support yesterday and got the automated response, I replied to that email with basically, ‚Äúplease a human read this, I want to use the atom shop and it‚Äôs locked at 390 when I know I have over 1000+, how do you expect us to buy atoms when they disappear like this??‚Äù. 
---
Still waiting for a reply, I‚Äôll update if they do respond...
---
I have a love/hate relationship with assaultrons. They are the only mob i fear and respect, and as such are the only mob i am wary around. Unfortunately, a large part of that fear and respect comes from how damned buggy they are. I have two builds that can oneshot a L46 assaultron dominator but then its a crapshoot as to whether or not it will actually die, or whether it will regen to full health, teleport into a table and become invincible, then shoot me with unerring accuracy with its head beam even though ive been sprinting away at full tilt and there are currently multiple walls between me and it.
---
I've done it a few times. Nothing like forgetting to swap super duper and starched genes after crafting something to walk through a decontamination arch and see your mutations disappear.
---
I hear you. I got lucky on all but the right leg. I  got the other 4 pieces in 1 or 2 tries, have been trying for months for the RL but can't get it. I made 7 nocturnals in a row. üò≠
---
It's a good game, it's just not a great game. Mostly this is due to various bugs and issues - if any player with over 100hrs hasn't got a personal 'why?' list they are liers. If you are after perfection from hour 1 you'll be disappointed, but if you are willing to give it time and work for the rewards it grows on you.
---
Minority here probably but I would have recommended it from the B.E.T.A. days....
---
Mirelurk Kings are the worst simple because most armor doesn‚Äôt provide for poison resistance.  I can take a lot of damage but poison not so much
---
Mods just game bug, learn chances the same as for armor, not weapons.
---
I've heard of someone rolling over 4000 times to get a decent 3* Unyielding set.
---
I feel for you, my first nuke was a real trip. I don't understand though why being in your husband's team you couldn't just JOIN him and fast travel to him and pick up where you left off, I may be missing something.
---
Lvl19 alt lol probably not a newbie
---
Sad to hear that! If you ever get the urge to try again (which I hope you do) to make things easier why don‚Äôt you bring some hired help next time? You said you guys are filthy casuals, try bringing someone who can help you do it legitimately.
---
Amazing that you guys did the encryption yourselves! 
---
Never give up! Never surrender! Ad Victorium!
---
Woah only one dollar? Where can i get this deal sir?
---
We measure camp space by flamingo units around here.
---
West Virginia?
---

---
That is weird as mine all show there?
---
I only came back not long ago after not being on since launch and I was feeling the same way as you at first.
---
I‚Äôm now 348 so no need to grind like crazy during XP events but I remember those days especially in winter where you play for hours.  I recall going from like 50-75 in one weekend.  That was nice
---
Oh I see.. Hopefully you get reinstated.
---
That sucks.
---
 I think the worst is going through all that and then doing the queen fight and getting her down to the last bit of health, lagging out, and not getting any loot from her, and also not getting credit for doing the event.
---
Just so you know, there's a fast way to run through the silos and launch that takes about 12 minutes it's a lot faster and more effective. What system are you on?
---
You should really write speeches, you‚Äôre REALLY good with your words, well done
---
&gt;	Do i need to spend a lot of money in this game to be strong? Or will i enjoy it as much as others that buy from the real money shop ingame? 
---
There is nothing in the atomic shop that makes you ‚Äústrong‚Äù or gives you an advantage. It‚Äôs all essentially camp furniture, outfits and skins for weapons. The only exception is a robot that collects materials slowly, repair kits (unnecessary. You can use junk you find in game to repair weapons more effectively), scrap kits (equally unnecessary. Your camp is portable for a reason. Also stash boxes and workbenches are everywhere). 
---
It‚Äôs a fun game. If you liked fallout 4, want more fallout, and don‚Äôt need to mod to have a good time it‚Äôs enjoyable. I have 800+ hours in since launch. They have added and improved a lot since launch.
---
Not sure if it matters but I‚Äôm on PC.
---
Content on wastelanders? I searched it and said its only available for the owners of the game back then, so do i still need to buy the dlc to be able to play it?
---
This will lead to trolling where people just hog silos to screw with you until you leave the server and sometimes you won‚Äôt always want to do that.
---
To farm Violet, I nuke a bland spot on the top left with the circle barely covering hemlock holes, to almost reaching the Alligator theme park, to almost reaching grafton. I‚Äôve picked up 250 Violet flux there in one nuke. But there are few enemies, so I usually wait til I have a bunch of fluids and mass before I nuke that spot.
---
Because I left the server entirely‚ÄîI ended up at the main menu, and tried to rejoin the team, but I got a bunch of weird error messages at first. Each one was different, it was things like, ‚ÄúAccount Invalid,‚Äù and ‚ÄúUser Account Has Been Temporarily Disconnected.‚Äù After about five or six tries, I was able to join the server by choosing my husband via Social, but I had to join his team again (I‚Äôd been the team lead before). So it was like I got severed completely from the team and server, resetting everything when I rejoined.
---
Rip that‚Äôs too bad that your first run went like that. I know how demoralizing it is when a bunch of progress just gets trashed because of a bug or a bad timed crash but don‚Äôt let this stop you from playing it‚Äôs a supper fun game when it works lmao. 
---
I know it‚Äôs a you and him thing but if you both want a little help getting back to that point I‚Äôd be happy to help (as long as your on PC) Understandable if you don‚Äôt just thought I‚Äôd offer.
---
This
---
I sometimes think they want to brag with their builds, little do they know most of us can do the same if we wanted to.
---
One of the few reasons to go console instead of PC. Really difficult for hacks and cheats through console.
---
Wow thank you sir, im glad that i could play it without being underpowered because of other people that can buy stuff. And im kind of a hard working grinding roleplayer in fallout and this makes me really happy.
---
You are correct. However I managed to earn 1500-ish atoms without any troubles, then the bug hit me and despite never played in [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) with this account, since steam release, I have 970 atoms there (had close to 80 before the bug).
---
I clicked the pie vendor as i walked in to talk to the Purveyor. As i normally do.
---
When i turned back around to leave, the pie was not visible. It took a couple of seconds to register. But i checked the machine and sure enough, after 300 or so hours, i got my first Perfectly Preserved Pie.
---
yeah, happened to me 4 times, entering the last room to lunch the nuke boot me in the same place 4 times.
---
There are very few challenges that actually require a bit of effort. 
---
Survive 30 minutes is probably the 'hardest' challenge. The rest are pretty simple.
---
Oh sure, you applaud him but when I do it butt naked after 15  blue long Island iced teas at Applebee's,  all a sudden I'm a, "monster" and a "embarrassment to my family."

Double standards are my trigger! I'm going to applebees, I need a drink.

No u can play it
---
If you are on PC just look up Xbox Game Pass, it‚Äôs like Netflix for games and the first month is 1$.
---
That‚Äôs really kind, thank you!
---
Hell yes, its still a Fallout game with hundreds of hours of content. Even if you just want to play 100% solo. I just passed 300 hours on steam.
---
I still have not even hit the vault 79 raid or launched a nuke. Admittedly, i do have two L80 chars and a couple low level alts.
---
Thank you for the kind offer. That‚Äôs one reason we love this game. We‚Äôre PS4, but props for offering.
---
If you like fallout 4, you will like this one. Hundreds of hours of content. Also, all expansions and seasons are free
---
I came here with nothing to lose but some tin cans...
---
...*and I‚Äôm all out of cans*.
---
in 10 days I will hit 4 month. But i played on my own and actually listened all holotapes and read terminals &amp; notes (not all of them but still). And i actually enjoyed pretty much all about BoS and the main questline in general. A little bit crazy and wtf but still interesting.
---
Is it just atoms from the legendary run, or all challenges?
---
It is pretty stupid. She landed a few times. MIRV grenades, gatling, few grenade launcher rounds and still didn't. I'm gonna go with bug given thats how Bethesda games be.
---
That sucks so much! Did you get one in the end?
---
I had an entire post on suggestions to help, then my computer crashed.
---
If you have any troubleshooter armor at all, I would recommend using it.
---
dunno evebory praise Amazon server's even when is shit, and true worlds fo76 don't have any optimization, I can play RDR2 online for hours with out any issue with my friend and be awere that is 200% more graphically heavy and have way more animations and complexity but fo76 not and and run worse than anthem that is shit.
---
Reminds me of Mario Mario and Luigi Mario
---
You do not need to buy it. Wastelanders comes with the base game.
---
Nah man, it's like minecraft in the way that every update/expansion will be free once you buy the title
---
Re-read the OP thinking I missed something, the OP didn‚Äôt complain...
---
Bethesda does take too long. You must never have had the need to submit a regular support ticket. Meanwhile hackers walk free killing entires maps of players in NW.
---
Well said
---
Just gotta get to lvl 50
---
There is actually a mod on PC that eliminates this annoying broadcast.

Bethesda should just give an Adventure Mode challenge alternative for the Nuclear Winter one. Regardless of cheaters, I feel like that challenge is there just to force people into that game mode. I certainly didn't buy the game in 2018 to play Battle Royale. That being said, I do appreciate the easy Nuclear Winter challenges. I'm happy to let anybody shoot me after I spam the place camp buttons 4 times or while doing something more fun like taxes as I wait for the survive x number of minutes to complete.
---
nope I can't play becouse my "play" option  on the main menu got grey and I can't select since the last disconect, but I can play on my alt that is lvl 7...
---
Just link up with a blind player and help each other through the wasteland like Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder.
---
Get a refund on Fallout first if you are able. You are entitled to the time you aren‚Äôt using.
---
Yeah, I'd say bug as well.
---
Lol that reminds me, I saw a level 9 player the other day charging the SBQ with his spear. Leroy Jenkins!!
---
mountain mama?
---
Yeah happens to me dont worry when you open the shop the correct amount is displayed
---
.... Your armour might be bugged... Most of mine breaks faster then combat armour lol,  every now and then you can get an immortal piece that never breaks
---
Clearly, I‚Äôm causing glitches. I must have picked something up from those diseased charred feral ghouls outside Site Charlie.
---
He takes it right back when he gets one tapped by my BE laser lol
---
Big Bend Tunnel East (where the Blue Ridge Caravan is &amp; Riding Shotgun starts) can have a set as well - usually mixed.
---
Honestly it should be both to give it unique build options
---
I created a second character this weekend purely to side with the wastelanders faction I hadn‚Äôt the first time (and try out a melee/shotgun build). Got to level 50 when finishing the vault raid, in large part thanks to some glass caverns lunchbox-aided ghoul farming with some higher level public teams folks. 
---
Now to finish off Sofia‚Äôs quest line (which was glitched for me, and had to be reset) and I‚Äôll have 100%ed the game trophy-wise.
---
I 100% agree. People need to give things a shot for themselves without listening to the reviewers that just wanted fallout 5. It‚Äôs a different kind of game, but as a lifelong gamer and fan of the fallout series, this is the game I‚Äôve sank the most hours into ever. At around 2100hrs currently and I‚Äôm stuff finding new stuff to do or things to learn every single day. It‚Äôs totally worth it
---
Ah...... Good times!
---
Lol username
---
I've had something similar happen as a bug. All of the Mister Handies and Sgt Gutsies were dropping dead shortly after interacting with me, both around Whitesprings and in the Enclave bunker. Luckily it didn't interfere with any quests, but it was unnerving.
---
Don‚Äôt know why this is downvoted. Bethesda sure doesn‚Äôt care about NW, slow reaction to cheaters and no new maps or other content. Basically a dead game mode with a couple of try hard groups who no life it and those who just want rewards for adventure.
---
I know. And if I recall, he ended up getting exposed for duping way more than just some ammo. I remember it was a big deal at the time
---
Wow, this is just dumb. So that's where my recently earned atoms went... Well guess I can't really spend them on anything useful if they're split like this. 
---
Sent in a ticket about this a few days ago, still waiting on a response. I don't expect them to do anything about it but hey, you never know.
---
Uhh...She is immune to explosive damage.
---
Another recommendation - hack every terminal &amp; pick every lock.
---
You can avoid the reactor sequence entirely by going directly left after going through the Decon Shower and picking that level three locked door. It leads to a terminal (level 3 hack) that lets you override the shutdown.
---
For Assaultrons, aim for the legs to cripple them.
---
In the control room, robots will usually hit you from one area - post up there &amp; try to kill them before they get close to the launch chiefs.
---
Would you reply to people just swearing up a storm because they didn‚Äôt get the perfect roll first try?
---
Got news for you, life isn't fair.
---
Here
---
like already mentioned, it isn't removable until you replace your camp.
---
also, yesterday someone from a discord claimed to be banned for having this item in his camp. he said he didn't duped or exploited score.
---
No, it was not plague walker as plague walker does not destroy armor and power armor. Dude was completely hacking. There were a ton of people at foundation and he showed up and when he killed you every bit of armor you had on would be broken as well even power armor. You would just fall over dead no damage nothing just die and all armor would be busted. He also had a friend running around collecting everyones stuff they dropped when they died. If you were able to grab your gear fast enough he would kill you again so his friend could grab it.  At first, no one knew who was doing it but when people started figured it out and got on prox chat to call him out he left the server. I reported it with video but who knows if they ever did anything.
---
What‚Äôs your platform?
---
If PS4, I have plans for most pieces in my vending machine
---
If they give us you‚Äôre suggested card you‚Äôd hate bloodied sneak even more do you think I‚Äôm not using a bloodied explosive with rank 5 demo lmfaooooo
---
PC, sorry.
---
yep same exact problem, sent a ticket 2 days ago.
---
&gt; Survive 30 minutes is probably the 'hardest' challenge. The rest are pretty simple.
---
I think that's the easiest one. Time consuming, to be sure. But hella easy.I queue solo, pick a spot on the map I know is unattractive, and hide. Ride the storm as it moves. Unless you are unlucky and/or get hit by magic bullets, you can complete it in one or two games.
---
You also have to be there from the begining, I've found that if I arrive, and people are shooting already, I get nothing, where as if I arrive at her "birth" I get loot.
---
Explosives do no damage to her just FYI. Grenades only make her fly, so it‚Äôs best not to throw them. 
---
I‚Äôm melee so as long as I can get a few hits on her I get loot.
---
I gave up on lore long ago
---
That would be nice but you would need it on all characters. I don‚Äôt know how diff that would be to add tho. 
---
But great idea!
---
It is a lot of fun. I have primed Furious for SBQ and a Vampires that I am wanting to get more everyday use out of. Still running a Gatling for target practice, and a 50 cal for heartier mobs while I build up the 2 mm ammo reserves. The 2 mm crafting batches are stupid small, but no gunpowder needed so that is something at least. Ammosmith, super duper, and bear arms has been key to adding the gauss mini into my arsenal. If you prime, add stable crimson flux to your shopping list.
---
Where did you get your information on how much XP is required to go from level *x* to level *y*?
---
it was so brutally hot this past weekend so i was able to hunker down in between raids in destiny lol
---
they're not going to let you grow XP increasing foods. thus why you cant harvest and grow cranberries.
---
Off topic, but what do you use flux for? Like I know Violet flux can be sold at vendors and some of it can be eaten.
---
Bufftats, Whiskey, Enclave Under armor, Str bobblehead, Excavator PA with calibrated shocks and motion assisted servos, +1Str Knuckles
---
So, how many Brotherhood soldiers do you think were a part of Operation Touchdown? I mean, they fought their way from Ft. Defiance, through Watoga and the Glassed Caverns, leaving a trail of bodies in their wake.
---
Taggerdy ended up with, what, like 5 guys at the end before the failed to set off the bomb?
---
If you manage to join back his team and he is still in the silo, all you will have to do is get a new ID card to get through the first grid, then you can just walk back to him(be mindful the robots do respawn, always)
---
Edited: ID card instead of I'd card.
---
Yeah as I was reading I thought dam that sucks, but also wow this person can tell a story!!
---
I agree I jumped from level 48 to 59 after playing for about 18 hours since it started
---
You have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about, not even a little.
---
There is no vats, there is nothing to do with swimming. Ignore the animations or whatever you see they are no clipping to top of map, sending damage to anyone who is loaded in while moving around getting other players to load in. If you want to troll them, go to the farthest corners of the map and make them work for it. But yeah be sure to always report, these people are trash.
---
I had the same issue last night. I would equip grenades in inventory, and they would immediately unequip.
---
You won‚Äôt get the same fuzzies you get from the single player experience that fo4/Skyrim probably gave you. As soon as I stopped chasing down that same experience, and opened up to a different kind of experience, I started having a good time.
---
Well we still haven't sorted how to fix the steam launch but what's most important is that we are able to access the steam side of the game. Hopefully Bethesda support and steam support work together (I have tickets open with both about this issue) and I can get it working the right way so I don't have to go into all the folders just to launch. :) Thanks for letting me know they're different! I didn't know.
---
Thats the price you pay for accepting items that were gotten through cheating.
---
Thank you. I hope so too.
---
wow that's pretty incredible! im doing melee shotgun on my current set up so my plan is to get gauss-y with it and start annihilating things.
---
How do i get a legendary powerfist? just rng from publics and stories?
---
There are tons of noobies now with game pass.
---
who knows what kind of changes their mutations has caused in their body? metals enriched nailes for example, could result in literally razor sharp claws... enhanced strength and aggression combined with close to no sense of self preservation... remember that, if you are healty enough and your diet is right, your own fingernails can get tough as thin sheet of metal without any mutation needed...
---
nice! getting all of these new perk cards is pretty cool for me so far, being able to fine tune the build finally
---
Upgrading to Prime Receivers and making ultracite ammo for them
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs really all you can do for any sort of legendary, unless you go to the marketplace sub and see if someone has one they‚Äôll trade / sell you, then you can see about arranging that.
---
Oh ok üëç
---
Only with the caveat that you don't ever pay full price for it.
---
There are fun parts to the game for certain but there are still do many problems &amp; bugs that it honestly isn't worth it's full retail price tag.
---
If it's on special or you play via game pass, go for it. Otherwise wait or move on.
---
I've seen plenty of AFK players just jumping in place, earning their minutes that way. I appreciate it because they are the majority of my kills.
---
Crafting prime receivers for guns, crafting Ultracite ammunition for those prime receivers, Crafting serum‚Äôs, building Jetpacks, Making fusion cores,
---
Admittedly, I have zero knowledge of modding 76. I just use a few to fix QOL that bethesda hasn't addressed. Currency ticker would be immensely helpful considering that's about all that keeps me playing atm.
---
This could be a game changer as I often miss out on scorch beasts even with a tag.
---
Edit - Just tried with scorchbesst and no loot.
---
Just set 10 timers on yer phone ü§óü§óü§ó
---
Another thing to note, I just claimed some atoms from the legendary run but those ones updated correctly on my steam client. So it might just be the ones from the challenges that are affected.
---
Was. I literally started it.
---
Well, wanna laugh? Just logged in again, and it is workingü§£ no words from bethesda yet...
---
any twisted muscles i¬¥d say...
---
Thats me. starting an event i think i can handle, then getting my sissy little ass kicked until a high level comes to save me and essentially complete the event for me
---
Don‚Äôt think this is accurate. Plenty of times I wait till the event has already started to save caps on travel, show up, kill her and get loot
---
I've never heard of that happening before. Have you checked your stash and made sure you just didn't put the wrong suit on at some point?
---
Huh, for me they did.
---
Huh. We‚Äôd died and he even left the site, but they hadn‚Äôt respawned once we got to the final battle, and when I saw that I needed a new keycard and everything respawned for me, I assumed I‚Äôd end up needing to redo EVERYTHING.
---
[https://youtu.be/\_aPHq3ZtNy8](https://youtu.be/_aPHq3ZtNy8)  This is just this guys opinion but it's a decent guide.
---
Got news for you: helping people in general is a basic rule to being a decent human. You could sit there on your self-righteous throne all day, spouting your "wisdom" or you could submit a ticket to help raise awareness. Either way, solid contribution, Doyouevenfreedombro.
---
Edit: rules to rule.
---
Weird. I saw them do damage
---
Mmmmm....... I'd go with bug then! üòÇ
---
ah i'll very likely rng it, unless i happen across one in a player vendor by chance
---
Odd - mine works fine. I just prefer the look of the ranger set.
---
There is no way.
---
Nice!  474 to 537 on my main as well as a few levels across my alts.  It was a bit grueling and I don't want to see a mutant or a ghoul for a few days.  All of the SCORE was a nice bonus though.
---
Yes, the weeklys count.
---
And all the ingredients for brewing
---
If you can deal with bugs and glitches yes. If you can‚Äôt than no.
---
Video games should be accessible to everyone.
---
Like this?
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects
---
If you want a tier type list, just go to kevduit and look up any build you‚Äôre thinking of and it‚Äôll tell you the weapons/armor you should be after.
---
Yeah I tried it but it didn‚Äôt seem to do anything either, will edit the OP to advise of that. Probably my fallout76custpm.ini is just not being loaded.
---
I think it‚Äôs something like 3250 billion to get both SEcret Service chest piece and jet pack mod. Those are the first things I went after
---
Edit: *bullion
---
yep, 2X SCORE weekend will give me some breathing room.
---
Haven't put in too many hours, but got my second toon from lvl 23 to lvl 85
---
My main went from level 480 to 520, and I went from rank 35 to 70. I love the new public team mechanic in general though... It was definitely something this game needed.
---
Yesterday for the first time ever, i found a guy who killed me with pounch FROM THE DISTANCE. That was really uncool and frustrating.
---
Well shit. I barely got like 4 levels, but then my play times vary a bit :/.
---
teammate also waited more then 8 months for the unban, he picked up some huge ammounts of ammo back in the early days without knowing it was not allowed (someone just dropped it at a trainstation).
---
Probably 24 soldiers at absolute most. I don't think the servers could have handled them bringing more troops than that.
---
Herbivore mutation 
---
Cranberry relish 
---
Brain Fungus soup 
---
Building public team 
---
Full unyielding armor 
---
Inspirational perk card maxed out 
---
Lunchboxes as often as you can 
---
Hit WesTek, Huntersville, Harpers Ferry, Fissure Sites, Capitol building, The Burrows, and do high lvl events as they pop up.
---
I do admire the ‚Äú I may not win but I‚Äôll do something to contribute ‚Äú attitude most of us have at low levels
---
Not really that hard. Powerleveled my bud to 55 in a few hours, using lunchboxes. That was a few hours. If they played hard, they could've been over 160+ too -- Just follow XP farming routes with Unyielding and you win.
---
Touche.
---
started a new character on thursday evening and now i'm level 164
---
Sorry to hear this. I do remember I got warned the raider vault quest can stuck. I had to do it seven times :O
---
After I went to do a silo run with a full grp in case I got a disconnect/crash I will have the option to hop back the server where the rest of the team is.
---
And you can only get 5 steel at a time, so yeah it sucks.
---
But still much easier to get 3* Unyielding.
---
Yes! It was fun wasn‚Äôt it!?
---
Most logic answer &amp; yet heavily downloaded
---
Knight Moreno to... i guess no one
---
If any Brothers pick this up: EL-7 is gold. Repeat. EL-7.
---
We've got no idea how many are in the cave. But they're definitely hostiles in there.
---
God help us.
---
I think most people use auto. Any bloodied weapon at 10% hp and under is strong, so any version should suit your needs just fine. However, I rarely see it being used in adventure. I think most people use it for PvP and not PvE.
---
There‚Äôs a few I know of.
---
Aimbot, the normal. 
---
God mode. Seen some survive nukes. 
---
Send damage. This commonly gets mistaken for ‚ÄúInvisible Punchers‚Äù. Usually lowly equipped, makes a lot of punching noises. Will instantly break armor, but can‚Äôt insta-kill, to my knowledge. 
---
Invisible Punchers. Only ever seen this once; and it‚Äôs actually kind of funny. Basically, they‚Äôre somehow permanently invisible and run around punching people. It‚Äôs pretty funny, and you can actually kill these. 
---
Fly hackers. Not exactly sure what to call these. But they‚Äôre the most prolific. Up in the sky, blasting down and somehow getting kills.
---
There‚Äôs only a few counters to hackers I know of. 
---
1) Stealth. Hiding is a valid strategy. If they can‚Äôt see you, they can‚Äôt hit you if it‚Äôs aimbot. Range is also an effective counter measure to these, as there‚Äôs render limits. 
---
Check for godmode by tapping from a distance if you can safely. If they regen, they‚Äôre godmode. Get the fuck away if they are. 
---
2) Nukes. If they‚Äôre not godmode, go for this if you can. They generally like to drop tight nukes if they can anyway, because they can stroll through them without rads. No hazmat required.
---
From what I‚Äôve heard, there‚Äôs some discord where they call it ‚Äúskill‚Äù. Around 15 or so that are usually on for ruining fun. More come out for XP weekends when the pickings are rich.
---
Bethesda, to my knowledge, only bans cheaters with video evidence. Mass reporting might work as well, though I wouldn‚Äôt know.
---
Wow despite all the bad things said and thrown at to this game, you guys are the most positive and encouraging community ive seen in a while. Im glad i asked for recommendations here and i thank you guys for supporting the game despite of its flaws and help on making it better throughout its hardships. I think im gonna be giving this game a shot, hey never could have enough fallout am I right? Also i think if i dont start soon, im gonna be missing out on legacy items too! You guys sold the game for me and i thank you for convincing me. I hope to see you on the wasteland fellow vault friends!
---
Funny game is suppose to be a survival but has so many basic mechanics from popular ones missing
---
It‚Äôs amazing. I‚Äôve never seen events so populated. Even the piddly events like Tea Time are busy.
---
Glitcher? Lol that's hilarious. Even if you were 'glitching', using glitches isn't wrong. You're just jumping through loopholes the devs put in the game. Like Rocksy. Using extra programs to hack, now that is wrong. We've all used glitches before.
---
From my experience dying is fine not sure about leaving the site half way, but when the game freezes and requires restart, or boots you for some random reason and you have to rejoin the world make sure 1 person stays in the silo, join straight back into their team. they can even wait for you at the laser grid, but you will need a new id card. From my experience even staying in one of the rooms you clear for a minute and walking back to a previous room is enough to respawn most robots(the sentry bot and turrets being exceptions I can come up with from the top of my head).
---
No problem. Good luck on your quest!
---
Non explosive Vampire SMG is my event gun.
---
Not enough power to 1 shot kill, but being full auto, can and will do the job if necessary.
---
x01 power armor helps a lot in silos. Also, hacking terminals to disable turrets will save you a lot of time and resources. I wish you luck for next time.
---
I was curious of this too.
---
I agree. I have enjoyed the game since release.
---
Try again today sometimes things get buggy. If you join a new server or wait a day it might get better. I‚Äôve been playing since the beta, this games does things like that all the time sometimes you just have to roll with the punches and hope for the best. I‚Äôve had quests glitched for weeks but I think they‚Äôre all good now
---
Yeah, something weird happened, because it took me multiple tries to even log back in. I was getting super weird errors. I think that‚Äôs why it all reset. That sucks, it‚Äôs so hard to lose out on a glitch!
---
My three characters:
---
- Gunslinger (lvl 70 to lvl 110)
---
- Strength Build (lvl 160 to lvl 180)
---
- Steath Rifleman/ Commando (lvl 140 to 150)
---
I think your right, it's my experience, but a few have now said that to the contrary , so it must be a bug.
---
Speaking of score. I was getting tired of hearing that XP repeatable completion audible go off every 5 minutes lol.
---
Did you go to the challenge board and redeem them.
---
Oh the desperation of low levels. Fun to watch but kills my will to grind out an alt character
---
A long time ago the Scorched Killer mod applied as a legendary slot, but that's changed. The general consensus is it's there for future content.
---
I remember swim testing my level 2 character and hitting lvl 50 in about 90 minutes.
---
Ohhh the good ol days
---
Yes but I still can't find any of them
---
Thanks! We did hack a lot of terminals, which let us disable turrets. There were a lot of ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt do this without training‚Äù responses for the robot control, not sure if that requires a perk card or something?
---
I lied tbh  
---
added maybe 50 levels to my main and 23 to my alt (last one i need to get to 50).
---
Not always true, I shot her 3 times with my level 10 hunting rifle and dealt about 18 damage total and was still able to loot het, that was this past weekend when I was playing on my low level character.
---
Haha! Good one! I‚Äôm amazed at how intellectual your insult was.
---
A better way to build up bounty is to take note of every C.A.M.P. spot in your session and go and pick locks. If there are any workshops that are occupado, bingo. Don't take it over but just lockpick and steal all the ore/junk/oil
---
You should be able to go at least 15 min before you get disconnected.  
---
Sometimes the hardest part is finding a ‚Äúsafe‚Äù place to park you char before walking away.
---
So many people cheat that if you're not at least seeing people through walls, you're putting yourself at a significant disadvantage.
---
I'd rather be at a significant disadvantage than be a cheater, but there are so few players who agree with me.
---
And sacrificial blade mod for machete also made 4 star items
---
Post the link please.  I'd like to see this in action.
---
If you are on PS4 I dont mind doing this together and letting you launch the nuke I already launched one thanks to help from friends before to complete the I am become death quest. I am quite the casual player myself who accidentally sold his second weapon which happened to be legendary (LOL) so I just use my laser gatling. So yeah if you happen to be on PS4 by all means hit me up two or more casuals should be able to do it haha.
---
second this one, especially that scorched one that comes a SBQ fights.
---
You get like 25-35 caps per weapon, average (the ones you get from uranium Fever).
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox and I‚Äôd purchase said pistol depending on what pistol it is. It‚Äôs hard to find good pistols for sale.
---
Nice! I don‚Äôt remember where I ended up on the season board.
---
ok can verify that copying the game files over to the [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) install folder and then clicking install in that folder in the Beth Launcher works.
---
(Though I already assumed it would be working as the files are the same for both)
---
Ya I did, a bunch of the weapons I grabbed I've lost to scammers or bugs, mainly bloodied weapons that I've tried to trade with
---
Mine was working again today, but then the game froze and crashed on me when I returned to defend the old bog Town workshop.
---
Did you look under the paint option in the mods.
---
This issue hasn't occurred again.
---
It‚Äôs nice having multiple characters at lvl 50 or more just for hitting the purveyor multiple times in a play session if you get a bunch of scrip fodder.
---
The only thing I care about is the chicken coop. Because I‚Äôm always making realistic, or farm style camps. The chicken coop will go right next to my cow and crops.
---
Treasure maps and the map vendor are great to do since your got a scrap box now. Those gives quite a bit of mat rewards once your free from defending your workshops.
---
Load bearing also have chests in the mine that have tons of mats as well.
---
I mean, I believed you, but no way.  Mostly due to my refusal to look up all the tips to maxing xp.
---
It's under the "paint" options when you mod that piece of armor.
---
For the PA, of course you need to do it in the PA station.
---
I dunno, we got promised a lot of features that would be added to FO1st back when it was announced (bigger camp budget, some sort of workshop permanence, mods etc) but we haven't heard anything about it since then.
---
The only thing that has been mentioned by BGS are instanced interior camps, coming in the ~~fall~~ I believe [EDIT: I checked the roadmap, it actually says C.A.M.P shelters will come in the "Winter"]
---
I will say I've been killed by the same player this weekend 3 times and each time he had a gauss shotty. His name was doomplayer or something like that.
---
Only 10-15 games in total and he got me 3 times with the same weapon each time? Not saying it can't happen but those are some unreal probabilities.
---
No it can‚Äôt have been. Score is impossible to complete and the repeatable is going to take aaaagggggeeeesss to fill even one time. Have u not seen all the posts.
---
Rads are dangerous for bloodied builds, of course. And most people protect themselves from explosives, not rads.
---
You get enough free atoms from the game to buy the last 9 ranks. I've been doing challenges I never thought I'd do just to get atoms. I'm hoping to buy out the last 14 ranks without spending a dime of real money. I want this over asap as I'm sick of being a slave to the grind and logging in every day. If they pull this stupid game board shit next season, I'm not playing it. One time is enough.
---
Yeah I didn‚Äôt think about that. I should probably somehow mark camp locations before I get wanted. I was hopping in and out of public teams so I could see my teammates camp locations.
---
If you're a Fallout 1st Gold member you get 4\* weapons but you have to be Fallout 1st Diamond to get 5\*
---
Shit is so cash
---
I checkt again is a B2515 Pistol not B2525.
---
No. It's just a graphical gimmick for kicks. We'll all eventually meet him on the last space on the last day.
---
It‚Äôs not that hard to maximize your XP once you know what you need. Even without full unyielding armor you can get quite a boost on XP earned. I keep corn and gourds planted at my camp crab cranberries from Aaronholt farm. Cranberry relish plus herbivore mutation gives a 20% XP boost just by itself.
---
Primed gun ammo, also some CAMP items need some.
---
If your radium rifle shoots and it goes 
---
Pew Pew Pew Pew.   Then it‚Äôs Rifleman perks. 
---
If it goes PewPewPewPewPew then it‚Äôs commando perks.
---
Good idea
---
My favorite is probably either the mole miner's (if they count) because of all the steel and glowing meat (which can then be made into glowing steak and sold for 11 caps each) you can get from them or the Wendigo because they aren't actually that hard to kill and they give you screws.
---
Edit: Oh I should add that the 11 caps is with hard bargain 3 and grape mentats
---
I‚Äôve been enjoying dropping #nukes4noobs lately. It honestly feels like a more honest game now
---
This. I actually get UPSET at the people who are using the crook at any point after the cows have deviated and are back on track. It just speeds them up and increases the odds they will run smack into enemy spawns to get them killed. I'd also rather have that sheepsquach dead as fast as possible because it's often the biggest threat to the poor moomoos, and who cares about a 1 star legendary at this point?
---
level 127-131 i think.  played maybe 3-4 hours.
---
no extra bonuses either, just trying to grind dailies.
---
I did see all the posts! I‚Äôm not gonna lie, I was worried going into it......lol
---
Might be this. There was a point that they had to put PA into stashes to fix something, so check your stash before you put in a ticket.
---
How much? I only have the helm and the right arm for t60. Got the others?
---
Kind of unrelated, but is said loot different per player, or is it the same for a pool of players?
---
Asking because i've left so much stuff on the SBQ, trying not to be an asshole who just ninja loots the corpse.
---
oOo that sounds pretty cool. ive been finding and storing gold, as i know it'll pay off later. but i have yet to even be hinted to vault 79 in my story progression, which albeit is all over the damned place. i was supposed to hit level 20 then talk the overseer but i started the rose questline before that point, which worked out since they tie to each other lol
---
So I could expect to wait a year and a half before I can get back on 76? Fucking ridiculous.
---
Fast travel from inside buildings
---
Oh! So that's why people keep picking the one lock in my entire camp, they're calling out for attention, like that one overly noisy kid, pick more locks = screaming louder, got it.
---
I just give 'em a wave and get back to what I was doing.
---
wait what happened? you would swim and get exp?
---
Public teams is the best update this game has ever had.
---
It gives use to Charisma. Charisma is now an awesome SPECIAL. Herd Mentality is now an unreal serum.
---
I had a couple of those last night, and I finally just said fuck it and turned off my xbox.
---
If you two need on PS4 let me know. I have an extra key card and I can walk you through the ropes on how to do the run with not as much effort as you put in :)
---
Yep. Proud music geek.
---
this is posted alot. and they are not goingto give you the ability to craft xp altering foods in your camp.
---
You could maybe hit the same level of damage with Berserker's and a broken Chinese SS. Rocking with no DR is hard, so stealth would be your friend, but on the plus side, full health and no addictions! It's also easy to "swap out" of Berserker's if you need to (equip different armor, change weapons) so it's more versatile than Junkies and Bloodied which kind of lock you in.
---
It is the ultimate PvP weapon, since you can shoot aimlessly and hit your invisible target anyway. 
---
I have a bloodied faster fire. Great weapon, but it feels like cheating. Don't take it to events unless you are ready to PvP. And never take it to Scorched Earth. 
---
Any Tesla is good, go for automatic.
---
Glad I could help I guess lol
---
If the nuke is properly placed SBQ can be fought outside the nuke zone making the need for rad resists much lower.
---
‚ÄúYes I‚Äôm aware posting it on reddit will not fix the problem, I‚Äôm just doing it to farm karma instead of submitting a ticket to actually get it fixed‚Äù üò¥
---
No, you just need hacker x3. I guess both have finished the enclave quest to obtain the degree of general?
---
Basically. Join a team, load up the perks for bonus XP, use low level unyielding gear and pop a couple leader bobble heads. 
---
Took maybe 90 minutes to level up to 50
---
When they had the triple XP event I leveled up to 80 within a couple hours.
---
I've been reluctant to take the herbivore mutation since it's so easy to just eat raw meat forfood but may have to do it, now that double xp is over.
---
Ghoulish rank 3. They can still kill you but it takes a lot longer
---
So there's never an instance where there's a line of dialogue that would "overflow" (be longer than a sentence or two that can be displayed at once) and is displayed as multiple subtitles? Because that seems like it would work in this instance, you could just keep displaying subtitles. 
---
It doesn't have to be perfectly lined up with each line of audio. 
---
I couldn't find anything about how holotapes were all individual lines of dialogue strung together, and modders asking about how to do it themselves weren't instructed to record it that way. Also, people were able to download the audio files as we would expect - holotape audio all together as it's played on an individual tape. 
---
And all of the other holotapes have subtitles.
---
If you've got some more detailed info about how this definitely wouldn't work, and there's no possible workaround, I'm sure we'd all be interested, but it just seems odd that these are the only exceptions when other long dialogue files exist that are subtitled.
---
Another good compromise would be to do like in 3 and have the audio written out in your pip boy to read. If the UI can't handle it, the UI needs to be redesigned. 
---
Same for notes. There needs to be a plain text version of the notes available to read somewhere (in the pip boy maybe).
---
Honestly, in general, if the engine can't accommodate basic quality of life accommodations for people who need it, the engine needs some work then. You know? It's a bad excuse.
---
‚ÄúFuture content‚Äù lol. Keep holding your breath On that.
---
Carnivore mutation works just the same for cooked meat foods but I personally think making plant based XP boosting foods is easier than meat based XP boosting food.
---
Yep! I was only able to disable one robo-brain (the lead engineer). Though there were occasional robots just standing there, like the sentry bot, so maybe it was working but glitching a bit?
---
1 plastic + 1 glass + 2 rubber = marine recon helmet. At 3 Charisma they sell for 16 caps apiece. If you are posted up near Grafton even better, as the gym is loaded with basketballs and kickballs.
---
He's not even deaf, just a white knight looking to stir shit. Absolutely nothing will be good enough short of 100% perfection by Bethesda. 99% of the game has proper subtitles but because there are a small handful of things that don't it's time to grab the pitchforks. It's absolutely disgusting and shameful how many people are joining the echo chamber of support. It's just the way people are these days.
---
I wonder why this person doesn't seem to care about blind people who might want to play they game. It's not fair that there's nothing implemented for them!
---
Im at level 86
---
I was actually asking enunimes. Also even if you previously had these weapons they are legacy and were more than likely duped anyway.
---
This, I always fire it south of the drop site so we can lure the queen out
---
Aye. got fixer and handmade plans for them all. Still never had a fixer drop out of probably 1000+ purveryor rolls though
---
Usually I'll say "Death has no consequence!" Over area chat as I charge in balls first.
---
Check vendors! The shops at Whitespring sometimes have some for sale. With high charisma and perks you can buy four or five of them for less than 200 caps each.
---
Also, treasure maps.
---
Because going to the top of the forest to pick the ten cranberry plants there is hard? Because 10% xp bonus, is game breaking? I can already make more cranberry relish in a few minutes then I can use I a session.
---
Bugged out line in the sand was a stupid amount of xp with an explosive weapon or Tesla during double xp.  Gained 5 levels in about 5 minutes the one time I did it with lunchbox xp bonuses going as well. Character was in the 260's, so it was a lot of xp really fast.
---
Spent most of the weekend finally being a bush wookie though.
---
One away from that tree with a cage hanging from it, so i think that makes me 49.
---
PS4
---
Instead? Check the post subject, friend. How would I have gotten the link to the ticket page had I not submitted one? Thanks for diving into a thread about handicap accessibility without reading just to be childish and unsupportive though. Big appreciate.
---
I‚Äôve gotten fixers but none that would be considered god rolls. Best one I think was an executioners exploding one.
---
I seem to do OK. I play on my own and pretty much only bush wookie and get placement XP more often than not. Probably get a kill most games when I ambush somebody as they come past too.
---
Thanks for the offer! I really want the full experience the first time, but I might get the Chinese Stealth Suit before I do another one. :)
---
Loot from most things (SBQ included) is instanced to the individual.
---
I hit 58 over the weekend.  Mostly doing events where once you open a lunch box others follow suit.  Then with the x3 XP buff just farming XP as fast as i could.
---
Its a perk card someone Else shared with you. Only appears when playing in a Team. Leave the Team and the card will be gone.
---
I can't speak as to the exact criteria myself sadly, but someone will surely arrive to tell you soon on here I'm sure. 
---
What I can say is that I did it at new gad via low level super mutants. It took me 2 attempts to get the revive ability and not just insta dying, but just an option. There's a small amount of water to do it in.
---
As to the rest I have no idea, I've never figured out the exact criteria behind a down myself. I searched but never found anything conclusive or specific. The only thing I could think of ghoul wise is that rad death doesn't allow revive so maybe that was a factor in that case? I also wouldn't be surprised if a bug was involved, naturally.
---
I think I'm at 54, I passed Zorbo at lvl 50, not sure if that's by design, seems like it would be.
---
Agreed. They require 0 skill to complete because I have none and I complete them.
---
My camp spawns visitors and me south east of my module.
---
Let me add I am a fallout 1st member and never spend atoms so i was able to buy a lot of ranks I just don't have time for the grind.
---
I like getting the you have been insulted Sonu can leave them at over priced camps lol
---
Thanks! Although now i feel bad for leaving all of that stuff ('=
---
That doesn't work as well as you'd think. Just rank up Sneak Perks for the mission. Sneaking is your best friend. :)
---
You're on a team, that card is from someone else who is sharing it with you.
---
Looks like a feature to me.
---
Why won't they exist outside of Fallout 76?
---
Definetly yes. I played all by myself also, now level 106 and going. Absolutely suitable for solo players.
---
I dont know what a bloodied build is
---
Thanks for letting me know!
---
You need to do a certain percentage of damage, so if there‚Äôs one person or a few that are melting her on purpose then most other players won‚Äôt get loot because those tossers did most of it :-/
---
I used to think that. We formed a team, six people, absolute commandos and snipers. Two extra people moving around the rooms. High level, experienced, etc. We placed ourselves to do the job. We were special forces: no mole miner was able to even get close to an extractor. No interruptions, perfect run.
---
And the bar never got completed. My guess is RNG.
---
Yes.  I have played it very much like a solo game since last year.
---
Don't worry there'll be new allies..
---
With their on form of currency as well.
---
So you‚Äôre saying we don‚Äôt need to burn through 1500 shot-gun shells, 800 rounds of 308s, 700 rounds of 45s, 18 fusion cores, and 80 Stimpacks? Got it. :)
---
Oh im not selling flux. I want to buy flux

DOUBLE CHEEKED UP ON A THURSDAY AFTERNOON
---
Dude... they are here more active than on their own site and forum. Here they write themselves and don't employ stooges that only point to unhelpful stubs in their "help-wiki".
---
You‚Äôre that upset about a crappy holotape? I mean really..... it‚Äôs not like Bethesda went out of their way to screw deaf players. There are so many other things to complain about that are legit. And you said you aren‚Äôt deaf? Are you that bored? Go play the game!!
---
It was a great weekend.  So much xp felt like I was cheating. Went 300-330 on my main and put 20 on my alt in a blink
---
48
---
I had no time to play All the days so sad about it...
---
I think he actually says your character uses it as a nightlight not flashlight.
---
Yeah that link was an edit after you acknowledged in another part of the thread that you didn‚Äôt even submit a ticket yet. Nice try.
---
I'm on Xbox
---
I‚Äôm not sure about later in the game but I‚Äôve been playing a couple of weeks and already at level 49 by playing by myself. The only thing I do that includes other players are world events that anyone can join but I only do a couple a day.
---
Other than that, I explore/scavenge/build my CAMP and follow the main/side quests :)
---
I hit it with a combat shotgun until I needed to reload and it fell off a cliff
---
Off you go, to spend it on penny whistles and moon pies!
---
Pretty typical in subreddits for RPGs that have a PvP mode in my experience. I don't know why there is such a deep aversion to PvP amongst redditors but go to other subs for similar games with pvp modes/maps and you will see the same bs calls for removal and how it doesn't "fit in" with the rest of the game. How having a corner of the game for PvP players somehow ruins everything else about the game even though it is optional and avoidable most of the time.
---
Obviously an open world pvp mode has a separate appeal then a matched based structured pvp game but if you don't pvp at all then I guess it all looks the same? Playing survival mode (or dark zone in division or whatever destinys pvp area is called) is nothing like playing COD or RS or any of the battle royals. Unfortunately I have yet to find a replacement for what survival mode was, been wandering around other games looking since it went away
---
Being one of those people that hit several unbelievable shots this weekend I'd have to agree. Probably just some dude doing his best and surprising themselves as much as anyone else.
---
Sometimes that mission has bugs, which are fixed by traveling to another place on the map and returning.
---
I played mostly solo for more than a year - I find doing story quests works better when I'm alone (so I don't have people talking in my ear when I'm trying to listen to a holotape or talk to an NPC)
---
That‚Äôs some Chad energy.
---
He‚Äôs hacking, I was in a lobby with him and he was running around one shotting everyone
---
Yes! I only started playing in teams because of public teams, but even then it‚Äôs just for the boost.
---
Yep. Game has been out almost two years, and there has been zero added content since release. /s
---
Join a public team and play solo, you will still get the benefits of being part of a team while wandering around on your own.
---
A few days ago the insult bot snuck up on me and when I heard target acquired I immediately vats killed it. When I seen the name I was horrified to see I committed murder and was upset I never got to hear it‚Äôs insult
---
Why never take it to scorched earth?
---
So that's what everyone's been talking about. I hope they clean this crap up then.
---
Yeah that is what I did the first time I did the run :) And I messed up the code and I was locked out. Needed another keycard and I only had one!  So I had to do it all over again.
---
Since then, I learned the process and I can sneak through and maybe use 100 rounds total and mostly melee and like 1 or 2 stims if I need to. 
---
Also, all the silos are the same on the inside.
---
If you make a 3* fixer prime technically its 5* because of the fixers sneak effect and prime
---
Seriously I just want adventure mode with no pvp restrictions.
---
Not being funny just genuinely curious; why did you buy so many ranks now rather than wait till closer to the end of the time? Like I understand maybe wanting to get it out of the way but wouldn't you have just naturally ranked up some of that from just playing the game over the 10 weeks and then been able to buy any left over near the end? That's personally what I'm planning on doing, hoping to get to rank 90 before I buy just to be able to only use the atoms gained from the board but we'll see
---
ok good to know :)
---
a glitch/bug on xbox is a hack on pc, nice
---
Ah yes, this is similar to my challenge of beating the scorchbeast queen with no armor and only my bare fists. He is becoming a true champion of the peoples
---
Whether it's crappy or not is up to the player. I enjoyed it personally, and thought it added to the game. Deaf people don't get the option of wandering a spooky cave and reading as they play. Instead they get "look up the Wiki page" which is just plain wrong. If you think it's crappy, cool; that's called an opinion. Other people may have different opinions, believe it or not, and should have better access to have them instead of just being ignored.
---
Yeah, that was  my first time encountering someone so blatantly cheating
---
Pete Hines is a mostly solo player so you're in good company :)
---
You‚Äôre gonna be real disappointed if you think this season design is a one time thing.
---
Uh I haven't seen anyone with a bounty for a year, didnt know it was still in game. Why would you want kne?
---
I have made it to the end, watched the nuke leave the tube....and crash out to blue screen. Its a PS4 rite of passage lol.
---
Oh and do you know where to get a good gun that's my lvl,I'm lvl 25 and I've been just using black powder rifle and melee guitar,I also have the laser minigun but I don't have any cores rn
---
Are there really that many there? I‚Äôve only ever seen one or two when I check.
---
Edit: Treasure maps are where I usually find the only one a week lol
---
I live in a hurricane prone area and with a active forecast this season i wanted to not miss out. Last season we had no power for 3 weeks.
---
It totally sucks but there are a large number of very real scumbags in this community.
---
OK, but I think I was mistaken, I just watched the video for the first time since I recorded it and I think that there are only 2 people but it's all the same I guess

What high horse are you on right now, kid? You're bashing someone for raising awareness to something. Yeah, I didn't submit a ticket right away, but I still did? I'm trying to see your point here. What is "karma farming", anyway? Some sort of weird term coined by misanthropes who can't be bothered to just be decent?
---
Every day. By the end of the all everyone will be level 100
---
That‚Äôs how it already is. Now they‚Äôll be a higher star status and since the grind is mandatory for it to be past lvl 100 and spend all your cards to just creating new characters won‚Äôt help you. Nobody will lose sleep over a new character that will take no rads or reaches max strength at lvl 10. If someone wants to make a new character and try a new build with the legendary cards they already grinder on one of their characters then let them
---
you and I, m8. 49 as well. that will change in 1 hour üòÇ
---
It sounds like I‚Äôm in good company, then. This makes me feel better, even though I‚Äôm not happy other people have had these experiences.
---
My point exactly, and back when 76 was a survival game(before they made everything even easier than it already was and removed a lot of the survival aspects), I felt open PvP like in the survival mode fit in pretty well. But there were the constant complaints from the PvE geared players playing survival mode and getting destroyed by other players, among with many other things that made it hard to just enjoy. I feel if it was tweaked just a little bit, it would‚Äôve fit really well
---
Enjoyment is entirely subjective. Some of us use less than effective builds and equipment just to make the game harder intentionally. Having a good build in this game means everything just dies and any sense of challenge is just gone.
---
Can't say necessarily about the insta-death but when me and my team did it we went to the water park and killed all but one scorched then stood in a pool when we were low health to let them kill us. Some things cause too much damage so you instantly die, we'd been trying jumping off waterslides into the pools first but that kept instantly killing us. Another option if you have a team of 3 is to get one person to leave and have them kill you and have your remaining teammate revive you, but again you have to be careful with damage so melee works better when you get to low health. Also if you have too much radiation you can't be revived because there's no space for health to regenerate if it's all rads
---
You're describing general play. Bullets will go one direction yet they face another during fast spins or latency; ive seen this countless times and it is completely normal for Fallout 76. Auto laser rifles hitting accurately 100% from 100m is not. Most other guns doing the same is fine.
---
Cheaters will no clip (fly), shoot the walls or ground and kill people, continue to do damage while downed, or render distance attack. Anything less is just perks and your perception of the game; once you know the game is easily cheated it is always on your mind -- but it is extremely rare right now.
---
I always wondered what that threshold is? The other day I joined and the queen had already mutated and only had about 25% life left. I couldn‚Äôt have done too much damage but was still able to loot. I was about level 80 using a Gatling plasma.
---
As others have said, that‚Äôs a card a teammate is sharing with you. It doesn‚Äôt use up special points.
---
I just got to 44. Only played enough to complete challenges &amp; never do NW. I don't think it's possible for me at this pace to get to rank 100, even though I'm playing daily.
---
üò±üò±üò±

Ahh fair makes sense then yeah. Hope everything is ok for you with the hurricanes and you stay safe.

I had to take a week and a bit off to study for exams, I‚Äôm only at 29. Pray for me yall

I don‚Äôt even see a point to locking your house. Can‚Äôt steal shit anyway.

No guide needed. Addictions cap at 5 (for 50% increase in damage) and they are permanent until you cure them. To get addicted get 5-10 of the said chem and just spam eat them, usually takes \~6-8 to get addicted. You can view different addictions using the link below. Choose the ones that affect your playstyle the least. There is no specific build required like with bloodied. Go with the build you like/prefer.  [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Addiction](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Addiction). That's about it. Oh and you can (if you so choose) to take chems you are addicted to, to temporary suppress the negative effects and gain the normal chem effects they provide.
---
Were you in a group with people fighting her? If you are close to any legendary enemy within a group and a group member kills it, you can still loot them.  You don‚Äôt even need to hit them
---
No bugs, just Bethesda XD
---
Marine helmets serums then any weapons/armor thats in my inventory ive picked up.
---
You‚Äôll get used to it. Also eventually there‚Äôs Concentrated Fire perk in Perception that will let you target limbs and head. It will save you a LOT of ammo!
---
This is why we either need free pvp or no pvp
---
I think you may have the wrong idea. They intentionally designed points of conflict into the game and have historically bent over backwards to try to funnel us into those points of conflict. They were almost gleeful about how the players would be shooting each other early on. The game has almost entirely changed since BETA because of player outcry, but it was absolutely a poorly designed murder simulator early on.   
---
The thing they didn't expect is that people would want to work together, and the game is absolutely not designed for that.
---
As for the main/side quests, say you get to the scorchbeast queen, if you‚Äôre at the right level and have the right gear can you take her on and succeed?
---
Future content... maybe
---
Just noticed this yesterday. Played for a bit and my balance showed 200.
---
Opened up the Atomic Store and had my actual balance shown (+1000).
---
Thanks for the post, hopefully this gets addressed soon.
---
It resets in 1h 12 minutes
---
I close the game 15 minutes before, and open up 5 minutes after
---
I can confirm the position (and possibly rotation) of your Camp Device, controls where you spawn but its relative, you don't spawn ON the camp device you spawn in a spot 30-50 meters out, in a certain direction, facing the camp device Its very stable... .
---
OF NOTE however, There are 2 "spawn points" -- there's a "close range fast travel" spot where if you travel from your camp to your camp, you'll hit that one.
---
The second spot is Long distance fast travel spot -- you have to fast travel from further away to see where you land.
---
Either way move your camp device to a new spot and see where you land.
---
Don't forget the community is also what caused the problem to begin with
---
Being at a disadvantage doesn't mean you can't do well. I sometimes do pretty well, too.
---
It just means you're playing the game with less resources than a lot of the competition.
---
Nice word had to look it up. No high horse, I don‚Äôt use marginalized groups as a weapon in an argument or a means to farm karma, just calling you out for grandstanding instead of just submitting a ticket to fix the issue you discovered. Don‚Äôt take it personally you are not even close to being the only person on this app to do stuff like this.
---
Awesome, thanks for the reply.
---
Bless you for pointing this out. Too bad I set up my vendors again yesterday. :)
---
It‚Äôs a feature they said may come to 1st in the future.
---
This.
---
Plus, pandemic makes things weird.
---
House isn't locked, just the "electrical room" where the generator and some junk storage display cases are, and that's more of a role playing "it just makes sense that a generator room would be locked" kinda thing.
---
Might just do away with it if it encourages this nonsense.
---
They made a mention of mods in an interview a month or two ago. Sounded like later this year, but not on the roadmap.
---
You sure you didn‚Äôt just get the raider set from completing &gt;!rose‚Äôs quests?!&lt;
---
not even had a noctural T_T
---
and when i think about it i don't even think i've had a handmade. HMM! 
---
Any number of harpoon guns though
---
Same I got this reply from him and he just gave me the "you just got insulted" note
---
I have three enemies that are scary to me -
---
1 the assaultron like yourself, that beam is just insane. So much worse if you take out their legs and they crawl under something and then hit you with the beam. Just when you think you've killed them they crawl about and hit you.
---
2. Yao Guai - see if they catch you and start one of those stun lock cycles where they just keep repeating the same attack over and over...just crazy.
---
3. Colonel Gutsy - that ridiculous autocannon of theirs that just goes right through armour. I don't know what it is but I'd love to have that insanely over powered gun myself. I helped a public team player run a bunch of legendary stuff in the bog - no lie we fought 2 high level legendary sheepsquatch, 2 legendary scorch beast and a couple other lower ones. I was running melee and survived it all without any real problems...not bloodied or anything but we did fine. I was overloaded so left to walk to the station, bumped into a Colonel gutsy on the way in the open without cover and he shot me down with just a few shots...I hate those guys above pretty much anything.
---
How long is it that you can be out of a private world for before the server resets? I cba having to repower Monongah, take the workshop, then take the ammunition factory, but I also want that score üòÇüòÖ
---
Do I have to place it somewhere special?
---
Bloody Three star swing speed combat knife with serrated mod I am lvl 140 something I can one punch everything at the golf course and a few tougher enemies it‚Äôs fun .. I‚Äôm a shotgun strength build btw only weapon perk I switch it martial artist off and on
---
Just to be safe you should leave the game out of adventure mode and not NW as well. That seemed to cause my only ever issue with auto reset on the challenges.
---
Im level 337 now. 90% of my gameplay is me just playing solo. There is like 3 or 4 events which require a group (or being max-min) so a group isn't required 
---
but with the new public teams if you like the buffs one gives start one up and just keep playing solo. I start building teams (for INT's exp bonus) i usually get players of all levels join and I probably see them a few times in an hours plsy session if I do events or in high traffic areas and I just wave and keep going on with my day.
---
I have been playing more NW since the legendary run came out, and just yesterday a cheater fucked the whole match up.
---
They were running the map, they knew where every player was and they had like 35 kills. It was a match with only 45 total players.
---
There is some salty bitch in the thread downvoting every post. Probably one of the recently banned dupers.
---
Anyone who owns the game gets wastelanders, same with any future dlc. Doesn‚Äôt matter when you buy.
---
I saw someone flying around yesterday. The double XP has been extremely bad about pulling all these assholes out of the woodwork. Prior to the double XP there was almost no one hacking in NW but this weekend has been an absolute mess.
---
That's happened to me three times last week. Really annoying...I tried chasing one down as it flew across the bog but never caught up.
---
There were 4\* items involved with the vault raids when that was open. I think it was just power armor, though, no weapons that I remember. I didn't do much of it, so I could be wrong on that.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt trust it over 5 or so minutes.
---
People have been saying that there has been some discrepancy between their Bethesda account and their steam account recording the values of atoms separately, so any they buy goes on the steam account and any they earn goes on the Bethesda account but there seems to be no way to access them. Could be something relating to that idk.
---
And if people join ignore them. Most teams, unless Events, won‚Äôt even bother being near you.
---
Thank you for info!
---
I haven‚Äôt looked too much into that because at my level I wouldn‚Äôt even attempt anything like that considering I still find it hard to kill things like Assaultrons lol but the wiki says 8 or more people to kill her so I think you would need to join the public teams already there killing her
---
Then assholes could just camp the silo and lock it down.
---
You think you have it bad, at least when you craft the PA piece you can use it.
---
I've been trying to make a solar armor set for a month. I have one piece that is even halfway useful to my build so far. One piece after a month. 
---
They need to remove vault steel.
---
no idea i stayed in NW the whole event made it to almost 80. (and no i was 61 not lvl 1)
---
Agreed. I am only playing NW for the challenges but it is NOT fun. Cheaters and hackers are still a problem.
---
93, really took advantage of the triple xp with lunchboxes. Shout out to the fools who used them at public events for both giving me free buffs and ruining other peoples.
---
so then per your own remarks you dont need the plants. enjoy your walk in the woods.
---
The best way to get mods for any gun, is to buy it from vendors. If you just need it for a one time use. Although not all mods are available. Sometimes you need to serve hop. Or the other option is to scrap the weapon, so there‚Äôs a chance you might unlock a plan for one of the mods. 
---
If you have a laser rifle/pistol, you need to scrap a laser rifle/pistol so MAYBE you‚Äôll get a plan for the mod. It does not mean every time you scrap a weapon you will get a plan. I could go and scrap a gun right now and get a plan, you could go and scrap 20 of them and never get anything. It‚Äôs just a random percentage. 
---
Also, if you have an Ultracite laser gun, you need to scrap an Ultracite laser gun. Makes sense.
---
awwww don't cry lil' cuckold. i love smashing ppl like you in this game. those tears is what i feed from
---
Which word? No, you should realize that you are indeed riding a high horse for no reason right now. And do stuff like what? I'm glad you think the subject is grand enough to grandstand, but I don't think you're really getting the point, so let me help you understand how to raise awareness: in this case, a post was made in ignorance of a ticket system. This led to a person asking if I had submitted a ticket, which in turn educated me on the existence of a system in-place (not every gaming company has them). So I dug it up, submitted a ticket, and posted the link so that other people reading this may submit one if they like. See what happened? Because of this "grandstanding" (or, as most grown-ups call it, "raising awareness") there more tickets being sent instead of just my one ticket had I done it in silence.
---
I don't think it's debatable, the plant based xp is much easier.  At least I still have all the lunchboxes earned so far and can use them sometime down the line.  I justreally hate the minigame of swithcing perk cards, entering cooking stoves, exiting them 4 times, switching perk cards again,  etc.
---
No I was not grouped, just saw the event and thought I would try, 2 queens this weekend with my low level very little damage dealt on my end but got to loot her both times.
---
Not bad for strictly NW. I only play that when there is exclusive rewards.
---
Sometimes I get SBQ loot, sometimes I don‚Äôt, I think I‚Äôm gonna go with the ‚Äúthere when it spawns‚Äù theory.
---
I was so close to cap I couldn't even squeeze the last teddy bear into a display.
---
Now I randomly break stuff down and rebuild it with the contractor perk on just to see if it was something I built before the perk so I can save a touch of budget.
---
I am a bloodied junkie. I am addicted to alcohol, day tripper, formula p, mentats and I think daddy-o (not on right now) as there is no impact to strength, mostly just  impacts to charisma and agility. Day Tripper seems to take like 15+ to get addicted, at least for me.
---
Damn it, thank you though! Suppose it‚Äôs more grind for the repeatable XP.
---
This....worked! Just one hide but hey it‚Äôs the first time I saw one
---
Do you remember what they said specifically about mods? Or have a link to that interview? I don't think I caught that one.
---
It can be either way but single shot is kinda useless
---
Im in a lead spot, no mobs at all.
---
Personnaly I prefer an Acid Extractor to melt all the ore from lucky hole mine. More effective IMO.
---
I've had this problem twice before where I know I got the damage but didn't get to loot. Yet last night in one fight she died so quickly I was certain I wouldn't get anything but I did. Usually it works fine but it sucks wasting the ammo when it doesn't.
---
Ive played about 10 rounds today and only once got killed by a flying cheater.
---
Its defnetly better now.
---
Tip for whitesprings is to get some ghouls to chase you and make sure you get hits off on them all and then lead them to the robots near the resort which will help you finish them off. As long as you've contributed to their death you get XP for killing and save time and ammo. The robots are all pretty high level so they can take a lot before they get destroyed.
---
Dailies reset at 11am CST.  I am in CST myself.  I make sure I log off at 10:45am and don't log back in until 11:15am.  I have not had a single one auto complete (Based on Murphy's law I just screwed myself and it will happen today =).
---
I'm having the same problem with the challenge, I've killed about 10 Cave Cricket's in the past two days and it's not updating, same with the Mirelurk's. The only challenge that seems to be updating is the photo one, I've taken all 20 in the Ash Heap Region and 14 out of 20 in the Forrest Region
---
i want it for the lvl 100 power armor skin
---
The next update should allow to do bigger conversions and change the cap to much more points.
---
Can confirm.  I found new love for this event over the past week.
---
Damn I feel you. I had the exact same experience; in fact it was what prompted me to make my [first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aljiq4/excited_for_first_nuke_launch_ended_up/) ever on Reddit.
---
* Running a bugged build (at the time, don't know about now)
---
* Going through bugged silo quests
---
* Random player joins, doesn't help, camps on the terminal, launches nuke
---
This. I used to have a lead camp and it didn't really yield much. Best thing to do is find acid then run lucky hole mine.
---
Be aware with camp budget that items on display also count towards it apparently. So magazines bobbleheads and items in display cases are taking up your budget too
---
[it‚Äôs pretty vague and not the best article but here it is](https://massivelyop.com/2020/05/28/fallout-76-interview-bethsoft-on-one-wasteland-text-chat-and-other-radioactive-topics/)
---
Instead of radsuit go with broken chinese stealth suit. That thing is OP. You can basicly skip all the defensive perks as nobody will see you if you wear the suit.
---
üëèüèªgood job binxüëèüèª good on you I‚Äôll upvote your original post just like you wanted.
---
Thanks for the reply! I will say a prayer to Todd that he doesn‚Äôt get either of us today
---
Camden park vendor sells Lever Gun plan (2000caps approximately). Level 25 is lowest level for that.
---
Mirelurk kings eat assaultrons for lunch.
---
Why didn‚Äôt you record it?
---
My routine with challenges that have compiled by user feedback here on Reddit;
---
Always quit the game in adventure.
---
Always start a new game session in adventure.
---
Complete your adventure challenges before NW challenges.
---
Don't play until 1230est.
---
Make sure you get off 1130est
---
Do not check the score board or atom store upon first login after reset. Go straight to adventure.
---
I've done this and had 0 issues. Hope it helps someone else!
---
Watch out, these shitty mods ban you for mentioning people's usernames.
---
*high five*
---
I saw a post from a while ago saying on Xbox that having some spare budget can help make projection lamps work or having fewer other light sources. There doesn't seem to be a set answer though because I recently got the nuka cola projection lamp and have tried these tricks and it's still buggy and doesn't always work unfortunately
---
You might wanna read sub rules.
---
Wait! The contractor perk works on your own camp? And saves budget?
---
I thought it was just for workshops?
---
That's actually plausible depending on perks, chems, bobbleheads, and magazines. The thing to be concerned by is being one shotted by something in PA, especially if from a long distance or a weak weapon.
---
The acid will make lead scrap?I had no idea. I dont think I have ever used acid for anything.
---
No mine breaks but a lot more slowly because I crafted it with high intelligence and it was 200% better condition with one of the crafting perks. I also run white knight too which might impact it
---
I love Berserker builds, but they do have their limited uses. For me, fighting the SBQ or nuke running Whitesprings, with a group, is one of the best use cases. I'll run Blocker, Fireproof, Dodgy, Ricochet, Suppressor, and Rad Sponge/Ghoulish (this one requires a team) along with a HazMat Suit. Fun and effective.
---
red rocket truck stop north east of abbies bunker.  Its east of freddies fun house (or whatever).  Should have three lead extractors.
---
Lucky hole mine is the best way to get lead, hands down.
---
Yep nothing has changed. The game will always have hackers but bethesda is so damn slow to react. This person is level 100...
---
Yeah lets just witch hunt people with no evidence! 2000IQ play /s
---
I think it just happens when you create the new team
---
Mad respect to the unarmed fist build, but even madder respect to a level 19 going in fists a blazing
---
So you picked a build that is just as meta? I‚Äôm confused.
---

---
Xp farming and want to maximize xp?
---
All my dreams came true.
---
I'm about the same as you.  As long as I hit all the core (not NW) dailies and weeklies, I should be fine.  I have atoms to spare if I need them.
---
I could do that, but the problem is I'm not sure that there is exact time of resetting dailies/vendors.  
---
Sometimes I saw my vendor caps was reset twice a day, have no idea how that happens.  
---
As an option - it is possible to add a hiddable overlay with quests/vendors and you will have manually click to reset the timer and check time by time whether it is ready...  
---
Also need some more info about reset timer - someone said 20hrs, but I'm not sure according to gameplay...
---
Does it automatically when you create a new public team.
---
No, you get lead ore from lucky hole mine then "smelt" it with acid to make the lead. Trust us on this you will get over 1000 lead from this if you combine it with super duper perk when smelting.
---
That‚Äôs some lame logic there. Your logic was you shouldn‚Äôt have it because it makes it to easy to make cranberry relish and the devs don‚Äôt want that.
---
It‚Äôs already easy. There‚Äôs already lots of ways to get an xp boost. 
---
So your logic is the faulty one. You can only use so much relish per session. You cant stack food xp bonus. And they already let you get an xp bonus from well rested which is literally laying in a bed. And that one lasts 8 hours. 
---
So it‚Äôs not game breaking like your trying to suggest.
---
But it‚Äôs not just about cranberries.
---
Wanted level was a relic of a time when bethesda thought we'd be doing much more adventure PvP. When everyone had slap damage automatically. They have slowly gone away from that model. Being wanted is as useless as assassin weapons now. I used to love building a bounty as high as I could.
---
That's the biggest kicker, there are no NW rewards after 100 so there's absolute no reason he's doing this other than to be an asshole. Last I saw he was 104.
---
When you create a public team, a notification goes out to every player in the session automatically.
---
Just go to fo76map.com and search ‚Äúlead‚Äù. It‚Äôll clear out the other markers and show you where the lead deposits are. That‚Äôs how I found the location for my camp that I‚Äôm happy with.
---
So dumb that you can't just set your nw stats...
---
Also use the excavator power armour when mining lucky hole mine.
---
This is truth
---
Since the game board started in general I've gone from 360 to 450. I'd say double XP accounted for about 30 of those levels.
---
Lol classic!
---
Thanks üòÇ
---
Well could be hard to do as most of those timers you listed are based on your acitivity. Like vendors/scrips/notes reset after 20h you first used them. Dailies are bugged as hell. They reset when they feel like it. There are too many variables that are dependant to the player to make such a site. Also, there is this invention called a watch.
---

---
I main as an archer but swap skills for sbq or other events.
---
Use a broken Chinese stealth armor. You'll keep the rad resist, stealth while sneaking and reduced fall damage.
---
Same. I sometimes miss a quiet Appalachia. No NPCs.
---
Hi all, thanks for the reports. Wanted to let you know that we are actively investigating this right now. I don't have any info beyond that at the moment as we're still looking into what is causing this. Will definitely share more info as soon as I have it.

 &gt; Hi /u/TheModerateTraveller, this sounds like it may be something else. Can you please send me your Support Ticket # in a PM?
---
 &gt;Thanks!
---
With the ability to buy ranks,this auestion is now pointless.
---
Anyway I'm at 60,no god mode,no atoms used,just all challenges so far +xp
---
Not on gamepass but I am on Steam but I am also having this issue
---
Some kind of way to gamble or bet caps with other players would be a lot of fun for me yea
---
That is why we have photomodes.
---
I photographed the first scorchbeast I downed with the assistance of the ASAM at Fort Defiance.
---
I was lucky with everything except the right arm. I settled for a 1 star unyielding arm when I got it.
---
Thanks dude I did not know this
---
I just hit them to get xp and wait for the high levels to finish the job
---
PSA: If you are on PC don't cripple your buildout for the cheat-fest that is NW and simply work on a specialist second character to run that dumpster fire of a mode if you want to.
---
If starting NW you may as well just start with a fresh character anyway.
---
I got Lucky finding me a chainsaw with at the wayward mission.. i actually did enough dmg at lvl 25ish to loot her! I didnt even know then I needed 1000dmg delt to get that sweet loot!
---
Out of curiosity, is WoW the only game you know with multiplayer queueing and matchmaking?
---
You have to do 1000 dmg minimal
---
That's another cheater who was able to get up to level 100 despite receiving probably dozens of reports
---
All vendors rest when the dailys do.....would be ideal
---
Awesome! Didn't think of that one, knew about broken armor though, funny how the brain works, or in my case doesn't. üôÑ
---
There's already a tool to track when dailies reset. It's called a clock. But the game also has an in-game timer for it as well. 
---
Scrip is player-dependent. If you're suggesting that there be an in-game countdown for that, then yes that would be helpful.
---
You should just make a friend - have the place down like 50 personal terminals and just unlock them all - my friend did that for me for one of my atom challenges and I was swarmed with nerds desperate for 5 caps..
---
I think it works to reduce the cost of your turrets and such at least.
---
Not sure about anything else...might be the result of my rebuilding at higher levels, who knows. I've just noticed that rebuilding when I have it on I seem to be able to cram just a little bit more in so I use it just in case.
---
i don't THINK you're right. but i HOPE you are.
---
it happened to me yesterday i had 1040 atoms, i completed a random challenge and got 30. for a few minutes my atoms stayed at 40 for some reason and then updated to 1070 as it should. maybe there is something wrong with servers? idk what the hell bethesda did, but if they cant even track the "premium currency" correctally there is a big problem (again) with bethesda.   
---
Not surprised at all by this.
---
How weird that they were all at full ten
---
Are you deaf?
---
Oooooooo ok I got it now...maybe thats my new thing then...farm the mine and smelt and since i have a steal extractor that works out ...thanx
---
That's pretty sad you think this is just to 'stir shit'. Let me remind you, this is something that has been prevalent *since the beta*.  People brought it up back then, nothing was done about it.  It was also brought up a few times shortly after release, nothing was done about it either.  
---
I understand prioritizing, but it's been pretty much a year and a half now, and Fallout 76 is continually plagued by numerous smaller issues.  Yes, they might be small but they still add up.  If you have enough small issues, you eventually start having a big issue the longer you ignore it and other problems are added to a growing list of things. That's one of Fallout 76's faults that still persists to this day, the same reason the lack of text chat is still a big deal.
---
This isn't some obscene request to overhaul the game you know.  It's asking for subtitles to do their job and transcribe accurately.  This is a feature Bethesda included in their game, so why shouldn't people have the right to point out there are aspects of the game where it's completely unhelpful or doesn't work. But more importantly, if it's so trivial because '99%' has "proper subtitles", what is so complicated that it would take so long for someone to simply edit the subtitles for a correction?
---
She still deals Rad damage on attacks so it can melt low levels
---
It shouldn't. 
---
I read that somewhere once and i've placed many camps since then and it's always north of it. Sometimes it's NE or NW but always north of it
---
Pretty sure fallout 76 is like $10 used at Gamestop, definitely worth that 10.
---
 Just about every game this morning has had a flying cheater or obvious aimbot, super fun experience.
---
That‚Äôs determination
---
People want to complete events asap. You gotta be ready at all times broski.
---
While this makes sense I kinda also like that your nw character is somehow connected to your adventure character. Almost like a continuity thing. Anyway I like that I gain adventure mode xp for it.
---
I dont live in a hurricane zone but i could see my cheap ass getting dragged out on a mandatory evacuation trying to grind my last daily.  "Hold on guys i just need 400 more score to unlock 3 repair kits"
---
You can't really fight her solo, by that I mean both that's it's very hard to solo, and that lots of randos will show up at nine sites to fight.    
---
Either way you don't need to worry bout it, it's easy to finish that quest.    
---
SBQ is the only think you can't easily kill solo as well.
---
I think pve players struggled with survival mode because they essentially were noobs again in a game that they already got good at. But pvp is always hard at first, it takes a little practice to get the hang of the other players movements and patterns. You can't play pvp in the same manner as pve. And the perk card systems biggest flaw is having qol cards compete for space with combat cards. Sure you can kill the strongest mobs in the game with your qol build but that build can't compete with a build that is purely focused on combat. But instead of branching out and tweaking their builds they just built resentment instead.
---
But none of that really mattered because survival mode was 100% optional and avoidable.
---
Right? I mean NOTHING literally NOTHING has been added!
---
Those kind of assholes are very uncommon.
---
So... bad luck this time, but now you know the silo layout so... , don't let this get to you. 
---
The good thing is that a lot of those wanabee are gone with the recent ban wave :)
---
Get yourself a broken chinese stealth suit. You can then basicly skip all those defensive perks. And put them on all the damage related ones and weight reduce ones to combat the lack of carry weight we berserkers have.
---
The advantage to keeping nw tied to your adventure character is that you get adventure mode xp while playing nw. But I guess the xp can be relatively minor. Still, it's nice to have that connection with your adventure character.
---
74, no ranks bought.
---
Level 53. Should hit 54 after todays dailies.

---
36, missed a week or so and had some weekly auto completes.  Pretty sure it's impossible to catch up without a tooooon of grinding which I won't do.  So, that's fun.
---
You will start a fight against other high level players, get destroyed a second after the event ends and loose your junk.
---
I have seen it work in another CAMP with one, so it does function in some capacity... can only assume this is a bug.

Whose crying ? You're the one acting like a little crybaby scrub. Ru mad that people don't support you and the bum loser things you do? You're a pathetic waste of space. Sell your game console and jump off a bridge scumbag lol

The dark matter jetpack skin you unlock at 100 is also broken it apply the regular captain cosmo jetpack paint and not the dark one

Thanks for the tag! We have another fix coming out soon for this that hopefully will address more of these scenarios.
---
Yes this would be the ideal solution, but waiting for Beth to do something is futile
---
Technically, the system has the capacity to go beyond 3.
---
There used to be some legit "4-star" items like having a 3\* Machete with the Sacrificial Blade mod.

10 levels or so.  Maxxed my xp gain and tried to grind a bit since I'm like 10 seasons levels behind, but it was so boring and unrewarding, so I didn't play much.
---
Any of them. You can't enter the elevator leading to the underground base if someone has recently used that site to launch a nuke.
---
When the player-base is doing more to fix problems than the actual developers.
---
Just above huntersville is a nice spot if you build your camp close to the cliff, you get a beautiful view. Plus you can farm huntersville. Most spots will have enemies. Camp does get attacked but I didn't find too often .. there are few on the mountains west of WhiteSpring, probably less enemies is my guess.
---
I‚Äôm an atheist and when I die, the same thing happens to my savefiles.

Food for thought.
---
I will add you as a friend tonight. What times do you normally play?
---
Last time I did free range I was about level 35 or so (45 now thanks to double xp) and I swear the event lasted like 2 minutes because I ran up, thankfully got a tag on 2 legendaries, before they got their heads blown off. And on a separate note the event just ended there we didn‚Äôt get rewards or fail it just ended idk why. That was totally unrelated to the post
---
Thanks, didn't know that!
---
Not if pacifist is enabled.
---
Which enclave under armor?
---
Bloodied for guns, unyeilding for armor, the rest is kinda whatever heh.
---
I work early morning most of the time so usually in evening till like 9 or 10 and days like today I'm up super late playing but I try to get on most days
---
I usually just go to alpha
---
I usually go for alpha since it's closest to my camp, but they're all the same so I doesn't really matter.
---
It took two days to process all the lead ore o got from there because I didn‚Äôt have enough acid. Had to run Camp Fire tales for bloodbug Proboscis several times
---
This.  I add the Grafton gymnasium equipment room to my normal junk route, and neurotically pick up fire extinguishers and plungers everywhere I go.  Glass and plastic are easy, but that rubber cost is tough.
---
Personally shot this bot several times. I do not take insults well apparently
---
how they manage to have so many things broke and when lunch an update they can make more bugs than fix it, I think only the half hour payed guys are working and the janitor is the gamer design there.
---
I blasted my way to 100 and stopped. I play it casually or when there's another event where you can get things. But the exploiters have pushed myself and many other legitimate players away. And I think in a way bethesda doesn't care. PS4 and Xbox are secure environments so they enjoy those areas as safe. Pc crew suffers
---
Np :) Just get yourself a nuke key (you can track one flying around with the terminal inside military wing of the whitesprings bunker) and use codes from this site https://roguetrader.com/#/
---
Thank you for this! The subtitles are shockingly bad in this game.
---
Likewise lmao
---
I'll be on all night tonight mostly
---
you hated fasnacht day because you didn't get level 20 legendary drops?
---
with the real drop at the end of the event, who gives a shit about the sloth?
---
Always Charlie. Probably because its closest to cranberry bog.
---
It was always worth playing at least just to run around and explore the world.    
---
Beth has some questionable money grabbing tendencies that may not make you wanna stick around as long as some of us.
---
Only from the challenges, those from legendary run are applied correctly.
---
The move your camp is the easiest - load in the middle of nowhere - place camp 3-4 times done. You never have to see anyone
---
Hey u/BinxPlaysGames thank you so much for raising awareness to this bug! I've logged this to be addressed.
---
Keep on talking smack over the internet man it really makes you seem tough and intimidating. I'm sure you got bullied in school so this is the type of situation where u feel powerful because you're sitting behind a computer screen. Lmao I feel bad for you. Being a virgin and a miserable jerkoff must be a rough life
---
Yeah, new Vegas style card games in 76 with player gambling would be awesome! Maybe you have to unlock a card table and build it in your camp to do it, that seems solid.
---
Something like Caravan from NV? Sure.
---
As long as just like in NV it can be completely ignored if it's not your thing (no score challenges for "win a hand of caravan" or any such bs)
---
Is anyone not bloodied/junkies?  Like it's so basic I don't even think about it.
---
All I did was make a Reddit post! Haha, definitely drop a ticket if you get a chance and let them know. (: Thanks for being supportive.
---
thats great, happy for you, hope she gives you as many as you need!

 &gt; Everything is supposed to have subtitles so I would count this as a bug.
---
You better work... I dont really think you will be able to reach him.... one week is allot... Im at 57 and never missed one challenge
---
cave crickets dude
---
Ahahaha yes that's a bug. It's a pretty rare one that we've seen reported! If you happen to have any repro steps for this one that would be awesome to see. As far as I know, we haven't seen this in testing.

I thought we had to pass him to get to level 100. If you check out the final box it says "awarded for passing zorbo" or something like that.
---
I have this problem sometimes too. Try jumping and seeing if it breaks the glitch. That‚Äôs what has worked for me
---
You have to lvl up at least once a day and a few times with weekly resets
---
I do the same thing as you except I complete my NW challenge in the middle of adventure challenges.
---
 I will do a few normal challenges then head over to do the NW challenge then go back to adventure and finished the rest of my challenges.
---
 That way I'm not starting or ending with the NW challenge.
---
That dude would have stormed the beaches at Normandy swinging a pipe wrench
---
I mean if you compare fallout 76 (that was lunch as AAA game) to any free to play like never winter, even RuneScape they have a better communication (never winter communication sucks but is better than bethesda) and theyr update don't make more bugs on core mechanics, that's why I think the entire team don't have a clue on what they are doing.I would love to see how dailies broke the perks lol, it's using the same code? lol
---
Always try to make rounds to low level camps and drop a care package. Stims, radaway, rad x, food, plans if I have them on me. 
---
Gotta keep the new player base around for the long run.
---
Yes! Begins July 23.
---
There is also a cool down time in the mine. You have to wait something like 20 hours before mining there again.
---
Prizebot showed up to Sugar Grove. I tried to ignore him while I was fighting robots. The funniest thing was I inadvertently killed him. I shot another robot with the Tesla and it redirected to him mid-sentence. Hilarious.
---
I just YouTube the fallout new Vegas playlist.. best ever imo
---
47, almost 48.
---
so ur a rifle build telling multiple heavy gunners whats worth and not worth. Making ammo at endgame is nothing. I would also like to add, you said it doesnt do dmg, I told you it does, then you ignored that and went on to tell me how making ammo makes it lame?
---
I see your assaultron and raise you an army of cave crickets.
---
Yeah i was also lucky with SS chest. First two Rolls i got unielding with poison resistance  and weapon weight reduction and another one is troubleshooter with radiation resistance and -90weight so perfect roll for silo runs.
---
SLM!

I can't wait until Meat Week is here!!!
---
Weird I have zero problem with Dailies.  Aside from the Ally daily they all reset at 8 pm EST like clockwork.
---
Cycling through poses till you get to the one you need makes them totally useless as RP tools.   
---
Your proposal would be so much better than the current emote system OP, I genuinely hope it happens!
---
Can you DM me your [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net) username and platform you're on?

I usually do the collision course event with noobs. A lot of them try to kill the scorchbeast that appears during that. Good thing it is friendly or else...

Dude... stop wasting atoms on this... atoms are for atomic shop... ranking up is silly, the last week will have extra challenges to help people out.
---
I went from 380  - 461. Good stuff.
---
I believe my SCORE rank went from 55 - 81.
---
For pvp I use Berry Mentats, then Overdrive, then Psychobuff. Works great for pve too so I keep a bunch on me.
---
Lol everyone has a different idea of what ‚Äúnonsense‚Äù is. Some people enjoy messing around and building up a bounty. It can be fun. It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs hurting anyone for me to run around with a 200 cap bounty. I think elaborate camp building and cosmetic obsession is nonsense in a fallout game. But that‚Äôs just me.
---
Lever action
---
Yea ally dailies reset always the same time. But the normal ones reset whenever they like. Sometimes you can do the same quest few times a day, sometimes it takes days to reset one.
---
From about 450-515. Nice.
---
got its been tons at this point, I'm playing on pc f076 for the first time so am completing the challenges fast
---
Yr braindead
---
I lock up my green house and ammo maker. When I had my greenhouse unlocked, it was always picked clean and I wasnt able to harvest anything.
---
yah but playing with pacifist on is like bowling with rails lmao
---
Make sure it is powered. Either directly if it needs it (an attachment with a wire) or that it is near a powered conduit. (The small pointy copper thing you attach wires to). It may just not be close enough to a power source to work.
---
I started at level 100, made it to 167. It's insane how easy it was to level up.
---
Railway, gamma, explosive laser (but just the explosive damage, so it's weak), and melee
---
Try not to lean on vats as a crutch for pvp though. It really shouldn't work on any weapon.
---
The camera always adds a few pounds
---
Lol got my niece a general at level 20. Yesterday she was scared to try so eairly in the world but a little encouragement and good armour she did üëç Great!
---
yah thats why everyone complains, totally not because there a real bugs? Hows the weather from down there boot boy?
---
Wow I only went up about 10 levels, which seems like little compared to you. Good job man!
---
Absolutely agree with the logic, and have done this, but a friendly reminder to those new players once the suit is broken it cannot be removed and re-equipped while broken. Since Berserker builds are underpowered, I tend to go into "Berserker Mode" when it's suited. Sometimes, that happens when my Chinese Stealth Suit breaks and I'm still wearing it (happens a lot, I'm sure you agree) but sometimes I just old fashion HazMat Suit it. A bit of both I'd say :) .
---
I start with Charlie, just because it's closer to my camp.
---
But otherwise, I check my missile silo holotape first, just in case.
---
Why were those players toxic just because they try to kill you it's part of the game right ü§î
---
The best is when they keep coming back for more like they‚Äôre winning
---
Ok.  Just to make sure you realize that you only get 1 per region and the one that you get is random.  You also have to travel to the region to get the dialy.  So you could go in theory a whole week and never get Queen of the Hunt.
---
I ask this because for a long time at 7:01 pm CST I start my rounds to pick up 1 daily per zone.
---
Well, I only ask because I‚Äôve played since Beta and never seen a challenge offering near that many atoms.  The only 1000 I‚Äôve ever seen is the weekly SCORE challenges.
---
Couldn't agree more. Some of the challenges take no time at all, but gain an overseer rank and survive for 30 minutes are completely ruined by aim hackers. It might not be as prevalent as it was but its still happened to me twice this week. BGS needs to address this problem if they're going to continue to make it part of the new features of the game.
---
Went from 19 to 50 on a toon in one day. Not a lot of planning, but had some food buffs and a few lunchboxes. Also helped that this particular character has a decent Int.
---
Pay it forward.
---
I always save my notes he leaves behind.  I've been insulted 7 times so far :(  I must be an easy target
---
Always remember OP = Overdrive then Psycho
---
In that order they stack giving you big boost in damage. Works with any psycho chem (psychobuff / psychotats etc)
---
Just find a camp full of water purifiers.
---
I think someone figured out that it was a bot doing that.
---
You probably get smashed daily by people that are actually good at this game. You feed off imaginary tears because you probably already used up all of your own irl because your life is clearly a pathetic joke lol. If this type of stuff is what you live for it's obvious you're a toxic moron. Once again I implore you to do everyone a favor and jump from the highest bridge or building you can
---
I want a BoS ally and not one that sits on their ass at my camp asking to go fetch this or that. They better come along!
---
so im new i just got the game from xbox game pass, but cant play it bc i dont have room on my C: drive, is the no region ping error something that will be fixed, or am i better off just uninstalling
---
Whichever have the turrets available to do a clean sweep of the area before moving ahead. It's more or less harder to do a nuke run when you don't have turrets to hack. Otherwise it's pretty casual to just hack, clean, turn off and proceed from segment to segment.
---
Probably because everyone is cashing in a word I cannot say and getting them along with caps, plans, booze and junk.....just a guess tho
---
I never understood Caravan in NV so i ignored it.
---
If running Bloodied, you can pack a lot of damage with a Gauss Rifle with low Perception. Here's a recent run-through of that setup -- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAgHsSWDzFI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAgHsSWDzFI) .
---
Think about how many you have. Everyone probably has just as many. Im just starting . Got to lvl 28 or so . I have about 30 regular, almost 40 smaller ones. And I use them all the time.
---
The adrenaline fix !!!
---
There's nothing in the atom shop I want. It's the same old stuff every week with just a different skin.
---
Because they're easy to find, easier to make, and almost worthless to most players?
---
Have you tried a higher total health to stay bloodied? Run with a higher max so you're getting into nerd rage at a higher hp and will have more ability to tank?
---
You never know
---
"only get 1 per region" that is absolutely not true. You can do several of them in the same region. I do all the dailies available to me every single day and i'm 200% sure that is incorrect. And i do know about the travel to the area part, been in this game since launch with ~2000h in game time.
---
Agreed.
---
Yeah, when Todd got up at one of the Bethesda presentations and made comments about how nice everyone is in the game, I didn‚Äôt take it as a compliment but detected some resentment that their Appalachian Thunderdome experiment failed to engender an ongoing PvP bloodbath.
---
I was wondering about this too. Same thing happened to me, I still have 0 cave crickets logged
---
Mostly the people who need them really cant afford 17c per.  As you get up in level you have more than enough.
---
Heck just this morning I sold 10 supers, 36 regular and 20 diluted to the vendor and that was just from farming yesterday.  I keep 5 regular and 10 diluted on me and none in my stash.
---
Try selling them cheaper or vendor bot them.
---
It's ridiculous.  It's a byproduct from rocket fuelled engines for gosh darn sake, and people are willing to ingest it!  Also, ALL murderers, rapists, and drug dealers have admitted taking it. When will this lunacy end?
---
Just another level to the FOMO. They want you logging in everyday thinking you're going to pass him. Keep you logging in everyday and seeing the atomic shop.
---
Fireproof plus popping one of your vaccinations.

---
Ok but did you herd the cows, also I am genuinely sure there is no correlation between sociopathy and not letting people tag a mob? Dont you think your exagerrating a bit? And arnt you suppose to read dorian gray in hs so, the subtleties are probably not missed. But my final question is, did u herd the sheep?
---
&gt; I couldn't find anything about how holotapes were all individual lines of dialogue strung together, and modders asking about how to do it themselves weren't instructed to record it that way. Also, people were able to download the audio files as we would expect - holotape audio all together as it's played on an individual tape.
---
Look at this: https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/DNBostonCommon_BoylstonHolotape.txt
---
This speaker exists in no other context but that one holotape, and all the lines spoken in that holotape are separate lines. I'm sure a modder could do whatever they wanted though; this is just how Bethesda tends to do it.
---
&gt; And all of the other holotapes have subtitles.
---
Yes, that's because the subtitles are linked to the dialogue files, as I've already stated a few times. 
---
&gt; it just seems odd that these are the only exceptions when other long dialogue files exist that are subtitled.
---
I realise I didn't make this as clear as I should have, but the cryptid tales *aren't* dialogue, in the strictest sense of the engine. They're just long sound files, not assigned to speakers or anything. Like the songs on the radio or something. A workaround would be to go back to those files, cut them up, and assign them to speakers.
---
&gt; Another good compromise would be to do like in 3 and have the audio written out in your pip boy to read. If the UI can't handle it, the UI needs to be redesigned. 
---
Fallout 3 didn't do that with holotapes. *Notes* were displayed in the Pip-Boy instead of on paper like in 4, but holotapes were never transcribed that way.
---
they're not underpowered though!
---
Selling helmet for 31 caps I bought rubber from vendors often
---
Not really in regards to why you're asking, but I go to Charlie if it's open. The ghoul's found prior to the elevator can spawn a legendary, and there's often a bobblehead available on the way in.
---
All 3 in a row
---
Well I have been playing for the last year and that has been my experience.  7pm CST they reset.  If I have not done some from the previous day then I may have 2 in the same region but if you do them all you get 1 per region not counting the 1 you get from Foundation and the 1 you get from Crater.
---
After two years, nothing new has really shown up. It's skins for camps, extra buildings, backpacks, weapon skins and PA skins. Half the time it's all broken upon arrival too. Even stuff on the game board is broken. It's all cosmetic stuff to pretend you're playing the Sims, nothing that actually helps me out except repair kits.
---
Drop them at a low level camp
---
I‚Äôve solo launched a couple. Not an expert by any stretch, but if you‚Äôre on PS4, I‚Äôd be happy to help plow the road with my 50 cal and let you do the honors.
---
Yea just vendbot normal stims...you might sneak 20ish caps out of a super.  Everyone still has a backlog from the display glitch it seems.
---
I mean, yeah. Your only friends are captive fish and insects you steal food from
---
EDIT: HOLY SHIT WTF we joined reddit on the same day
---
Excavator as you get +100 carry weight for a full set
---
If i was a PA build then id carry the excavator with me just in case
---
10lbs per chassis but you'd get +90lbs back when you jump into the excavator
---
I know this is the appropriate answer but it‚Äôs so hard to do. No matter what I find myself lugging around a stack of legendaries that wouldnt fit in my stash to be scripted over the next few days. I will never have enough space and I have come to accept that I will alway be judging what to drop or sell to make room for the next thing.
---
The Excavator is the only armor with carry weight bonuses, but the T65 is much better in things Resistences.
---
They seem to be very common loot on NPCs, so it‚Äôs easier now more than ever to build up a stock.  You‚Äôre probably better off cutting your losses and selling them to vendor bots for ~10 apiece...
---
Explosives are your friend in that event. My gauss shotgun has been great at dealing with them.
---
pretty fantastic, I feel like I can see Weatherby S&amp;L off in the distance if I squint
---
Do you know the maximum a vendor bot will buy them for when using grape mentats, hard bargain 3, max charisma?
---
Doesn't a full set of Excavator get a set bonus to Carry Weight? Plus you can add Calibrated Shocks on top of that? That would likely be the most Carry Weight.
---
You're never going to sell them for more than a few caps. With the pharma farmer perk I can collect easily 70+ stimpaks in a couple days of play and sell them at the vendors.
---
Don't let them get to the Brahmin.
---
I found that I could never sell regular stims well for prices above the vendor bot. So with chemist and super duper I make dilutes out of all of mine and then sell for 5 caps a piece. Keep 100 of them in my vendor at all times. Once every few days someone will buy all 100. Gives me a good outlet for all the extra purified water I have and a mild xp gain with creating them.
---
I sell super stims for 20 a piece and they occasionally sell as well. Never had luck with the regular ones though.
---
Excavator w/ calibrated shocks gives you 200lb carry weight so it‚Äôs the best power armor to carry stuff out of all power armors.
---
Thank God it is that way!
---
It does - +100 &amp; +100. I can rock over 420 lbs in my Excavator.
---
Based on a real life bug too, apparently!
---
A full set of Excavator has a special effect that adds 100 lbs of carry wright. No other PA does this. You can get the Callibrated Shocks mod for each leg to add 50 lbs of carry weight each for any PA.
---
yeah I'm still doing underground camps and patting myself on the back, like an overly confident mole
---
I thought so. Considering axing the T65 and going for Secret Service armor instead. Since I have the torso and jet pack.
---
Thx
---
I don‚Äôt think it does but empath in a public team with strange in numbers is effectively better than lone wanderer. I don‚Äôt ever plan to be off a public team again unless I‚Äôm farming a private server. The benefits are just too good.
---
Getting to 50 came quick for me! Almost made it to 50 on the first evening of it.
---
Dailies/repeatables reset always at 1am or 2am cest - depends on the quest. Vendors (scrip,caps,GB) reset 20 hours after your first transaction. Ally quests reset 24 h after you finished the quest
---
Sell them extra to the vendor. Everyone has lots. Or run around Flatwoods and stick them in mail boxes so lowbies can find them.
---
Don't bite the hand that feeds.
---
oh yah forgot to ask, r u low level? Cause the brahmin die if the sheepsquatch smacks it once and you lose the ability to get good rewards if any of the cows die. So while I never read it in hs, i am pretty sure dorian gray deals with selfish desire, sells his soul for eternal youth type shit. Aint asking people to let u get a hit at the risk of the event is as selfish if not more selfish then the guy finishing the event? Also killing the cows is exp. Simple solution tho, tons of genuinely antisocial players who are scared of human jnteraction or fed up play alone, on private servers, so maybe thats a route for you. Im more of a captain nemo kinda guy tho
---
No, just go play the drums or turn the fire spits when the event beggins, and do not let go until the event ends.
---
Has no one mentioned scorchbeasts yet or the terrifying whomph of wings and distant "Reeeeeee!" As they hunt you down?
---
17c is too high.
---
Might move a few at 10c, but 5c should be the most you charge for "base Chems" (Non Supers, Regular Buffout, Psycho, and Mentats, etc). 1c or 2c for Diluteds. 10-20c for "special" Chems (Radshield, Bufftats, Psychobuff, X-Cell, etc)
---
Considering 3% of the fanbase seems to understand caravan i would go with something much simpler
---
I suspect Bethesda programmers come up with Insult Bot comments when they‚Äôre done reading the boards after a bad patch.
---
That really is a totally valid point. No need to be a complete jerk. I don't have voice on so I can totally privately rant.
---
[https://bethesda.net/community/topic/358248/meat-week-faq-guide-feedback-thread?language%5B%5D=en](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/358248/meat-week-faq-guide-feedback-thread?language%5B%5D=en) Meats used in the event are unique ones that are only available during the meat week.
---
With the right legendary effects, your carry weight in normal armour completely outclasses PA
---
Last time i used PA was back in vault 94, and only due to how much more tanky i was able to be
---
You don't think Troubleshooter's is a valuable effect? Have you never done a silo run or the encryptid event?
---
Mine hasn't. I'm supposed to be putting out around 1500 dmg but yet most things are taking 3-4 shots unless I use VATS and then it smashes them %100 of the time. IF it actually hits them! I got right up into a muties face and missed 3 VATS shots in a row. And countless times after that I would just miss. I'm so gutted i had been grinding for this gun for weeks.
---
Too bad you are herbivore as the pepperoni roll from riding shot gun is amazing for carry weight. I start my daily grind with that quest and it gives me +65 carry weight for an hour (carnivore and strange in numbers). Maybe someone knows of a plant food that is similar.
---
I keep 50 on me
---
look up ps4 rebuild database, Data cache, etc. I have an older ps4 (4+ years) this helped me.
---
I don't remember. I only have 2 charisma anyway but I think it might have been 9 caps not sure though, it's a long time since I've used HB and mentats while selling.
---
Not perks as an expert shotgun I mean like legendary perks
---
17 is way too much. I think around 10 is what you can get from vendors if you buff your charisma or run full Unyielding.
---
Personally, I'd just dump them on a vendor bot and use the space for something more valuable as you pick up a lot of them just being out there exploring. :)
---
If u read have the posts it because people have and rng. I‚Äôm not saying there are not bugs.
---
20%
---
I did finish her quests, but I never changed into Raider gear... I just finished the BoS "Belly of the Beast" Quest, and had on Excavator gear... Log in today, and it's Raider gear.
---
That‚Äôs the point. There needs to be ‚Äúlesser‚Äù effects in the pool. That‚Äôs like saying we need to drop all under powered weapons so u only get top tier weapons.
---
Go to public events such as line in sand, radiation rumble or guided meditation when there are high level players there and shoot the enemies a bit so you'll get experience. Some people might think it's mooching but more enemies spawning at these events is always good which an extra player will help with.
---
Thank you for all the replies! I guess just selling them to NPCs will be the easiest to do. Also, i probably should have mentioned this in my description, but i‚Äôm sitting on a stash of 350+ stimpaks haha. Guess they aren‚Äôt as profitable as I thought
---
I think last I checked, it was at 36.  I might be a bit away from 37.  Been doing other projects as well, so on and off towards it.

Flashlight is funny, nightlight is funnier.

---
I hate these jerks so much. How can they be so pathetic?
---
Every day I gain more than I use and I split them into Dilute versions most of the time too.    
---
If you want to sell them, sell them at Vendbot price of 10 caps max. Lower doesn't make sense as people will buy them all off you to make a profit which you could have yourself.
---
When?
---
I had my just free fire at them vats is kinda unreliable right now
---
Weapons I loot off the super mutants from my xp/legendary run from Huntersville to West tek, then satellite array with a pit stop by Blackwater Mine before selling to the Whitespring vendor bot. With a full unyielding set, 9 charisma, hard bargain 3 and maybe a Grape Mentats...it's really easy to hit 1400.
---
33%vats hit or 40% bash damage makes them "magic" and serviceable without perks.
---
I have a lvl 15 db with 33vats and it still one shots lvl 62 ghouls.
---
I wish we could have Buddy the robot from Fallout 4 to pal around with...

yo but shouldnt u guys have an anti cheat that works? Why r u leaving it up to the playerbase to record their expierence? The average player doesnt record their gameplay 24/7 so unless its a planned occurarance, how would someone who doesnt record gameplay report someone? How would they get the video proof that seems to be needed for you guys to accept a glitch happening or a hacker existing?
---
see, i agree with you, but using TS as an example makes you look like a fool. many players have a full set of troubleshooter's armor for when Encrypted pops up, or for doing silo runs. shoulda said Nocturnal or something.

Game has flaws for people that are RG colour blind as well. Like snapping objects and the nuke zones in NW. Needs a way to adust the hud like in fo4.
---
I've had the same results OP. It is absolutely disheartening when this is the result of having used the in game report system, taking your time to take and upload video evidence, and yet you still see them in the game.   
---
u/CM_PipBoy the message to those of us who do this and still see these people in game is that Bethesda does not care that they are doing this. Not just in Nuclear Winter either.   
---
I don't know what the internal decision making looks like for Bethesda, but something really needs to change if it's going to improve the quality of life in game for PC players. Running into people who are hacking, using hacked weapons, flaunting dev room items, exploiting events with tents, duping etc.. should be the exception in play, but they are not. The exception is playing a session where you don't see at least one of these things in play.   
---
I cannot articulate well enough how frustrating it is as a player to report these people through the in game system just to end up seeing them at it again, even if you have blocked them.
---
You get to a point where you have to decide what¬¥s important for you to keep. I never need to stock up on stimpacks/radaway/chems etc. i always have a lot from naturally playing the game and often end up with 30 plus of each, then i hunt down a low level and give it to him.  Knowing if i need some in excess of what i gather naturally i can just make one run at Morgantown airport or the hospital in Charleston. After getting rid of almost all aid items except max 10 of each chem/aid (and not even all of them) I looked at my ammo. Decided enogh is enough and i carry it all with me with 2\* bandoleer perk and 1\* batteries included perk and i have over 120.000 ammo in total. Then look at my weapons and armor. Yes sometimes i can have excess weapons if i've done a lot of legendary farming. But then i just leave the one star legendaries. And why do you walk to your camp if you have fallout 1st. why don't you just plop down your survival tent. or walk to the nearest workbench or train station? You need to work with what you got.
---
Played for about 8 hours yesterday and went from 120 to 131, used lunch boxes and joined a build team, double XP weekends are awesome!
---
Lol you where 55 before the event? You must live in the game
---
Happens to me all the time when I do that event. I'm a melee build and I have to run to the boss. It ends up being to late because some inconsiderate jerk with a minigun killed it. I would love the middle finger emote in those situations. I hope Bethesda nerfs certain weapons and perks or at least buff legendary enemies so it's harder to kill in a few seconds.
---
this!
---
Isn't it this weekend and will probably only be Friday to Sunday, not a whole week?
---
Having everything reset at the same time as the dailies would make perfect sense, so of course they'll never do it.
---
Only went up by about 15 levels with my main account.  I use like...  2 accounts with this game, along with the fact I have 2 copies of the game &amp; 2 PS4s.
---
Agree _except for_ the revive 2 players and to a lesser extent the 'level up' challenge. Placing CAMPs, using stims, unlocking a safe, even killing creatures are fairly trivial tasks that can be completed in a single NW round, maybe 2 or 3 max. But leveling up in NW takes several rounds, even during Double XP weekends and it's been months since I've revived another player (mostly because I largely solo in NW) and the last couple of times I tried team play specifically to complete the challenge I went several rounds without ever getting the opportunity to stim anyone and the two times I even attempted to I got sniped for my trouble.
---
My friend and I jumped off a bus into half water half land at Charlestone near the spawn entry point. It took a few goes but it got done. Basically jump off the bus at the top and land both in the water and on land. I did it with no armour on so no buffs helping arrest the fall. It is a pain in the butt to do
---
Checked my stash, and it's not there, it's just gone. I did finish the BoS "Belly of the Beast" quest before I logged off yesterday... the only thing I can think is that I exited my gear next to another suit, I have a bad habit of pressing 'E' instead of 'W' and exiting by accident :/
---
You still get mutations through serums when using starched genes.
---
If the water is a tad too deep it's instant death, so be sure you're not swimming.
---
This is why I only have 4/5 pieces.  My last piece I have to replace is unyielding powered sentinel heavy leather. I dont think I am going to get better than that any time soon
---
Vats does seem majorly bugged with this gun. You pretty much have to enter vats, exit vats, enter it again, and then shoot. Sucks for those dogs cause usually you can‚Äôt vats target them anyway while they‚Äôre underneath. But I find one or two shots right at the Brahmin without vats tends to kill the dogs.
---
Yessir, also a 15% less damage while blocking on a piece of armor also counts as well.
---
Pvp is dead in this game
---
Yeah probably, I don't keep up with stuff well enough
---
Easy to say with a double XP + 4 lauchboxes weekend.... see how long it takes tomorow.
---
They're probably thinking to themselves, "If I don't one-shot the boss someone else will," it's a cycle, don't get dragged in yourself.
---
Make sure you use super duper
---
Wait? You have all the weight reduction perks and still can¬¥t manage it? HOW? i only have bandoleer and batteries included.
---
Quad, 33% VATs, 15% Crit would be my godroll DB (i'll pay 20k caps on PC if anyone has one :-P )
---
Is your CAMP in a good spot? I have a pretty successful stimpak business right across the water from Wayward. I sell diluted for 10c, stims for 18c, and supers for 25c. I base my prices on supply and demand. I used to sell them for less but couldn't keep them in stocks. Im on Xbox if that matters.
---
Everyone of us do this event for the rare plans, but the losing the final legendary is enfuriating
---
My understanding was that she was immune to the explosive legendary effect (i.e. TSE weapons would just be 2 shot) not immune to all explosives. Unless I read it incorrectly.
---
That is quite strange.
---
I feel your pain. My wife and I tried to do our first silo run, and it failed. We honestly don't even know what happened - I feel like a timer of some sort ran out, and my wife believes that someone launched from the silo before us. Either way, it was pretty frustrating/disheartening.
---
On top of it, a few days later my wife got the trophy for launching a nuke - she was on a public group and one of the others in that group did the launch. She's a little frustrated that she has the trophy but didn't actually complete it.
---
A few days after that, the same thing happened to me. I'm more "meh" about the whole thing,  but it is a little weird to get credit for something that you had nothing to do with. I was not even on an "Events" group, but instead a "Building" group.
---
I would call us somewhere between filthy casual and serious player. We're somewhat new (Wastelands already existed when we started), and we're both level 120-something right now. I'm only just now starting to try to build a set of SS armor, and only a few weeks ago did I start messing with mutations and attempting a "bloodied" build.

My CAMP is right on the Snake near Whitesprings

So have I, but I'm pretty sure it was near Harper's Ferry.  My first character to get over 50 was a melee build.  
---
These days I can solo the queen. The bog standard scorchbeasts don't make me flinch, even in packs.
---
if you dont know what to do, a safe bet is to play some drums or turn a spit roaster, as those add continuous points to the point that the meter hardly moves down.
---
but generally, you want to collect "greens" (big plants), get meat by killing critters, putting out random grass fires, and cleaning Chally's poop.

Four Leaf Clover for instant crit bar in vats
---
Enforcer for broken limbs and SB wings
---
Shottys benefit from having each pellet able to activate a perk with chance on hit.  1 round usually breaks a limb or give you a crit bar.  
---
Grim Reaper sprint is great for AP refresh when combined with Four Leaf clover.  Obviously the damage boosting perks too.  Shotgunner/ Bloody mess
---
Ofcourse not. Obvious bug. Go make an bug report in the official game site.
---
Same, it was plain as day
---
Just do your dailies from Thursday to Monday and you're good to go.
---
I saved this image to my desktop and have been checking it for dates. Looking now it seems the double score is actually for 5 days. That's quite a weekend.
---

i crouched and punched em. that worked for me.
---
I use my Tesla until the end of the event. The arc cooks everything except the Brahmin.
---
I got from level 41 to 94! Of course I played non-stop since Friday morning just doing events.
---
I would like this too but takes too much programming probably. they cant fix perks, auto completeting challenged or glitches in the game from beta so its highly unlikely they would do something. Plus pc is dead. They banned bare veteren pc players, to the point trading on the pc subreddit is almost non existant. Literally from dozens to 1-2 a day overbight. So without an active vendor base, no point in adding the qol of perk. Pc gamers will never be priority anymore and since fo76 is not a priority, you singing into the wind brother.
---
That sucks, I didn't know combat rifle skins didn't apply to the fixer. Makes no sense since they share all other mods, they should share paints too.
---
I've managed to get a good few levels past my target before this week's reset,  I've had a good run at it and I should hit 67 by tomorrow. Been really pleased with the progress so I had a night off on Sunday after completing the dailies.
---
Does have pitfalls mind you, I've nearly totally exhausted my ammo supplies and I'm out of acid to smelt down the lead ore so a bit of resource farming is the task for tonight.
---
That must really suck. :/ Maybe use the ticket system and drom them a line? Colorblind mode is pretty much a standard these days anyway, and a AAA title like Fallout should definitely have that.
---
You're one of us now!
---
When you finish her quests you get a full set of raider power armor as a reward. Sounds like you didn‚Äôt notice until now. No idea what happened to your excavator. Could be in your stash maybe.
---
No, but sniffing paint is trading low right now, so I‚Äôd invest in that before it peaks again.
---
Actualy you cant just blueprint it. Takes like 3 different buttons at once and switching your view from a blueprintable item to the ammo machine
---
They are a lot more common than they used to be. I usually drop them for new players. I got tired of transferring them to mules.
---
You suck at being a silent secret
---
And then someone with a tse shotgun would blow your base away and you would waste all of your precious junk to repair it
---
Over the weekend I've just made a point of not looting anything but ammo and legendaries, and even some of those I've left, as I know the limits are very harsh and inventory management is a giant ballache at times and with it being double xp I didn't want to waste any time with that. I've no idea how people with just one character cope. Normally I chop and change when limits are hit but, again for the xp, I've stick to one toon over the weekend and it really has shown how quickly those limits are up.
---
Sometimes it works, but not always
---
Homies just asking why they dont talk to people anymore? You very confidently said cause they complaining bout first roll? They dont reply to anything else either even when its a legitmate concern?
---
This. I started using it a few days ago for the first time and I just couldn't play without it anymore.
---
nah fuck it, everyone has to learn mechanics at some point. Its part of the game
---
üò≠
---
I'm 2 spaces ahead of him, maybe I can make a bit more distance today.
---
Seems a little pricy but I also have no need to ever buy stims
---
What are the best stats for SS armor?
---
That wouldn't be an issue to be honest I usually try to do like a quick scrap run together enough lead and steel and maybe some Plastics to get some ammo for whatever I'm planning to do that day so I'll just work that into being one of my daily routines of going down there and grabbing whatever lead ore I can and then waiting a day before it resets
---
it's like highlander
---
Because there are plenty of people who report people simply cus they killed them and they can't handle that. Doesn't mean they cheated in any way.
---
Video Proof on the other hand is a simple case of see and ban. 
---
Also go easy on the poor Community Manager, the person is just trying to do his damn job, he's not in charge of anything development wise and I highly doubt they have any say, the most they can do is forward it so that the higher-ups can go "Pssht yeah right" and disregard what they said.
---
We all have our problems with F76 and/or Bethesda and sometimes the CM's take the brunt of it, but you're out of line.
---
Wanted is wanted if you need the challenge go for it. It's a swift lesson about not stealing from other players.
---
I'm not saying this is facts but I'm pretty certain the whole gun is broken. 1500 damage is enough to one shot muties and I'm just tickling them with it. I swear this game is like an unhappy marriage for me. Just putting up with all the bullshit for the far and few between good times.
---
You‚Äôre right, I kinda figured that if they did the crime they would pay the price.
---
More effort than some players put in. I was the second player to the event recently and the scavengers were all nearly dead. I killed all the ghouls and defended the last scavenger pretty desperately and then more players showed up. We get a handle on things and the event starter guy (level 150) just goes around looting piles while no ore has been collected and the last survivor is nearly dead. I go to try and collect ore to maybe get level 1 and the scavenger is killed. There were ten of us. Event starter didn't seem to even notice we'd failed. Seriously considered switching pacifist mode off and wrecking him for all the junk he'd been collecting. But its just a game, and it wasn't that big of a deal really. I just wish you could rely on people more
---
SMG is very fun to use, I rocked one for a little while myself.  I like to keep a weapon I have no perks for, thought this shotty might be the perfect middle ground :)
---
I have one of those and they are awesome. Especially considering the fire rate.
---
The main event for Meat Week is an easy, fun event like Fasnacht.  There are a variety of easy things to do during this main event.  The toughest things are the preliminary events where you have to kill animal hordes to be rewarded with a special meat used in the main event (and having a lot of that special meat plays a big part in getting the best rewards). I don‚Äôt want to give away too much here, but that should sum it up.
---
Not sure what I watched. One player was ranked 5 and the other was 97. Did they win the match? Cuts out before you know they both run.
---
Could it be a visual bug with spectating?
---
I just have a player who is deduced to NW
---
yes, is what I always try to do
---
Are you using a ‚Äúmagic‚Äù variant of the gun? My regular ones are alright, but my magic variants are OP when used in vats. Especially in the way I mentioned above.
---
Wow that‚Äôs brutal, try server hopping every two or three purchases. I used to dump all scrips on one server, sometimes the results were absolutely shiit. After I started server hopping it‚Äôs better/more mixed. Some servers are very bugged and would give me five ‚Äò40% bashing‚Äô garbage in a row. Server hopping mitigates that.
---
Dumb super newbie question but how do I update my vault-tec card mine still says level 1.
---
My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.
---
I dont really know. I honestly sell many stimpaks for the prices I said. I notice most that buy them are levels over 50 and normally buy me out of everything all at once but lower levels buy them too little at a time. I started baseing my pricing by how much I could sell a certain chem to a robot vendor with my 15 charisma character then just added 1 or 2 caps and go from there. I keep a log of all my pricing too. I can sell a standard stimpak to a robot vendor for 10caps. If supply and demand brings me down that low ill stop selling to the public and just sell to the robots.
---
Nope i do it all the time as a 200 plus player. I don‚Äôt take their junk though unless i see them doing something that deserves it like breaking into a players house myself. since it can be pretty easy to accidentally become wanted especially when just learning how the game works.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm game man. Could you wait an hour by any chance?
---
I love berserker builds, so don't get me wrong, but compared to a Bloodied/Unyielding build (even rifle, especially melee) they are underpowered. That said, your build listed here for rifle will more than get the job done and requires virtually zero maintenance.
---
Sounds like its in the pipeline and prepping for release, but isbt going to be out likely until next year. Based on timeline of what has occurred and what they are referincing.
---
i gave mine the custom name 2x4 (as in, Two by Four. cuz it's DOUBLE barrel times QUAD effect), and I jokingly call it the board to my friends lol
---
And if you plan to use a longbow instead of a crossbow, my experience has been that they are really bad in vats because vats wont lead targets. Idk if this has been fixed tho.
---
Sure, just hmu when you're available
---
You‚Äôll get there. Just keeping reading posts here and googling stuff you don‚Äôt understand. Tbh I was about lvl 120 before everything really started clicking for me
---
I‚Äôll take a low level bounty, I usually drop some stims or good alcohol like hard lemonade or rad ant lager in their loot bag and I usually wait for them to respawn before I leave so no one can take their scrap.
---
I'm Not maxed on Charisma but i get about 10 Caps per Stim. 4 Charisma (no Unyielding), Shielded Casual Armor, Hard Bargainx3, and Grape Mentats.
---
It's tough to have a clear answer and could depend on your build (sneak/melee/range). However, diminishing returns on DR/ER is correct. Higher DR/ER will always reduce damage, it's just that at a certain point it is wiser to invest in % damage reduction perks or just go for perks that increase damage.
---
Here's my personal example. I used to have barbarian and my DR would be 400 with it. I definitely felt tanky. After reading about diminishing returns just like you have, I switched barbarian with rank 3 Blocker. This is 45% damage reduction from melee, but my DR went down to 320. IMO, blocker is better. I am a bloodied melee, so I'm usually getting hit by melee attacks. The 320 DR still feels plenty tanky for ranged shots, and the blocker perk seems to make a big difference if high level bloated ghouls or whatever come swinging at me.
---
Or instead of blocker, you could perk in to something that would increase your damage. Think of it like this. Certain big attacks from high level enemies will always hurt you - is it worth taking 5 less damage or maybe dealing 5% more damage? This game's easy and flexible enough that both answers are viable.
---
I‚Äôm not nice enough for that lol
---
Came looking for a rant, none to be found. Shame on you..

---
No Stealth suit,No Addictions,No Armor.
---
I have no idea it's a two shot for 25 and reload speed 15. Prime receiver. And all the perks to buff the dmg. What exactly is a magic variant?
---
They're not invulnerable. The Brahmin have oversized hitboxes so you are essentially hitting the brahmin instead of the dogs. Same reason you can't use VATS, because the dog is technically behind an object. You need to use explosive weapons or melee, or try bounce a tesla rifle into it.
---
Kill them. No mercy.
---
There was a level 20 who was wanted in my vicinity not too long ago. I figured he'd appreciate someone taking care of his "bounty." 
---
So, I stalked him for a few minutes and cornered him in that auto-repair shop north of the Airport. 
---
Turns out, he had a mic &amp; was hoping to "negotiate." 
---
I actually appreciated his candor. I turned on my mic, just let him know I was there to get rid of his bounty &amp; wasn't interested in his junk. So, I killed him - also dropped a care package of stims, food and some ammo, guarded his junk until he respawned and wished him the best of luck.
---
Nocturnal armor really need adjusting. Maybe have it increase stats at night instead of DR. Nocturnal weapons are actually pretty kickass at night. Not quite bloodied damage but I think they match junkies. There just garbage the other half the day lol.
---
Awesome! Not sure how it will work since we can‚Äôt be a team and kill each other. So maybe just keep our fingers crossed, join a match at the same time, spawn at a pre arranged spot, and let the fisticuffs commence?
---
No, no they wouldn‚Äôt
---
You didn't buy the raider waster gear set did you? Because if you apply that paint to excavator armor it shows as raider waster armor.
---
Two shot FFR %25 reload speed %15 *
---
Put all of the mods that decrease range on the shotty and it should bring the range into the negatives making it a 95% chance to hit at any range in vats
---
Like u/manson_ew2 said, I've had it on a schedule where it resets middle of the day, so I can play in the morning &amp; then again in the evening. Been camping last several days &amp; it's out of kilter now
---
If you shift it far enough you sit on the bricks but your almost in the fire lol
---
Go into photomode and it's under the Vault border-type catagory.
---
Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but I‚Äôm *pretty* sure there‚Äôs at least one or two things that need fixing more than a single stash box.
---
As a fellow not great player let me share my strategy... a perk card that makes stimpacks nearly weightless, and 100 stimpacks.
---
Sometime in August
---
Realistically the ammo cost isnt that bad as you dont have to waste acid, its just lead and steel both very easy materials. Lucky hole and west tel and you should have plenty of 2mm
---
Bounties are bounties. This is the way.
---
What platform?
---
Whenever I do it on Xbox I throw up a post on XBL's "Looking for Group" that says "Imposter Encryptid start at xx:15 - join off profile" - leave the Xs, swap the numbers to the minute start time you want. They will come. Also, trigger the Event but don't START it, let's your server know it's available, but gives people (on the server and from XBL) to join you and show up.
---
I usually get about 8-15 participants.
---
This is the way
---
just depends on the server. I saw it run 3 times this weekend.
---
Fair enough.
---
3 star bloodied crossbow is a great weapon fir a stealth archer in pvp
---
they need to make it such events more often, made me feel some kind of way when I‚Äôm not playing... couldn‚Äôt care less about legendary run but double xp made run around like crazy and kill every high level creature
---
It's a sad attempt from angry dupers to get revenge on the community instead of taking responsibility for their actions. When the ban wave was going on, they were crying in cheating discords about how "60-80%" of "loyal veteran players" were being mercilessly banned by big bad evil bethesda "for no reason". Now they found another exploit, so they're trying to spread it to as many unknowing people as possible to either prevent future bans or take innocent players down with them
---
Blocker, Dodgy, or Serendipity. If you have armor with Action Point refresh or Action Boy/Girl that can offset the AP cost for Dodgy. Serendipity for low HP builds. Ghoulish and Born Survivor are also ones I like to test out.
---
Rank 1 of Born Survivor works under 20% HP. It basically tries to Auto Stim me all the time. Carry a bunch of diluted Stimpacks.
---
I got destroyed in 2/3 of the game I played yesterday by hackers. One guy had a lever action firing practically nonstop through all of the surroundings, and the other guy had pinpoint accuracy with an auto laser; both of them could see everyone in the map and they usually end up killing most everybody.
---
I ran into him around the white springs bunker and i couldnt hear what he said cus my friend was talking :(
---
Quad is awsome on dB! Have one with limb damage and I just stored my junkies for it
---
I thought it took up no budget since it's not intended to be buildable?
---
Congrats from one handgun main to another! Not many of us out there, let alone your level, impressive!
---
One of my favorite parts about being a handgu main, even though hard to find, they are usually cheap to trade for. I  temporarily speced bloodied from junkies to speed up leveling until legendary perks come out. Was able to  pickup a b5025 10mm for a 1* quad tesla and a jffr Fr gatling gun. Cant complain about that!
---
go to whitesprings and watoga, claim workshops, jump on events
---
Yeah it‚Äôs not ‚Äúmagic‚Äù. Magic weapons describes this weird thing that‚Äôs happening with fast rate of fire weapons such as the gauss minigun and some others, but also includes the gauss shotgun. You want to look for one with any one of these prefixes: Instigating, junkies, 33% vats increase, bashing damage, or limb damage. Any one of those bugs out the gun when used in vats and makes it a lot stronger. You‚Äôll start seeing glitchy looking numbers like a digital clock that can‚Äôt figure out what time it‚Äôs trying to show, and that melts most enemies
---
I find Meat Week to be much more chaotic than Fasnacht. But that also makes it more challenging and fun.
---
If you're just looking for a good roll to get you started, then you can go for the 2\* weapons to start with, you can get 20 2\* rolls for 1000 scrip or 10 3\* (The third star aka the minor trait on a legendary isn't as important as the prefix and major trait).  
---
As far as armour rolls go, I wouldn't waste my scrip on it,  get through the wastelanders questline asap and start earning bullion for the SS armour.
---
So I'm a new player, quick question, what does double xp and lunchboxes have to do with reaching the end of the legendary run? I thought the only way to get score was daily and weekly challenges.
---
I got booted when I first tried to launch a nuke. Was doing a solo run at level 50. I was horrible unprepared and completely out of supplies. Once I was finally ready to launch.. that's when it happened. Got the boot. I waited an entire year before I tried again. This was before player vending was a thing so farming caps was a bit of a pain in the ass as well. I couldn't just spend my way out of my lack of supplies. 
---
I completely empathize with you. It's so disappointing to make it that far and then have it snatched from you. I couldn't even play fallout for a few weeks. Haha.
---
Lool. I love the last sentence of this comment.
---
I mean it's sad but true, but also funny.
---
My problem is I have "wienie baby" mode on because the "PvP" in this game is a joke and I don't want to have to deal with accidentally clipping someone while doing an event and having them blap me because I "slapped them like it's some sort of mideval honor duel"
---
I think that you should still be able to attack Wanted players even with "wienie baby" mode on.
---
Guess I'll have to find someone to come to a private server or join someone on one and work out trading "kill wanted players" kills by lockpicking a water pump or something if I want to get the atoms for that"
---
It could be a good idea to have good with salt perk maxed out and ready to go
---
We run it mostly on private servers to avoid waiting times, i dont do sbq anymore except someone else launches i go to help
---
oh I misread and thought normal ones were OK and legendary run was messed up.  Very odd....
---
But you can server hop.  It's not 100% as there are some worlds where you can't pick the deposits, but just server hop again and you should be good.
---
One run at Luck Hole Mine nets me about 440 lead ore which, with Super Duper, smelts to 1250 lead scrap.  
---
I can get it up to 1500 if I also pick the lead nodes on the mountain side near Dent and Sons.  There are two locations on the base of the mountains to the West and one on the mountain to the North East.  It gets me to about 500 lead ore.
---
I also notice a lead cluster in the middle of the Ash Heap when doing the Mole Miner Treasure Hunter event a while back.  But I need to find it again.
---
Also, you get Acid from Yao Gui, Cave Crickets (Tanagra Town), Snallygasters, Bloodbugs etc.  You also can take over workshops with Acid nodes.   Tanagra Town is nice because you can server hop and get about 40 acid per run.
---
You can get a lot of acid from Campfire Tales and the waves of Bloodbugs.  Being on a team helps because you can loot even the ones you don't kill.  The trick here is to keep it going for as long as possible which is hard to do on a public server because most are after the rewards and not the acid.
---
It's over, but I was farming beeswax at Fachnact.  It brakes down into acid.  Beeswax only appears during the event.  I ended up with about 12K of acid just from this event alone from sever hopping, etc.
---
Finally, there are workshops that have acid nodes.  Take them over and set up acid extractors.  You can set your CAMP down on an Acid node, but be aware that these are popular locations and you may find a lot of worlds where your CAMP can't be placed.
---
Yeah I sent in a bug report about this one too. Thought it looked strange, then I went to crouch and noticed the armor skin was floating above me.
---
Sad. I hope bethesda becomes even more ruthless with bans
---
&gt; Robotics Expert: Equipping Robotics Expert no longer prevents players from trading with Vendor bots.
---
That's hilarious, I didn't even know that was a thing. It comes close to actually making sense, like if the robots are unwilling to deal with you because you know too much about them, sort of like a person going around mumbling under their breath about the taste of human flesh. It's a stretch but it almost works
---
You should be fine if you keep up on it. With the extra SCORE event coming up you'll be able to catch up a bit.
---
Well considering I was about level 5 at the time id say, yeah they were toxic griefers.  I dont remember their levels but I do know they were both over level 50.
---
I normally run it all the time, but I was using the XP weekend to level up my alt. She's not ready to fight the ISS yet - but she will be. Already got the suit of Troubleshooter armor, but need a few more perk cards before she's ready.
---
After today, I'll probably go back to running more with my main - got about 15k of Ultracite 2mm I need to burn off.
---
I thought it was fun only problems were the intense drops in fps for us console players. And occasionally it just wouldnt work lol
---
Buy Atoms.
---
I've already resigned myself to doing so if I feel like finishing the LR. Don't use PA, so don't care too much about the skins.
---
You need to be able to do approximately 50k damage to her in half an hour through 80% damage mitigation and 300 armor,with an additional 90% explosive resistance on top. 
---
This is doable with a few types of build and strategy but it definitely requires preparation and a healthy amount of knowledge you can still fail if she decides to bugger off and not cooperate
---
I love that people do that, it makes early leveling  and looting so easy
---
Is it a bug if it‚Äôs actually just oversight without thinking of the deaf player base? Lol bug implies it‚Äôs not working as intended and clearly the quest is working.
---
Alright appreciate that! Thanks man.
---
Probably the notion of them being very smart and using you for a tool. 
---
I would really REALLY like to see Bethesda implementing a system that would somehow track event player contribution.
---
I went from 51 to 73 this double xp weekend just by killing stuff.  If you extrapolate that out to 8 days to compensate for not having double xp and that we still have 7 weeks left to complete it with double score weekends up-coming I would say you are fine.
---
Thanks! Yeah a lot of people used to give 10mm Ammo away before the converter came along. But it's cheap to make anyhow... 10mm is definitely underrated!
---
Absolutely. You don't need to be in a group or have a team to play this game and grow. I'm a level 241 and I've played solo since buying the game.
---
Depends on your lvl and abilities. But a pretty universal thing is to join certain events with a tesla or exploding shotgun
---
That‚Äôs brutal. I totally empathize with not wanting to play for weeks. I hope you got your nuke in the end.
---
I'll try to get the caps for that
---
Just sell them to a vendor bot.
---
I‚Äôll look into that, thanks for the info!
---
I do allllllll of them tbh
---
You will probably have to put in some extra grinding time, or buy some rank ups later in the run, but you're not that far behind, with double dailies coming up you may be able to get yourself into a winning position.
---
Everything should reset at noon with the challenges.
---
Thanks, i did not know server hopping would work. I have usually enough ore with 1 run and it weights a lot.
---
&gt; If you're just looking for a good roll to get you started, then you can go for the 2* weapons to start with
---
Couldn't agree with this more. I got 2 stars of my ideal weapons with the 2 best effects for me and have now spent thousands of scrip and never gotten a useful 3 star.
---
You just told me to see your point of view without even considering the same courtesy, if your a decent human being you will try too.
---
Rather then providing a civil response or constructive disscussion you blatantly stated that you will use the perk out of spite and made the erranous assumption all bloodieds are entitled; these aggressive statements serve only to escalate. Already any chance of meaningful conversation has been shattered and you are supporting intentionally aggressive gameplay.
---
While I may have spoken from emotion on my first post due to the troll I just experienced, you responded in a rude emotional way rather then an effective logical approach where you could told me that isnt the way to go about it, and I would have said sorry and agreed. But no, because I "sounded like and asshole", you were one making me less receptive.
---
You appear to have little to no care about a large portion of the community due to a build related discrimitive bias based on what you've said so far, some of them working for nearly 2 years just to have them torn apart for a cheap laugh... Your lack of regard and bias crafts a lense of perception causing you to view a player who was upset about being intentionally screwed over as just "sounding like an asshole" and gave it no further though.
---
I'm done waisting time with you till you can hold a productive discussion with points supported by logic rather then unfounded disdain and emotion but as of yet that hasn't been your intent so bye have a nice life.
---
If they were more often it‚Äôd take away from the player base wanting to participate. I wouldn‚Äôt enjoy that. 
---
I went from somewhere around L37 to L78 over the weekend...it was a good jump, sure, but zero sense of accomplishment and I also don‚Äôt enjoy that.
---
The two times I've gone wanted.  The first I was just starting out and didn't really know what was going on with the "workshop" areas
---
The second one I was just tired and forgot what I was doing and ended up picking someones lock at the red rocket truck stop up north.
---
Both times I had to strip naked and go to an event area and literally beg people to kill me to get rid of it.  Like the first time took 15 minutes of asking people at Fasnacht to kill me to get rid of the bounty because I goofed.
---
The second one took about 2 minutes at the Meat Packing plant (that uses raw sewage as an ingredient btw as an added "tee hee hee" from the ChiComs)
---
My first CAMP was just below Huntersville, near the broken highway bridge.  It's where my main character grew up.  Every time I logged in I made runs through Huntersville for the XP, guns, etc.
---
Some bushes work better than other for cover, I like the short dense ones.
---
Use third person view with weapon holstered, you can pan around your character in this mode so you can check yourself for bush coverage and get a semi periscope view around you for enemies.
---
Be mindful of your pipboy screen it can stand out in a bush real bad.
---
Once you get the ghillie suit, people will walk right into you and continue on if your set up right. Multiple times ive had people run into me and just think im a rock or something they hit.
---
All crimes punishable by exploding .50cal machine gun.
---
I've launched a lot of nukes, been disconnected many times afterwards. Pretty sure it's a feature.
---
Just **make a NW specific character**. Rewards are account based, not by character.
---
You'll get a leveled alt from it, and not have to shoehorn perks/stats between the two.
---
That's part of the game though it should be a balance between the nice helping and the probably not so nice side of it doesn't mean they were toxic though
---
It doesn‚Äôt have to be only caravan.But besides caravan is quite easy,you just have to dedicate a few minutes and think about it.With a decent,short tutorial it could become quite popular IMO.
---
i went to kill the sbq just when i came out of the vault at lvl 2, my friend gave me a pipe pistol and i melted her haha (that was a new account, i knew abit what i was doing üòÄ)
---
Happens with all the armour types.
---
This was very helpful
---
The repeatable challenge gives 100 SCORE for every 10000 xp you earn. Between level 700 and 800, you need about 118,000-128,000 XP per level to level up, so I was going up in SCORE rank every two to three levels towards the end of the Legendary Run.
---
I did. Just last week actually. Admittedly it was in a group this time. I'll do a solo run again at some point. I'm more than capable of it now, thankfully.
---
Yeah, way back when I had no idea that picking a lock on an extractor would make me wanted. I think I was like level 25 or so - I didn't really know what to do, so I tried to make a run for it.
---
Then some guy in T-60 caught me in Summerville. It didn't end well.
---
Was on PS4
---
Yes!  I am going to start doing this to the trolls who try to sell mounted heads for 5k caps
---
Legendary tenderizer is coming üòé the plans will be given out in this year's event
---
I assume you mean like if you have 90% weight reduction on all your armor and weapons right? 
---
You're not talking about something deeper than Deep Pockets mod on everything?
---
I just hit 53 and have missed several days of dailies.  Grinding that repeatable has been super easy for me especially with XP boosters, im worried about the next couple weeks though. Im active duty and ive got a mission coming up so i might fall behind.
---
It does, less lag and the Queen isn't as buffed
---
Inside the blast zone, the queen gains major damage resistance buffs
---
Get unyielding gear, xp and int food, group buffs with herbivore, egghead and herd mentality. Then run West Tek, Huntersville,  National Isolated Relay and Abandoned Bog Town 18 hours a day.
---
I did it twice on Xbox this weekend but people don't activate the pylons or it's the same two people doing it. It's a total waste of time if people don't help out.
---
Weekly challenges are updates at noon eastern on Tuesday.  I had the same issue, make sure you are not logged into the game at that time, adventure and NW.
---
All of them, if I'm launching a nuke, I'm usually launching 3.
---
This. Also we still haven't had the double score event either.
---
Did it four times over the weekend, two wins two fails. Lots of low levels participating which is awesome. Downside is many of them chose to do melee and effectively form a human shield around the sheep so gunners can‚Äôt damage the sheep. Of course when the sheep fires her laser everyone dies including the gunners lol. That‚Äôs how two of the events failed miserably.
---
I am stupid can confirm.
---
Yes. If you have any hacked items on your account, you are at risk of being banned, full stop. No two ways about it. If you're worried about your account being banned, drop it. If you don't care, keep it.
---
I have a grognak axe. I get right up in her face.
---
That line of thinking is actually what has lead us to the pile-up of bugs we have now; furthermore they don't even make timely fixes to what we tell them are the most important?
---
They're too busy making stealth nerfs, working on issues they themselves created, and making this game more of a grind. They're so out of touch with what their updates even need to be at this point. [They don't even understand that the reason the SBQ isn't landing or being crippled](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hr5q43/fallout_76_hotfix_july_14_2020/fy239tb/) is **BECAUSE THEY GAVE HER A PERK THAT DOES JUST THAT IN AN UPDATE**
---
Meanwhile hackers and dupers consistently get top gear like clockwork because Bethesda **CONSISTENTLY** has not fixed this game. Exploiters already have the entirety of the Legendary Run knocked out, while most legitimate players are barely at rank 45.
---
I would dump and distance yourself from it.
---
Just take a grape mentat and drink some alcohol with the party boy perk and you can sell those for so many caps at robot vendors. I love selling things in bulk like that, i hit max caps per day so quick
---
It is not a nuclear bomb, if you play thru the sidequests you can find out that there was some crazy corrupt stuff going on in the grafton steel company. (Some of this is revealed in the quest to get the perfect storm) anyways one of the workers went nuts and made a chemical bomb this is what caused the toxic valley. It was detonated on the same day the nukes dropped.
---
Edit: im dumb I thought you were talking about the toxic valley
---
Yes. They use a Nuka Cola Quantum Banhammer for it.
---
That post did not go the direction I initially thought... but I would like this feature as well. I don‚Äôt see it happening, but it would be a nice feature. Provided it wouldn‚Äôt ruin some unrelated ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù somehow.
---
When the back of the dog appears from one side, you can hit, but if the dog remains completely below the brahman (parallel to it), is impossible to hit. I am unarmed by the way.
---
Just last night I played a match. I was hiding in a bush that was 100% big enough to cover my entire body. suddenly i start taking massive fire from nowhere and die. The follow cam shows me the guy that killed me... from clear across the map. As i'm watching he continues to just fire off into the air and is single handedly killing everyone in the match. Yeah, cheating is still a massive thing.
---
Problem solved!   
---
I didn't notice til I exited the Power Armor, there's two sets of Power Armor in my storage! I wish they had different labels o\_O   
---
Sorry for the trouble. I would like to blame this on mom brain and waking up at 6am because of our barking dog. \*facepalm... But it might just be me :D
---
What‚Äôs the Nuka Cola Quantum Paddleball?
---
i just read another thread, can i presume you are on steam? check your bethesda account they may be there
---
Oh ok, I forgot about that one, thanks for the reply. I've been doing all the daily and weekly challenges aside from NW ones, but I'm only like 1/4 the way there. Hopefully I can make it as well, there is some cools stuff toward the end that I'd like to get.
---
That's exactly what I do lol not got enough key cards for them all, if I find a camp that's totally locked up I'll see if I can phase through using a work bench or bed and I'll leave 1 just to screw with them lol
---
With carry weight mods I get, I think it's 470.
---
Then I eat either Ribeye Steak, Cramburger or Grilled Radstag to get that to 490.
---
Then I wash it down with some whiskey and some sort of buffout to get it to 515 (for when I need to fast travel at the end of a mission and I've already broken down everything I can)
---
Then in an emergency I've got Rad Ant Lager along with me which Get's me to about 565 for 60 seconds if I'm desperate.
---
if it's anything like the Nuka Cola bottle lamp, you may just need to store and replace it a few times.
---
apparently anything that has a special lighting effect just randomly decides to not work.
---
Weapon weight reduction, food+water+chem weight reduction, etc
---
Deep pockets are mods, not legendary effects
---
What you do is get the Acid first, before mining Lucky Hole Mine.
---
If you have Fallout 1st, you smelt at the Chemistry bench in the semi-hidden cave in Luck Hole mine, leave Lucky Hole mine, plunk down your tent and store the lead in your Fallout 1st Box.
---
If you don't have Fallout 1st and have finished the BoS quest, then keep it as ore, walk down to the insane asylum and use the Brotherhood of Steel workbenches to make ammo.
---
If you haven't done the BoS quest, then yeah, it's heavy and you'll have to clear space in your stash or set up a CAMP nearby.
---
I didn't realize her quest came with the gear, and yea it was in the storage.... noticed after I exited the power armor... to find there was two power armor.
---
Whoa - I stopped carrying that much stuff a long time ago. But kudos!
---
Hit me up and I‚Äôll craft you a set. Got some nice paints I could put on for you, as well.
---
i take it this was on PC
---
NV has a lot more old country western stuff, and a few songs from Annie Get Your Gun. I dig the old west twang. But I also really like the jug and blues and bluegrass types from like Appalachia and the eastern seaboard.
---
1.5k damage isn‚Äôt what I have heard the threshold is.
---
Blackwater mine has a ton of oil canisters.
---
But this isn‚Äòt a duped Item (well it is but that‚Äòs not the point) but a upgraded weapon that shouldn‚Äòt be in the game in the first place. Is it not possible for Bethesda to delete them all at once? And if it is, why ban people if they leave it in the game? Or if it‚Äòs not possible, why not ban all people with the item, get rid of it and don‚Äòt endanger new players?
---
I tried and failed massively the last time this was a challenge. Then yesterday I managed to kill two players easily. I'm sure I'll fail massively again today.
---
That's exactly how we're going to do it. NW is pretty unpopulated, as you've probably noticed.
---
Wow definitely thought i posted a reply.. thank you very much!
---
Almost every time I join that Radiation Rumble, the event fails because nobody is collecting the ore. The turrets will mostly take care of ghouls. You ideally need 1 or 2 people to babysit turrets &amp; keep them in a working state &amp; everyone else should be collecting ore. I'm wondering if I was in that same event with you coz I distinctly remember a lvl 19 with only fists just barrelling through the ghouls. However, there was only me &amp; 2 other people because it was pretty late at night, so the event failed. I think the other person was a lvl 79 &amp; the other well above 100, maybe above 200. The lvl 19 sticks in my mind though. I was really late to the event coz I was doing something else story related.
---
This could benefit console as well vs having to hold down the button to slide it across.  Would give me a reason to connect my chatpad.
---
Yeah he/she killed my NW avatar 4 minutes into the game this morning (July 20) from 2,000 feet in the air. Unlimited ammo, perfect aim, and must also have some kind of targeting pip above other players to find them. Kind of makes playing NW for the SCORE points a waste of time.
---
A really, really old weapon in game (from Fallout 4 Nuka-World DLC). I'm not sure if it was ever a droppable item in game or if it was glitched from the Dev Room.
---
So real question is will we see the addition of legendary perks in update 21?
---
Yep, thats why I listed three different methods, explosive is the best, because the splash damage will kill them, its 100% the best way to deal with them, but melee and tesla work depending on the dogs positioning.  
---
I used to position myself in the tunnel for the last encounter and try to shoot past the brahmin, but their hitboxes stick out so damn far and in such weird places, I could not shoot past them at all.
---
Ignore the workshops. They aren't necessary. You get more junk just from scavenging in the world.
---
nah just stay away from workshops
---
you dont need them,
---
if you want to get easy ressources than accept the risk that comes with it
---
Dev Room I think. The Plan for it at least
---
It's a hacked item taken from the devroom. No players should have it in their inventory, and that applies to you as well.  
---
No, it's not possible for Bethesda to delete them all at once. Idk why people think beth has the ability to mass remove items from player inventories. They've never done it before, so even if they can, I doubt they ever will.  
---
Past that, you're asking me questions that I can't answer as I don't work for bethesda. I'm telling you that you're at risk of being banned by having a hacked item in your inventory, and it's the truth. If you have a problem with that, submit a ticket or drop the item.
---
Thanks for advice! I‚Äôll definitely spend my scrip on the 2* then! I‚Äôve had some decent armour from drops and quests so I‚Äôll use that until I can get the SS armour! Thanks so much
---
What other games do you like?  You might want to start thinking about that now.
---
level 140 here. played 90% of the game solo, mainly cuz my friends stopped playing. i dont actively avoid other people, though. i still joined pubpic events. and after public teams were added i made sure to always join or start a building one for the INT (and thus exp) bonus, and i only ever actually worked as a team with them was when someone put on their headset and said "I FOUNDA WENDIGO COLLOSUS, HELP ME". i hadnt fought one yet, so i headed over and the four of us actually functioned as a great team.
---
my point is you can totally 100% this game on your own, but so long as you avoid workshops and keep pacifist on don't be afraid to join people when something is already happening. most of the community is cool.
---
I went from 218-246 on my main,112-137 on one alt and 77-87 on another alt.
---
Played 2hours thurs, 2hours friday, 2hours saturday and 5 hours sunday spread through out the day.  About 11 hours total over 4 days. Happy with my progress.
---
 A reasonable portion of that was cashing scrip, rolling new SS armor and tr@ding on the other sub.
---
Btw, you can't hack on Xbox and I have one of these. It may have come from an illegitimate source like exploits within the game itself, but they have been on Xbox passed around for awhile at this point. I picked one up because someone offered it to me.
---
I doubt Bethesda will ban players that did not create or duplicate an item that wasn't hacked in, especially since modding isn't possible on the Xbox version. If they cared, they would've removed the items from the game and also the same exploited OP Nuclear Winter Laser guns in adventure.
---
Yeah those brahmin as well as NPCs have huge hit boxes, you can‚Äôt hit anything partially behind them, vats won‚Äôt work either. It‚Äôs very annoying.
---
If you place a workbench under it, then blueprint both, you can correctly place it on the wall. There are a few YouTube vids about it. Not fixed by any means, but a workaround for now.
---
Thank you so much. Do you think you could show me your special for the junkies archer? I don't really have too much experience in junkies build let alone a junkies archer but I'd love to know the perks i should get in charisma and such. Also is cola nut worth anything to a junkie archer build?!?! Lol
---
ikr
---
spectacular
---
I hate PVP in Workshops, so I'm right there with you. A few thoughts.
---
1. Fallout 1st makes this SO MUCH BETTER. Worth every penny for me, but I suspect you're working with public servers. 
---
2. If you're killed in the Workshop and seek revenge, killing the offender shouldn't make you wanted. You would only be wanted if you kill them outside of the Workshop zone. Just an FYI for anyone reading, unless something has changed that I'm not aware of.
---
3. As a small workaround for public server Workshops, remember that if you are just outside the build zone when they take it over (the zone is shown in green when you are building) they can't touch you. It's so much fun to stand just outside this circle to have them pay to take over the workshop (which can be expensive if you build it up), shoot you, and you just stand there unharmed. Remember to place your workshop spawn mat right on the edge of the zone, this way you can fast travel in and move outside while you get settled.
---
Wow what duped is taking anything but other god rolls. I see them for trade only.
---
A variety of CAMP side activities would rock. Pool, Darts and Cards would the be the main things I'd like to see. We need a reason to hang out at peoples CAMPS other than just to see what is being sold before moving on.
---
Yea it‚Äôs confusing because it has zero weight (until you deploy it) and is just labeled (power armor chassis). I remember getting it on my first character and having to junk it because I wasn‚Äôt even high enough level to wear it!
---
They have removed from inventories before, with the hunters hood from the devroom.
---
I didn‚Äòt attack u mate. I appreciate your answer and just wanted to discuss. I don‚Äòt work at bethesda and don‚Äòt develop games so I don‚Äòt know. But I suposse there are people on this plattform, that know such stuff, like you, that why I asked/presumed it. To get to know if they have the means. But is it really this hard for a game to have the means to delete an item? Or is it just Bethesda?
---
I put together a complete 2 star unyielding heavy combat armor set from nothing but the reward from completing Scorched Earth. You get heavy combat armor every time.
---
I'd characterize accessing the dev room as hacking. Maybe not in a literal sense, but if you want to argue about semantics, go somewhere else.  
---
And I'm telling you from experience that people have, many times in the past, been banned for having hacked dev room items in their inventories, even if they themselves didn't hack them in. It's just a fact, it's happened before, so it'll happen again. If you don't like that, submit a ticket.
---
Oh.  Well shoot.  It wasn't like that when I last got into any scuffles of significance.
---
The latest patch nerfed gauss shotty. Mines are much weaker than before patch even when they hit, including TS, Junkies, Quad, etc.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
Very nice!
---
This is a stupid point the only reason people attack other people's workshops is to be toxic since they could just switch servers.  The problem is not that there is a risk. It is that pvp is fundamentally broken and doesn't belong in a mostly pve oriented gamemode.
---
I didn't know about that. Good to know ig.
---
Why‚Äòs that? The Paddle is not on my account obviously. Why would I ask for the banhammer if I already have it?
---
If you are intentionally trying to buy a duped weapon, you are part of the problem.
---
Of course lol. The wild west of hackers.
---
My first sbq fight was with a cattle prod and a s pace suit
---
seems like there's no change in legendary perk coin system.
---
Is it a hacked item or just something that was very limited and got nerfed?
---
I think logging in anytime near 12:00 Eastern is risky.
---
I'll correct you there also: Dev room isn't accessible on consoles. Please try again though.
---
damn that's insane! i was with my destiny clan too a bunch and we ended up raiding 4 times otherwise id have likely been there too! raids in 76 when
---
Man im glad im on console
---
God, you‚Äôre the most insufferable mother fucker I‚Äôve ever had the displeasure of interacting with.
---
I thank you, but that's still really good. i have practically no life and it was too hot to be outside lol
---
No need to get defensive, I never claimed you did. Apparently, according to a different person, items have in fact been removed from player inventories in the past, but I don't doubt that it was coupled with bans. I personally don't remember the item he's talking about, but if you want to look into it, he said it was a "hunters hood"
---
Based on the responses here &amp; a few google searches, it was an item obtained by glitching into the Dev Room. It's not a legitimate item (to have) in game.
---
Workshops are meant for PvP. That is the entire purpose. Pacifist does not work there at all.
---
You would need to get every daily and weekly for the rest of the season plus a lot of xp grinding.
---
This.  Blackwater mine for the win.
---
Just got through lotting a queen. I did not deal over 1000.....i think. I did 3 dragon crits but the numbers were weird. It said 95 but there were several numbers underneath.
---
No, that was just the *rationalisation* for the dupe - not the **point**.
---
The point was always greed[.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hu7j40/account_wipees_did_you_lose_everything/fylbbn6/)
---
I'm curious to know how you think dev room items are obtained by console hackers then, considering you're apparently an expert on the subject
---
you have a point
---
This was either never true, or has changed in a update. I only recently got into mutations, and since I started I've never removed starched genes, and the new ones I've added have stuck.  Using a full RadX does make them temporarily go away, but they come back once the RadX wears off.
---
Edit: /u/Odysseus_Cipher corrected me, it's RadX not RadAway
---
See this has been my experience as well which is why I don‚Äôt buy into the ‚Äúdupers who were banned deserve your sympathy because you were helped by this dupe too‚Äù. I haven‚Äôt gotten one good weapon or outfit from other players because they all want way too much for their six of the same weapon
---
the game outright tells you claiming a workshop flags you for pvp before you initiate the claim. if you dont want to deal with the risks that come with it, don't claim a workshop.
---
i dont understand why this is so hard for people to understand.
---
Like I said I‚Äôve been playing since April and I have nothing to show for it. Meanwhile people who cheat can have everything they could ever wanted, I‚Äôm tired of fighting the same boss everyday just to get shitty 1star weapons. Bethesda took away the ability for us to grind legendaries, theres cap limits on everything and the RNG is trash.
---
Dragon shoots multiple projectiles I believe
---
I can show you the specials when I get home from work.  As far as cola nut goes I don't use it, I think people do use it for full health builds and use a lot of nuka quantum.  for charisma I usually max out loan wanderer and party boy so that's 7.  I normally do that for all three builds.  You need a fair amount of points in perception to have all the archer perks maxed.  you also want a fair amount of agility as well.  I run 4 in luck for all three builds, bloodied mess and starched genes.  What level is the character your working on?
---
Dude. Your so wrong. And more do, go away with your wanting duped items.
---
Of course they‚Äôre laughing at you. You‚Äôre offering caps when other players are buying them for RL money.
---
I missed like 2 weeks of it because of work. All i want is the sheepsquatch plushie
---
I can rock 575 with my excavator and without it I can carry 580
---
Hey! My troubleshooter‚Äôs fixer is a beast during Encryptid and AWOL Armaments!
---
You can change the photo by going into your photo gallery and tagging the photo as your profile picture.
---
Probably.
---
Heck, I got most, if not all, of those rewards just by opening up all those free card packs we received.
---
I just use the 150 Atoms prize as a "Free level". Or any challenge in game to score me 150 Atoms ill pretends its SCORE.
---
That‚Äòs interesting. Wanted to edit my comment already to ask if it isn‚Äòt almost the same with the duped TSE‚Äòs that got removed
---
BSG doesn't care about your scenario.  Why?  They don't know it happened. How do they know you are a duper? When you have ridiculous amounts of an expensive desired item that would be unfeasible to create or purchase otherwise.  500,000 ultracite?  15 sets of the most wanted plans in the game? you going to get banned.  It's that kind of stuff they are looking for, not vanilla guns that got duped due to glitch. Plus I bet neary eveyone lvl 200+ has or had a duped item of some kind in their inventory obtained without a clue to it's origin.
---
I did the same thing when the game was 3 months old and something similar happened.  Then it turns out, BGS isn't that good at tracking anything.  So one-off glitch dupes, duped weapons purchased innocently, all go undetected unless more than 1 shows up in inventory. Even legacy, currently non-existent weapons would not be detected unless you have multiples of the same exact item in inventory.
---
Just an FYI, gold bullion is only obtained by turning in treasury notes you receive from public events after you complete the vault 79 quest line. Junk gold is separate from that and only used in crafting.
---
I really hoped it worked properly. But my expectation of it doing so were extremely low. Good to know that its finicky like the nuka lamp.
---
Oh! My bad. I had no idea.
---
99 to 244 here
---
And went from 49 on the run to 82
---
April was only 3 months ago. That‚Äôs not long at all lol. 
---
Again, you are part of the problem if you incentivize people to exploit the game.
---
They didn‚Äôt take away any incentive. I started playing before we even had a legendary exchange. You know what we did? We gave away extra weapons to new players. You don‚Äôt need to get scrip to grind.
---
Oblivious you didn‚Äôt get the point of my comment so I‚Äôll just leave it at that for now.
---
There is a mothman cultist on the north end of savage divide in a camp. It's always where I fast travel to take the picture of the campsite for the daily overseer quest. The cultist always has a flamer. I would server hop that spot.
---
When did I say i was a rifle build? Im a heavy PA primarily but also bloodied. Endgame making 20 bullets compared to the 100s you could with a 50 cal or minigun doesnt compare. Im saying the damage isnt enough to justify only making 20 bullets at once in my opinion.  I even said the gun is really cool just not worth it yet, jesus dude cool your jets
---
ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Man I still can't get it. It's the R&amp;G Processing building right? Which fence line?
---
That‚Äôs a good run there.
---
Every mention of it I have seen says it takes up a good chunk. Not something I wanna test out
---
So true.
---
Shoot their legs off and laugh as they desperately crawl to get you. (Beware the laser though)
---
I missed the whole first week as well and just hit 38. I have hope! We‚Äôve got a double score daily‚Äôs weekend coming up. I figure if you can catch by then you‚Äôre good.
---
Stop crying and suck it up like every other legitimate player.
---
 You should drop your gamer tag so you can be reported for trying to buy duped weapons and then you can be banned as well. 
---
I honestly don't understand the mentality of you people.
---
No, those items are automatically unequipped when you enter power armor.
---
My event completed successfully ü§î
---
If it isn‚Äòt accessible, how did the people get the Quantum Paddles? Tried to find it out yesterdey but didn‚Äòt find a clear answer
---
To be specific: does anyone know how they got into the devroom if it happened? It‚Äòs obviously not possible anymore so I guess there‚Äòs no problem in telling the way it got done
---
i have only found it once, it was in the outhouse at the archery range at the scout camp
---
i'm a simple person. i wont go looking for a fighr, but if you cross my path and you have a red arrow over your head, im taking the shot.
---
metaphorically taking a shot, i mean. i'm a melee build, so i wont actually shoot you. i'll just... beat you death. i guess.
---
ive played solo since beta. over lvl 200 . great gear 100% story completion and i still enjoy the game every day.
---
like every big notification that blocks game play, i hate those.
---
double tab tab will do it, but tedious.
---
Thanks u/itscmillertime for the photo change workaround, I also had no idea. Another +1 for the name change though!
---
Wow, great stuff!
---
That's the best pair of caravaners by far.
---
That‚Äôs what it would seem. Too me 3-4 additional matches though for some reason, and I placed relatively well each time. Who knows. Either way you are almost there!
---
Hehe, I like to use my bow because of the low ammo use
---
You posted in a public forum an open subject and your post breaks the forum rules as well as the game rules.
---
You need to be banned from this forum and the game.
---
You would get more mileage out of a general set of 1 each ghoul slayer, mutant slayer, troubleshooter, exterminator, hunter armor than full vanguard, the 15% damage reduction magnifies your armor, meaning if you already have 500 dr you are gaining effectively another 120 on top of 15% less damage compared to vanguard getting 175 sometimes.
---
You'd have to do the math. But the Halloween ones are straight, so you need 14k total to get the skeleton. The Xmas ones are not, so after each one you need the full xp for the next, so it's 14k from the beanie to the jacket
---
This current one is fresh out of the vault. A whopping level 24 and I'm taking things slow with this character considering all my other builds are bloodied riflemans and stealth commandos. I'm hearing a lot of people rag on me for making a Junkies crossbow character but i think she'll turn out pretty good. Really the junkie perks have me all confused. Sorry for the constant unknowingness lol
---
It's not in Bethesda's interest to ban potential atom buyers over a useless weapon.
---
Lmfao cry me a river. You‚Äôre god damn right I‚Äôm asking for duped weapons, why play legit when everyone cheats and gets everything they want but I have to play for months on end to get anything good? Yea ok
---

---
I think most are level 45+ so ahead of the curve. Just need a rank up a day and with daily‚Äôs and weeklys not counting next weekend event should be fine and dandy
---
not really,
---
workshops need to have a counter because otherwise you could just claim all the workshops and farm infinite ressources
---
i agree that pvp in adventure mode is unbalanced and needs major improvements
---
but your not entitled to just get a workshop, farm your ressources and feel hurt when someone takes the opportunity to kill you
---
you willingly accept to run around in a PVP area and feel hurt when people do exactly what that area is designed for
---
if you think pvp should be no feature in this game than thats a valid opinion but nothing more than that
---
if you dont like it you can write bethesda about it and complain that they didnt make the game like you would want it to be,
---
but calling out players for playing the game like its intended doesnt change anything
---
Neat tool, never knew about it before, will bookmark for future reference.
---
I have just noticed - NW: Kill a player.
---
Aw now i gotta actually *play* NW for few minutes rather afk or spam camp placements, booooooo.
---
While I agree with the sentiment that the big brains at HQ are responsible, overwhelmed, and even before then were making terrible decisions for the games health and design, you miss the larger point. The community managers cannot behave in a way that you want them to, or provide information you feel entitled to, nor can they do it on your schedule or even a schedule that makes sense as they are beholden to others that decide these things. Typically they have a script they stick to (Which is why we'll pass it along/on the radar/investigating) are becoming memes and like EA for example have their words scrutinized with a fine tooth comb by passionate fans and the wrong sentence can spiral into a viral clusterfuck that only hurts the game further. 
---
With all that being said, when one of the them is kind enough to offer to help someone skip the line or otherwise put a magnifying glass up to a specific situation, the last thing you should do is sass them or use it as an opportunity to vent your frustration. Check my history, they should flair me king shit talker-talker but shit talk the big brains/Bethesda not the people who could just as easily ignore everything and only stick to the script but instead they are here face to face with all of us trying, and that is important and should be encouraged. 
---
They are people, not robots, and like most people they aren't going to respond if anytime they do anything no matter what it is they get resentment and vitriol in return.
---
No prob. I just wish character name showed up in game instead of user name.
---
Ask me if I care?
---
I wonder if i combined it with tank killer would it be more effective
---
Lol as far back as April you say?!? Why by jove you should have every single thing you could want in this game already!
---
50 / 50
---
Too much fire in the *is eternal grind*  front...
---
*Nope Crickets* are the thing of nightmares!
---
There is a bathtub with 20 soap bars east of Camp McClintlock. It is under an electricity tower near the bridge. You may have to look a little to find the spot.
---
They scrap for 1 oil per bar
---
Been having the autocomplete for 2 months now with no issues. Just recently its started popping the quest up every time I join a server. I'm already allied with Foundation but I still turn it in for the caps and treasury notes. As others have said, they won't ban you for that. What will probably end up happening is that they will patch it and you won't be able to do it anymore. It doesn't really affect other players if you continually turn it in, there is still a daily cap on gold bullion and a cap on scrip, so you can only gain so much from it.
---
You've been playing the game for 3 months and clearly participated in the recent stackables dupe, which means that you're already significantly farther ahead than any player who plays the game legitimately. You're just lazy and greedy. If you want everything to be handed to you, go play a single player game and give yourself shit with console commands.
---
You mustve had a ton of duplicates lol
---
That‚Äôs my next level. Super excited to get that today ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
It should be. Even then though you can‚Äôt just pop a few shots off, you need to actively fight her to loot her.
---
The greatest thing about that bot, is that it was made as a social experiment to see how people take insults. Based on the data, raiders and blood eagles, respond with words and insults back, settlers scrap or repurpose insult bot, and then there is the players who just kill it everytime.
---
I think the players and settlers are the real bad guys in Appalachia based on how they respond to an automated insult
---
No, the only change is animated or regular now give the same coins...
---
Itd be nice to get word if they fix the excessive shine/gloss on everything, its starting to get really old.
---
Yeah that is super inconvenient. With PS4, if I see my buddies online, I just message them on PSN. I can even do it from my phone. 
---
It was like 175 card packs...
---
Think there is one that drops 100 fuel in lucky hole as well
---
Which is why so many people aren‚Äôt using it as much, you get a lot of great perks with your armor, as well as your backpack you lose when you slip in PA.  I have to swap out perk cards to compensate and find I is PA less and less.
---
Thats what I was thinking. I had done a good couple matches after I got the beanie but still nothing. Im probably right  on the cusp then
---
It would be really nice if they would issue pve only servers so that there are four gamemodes and people who want to be actual cancer can just leave the pve players alone.
---
What a genuine prick. You're an embodiment of everything that's wrong with the 76 community.
---
I was just super happy to get from 108-115, haha. I am a super casual player though.
---
I know you don‚Äôt care now.
---
But the moment you get banned from the game you‚Äôll be posting like the whiny crappy player you are about how unfair it was you got banned. 
---
Because that‚Äôs what you are all like. Snowflakes.
---
It does lag badly.
---
The other issue with that idea though it how it would react to "Super Duper."
---
Cake day buddies 4 life!
---
Yeah i was using the christmas rewards to gage where i was at after getting the second to last halloween item
---
 I don't cheat and I have a stash full of God rolled weapons and a couple legacies. So get the fuck outta here with your shitty ass lame excuses for cheating.  You entitled fucks make me laugh.
---
No it's unequipped when you enter PA, and reequipped when you leave it.
---
It has the "fun" effect of meaning most late game players lose carry weight and therefore become over-encombered when wearing PA xD
---
Also they all pussies because they shoot you in the back while you crafting and think they dope for strategically killing you while sneaking, it's laughable at best. I agree, time to remove PVP completely from Adventure, it is no longer needed or wanted by the majority of the community.
---
Nope.
---
That's why I rarely use PA - I carry a lot more and am tankier without it.
---
How can I get banned if I never broke the TOS? Receiving duped items isn‚Äôt the same as duping them yourself genius
---
I was pumped to get mine yesterday. Will never wear in NW though haha
---
Due to the ban wave many of the duped copies are now on accounts that are suspended. So it's not like there's an abundance now. Even during the week the dupe was rampant you're still not gonna get an explosive gat plas for caps, or presents. Those dupers probably already had thousands of presents, if not more
---
Contrary to popular belief the dupe did not spread the wealth, it just lowered the trading value of alot of god tiered weapons for other traders to pick up for cheaper in trade value. Not many dupers just gave away legacies or even sold them for caps
---
And 4 days? There's people that have been after them for weeks, even months.
---
I shoot him on sight too.
---
Haven't played NW before this weekend? I had like 3 or 4 unopened packs
---
Omg that's hilarious
---
Oh yeah that‚Äôs true I always use that‚Äôs probably the problem. my lucks at 27-30 most of the time so it probably gives me the super duper a lot lol
---
Funny enough, you made it my business by making this idiotic post. You're clearly just a brat who can't handle a little bit of grinding. Pathetic. Go cry about it to somebody who cares.
---
*laughs in thousands of Christmas gifts*
---
I had never played until the NW challenges started up for the Seasons.
---
Of course, I'm also a player since BETA.
---
I think the responses here aren‚Äôt unanimous...has anyone been banned for having that item specifically?
---
Imgur?
---
Bloody Franks, just north of Berkeley Springs. There's a boss npc whose name I forget that drops 50-100 fuel and is server hoppable.
---
How stupid are you? They literally just went through a whole wave of banning players for duping AND buying duped items.
---
Talk about snowflake and thickheaded.
---
(Todd laughs)
---
Probably not - though BGS did ban a bunch of people who accessed the Dev Room.
---
I really don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a bug since it‚Äôs given a random % change of being given one. Bethesda just needs to adjust the % chance but lord knows that won‚Äôt happen for a good while and as a result everyone who cares about the gun has already grinded for the attachments. Like I said earlier too the downside of the gun is that radiation resistance is common amongst enemies and they could keep the attachments as rare as they are but as a result it just has a higher damage per shot than the handmade. It would help build diversity amongst loadouts for rifleman and commando builds and also help deal with the issue of fixers and handmade being duped to the high heavens. It makes no sense to me why bethesda doesn‚Äôt balance multiple different weapons for different situations.
---
I know the first time atleast you want to do it all correctly but, for times sake you can clip through 2 doors making a silo run about 5 minutes long. After launching countless nukes having to break all the cores and repair them is just tedious and annoying.
---
I would never leave survival üò¢
---
Just finally launched my second one since I launched one back when the game first came out to finish the story. I wanted to launch one because every night on Xbox I get into a server and it was already launched and ended or no does. Well I wasted a card because only me and 2 guys showed up and ran out of time. I gotta redo my perk cards so I can solo the queen. But I used Charlie so I didn‚Äôt waste caps to get there
---
That‚Äôs funny cause I still have my account hahaha so keep talking about things you know nothing about
---
Stay Frosty little fella lol...
---
I absolutely agree that these community managers are doing their best and its not their fault. And we aren‚Äôt attacking them. I‚Äôve played since beta, i preordered the game, and ever since it has been disappointing. While i love this game, it needs to be better. Criticisms are needed to make the game better. Higher up Bethesda employees do not need protection. I would cut Todd‚Äôs balls off and throw them in a tree if I ever saw him. But just know that when we complain its always at the devs for being bad at their job, not the community managers doing their best to take advice from the community
---
I'm on my 3rd character and still have yet to launch a nuke... but my current character is a stealth build &amp; typically good at surviving difficult battles. I'd love to help if you guys get brave enough to try again. PSN is xa0t1ca (middle o is a zero)
---
Nice, thanks for the write up. Anything on the Ammo Converter?
---
I shall try that next time i have near max on them
---
Happened to me once too. I got there a little late but I unloaded at least 2 clips of my .50 cal but no loot. It‚Äôs also the one time I saw the queen health drop like she was a level 10 ghoul. Not sure who had the crazy build but it was over pretty quick. PS4 by the way so pretty sure it wasn‚Äôt a hacked weapon.
---
I always forget to add super duper when I craft food, always use it when I make ammo.
---
Usually you instadowned when u got dots on you
---
Did you get duped fixers, explosive energy weapons a, handmade?
---
The christmas presents never got a ban wave due to how wide spread they are. If you got any of the recent duped items you'd be banned right now
---
You have to remember bethesda is a triple A studio and fallout 76 is a C tier game. They need to do better.
---
I booted up the game for the last time a few weeks ago, and I was only playing for five minutes. Insulted my mother or something and said my family is all dead. 
---
The repair kits killed it for me, I wish I could play without a constant struggle for cans
---
Is there an easy way to get two players in the same game, I struggled doing this last time, I got two of my characters in eventually but was a pain. Joining a team prior and trying to break it once joined doesn't work.
---
Hate to say it but your friends are misinformed. I never played other FO before, simply because those were all solo games and I like multiplayer games, pvp co-op etc. Picked up 76 on launch day since the box says multiplayer, and found it really fun even with all the bugs and flaws. As of today many of the bugs have been fixed and polished, it‚Äôs a great game to spend your time with. Just like any software there will always be bugs, but don‚Äôt let that keep ya from enjoying the content. 
---
Lots of the naysayers are simply parroting what others say, because negativity always sell. I recommend this game to a friend, she said ‚Äòbut they said it has no endgame content?‚Äô. I asked where she got that from, she showed me a youtuber who badmouths 76 while all the clips were from past FO games. And in the end the guy even said he doesn‚Äôt PLAN to get the game, meaning all his ‚Äòopinions‚Äô were pulled from you know where.
---
Quad/explosive/faster reload is probably the best db shotty imo
---
Its not just the free stuff. Plenty of atom shop items are bugged including the bungalow WHICH THE JUST RELISTED FOR SALE. WTF Bethesda?!
---
"It just works."
---
because of the "drawbacks" of playing junkies and bloodied
---
Just join at the same time. I did four times with another dude already and it worked every time
---
If your on Xbox I can craft the important ones for you free of charge. I have far too many mats and caps.
---
Yeah that makes sense...Thanks!
---
Thank you!!
---
Being bloodied isn‚Äôt a drawback by any means given the benefits or every other buff like uny
---
I'll have to try that, thanks.
---
Oh wow thanks. I'll have to check. I'm on xbox one. I'm an experienced level 94 player and I just havent fou d the plans for them yet.
---
Alright, thanks
---
I played NW for the first time in ages the other day and it absolutely sucked.
---
Sometimes just removed and putting back on fixes as well. I have seen this alot with the shotgun one scattershot, where is suppose to reload faster but does not until i remove it and add it again
---
It came from an exploit in workshops. I never learned how it was done because I don't exploit, but it had something to do with stash boxes/containers in a workshop and putting in another item. Lasers became nuclear winter Laser guns with unlimited magazine and huge damage, and baseball bats became different rare colored ones. I also heard the alien blaster with way better damage came from there but I haven't confirmed it. The quantum and cherry paddleballs came from a normal paddle ball in there.
---
Okay
---
Blood Eagle‚Äôs drop a lot of Stim‚Äôs and agree with others they are a far higher drop then they used to be.  At 10c for Vendor you just dump them there.
---
Bloodied and Junkies have downsides (glass cannon and withdrawal effects). Whether those downsides are enough to balance their damage is a different question entirely, but that's the reasoning. Personally, I think the enemy specific weapons deserve a buff since they are only effective with one mob type and at this point aren't worth lugging around.
---
Well, that;s what I get for only playing about 8 hours from Friday to last night. I only ranked up from 49 to 62 but I didn't go out of my way to maximize the xp.
---
I do want to say the public teams thing is really cool. In the last week I have found 5 other cool guys to run with that have mics so we are constantly sharing rewards and helping each other make our way thru events and quests. Previously I rarely worked with anyone or even talked to anyone while playing but teaming up has made that so easy and I guess I got lucky teaming up with others who are very friendly and welcoming.
---
Never realized how much fun I was missing out on not having any friends playing 76.
---
Newbie that does the exp farm event lol üòÇ
---
Because not every legendary effect is meant for endgame play.
---
Nice. But I'm on xbox one.
---
So I'm entitled for not wanting to be instantly killed by another player for absolutely no reason and you aren't for wanting to allow people to take other people's shit. I would be glad to just give someone else my workshop if they gave me the option but no people just walk by and destroy all of the generators and leave.
---
Why buy atoms when you can just progress normally? At least in this case they are not exactly behind and doing daily and weekly challenges they could get to 100 by the end of the season.
---
Thx for the answer mate ;P there‚Äòs a Alien Blaster with better damage? Are we talking like useful damage?
---
I'm on xbox but do have ultracite. I like the excavator cuz of the extra 100lb weight bonus
---
Good to know it‚Äôs not just me. Farmed tons of those crickets for acid yet still shows 0/3 lmao
---
Great shots. That one in Watoga HS is awesome
---
There is a link of where you have to be each week and 45 is as of end of today I believe where you should be without lots of grinding.  So on track
---
As a proud Cannibal, I resent that "human flesh" comment. How would you like it if I mocked your dietary choice to wolf down every can of dog food or box of fossilized moldy steak substitute you find?
---
Isn't Unyielding builds can carry higher weight than PA?
---
Twitter,  let me search for it... but not rise your hope about patch 21....

A big problem is there are so many events where to complete them there are jobs besides killing.  But those jobs give no reward.  At least in Free Range everyone is close to one another and when the sheepsquatch appears it‚Äôs right there by the cows.  How about radiation rumble?  You toil for ore or heal those dimwits for what?  Everyone else runs around getting xp.  There is a flaw with a lot of the events.  I‚Äôm sick of protecting the friendly animal in PP and no one helping.  But really my irritation should be towards the creators of events that require different players do different things but only rewarding killing.  That needs to be fixed.  
---
The reality of Free Range is you get a better reward when more cows live.  If the sheepsquatch kills them at the end while we all take turns shooting then what was it all for?  Lots of these events need some reworking of how rewards are distributed. Because the way it is now is pretty shit.
---
I believe they are adding extra daily challenges to help with some of the folks who experienced auto completed challenges. I‚Äôm sure you will be fine, good luck!
---
Too bad I have two weeks vacation
---
i agree that it would be a nice system, if a player challenges your workshops, you have the option to just give it to him without engaging into pvp
---
that way you could also make the encounters more fair,
---
as i said i do agree that there need to be changes but just completely delete all pvp im not a fan of
---
and yes id say if you want an unlimited free supply of ressources in such a game and dont want to run any risk by doing so,
---
that means you feel entitled to have that opportunity
---
Don't?..... 
---
Out of everything why are you picking suppressors?
---
I'm on exactly the same square, only cost me 1700 atoms :(
---
Cool. PM‚Äòed
---
I've been playing since right after Beta on Xbox and have watched fallout subreddits for information on anything. I haven't seen a single person with dev room items or the most definite thing to be passed around early which was the Marine Combat Helmet. The dev room is flat out not accessible on console.
---
 And if you *could* cheat on console, Nuclear winter would be massively cheated on like PC, thus being unpopular and having less players. This wasn't the case though and console has the healthiest NW experience.
---
I don‚Äôt even bring a hazmat suit or pa anymore. If I get to close to the Nuke zone I just pop a nuka grape. I am full health build though
---
I just realized your character name does show during the monster mash event, and I had just named my daily "level up" toon. "Nobodyisgoingto seethisanyway" I'm such a liar üòÇ
---
My acc got suspended as I duped 2 guns, contacted Bethesda to see if my account was getting banned permanently or the suspension will be lifted and I haven‚Äôt gotten a response in like 3 days
---
well, say you have 100 HP and you downed hp is 25 normally you would take 110 damage. and it will knock you to downed status. with 15hp. but if the monster hits your for 135 dmg. you go straight to fallout jesus do not collect 200 caps.
---
Yup they‚Äôre all greedy just like the rest of this player base. If you don‚Äôt have a legacy god roll to trade with then you‚Äôre basically screwed and are put in the hands of RNG
---
You can buy Bullion with caps once you complete the Wastelanders Main Quest, to a weekly limit. Bullion is used for various high level plans.
---
After completing wastelanders there's a sink of 6k caps once a week for end game currency.
---
There's also some new plans that can be purchased for caps.
---
Nothing in this update PA related from what I can remember is based on caps.
---
Nice always good to do that I have good with salt and hike thru then a piece of armor or 2 that make food drinks and stuff weigh less, oh and butchers bounty. so I usually have a bunch of food then I sell it or give it away
---
This was the most enjoyable one I‚Äôve done, building teams and discovering intelligence builds made all the difference ,  still didn‚Äôt max it out but was getting double the XP I was getting in the last double XP weekend.
---
Now working towards getting everything I need for next time.. grindy grindy grindy
---
Also, if there are twenty people shooting squirrels, don't give in to the peer pressure. Drums, fire spits and shoveling poop are just as important.
---
You got this dude. You did the responsible thing. 
---
I would have not.
---
This is what I do. Others have said that it does not prevent them from starting the event though. You could also put your power armor frame in the doorway to block people, but they can still come through the ceiling.
---
Buy bullion
---
I'm taking donations ;D
---
I don't blame you. It gets stale after a while. Sticking to dailies for a while lmao
---
no worries.  I actually have had a lot of fun with my J archer build.  I use a 33/25 crossbow and a limb damage compound bow.  The cross bow is a beast.
---
Best gun in the game I could care less for any other weapon at this point now that I got my b2525
---
Notice the "" around the word drawbacks.
---
I think bloodied should be nerfed. (Also as a junkies i say nerf junkies as well or make enemeis way more resilient and boost other damage builds) BUT i have seen bloodied players get wrecked by a level 10 ant at campfire tales. That's a drawback.
---
Yeah, or less
---
Getting rid of cheaters means getting rid of people that pay for the 1st Subscription. Can‚Äôt get rid of the people paying them for a game they already paid for.
---
Ah wasn't you then! Congrats on the win üëç
---
Bethesda would NEVER admit to wrongdoing. Still a ton of people sitting in limbo. Most started new accounts and used double xp weekend to their advantage.
---
You can buy gold bullion once per week for caps. With a max of 300 bullion for 6000 caps. If you weren't around when Wild Appalachia came out there is also the Assaultron Recall boards for the Encryptid event. I'm not sure what else there is.
---
We all have to cry, as todd drinks our tears?
---
I still remember the first time I meet it, it stated that it have an insult for me but I wasn‚Äôt worthy of it, then it laughed. The location was a couple of feet from the entrance of the Mothman town.
---
Oh nice! I found out the level 48 dude was a banned duper on a new account, so clearly he knew what he was doing.
---
To be fair, I've only seen two completely obvious cheaters during my stints in NW (Overseer level 37ish from solo bush wookieing FWIW), but they were both during the same play session from this newest double XP weekend. No fliers, but still 'shooting/punching halfway across the map' levels of obvious.
---
Your information is stored on the Bethesda servers. You‚Äôll just have to re download the game and start playing.
---
so since i can't do today, tomorrow and potentially wednesday's dailies, i'll be behind?
---
Same here no response after being suspended.
---
There's 4 that I know of. The normal trashy one, the VATS Unknown which is actually useful on my pistol character, a cheated one on PC that is Bloodied with other stars at 600 damage, and the Workshop exploit one that I've heard has over 300 damage. 
---
If I can find someone with one of the workshop I'll definitely trade hard for it.
---
Funny enough I know exactly which exploit you're talking about with containers in workshops, and you're just objectively incorrect about getting nuka quantum paddles from them. If you want to reference something, make sure you know how it works before you do.  
---
That being said, I've talked to plenty of people with hacked atom shop items that were pulled from the dev room on console. Again, I'd suggest actually looking into something before you convince yourself that you know anything about it.
---
I think you'll be okay. As for purchasing rank ups, yeah you would be best waiting until the last day and buying out any remaining ranks. This means you will have more atoms to spend too as you will earn more from different rank ups.
---
*sigh* One can dream...
---
I hope not.   Historically, once the new system comes out, I never go back to the old one.   I'd hate to just leave this game behind because it isn't compatible.
---
Bloodied is great because it pairs well with other perk cards and legendary effects, on it's own it would not be worth running around with such low health. Junkies involves reducing stats and two shot was drastically nerfed or that would still be the meta and even that has the problem of your guns breaking twice as fast.
---
WV Lumber way up Northwest (Blood Eagle Camp now) wait on the road there and you'll encounter him more time than you want scoping out the place.
---
On another note. Don't.
---
There needs to be something seriously wrong with you to go suppressors.
---
Stay safe dude!!
---
If and when anything happened, it would be posted here. You wouldn't have to look long to find it.
---
It‚Äôs probably because 900 hours isn‚Äôt sufficient for someone to create a huge amount, but now it‚Äôs been almost two years and someone are probably approaching 7600 hours, it‚Äôs more common and realistic for people to craft and accumulate large amount of ammo. Heck I‚Äôve never crafted any .38 and fusion cells, but I saved all the ones I picked up while I play and I‚Äôm sitting on more than 30k of each kind.
---
3-4k from the the beanie for the skeleton. 14k altogether for the Halloween rewards. The Christmas rewards reset each rank so you need 14k from the beanie for the fur lined coat
---
That damn bot always runs up on me when I‚Äôm sneaking.
---
Make sure to rename the chassis as to which PA is, so you don't get confused again!
---
I usually play between 4 and 6 pm eastern time. Don't have FO 1st  never played private server but always wante to try one..
---
Schotzie003
---
That would be good.   With all the time I've put into learning this game and building my character, I'd be willing to buy it for PS5.  Especially if they can remaster it somehow.
---
Thanks! I‚Äôm DoctorJaxx, I‚Äôll send you an invite.
---
(Also, I‚Äôm new to Reddit, how do you get the neat Order of Mysteries flair? I‚Äôve got a camp build for a Mansion of Mysteries that I‚Äôm planning, pending the availability of some items in the Atom Shop I need!)
---
Damn the workshop really one does sound interesting ;P
---
I‚Äôm not saying they should make every legendary effect endgame, I‚Äôm saying making 2 effects strictly better than any of the mob specific effects is poor game balancing and causes a large % of legendary drops to just useless since bloodied and junkies do more damage in all situations.
---
alright, thanks man. i hope you're right!
---
Maybe, but come Thursday its Double Dailies, so you can catch up again.
---
That's funny. Because I know a person who put the paddle ball in and got it out back when it was possible. But you do you.
---
Ya it is. Do u keep your perk on so u don‚Äôt heal your mutations (sorry if that is an obvious question)
---
NW is what pvp is for but yes I understand that would be unfair to some people so maybe if Bethesda would be willing there could be pve and pvp servers.  Also maybe they could make the workshop defenses actually hard so that it isn't just free necessarily.  I am all for that but just getting destroyed by another person like I said is not for me.
---
Man good thing so we do on xbox is transfer our gamer tag with all its info
---
It didn‚Äôt come from the dev room. It showed up during the workshop glitch that allowed you to put weapons in a scrapable container at the workshop, scrap said container and then have NW glitched weapons show up in your stash box.
---
They're already confirmed to be launching in update 22, alongside One Wasteland.
---
I have them at 7 caps and it‚Äôll be a day or two before someone buys them.  They usually buy them all when they do, though.  I rarely get supers to sell, so I usually just vendor them 
---
Since the 1400 vendor cap is in play, you have to kind of be strategic in what you sell.  I‚Äôd rather sell perishable stuff, water, and weapons.  Wish you could bulk up stims, but I sell them last.
---
I thought it was hilarious too, but for a different reason.  I imagine that because the vendors are robots, the prompt to hack them from Robotics Experts must interfere with the buy/talk prompt.  Which makes total sense, but I would have never thought of that. üòÇ
---
That event won't be like a month condensed tho. It'll just be 8 days in 4. You won't go from 35 to 68.....
---
Easy fix; Bethesda makes Atom balance shared between Steam and Bethesda Launcher? ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Welcome to the Wasteland, kind stranger,
---
They  might want it so it takes the wanted tag off of them. I used to get wanted and would go looking for someone to kill me.
---
Its normally done using some sort of cheating software, and changing your fat, muscle and skinny values higher than theyre normally meant to be (im not sure on details, but i think normally all 3 total to a value of 3, but you can just set all of them to 3 individually to make whatever that is, or a stickman if you set them all extremely low)
---
Do you yell ‚ÄúTIMBER!‚Äù when your enemies go down?
---
Same here I got suspended six days ago sent them an email 5 days ago and haven't heard anything back. I sent two emails and I sent another one this morning
---
It was so bad I literally sold legacy legendary energy weapons to vendor bots because I had no more space and can‚Äôt walk freely to farm all the materials needed to maintain those weapons lol
---
T H I C C C
---
Is it? I always looked at empath with ire -2 to everything seems like a lot
---
Yeah but wouldn't that require any making a completely new gamertag?
---
Because there needs to be "tiers" in online games like this. To have sense of progress and to give that rewarding feeling when you acquire new and better items. There needs to be low crappy ones, middle ones and then top tier items. If everything was balanced the game would be kinda boring don't you think? Or else there would not be any need for legendary effects at all. Just weapons. Or maybe we want to remove them too. Make one type of weapon available in game. Without effects. So everyone can feel equal when they have not had luck acquiring that best item for their build.
---
EDIT: Whatever changes the developers make. Whatever nerfs they put in place. There will ALWAYS be the top one that is better than everything else, that everyone wants. As there will always be the worst of the worst that nobody wants. Asking for changes or whining about effects does not change that.
---
EDIT2: There is no damage/dps race/competition in this game that would require to balance items. If the game had rifts like diablo, raids like wow, etc etc.. You would gain an massive upper hand if you had an OP weapon, therefore it would be the need to balance stuff. In this game, if someone uses bloodied build/weapon it has ZERO effect on you. ZERO. And before someone comments the same'ol "It's always the bloodied ones that one shot everything and ruin it for everyone else". No. You can one shot and be an asshole with any decent build and with any prefix. Bloodied or Junkies have nothing to do with it. You are just jealous because you have not played the game long enough and have not had those top tier items drop for you yet.
---
If you move your camp multiple times, it might delete itself from storage. It seems to not be super consistent but it should work
---
I spent most of my gameplay not understanding why other people talked about being diseased so often when I almost never get diseases... only much later did I find out that most were not running this perk which gives 35% disease resistance at all times   
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Rejuvenated](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Rejuvenated)
---
You can listen to anyone on here about the safety of certain items and being banned. It's up to you who you believe though. I feel like I have a decent understanding and have actually seen enough of these bans/glitches through friends and watching the community to weigh in. 
---
If Bethesda hasn't removed these illegitimate items and players have them still without being banned, its probably safe. It's been many months since the exploit was fixed but the items are still being traded around and sometimes duped.
---
Of course I don't recommend using exploits yourself or telling friends to do them, but if they do it I'm definitely taking a couple minor handouts so I don't have a disadvantage in the future of trading. Duping is still bad.
---
Because if everything was good then nothing would be special.  Turds have to exist before one can truly appreciate the smell of a rose.
---
I suspect that is related to deathray that it currently emits that only few builds can survive
---
This would be so OP. If never have a camp if this were a thing.
---
That would be pretty cool. There already hot tubs in the game, so it shouldn‚Äôt be that hard to put some water in it and give you some sort of rested bonus after sitting in it for 30 seconds.
---
Yes it does.
---
Romance that grandpa!
---
Ignorance of the law is no excuse
---
If you have a good team leader they can keep it on building and then switch it to events right before the event ends then switch it back.
---
Its not from a dev cell, its from the reroll bug using storing workshop containers a while ago, or the spawn hack on pc a long while ago.
---
One of them certainly did not want to die, I chased him for like three miles
---
IIRC none of the radio dramas have proper captions. Getting captions for all of those would be appreciated!
---
Building for general gameplay then if your team leader and doing an event switch the public team goal to events as the event is about to finish to maximise your xp. Once this has been done switch it back to building.
---
As long as you don't have valuable junk death basically means nothing in this game. I frequently empty junk and run into situations I think I'll surely die in just to see and honestly I prevail or can hide way more often than I expect lol. Try mapping new locales in cranberry bog at lvl 10 it's a kick.
---
Hello from someone else who plays with her husband and yes this is basically life during pandemic!  76 is like our second job or something.  
---
Anyway, similar happened to me when the two of us where fighting my first wendigo colossus.  That stupid thing sucks so many resources.  We almost had it killed and we both got kicked from the server.  F. That.  Frustrating.  He is level 2?? And I‚Äôm like 188. We still haven‚Äôt launched a nuke.  Now I can look forward to Possibly much work for nothing.  Ugh.
---
45 is good, if you do not lose too.much score. Calculate with the double daily score weekend (this weekend), and only buy ranks at the very last day if you have too.
---
i mean, i will NOW lol
---
If they want me to purchase the game again for my new system, this would be the incentive I need.  If I have to rebuild my level 130 character from scratch, I'm just going to play something else.
---
If you go to https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/ on desktop, it's on the right hand side underneath the "create post" button. 
---
Ooo, a mansion of mysteries build would be awesome... I'm into camp building so I always hope that there will be someone who likes building on my "building" events team (but that's been fairly rare so far)
---
The atoms are probably going to your Bethesda account
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hui4kn/bug\_atoms\_received\_by\_challenges\_arent/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hui4kn/bug_atoms_received_by_challenges_arent/)
---
i agree,
---
i just dont take workshops and havent missed them at all
---
ultimately, thats just what i wanted to say and i didnt mean to offent you or anything
---
i actually would love a hardcore server without legendaries and full on pvp
---
imo a lot of the balance problems come from legendary gear and after all id love to have a good pvp system in adventure mode
---
Yea I have no idea why it shows up there but nowhere else!
---
Again with I say thank good im on xbox cause all my 360, Xbox 1 and 1x purchase have carried over for my stuff
---
Good job I think the edginess of your post
---
I purchased the game on steam and created a Bethesda account to change my name from the random letters. When I try to do the ink change and log in with Bethesda account it tells me that the free trial is over and the only option is to quit. So I cannot see if my missing atoms are there. 
---
The shop tells me I only have 300 atoms but occasionally the map shows my correct total of over 1000, but I cannot spend them.
---
As others have said bullion is the new cap sink. However it is a limited sink and only holds 40k caps in bullion that also gets filled by the treasury note (received through quests) mechanic. The bullion can only be used for character limited items (no trade). So at some point bullion will be like serum recipes were and we will all need to find a new caps sink.
---
It won't even let me play Nuclear Winter because of my better health bars mod, but cheaters in any game are a plague
---
It is because they have synergies with perks and consumables
---
Actually, subtitles are localized in 13 languages, while only 6 languages are voiced. So, the script might not exist for all the supported languages, and it would need to be translated for example to Chinese and Korean.
---
Have you visited your dealer service on regular basis?
---
Things tend to turn into a turd if it is not serviced!
---
Bullion and when there‚Äôs a dupe lots of players sink caps into those
---
I'll have to try that. Thanks!
---
It's been less than a week and the FO76 week runs Tuesday - Tuesday so I wouldn't expect anything for another day. If anyone has appealed, and of you are truly innocent why wouldn't you?, it will take time to fact check and go through data archives.
---
The banwave was not a one time event but is ongoing so I doubt you'll get too much detail as to methods and outcomes. If it is implied some methods are somehow less damaging than other and will automatically be overlooked then Dupers will see it as a green light (and I've already seen at least one video of 'but I didn't dupe guns, only xxxx' so I shouldn't have been banned).
---
Why not play hunter/hunted?
---
I collect unobtainable items, as far as i know indiviual items have never gotten anyone banned. Having more than 5 scrap this at a scrap box did, or large numbers of duped things, but ive never heard of a ban for individual items. My mule has a good 200-300 of those types of items collected (playtest guns, dev plans, glitched out quest items, all that jazz) and is fine. There is always some risk, but i would say its unlikely to be much of a risk. 
---
As for removing items, they did single wipe waves on fasnacht masks before the first fasnacht, as well as hunters hoods and bottlecap mines. There is also an auto delete script running that deletes some unobtainable items (laser musket, thirst zapper, acid soaker, cage armor, spike armor, presidential gauss rifle, winterized PA paint plans, vorpal pistol, JUNK rifle (paintball gun), and i think a few more, but i had all of these when they were removed also, and nothing came of it other than i lost the items.)
---
They could re-make survival mode into something really great with some proper balancing.  Nothing was more exciting to me than survival mode, while it had it's issues, there is nothing better than the thrill of going about your business while always having to worry about the threat of the only truly dangerous enemy in this game, another human being, trying to stop you.  I would play the shit out of a new survival mode with fresh characters and some real balance changes like you suggested.
---
Unfortunately, I really do think that something like this is so far down on their priority list.  And people are still gonna complain and say they don't want development time and resources wasted on something they don't want, that's how these types of things always pan out.
---
Maybe in 2021 we will see Survival re-mentioned in a road-map somewhere or something but I will not hold my breath.
---
Shouldn't have ever left
---
This happened to me when I went to title screen then closed out the game the log on with a different toon
---
&gt;Anti-Venom: Has been renamed ‚ÄúFunky Duds,‚Äù
---
Truly the update we've all needed.
---
In addition to using a building team to increase int + thus xp, I recommend the mutations herd mentality and egg head if you aren't already using them + eating brain fungus soup
---
Well people do it cuz the most optimal builds require you to be low health and out of power armor, they straight up won‚Äôt do the queen if it‚Äôs in a rad zone
---
Encyptid too if your holding a pylon  it will show your character name instead of your account nane.
---
Edit: im aware that seeing your character name is only client side, was just offering another instance of where your character name is visible in game.
---
It's coming out on the new systems, there's no doubt.
---
I'd be happy to help you, add me to steam and ingame, same username as on here! I can hop on now if you like :) (Oh and you can keep the outfit, I have a few already, I'd just be happy to help)
---
Not to mention that you get x4 ore when you use a full set of Excavator......
---
Worst is when server boots you, and you cannot rejoin because the server is full
---
I have 350 purified water that I can put to use too, if it's required for it.
---
For the record I support survival. 
---
But there were still griefers in adventure when survival was around. Griefers don't want a fair fight. 
---
It still doesn't justify opposing survival.
---
Weird everytime ive tried to fight someone at a workshop since patch 20 the never turn hostile for me
---
in general, yes, but you might want to try to get a more reliable ISP to minimize potential frustration
---
By the end of this week, you need to be rank 45.
---
This has been talked about and posted gazillion times already (hint: do a search) but 1 Int = 2% xp. So "building" is best for your ordinary running around and killing stuff. While "events" is good if you only do events. The best case would be to use "building" and have group leader switch to "events" when the event is about to finish, then switch right back to "building".
---
I bet people laughed at Morpheus too, until he proved The Matrix real ;)
---
I could never get used to the Xbox remote.  Hopefully they didn't change the PS remote too much.
---
I disagree, I think being overencumbered is a game mechanic you don't want to completely lose. It's already comically easy to gather all the junk in the game.
---
Since taking that back pack mod that lowers the chem weight by 90%, I find I‚Äôm usually stuffed with chems.
---
That would be one of the best-case scenarios, I think - have the Fallout 5 protagonist wake up in the Vault where the Appalachia simulation was taking place :D
---
Thats a weird one. Its supposed to be just having 2 arms will do it, but I've heard its actually the chest piece that gives the effect? Never tested it myself. I always just used a full set.
---
I haven't seen that :-o
---
Must investigate!
---
Why?
---
As a initial release player like you who came back for wastelanders I can say now might be a great time to come back since youll have a bunch of new content to play before the new BOS update comes out. And the game now is much different.
---
Well I guess you did care, because you went and deleted your own post!
---
I'm sorry man I was just caught up in the hate and I didn't mean any I'll will like I just edited in my post it just feels like gatekeeping for lower level or returning players.
---
Do you have pacifist mode on? It‚Äôs a must
---
Didnt you quite this game like 7 months ago cause no one cares about your whiney posts
---
What an absolute unit
---
dont bother with this event tends or just assume you arent high level enough
---
You needed to have been playing around a certain time frame to get blessed with a bunch of free packs.  Don't remember exactly when that was but I had them too, started playing around 1 year ago and just tried nuclear winter a week or 2 back for the first time.  Started with 180 packs, that was a nice surprise.
---
If you're on Pc I can help run you through a silo in twemty minutes or so, no cheating just the whole experience (same name\^)
---
I try all the time, nobody queues.  It's not great and not very suspenseful either, as an active event.  It shows you pretty closely where your target is and doesn't last more than 10 minutes unless people hide, which makes it worse.  The suspense I'm looking for is during normal play, having to be on my toes in case I hear player gun shots, or footsteps.  Maybe hopping on mic and discussing if they're friendly or savage enemy.  Making choices
---
That is frickin awesome! Well done!
---
I was on my 3rd character when I read a post from someone on this sub noting that how many items you have in your inventory significantly impacts the speed of crafting. I am a hoarder. I dropped a bunch of holotapes / notes I didn't truly need, common outfits that I didn't wear regularly, etc. and they were absolutely accurate. Crafting is still slow with a less-than-ideal user interface but it's significantly more tolerable now.
---
absolute unit
---
I would also be willing to help. I'm online now if that's any use to you and just messing on my alt so feel free to add or let me know- I was just considering doing a nuke run as I need some flux for my alts underarmour. 
---
Same name as here.
---
Shared loot and Experience during event would solve it more than it would introduce issues like AFK even doers (which can be fixed by not auto-starting an event for people already in area when it starts) or people who do nothing, because they don't impact the event negatively (with exception of SBQ).
---
Highlight the challenge to see requirements.
---
Under normal conditions it takes 2-3 people to kill it within 15 seconds.
---
I'm all for survival mode. I ain't gonna play it, but lord knows some of y'all need a place where you can go shoot each other for a while. I was as sad as anyone when I found out it was shut down.
---
I think at this stage most people are probably aware that you aren't shooting them on purpose, although that doesn't stop people taking advantage of it and trying to wipe you out when you aren't expecting it. This game could use a whole rework of the emote system, considering the lack of text chat and peoples unwillingness to use voice chat, a good emote system is so vital and this game is sorely lacking.
---
I don't know but I can say that unfortunately my Nuka Cola projection lamp regularly did not cast shadows. I tried everything I could think of and it still only worked maybe 10% of the time. Eventually I gave up and have taken a break from using it :(
---
Your title isn‚Äôt ‚Äúclaim a workshop‚Äù though - it requires you to build specific things within a camp or workshop and these are listed on the daily / weekly challenge. 
---
Usually you‚Äôre required to:
---
Build 5 stairs / doors
---
Build 10 water sources (hand pumps)
---
Build 5 floor decorations (mats)
---
Build 5 sets of shelves 
---
Build 20 electrical connects and/or generators (basic wooden pylon is cheapest)
---
Theres 2 dailys for foundation ??? Or one for each ????
---
I had the exact same thought, still looks cools with just the outfit though.
---
ohh thank god. Have not realized that it says i have to build something. x)
---
na not really
---
Great shot!
---
no reason to be sorry at all
---
anyways have fun nonetheless and maybe well see us in appalachia one day üòÅüëçüèº
---
Of course but I use TSE [50.cal](https://50.cal) and can get a bit Gung-Ho, and some still take offence.
---
Ok, thank you so much!!
---
I love how the lower levels impress the higher ups with the grinds.
---
About 18 oil can be had at the Silva Homestead on the far west of the map.
---
They have more balls than some higher levels. I like fighting them and tend to give them goodies.
---
I was playing on Saturday and just doing a bunch of server hops doing the encryptid event after buying 19 cards.
---
The runs were fine, I'll spare people my bitching of people seemingly being unable to read the instructions of "Activate Pylon." But there was one run where as soon as I activated the final Pylon and the imposter had its shield sapped. The guy who was kiting the imposter had an M2 with the glitched laser splitter barrel. Which caused him to, no joke, kill the imposter instantly before I could even fire a shot. Even though I was already aiming at it. I really want those glitched weapon with the laser splitters to be removed or fixed. I can live with the BE gat plasmas, even if those people are also dicks during Guided Meditation by vaporizing everything. But they can't insta kill SBQ or Imposters. 
---
Just need to make it to where everyone in events gets the drops from legendaries, even if they didn't hit it. Same with XP, since during radiation rumble no one ever wants to go get ore because they lose out on all the drops. Hell they could just reduce event XP to like 75% for people that didn't tag an enemy in that case to make it so not lucrative to leech the events.
---
Yep I sold my AAE gauss to the whitesprings vendor, out of necessity üò≠ I got to lvl. 75ish and was so bogged down with crap that I turned my main into a mule, and started a new character HAHA
---
If your are on PC and want help with a silo run, hit me up. I launch them all the time.
---
August 18th to the 24th
---
If they're behind now, odds are they'll be behind near the end of the 10 weeks.
---
I'll see where I am near the end before buying ranks, but I've also got 2 FO1st Atom payments between now and then.
---
I think 50% limb damage is also magical.
---
That would be awesome! Im at work now but will be home to do this around 4:00PM PST. will you be on later at all?
---
you're definitely going to want to take advantage of that XP bonus as much as possible. From all the things I've read, if you only do the daily and weekly events you need to do all the nuclear winter ones too if you intend to actually finish the event. 
---
Bethesda didn't leave a lot of room for people to get every award.
---
Of course its always possible they will/have changed things to make it easier.
---
And your a pile of shit
---
You're not wrong, and with the game's balance even a fair fight would be hard in survival.  But I think it did make an impact on the frequency and amount of griefers in adventure, those weeks after survival got removed holding workshops was brutal.  
---
Thank you for your support!
---
Part of me wonders why people are still using legacy lazers for her lol
---
Beautiful! I have a knack for photography and I love roaming around with my prosnap capturing gripping moments in Appalachia.
---
That's a nice story. This is a good community. Not perfect, but we try. üòÇüëç
---
Lucky! I'm on PS4 and my camp device skin definitely does not show up just by selecting it in the atom shop. I was really disappointed because I put a lot of work into my camp and am not motivated to scrap the entire thing just to see the skin.
---
Whats that, about 5.5 hours? I should be on sometime around then. That'll be 9am for me.
---
Bloodied puncturing power fist - I feel like people think I'm an idiot when I go running in to the SBQ with my first, no power armor lol But I can usually tank pretty well and dish out some damage. Unfortunately on PC so can't team up.
---
Question for you guys tho, how much damage can you do per hit on the SBQ? I seem to be able to hit 300-1000 or so depending on how low my HP gets. Wondering if that's high or low lol
---
EDIT: talking about strats, this is the build I've been running for bloodied powered fist. I switch some things out here and there depending on the situation, but this is my default go to (with all armor pieces being unyielding)

---
Changing character names should absolutely be a feature.
---
Bethesda: "Sure! 1000 caps each"
---
Seems to be how the npc vendors work.
---
I appreciate it!! I'll be on closer to 4:00PM PST today (and most weekdays). If any of those times work for you, I'll reach out!
---
Pepperoni rolls don‚Äôt give u +65 CW
---
A curse upon Bethesda if they tease us with that precious little recalibrated Liberator in the Settler questline and don't let us have one as our own little buddy down the line.
---
My camp is southeast of the settlers camp.  At the top of the cliff I have a lead deposit.  At the base in a cave I have acid.   Takes a bit of juggling to get the camp in just the right spot to access both though.  (It has to be halfway down the cliff)...
---
So you agree that you are not a normal condition ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
As a PvE player, I loved how Survival and NW gave people who wanted that the opportunity to PvP without turning Adventure into a grief fest. 
---
Sadly Bethesda didn't listen to the players and allowed character movement between modes (which they fixed in NW). 
---
My ONLY issue with those modes existing is having cosmetics locked behind them. I do think your 30% is far too high, probably closer to 5%.
---
Mutations stack.  You can have all of them at once if that's what you really want.  You should consider using the perk cards Starched Genes and Class Freak both in luck.  Starched Genes prevents you from getting or losing mutations randomly.  Class Freak reduces the negative side affect of mutations by a %.
---
There is a ~~bug~~ feature with mutations that if you use Rad-X you will cause mutations to lose their effect for the duration of it's effect. Diluted Rad-X and Radshield don't have that problem.
---
great.
---
Did you miss the first part where I said I wasn‚Äôt sure on how to search through posts and that it might have been asked already? Purely to avoid being pointed exactly what you just said. Thanks for the info though.
---
Ikr. But preferably 500 max each
---
YES.  I loved in survival mode when I would encounter another player and I had to decide in a second "is this guy friendly or not?"  If I hesitated and I was wrong I was most likely dead.
---
A full week's worth of SCORE is about 20,000.
---
At the end that's six ranks.
---
It's been three weeks and I'm Rank 47. My personal estimation is that it'll take about nine total weeks, playing casually but consistently to complete dailies and weeklies to hit 100 or very close. The season is like ten to twelve weeks long, so missing a week should be fine.
---
I also wouldn't be surprised if we didn't see more events and other opportunities to earn SCORE approaching the end of the season to give people opportunities to catch up.
---
I've also seen people hardcore grinding that are already in the 80s. If you gotta buckle down and grind for a couple days to catch up a bit, do it.
---
Do your best, and buy the last few ranks you need at the end of the season. Don't panic.
---
You'll find plenty of people willing to help. I see someone else also said they would- according to your timeframe that would unfortunately be midnight for me so I won't be on at that time myself.
---
Seems the other person will be so hopefully you can get it sorted there. If not the offer is indeed open for another time.
---
Good luck!
---
For sizable portion of the community, it is a biggest flaw
---
Lmao damn turds
---
= was too lazy to do the search, anyone can type in stuff on the search bar.
---
I thought so too, I just put a few shots at her so I could get the xp when she died, getting to loot het was a welcome bonus, scriped the legendaries so when my alt hits 50 I can hopefully get some good rolls at the purveyor.
---
lol that‚Äôs hilarious üòÇ
---
bravo
---
Wow. You‚Äôre really not getting it...
---
You only get them from events with exclamation marks on them.
---
Got nothing to lose. Just trying to grind XP while DXP is going on.
---
Imagine if you could go to the Wayward and find a table of players to join a game of Caravan. Could make it a useful spot again, and be good for high levels and noobs to do something that doesnt require big guns.
---
I had this on my 6-7 silo run, I usually solo the silo as it's a lot easier than in a group, but on this run I noticed more robots than the last times but didn't think much of it, continued until it was time to put my card in, when To my left I noticed a shimmer and looked and saw a guy in chameleon invis, I got on my Mic and told him to GTFO I aint doing shit until he buggered off, after 5 mins he fecked off, I do have a kinda deep threatening voice in RL So maybe that helped :)
---
But rule of thumb , check your back before you do your codes.
---
Its an endgame item, you should have to do an endgame activity to get it, there is almost no other reason to drop nukes at the moment (other than the obvious)
---
It would be ... interesting ... if a handful of irritations we thought were bugs were actually placed intentionally by Bethesda on behalf of Vault Tec.  Not sure which bugs I'd be able to laugh off if they turned out to be features, though.  My inability to fast travel reliably has me cussing out the game on a nightly basis.
---
I didn't get banned. I got a suspension pending investigation email. I wouldn't say I'm 100% innocent, as I did buy weapons from people that I am sure were duped, as many many other people did. I did no duping of my own, yet I got banned. I know people on here are going to say oh you deserve it blah blah blah blah blah, but the fact is that many of the dupers are still out there still playing the game. So yes, I am pissed then I got hit so hard for simply buying weapons with caps that I obtained legitimately. This whole ban wave is a complete joke and the day after I was suspended, Bethesda charged me for another month of Fallout 1st. I have pictures of the email regarding the suspension, and my bank account transfer with dates and everything. I have emailed them three times telling them I either want my account back or I want my money back in my account, I would much rather have my account back but if they're not going to do that I want my money back understandably.
---
It's not how many rads you take.
---
Think of it as a percent chance every tick of rads you take, longer you're taking rads, higher the chance you'll end up with a mutation. But at the same time it does mean simply running past a rad barrel can give a mutation.
---
I always go for bounties. If they‚Äôre under level 50 I‚Äôll kill them, throw a thumbs up and go away. If they‚Äôre higher than that I‚Äôll still give them a thumbs up, but I‚Äôll also take their junk.
---
If you‚Äôre over 50, you know how to not get wanted and you know to stash your stuff. Your junk pays the cost of fast travel and bullets.
---
Don‚Äôt rage quit, wait 10min or so then you can respawn and even loot the sheep if others finished the event successfully
---
It‚Äôs really perplexing that they don‚Äôt update the camp terminal with this kind of information. It already tells you when the opossum and biv dailies are available. Why not expand that to other dailies and currency timers?
---
My wife rage quit for the first time doing this quest we were like level 60 had very little gear. Power armor helped a lot. Till then we never used the stuff. Later we did find out that normal gear can out do PA.
---
Wrong. Mutations from serums are unaffected by Starched Genes.
---
Clarification - Starched genes doesn't stop serums from working.  Once the serum wears off you can still lose the mutation by disabling the card.
---
If they went extreme with clean slate characters, full kit drops and removed all legendarys I'd never put it down.  
---
I agree it's so far down the list, just confused at r/fo76 adamant position against it.  Seems myopic to just downvote any mention of a PVP outlet, then complain about players trying to PVP them.
---
Not at all, it's just bad usability. Different sets of power armor should not have the same name by default. I knew that they did and I still accidentally picked the wrong one. If you don't want to scrap the other sets, I find it very helpful to rename them (exa: T-51, Excavator, etc.) Also, if you put a skin on them from the atom shop, the atom shop icon can help differentiate them
---
That's the thing I would just rather give them the workshop than fight them. I was just being salty earlier so ignore the earlier post.
---
Rad-X suppresses mutations, not Rad-Away
---
It really would make sense, though, within this universe that we know and love, if the lack of death permanence in a semi-persistent world was because nothing is real.  And how the eff do we explain Nuclear Winter without being a sim?  Sure, vault experiments have led to much murder, but it's different when you can fight the same person repeatedly in a weird nuclear-storm situation.
---
Yes I love this :) Thank Youz
---
I'm not panicking,i'm at 61 and have all the time I need.
---
What I mean is that many are seeing this double daily weekend as some kind of mega boost. But if you're over lvl 50 in the run, that weekend will just be a small help.
---
I wish my graphics were that good (750 Ti here) she looks like an angry potato with wings for me, Nice pic :)
---
Not a bug - it's intentional. It's mentioned in one of the loading screen hints.
---
when in doubt uninstall the whole thing and do a fresh re install
---
I end up giving me sbq rewards to the lowest level player or I make them a full set of gear after, just because they had balls
---
I once defeated the Legendary Sentry bot in Grafton Steel with only the torso and left side of a T-51 suit
---
Stock up on ammo. The Primal Cuts events are where you get the meat you turn in and they‚Äôre almost constantly running. You don‚Äôt want to have to stop and farm materials while you could be hunting.
---
Just tried to recreate this in-game, using a missile launcher, and both versions of the fat man as well. The trail isn‚Äôt the same. Missile launcher looks the closest but is significantly smaller than in the video, and the graphic of the trail is pure black, vs the bright white fade to black trail seen in the video.
---
The SAMs &amp; Nukes look similar, but they wouldn‚Äôt be shot from that location. And there is a random encounter location not far from that spot. Hmmm, it is interesting! As someone who‚Äôs been on the hunt for zetans since day 1, I do hope it‚Äôs related!
---
That is actually really funny hahaha. These lower levels have no fear (I'm one of them).
---
Fully agree :D
---
I am in the same place. Since I have more than 2000 hours in, one of my characters had a set of vanguard power armor and vampire/junkies/antiarmor/instigating jewels.
---
I said to myself: 'lets be healthy again'. I cured my mutations, moved perks, etc. 
---
A day later I am back to bloodied unyielding. 
---
You can't go back from doing real damage. Even role-play wise, I like the idea of being vulnerable but able to kill enemies with one-two shots and short bursts, or a headshot.
---
Fantastic shot! Beautifulüëç
---
I only got grind to grind yesterday and took 1 character from 219 to 239. Went from level 49 score to level 56. Wish I could've grinded the whole weekend.
---
Sorry, just took me a while and thought I'd share
---
I finished that part of the quest last night and about lost it when I saw the little guy take off across the golf course. I just want one to follow me around, it could be a purely cosmetic pet for all I care
---
And the biggest balls award goes to.
---
Still no fix for the VATS bugs? Fuck it, then.
---
Shhh!
---
Yeah i know ):
---
I think so. For immersion I like having a robot in my camp. It is kinda lame you have to pay for the other skins and collecting program upgrades, but if you can swing it go for it. I like being able to get a few blood packs every now and then from mine just for stims
---
Yo ho diddly dee it's a pirate's life for me.
---
Double daily score for 3 days.
---
&gt; Vital Equipment: Fixed an issue that could prevent Vital Equipment from progressing if the player killed the Raider Thief before talking to Ward.
---
I don't think it sounds like it will but I hope this doesn't fix the issue where I automatically have what ever goober Ward is looking for.
---
Especially with the tent glitch.
---
If that can all become part of a big reveal someday, I can dig it.  I just want there to be SOME canon explanation for how this MMO version of the universe works!
---
There‚Äôs several variants of ‚Äúmagic‚Äù weapons that aren‚Äôt hacked, they‚Äôre just glitches with how the game mechanics worked. People figured them out and have known about them for months now, Bethesda still haven‚Äôt fixed them. Right before Wastelanders dropped I decided to try one myself (saw angryturtle‚Äôs video on them and realized I had a couple candidates on my mule), so literally the night before the patch someone dropped a nuke and I went to it.
---
I literally took her from 100% to 40% in ~ 6 seconds before she took off and I stopped firing. I let everyone else get some DPS time in, then opened up and finished her off again in like 8 seconds. 
---
There were only 2 other guys at the nuke and they were barely scratching her. 
---
I‚Äôm fairly certain I could have killed her in one burst even fighting her legendary regen if I‚Äôd wanted to.
---
There's some things we don't talk about.
---
Lmao.
---
Nope. The best berserker does not come even close. And I have put more than two months tweaking a berserker build to perfection. 
---
Plus, Unyielding is king. Nothing sneaks as a bloodied Unyielding ninja with 33 agility.
---
This happens often when I use the windows key instead of alt-tabbing.  I found that the game fails to return to the "original resolution boundaries."  That's what I call it.
---
As far as I can tell, the only way to fix it, is restarting or running in a borderless window(which makes the game run worse).
---
Remove the post we dont want this fixed
---
Does it help that I put this as a question and not a bug? Ill delete this post üòÇ still curious wtf is going on.
---
Yeah to hell with that lol. I have Fallout New Vegas and Fallout 4 but I just started new playthroughs on plus a few other games that will keep me busy for a very long time haha. I hope to get my account back but if not it's not the end of the world
---
üò±
---
It's because you picked one up out in the world outside of the quest. It's one of those known 'features' most people are okay with.
---
Yes sir üò≠
---
Man I'm sorry I wasn't trying to get personal and ruin your fun and I was being unfair when representing the point of pvp players.  Insults don't make valid discussion and misrepresents your valid points.
---
Duchess better watch out. New thiccy in the wasteland
---
1 surface to air event during double xp got me like 500 score just killing scorched beasts yesterday.
---
Most public teammates won't assume by default that you want to play with them. Sometimes other players from my public team will stop by wherever I am and wave and say hello, but if I don't seem in the mood to play as a group, they leave. The community for this game is typically quite friendly and respectful compared to my previous experiences with similar games.
---
Bloodied is not the issue: Unyielding is. Bloodied by itself is not enough to make a powerhouse of a character. Bloodied + Unyielding is the broken thing.
---
If they gave it the same sort of "emotional" bleeps that Lonesome Road's ED-E has, that good round boy would have a serious contender for the role of my favorite buddy bot.
---
Today i didn‚Äôt. I‚Äôve got another exam on Wednesday and I‚Äôve played from 11am to 6pm. Lord help me üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I don't know what's going on with it but I do like not having to go collect wards stuff everyday.
---
Sorry I'm just really tired that people keep persecuting the PvP community
---
I kill them and send a message explaining how being "wanted" works and tell them to come get their junk. Everytime- they just have no idea what is going on.
---
Do your weekly freely. And no the xp challenge won't be doubled as it is a weekly as well. It's stated to be a weekend for dailies. So basically the score of 6 days of dailies in 3.
---
I remember those days.
---
People didnt like survival mode. It was totally dead when they took it offline. I was server hopping for something once, and figured I'd do it in survival, and it kept dropping me in the same server because only 1 was running. 
---
NW is waaaaayyyyy better. I probably play more nw than adventure. Equal chance, no vatsing players, no duped god tier loadouts, no legendaries at all. It's awesome. I feel bad for pc players that dont get to enjoy it for what it is. I know a bunch of people that have no interest in adventure at all, but play NW religiously.
---
Ps4 or PC?
---
Well, im sry for you. But you guys seem to be so very passionate about playing F76 and i love it so much. You had me on the edge of my chair all the time, reading thru this. As others mentioned before, you seem to have a real talent with words or at least story telling. Next time you gonna do it!
---
I 2nd this. It's utter bs how they keep losing those damn kits ü§∑
---
Need to be a cap Sink... ward gave quest... go to shady cave...talk, pay a few caps get the item. Go to ward... XP gold  and bye bye
---
The Valves for the raiders? Same...go purchase return...  and bye bye...
---
Dont see it
---
I mean I really try to keep an open mind since the commentors below brought up very good points about my hypocrisy.  I would like to have more options for both communities so people can enjoy what they would like and shutting down pvp contradicts my own point.
---
Exactly!!  I didn't even play much survival because of the aid drops being ridiculous, but it still straightened out session aligments.  Removing or limiting Nuclear Winter rewards would be an awesome move to keep adventure AFK people ruining it too, but Bethesda doesn't think in logic.  
---
I think 5% would represent the players that stick around hoping for this to happen.  That 25% difference are the players that checked it out and decided wow this was false advertisement, I can't shoot anyone.  
---
The game was kinda in the middle at launch and has been moving to cater to the majority of PVE Fallout 4 players.
---
The other day I joined on my lvl 7 and got loot, some high lvls complained for not getting anything. lol
---
Bugthesda, is whats going on.
---
Welcome to fallout 76
---
Thats fare
---
Nice come back and well thought our response lol .. go play NW.
---
I tried a martial artist monk for two months. Absolutely unarmed (no gauntlets, nothing, because I wanted to punch with both hands, trigger that animation) who would go full health and get stronger as he took damage. Quite immersive.
---
Make it right?  Nope. Everyone of us agreed to the eula that gives Bethesda the right to do what they are doing. No where in there does it say that they will make amends if at the end of their due diligence they determine that they wrongly suspended or banned a user.
---
They did with the ban wave last week, why would this be different?
---
Go play sims, Minecraft, elsworld, 2n life
---
OMG, that is an amazing, amazing picture. Well fucking done, excuse my language.
---
He continues to be the lone bright spot in the dark apocalypse. Legend has it he was originally robobrained from carrot top. Only a legend though
---
Yeah I'm still getting them, wish I wasn't though, I have over 2300 of them now.   
---
Just to be sure, you're on a character that you've done the vault 79 raid with?
---
What's the source on that info? Can't say I've heard such a claim before.
---
They give you 30. Carnivore doubles it to 60 and strange in numbers increases that further.
---
It's what a friend told me some time ago
---
I‚Äôve been playing since beta. Been through several ban waves with no problems. My character is a legit level 1039. I got hit for holding some weapons for someone and for letting it take place in my private world. There is no way I can start over. After thousands of hours and hundreds of dollars in the atom shop and a year of 1st, if I get banned or wiped I‚Äôm done with this game.
---
colonel gutsy in a pack are the worst
---
What happened to your response
---
Well, don't sweat it too much at this point, you are so far behind unless you spent dasys and days grinding you won't hit the max.
---
ikr .. it's funny how the PvPer's who know how they behave are the ones getting all upset over nothing .. too bad they removed survival.
---
Those two effects have significant downsides while target-specific weapons have only buff with zero downsides, so you get to reap the benefit at full hp and full Specials.
---
They need a middle finger emote
---
That crazy bastard üòÇ
---
I like the chem and booze collecting raider one the best. The chems sell for good money to vendors and the booze covers what Biz needs for his daily 9 times out of 10. Plus some of the chems are useful depending on your play style and are very light.
---
I killed a wanted level 6 yesterday, then dropped him a bunch of stuff, Heart/Wave job done.
---
For some reason, shotguns need vats to cause real damage. Otherwise, you just shoot salt. 
---
Try it.
---
they don't like explosives of any sort
---
If you are just focused on XP, Building is the best... If you're currently using your Lunchboxes, I suggest staying the f\*ck away from Events, as if you're using 4 of them and someone opens one around you, you just lost those 4 Lunchboxes... It's a bug.
---
This is true, or at least used to be. If I was at or near max budget the nuka lamp would not project.
---
Well they sure as hell are going to give me my money back for Fallout 1st that they charge to my card the DAY AFTER they suspended me. Why wouldn't they do their due diligence? That's their job, they can't just target people at random.
---
They already said they won't include legendary perks in patch 21 but in the later patch.
---
EDIT: The ITV article you linked in one of your comments here literally says they won't.
---
Can you please remove this section from your post or at least alter it somehow to avoid further confusion for people who do not know that yet?
---
Nice, I enjoy photomode too... although it could do with a little more if it returns in the next Fallout game.
---
Nope, there is only like  one cunt doing this while others are fine, i use weak weapons during events, why not share with others
---
Wait there‚Äôs a reason some lasers are green and some are not?
---
For some reason I read this as glowing fists, which sounded like a cool weapon skin.
---
Really hmmm I‚Äôll have to check that out good to know thx. Now I have to heal my mutations one by one hoping herbivore come off first
---
Ever since magic heavies became widespread (thanks angry turtle) this a real problem. It can happen with SBQ, Sheepsquatch, assaultron-sheepsquatch , etc. in fact the first time I did the imposter sheepsquatch with my ‚Äúmagic‚Äù gauss mini I flattened the thing in 1.4 seconds. Question marks went up all over and I I had to say over mic, ‚Äúguys my bad. I had no idea it would die that fast. Sorry.‚Äù
---
They removed them due to betas like you who would go their and complain and gets things ruined like the damage cap and the armor and weapon and even white knight nerfs comes from the pve guys
---
it's great fun and i am looking forward to the event
---
Legendary perk system is still a work in progress and to be honest it's still an utter mess, clunky, tedious and useless in its entirety. Hope it's gonna be a totally different thing and they decide to postpone it to a much later date since it's a little bit too far from perfection and still needs a complete rework to become viable, rewarding and user-friendly.
---
Green are ultracite lasers, they doing more damage to scorched, even basic ones
---
Wow your wounds run deep lol
---
Well look on the bright side, medical tech is making great strides to curing deafness!
---
Collecting program upgrades? Don‚Äôt know what that is, but my Fastnacht collectron wants it!
---
The total new vendor plans available for sale with caps I think were only around 20k. Couple of different mods for bows and crossbows, but nearly all new plans are gold bullion and not cap purchases.
---
Source please ?
---
they really need to either increase the 200 bullion per day cap or lessen the treasury notes you get.
---
Not only are the hard core dupers still playing, there are STILL active dupes in the game. The only thing that changed is that a bunch of people took a chance at their dream weapon and got nailed because Bethesda let the dupe run for 5 days. They could have shut the vendor bots down day one and saved a bunch of people and themselves a ton of headaches.
---
It‚Äôs from a flaming floater! We tried various ways to recreate the shot and couldn‚Äôt, moved on a little bit and got attacked by floaters and the flaming shot is identical to the one in the video.
---
Did I miss something?  I don't recall seeing one person on here any time recently even bring survival up, let alone be opposed to it returning.    Why would anyone be against an optional mode?  
---
I'm on pacifist mode, not interested in pvp and it has no effect on me, but I'd be all for pvpers getting more shit to do.
---
Been here forever thru every asinine nerf that the "community asked for" then they up and quit and leave us with poo
---
It saves a few seconds and a few clicks if after you select the ammo type to trade in, instead of hitting confirm two more times, just hit back (0 on ps4) and it will take you back to the ammo select screen.
---
So for me I hit X to add ammo to the machine, than hit O at the next screen to take me back to the ammo select screen. Rinse and repeat. Vs spamming X and having to go through more screens on the terminal.
---
The downsides of junkies and bloodied are entirely negligible when you look at the support they get from the build. If you‚Äôre running junkies you sit at about 50% health to get max damage and when you‚Äôre doing that you get benefits from Uny still so the special loss from addictions is negated and you get to have more health than a bloodied. Bloodied has the highest damage out of any build, but also has good survivability with serendipity and nerd rage so the ‚Äúsignificant downside‚Äù you mentioned is pretty much nothing once to look at the supporting pieces for the build. However the zealots and other effects like that have the downside of dealing less damage than those in all situations no matter what. If they got a damage buff their downside is that they are only given a benefit when fighting specific mobs otherwise a 1 Star variant is the same as a non legendary weapon which if you ask me is a good enough downside given bloodied and junkies have pretty much no downside.
---
I use a junkies prime ultracite Gatling laser and it's beams are red, I think there's a big with a mod that changes it to red
---
I grabbed this guy this weekend too.  He‚Äôs pretty funny and gains me some caps by selling his findings.  I have him set to chem/booze as well.
---
Please.
---
Ok, rule 9: no witch hunting. This is obviously not witch hunting. This is clearly being hunted. Did the text body say something other than "fuck this fucking fucker"?
---
Run a suppressors bloodied build
---
Obvious troll is obvious.  
---
Take my downvote.
---
With radiation rumble I don't even bother with objectives, its purely to grind XP. I am that arsehole one shotting everything in sight.
---
Are you for real?..
---
People like the idea of survival mode but not the implementation.  Dropping 50% of your characters entire AID stash, because traveling pharmacy doesn't effect stash?  Awful 
---
It definitely got that way, joining a low population server pretty much put you top three on the map as soon as you killed a mob and then people would find you and kill you.  It sucked.  I like NW too, but I also like Rust and they're very different.  
---
With a couple small changes survival could be suspenseful adventure for end game players.
---
I really hope so... really....
---
Amazing photo! Nicely done!
---
I honestly can't tell if this is sarcasm or not
---
Wait....you aren't impressed by their bloody weapon and unyielding armor? You aren't impressed with them doing 2,000 damage to enemies with 400 HP?
---
I ran into 3 this weekend. So yes, I think double XP brings them out
---
Oh FFS... This guy ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Survival shouldn't be a mode, you should have to choose that type of character.   No mixing with Adventure mode
---
Why not? I you really need one it gives an overpriced option.
---
You made my day. I seriously feel so much better. I‚Äôm coming for you, Site Alpha!
---
Yep. Poison damage in this game scales to dangerous levels. It's why I'm so happy the legendary perk for poison resist will work with PA since that's all I use.
---
Even with full health and full T-65. There was a glowing 3 star legendary Mirelurk king in Wendigo cave. Even with my stringent weapons I couldn't kill it in time for it to run up to me, swipe me once. And drop my health so fast I didn't even notice before I could use a stimpack.
---
I'm also certain that their range sonic attack also applies poison damage.
---
Surprised he even made it though the door with the size of his balls
---
I'm at the point now where theres nothing I really want to spend bullion on, until this evening I'd forgotten to hand notes in for about a week straight and hadn't seen smiley for about 2 weeks, they'd need to increase the actualy bullion cap if they were going to increase the daily cap, or find a better system for giving endgame rewards.
---
Now that, that is a fantastic idea.
---
Oh christ... Don't bring that shit here! There is no racism there, you are just an idiot.
---
Building is the general XP party.  Events is the only other one worth joining for XP, sake, but if you wanna grind levels probably just eat cranberry relish, brain fungus soup, inspirational 3 star, crack a lunch box, clear out west tek, then server hop and join another building party, or any other party if there isn't a builders to get the xp bonus from inspirational as well as mutation perks.    
---
Bloodied full unyielding set also best bet for INT maxing.
---
Edited my post to state that the article you linked in the comments below contains that info.
---
Yea here's a tip:
---
Don't Dupe
---
So cool!!!!!
---
I've been trying since yesterday but it did nothing. I tried again and still nothing, then my game crashed and I had to reboot. Since then it finally works, so weird.
---
Thanks for the comment because I was giving up and it suddenly fixed itself after trying one last time.
---
I seriously don‚Äôt know if you guys are joking or not
---
yeah but i'd rather have the bullion than the useless notes that i can only get rid of 20 a day
---
To be fair I was stuck at home waiting on covid test results so I had some time on my hands
---
Agreed, I think Beth owes me a new space bar, the amount of times I have to batter it to do anything, scrapping 1800 lbs of guns after Line in the sand is not fun........... but necessary  ( gotta get that scrap).
---
I‚Äôm a pvp‚Äôer + agree a survival mode should exist just not as it was. I have no prob finding a fight say after a queen but people are salty AF. In the meantime I‚Äôm gonna keep hopping people @ workshops among other things to get some kills
---
I want a Yawn emote for the Tea event
---
Same lol
---
People say pc is better and on one side they are right but on the other side they are wrong
---
shoulda went with
---
heres a tip " always brush your teeth"
---
the point of your shit joke is to be as mundane as possible
---
Yeah I don't care what these self-righteous assholes say about people deserving people deserving it. I'm sure some people did, but many people including myself and a few other people I know got totally screwed over by Bethesda. I could probably hundreds of dollars into that game through the atom shop and Fallout 1st. The least they could do is give me the courtesy of looking into my case and making things right. Whether I get my account or my money back I don't really care at this point I am so done with what was once my favorite video game developer. I'm giving it till the end of the week then I'm posting screenshots of my emails and and bank transfers all over social media. They want to play hardball, we will play hardball.
---
I was stuck at home because I don‚Äôt like people lol
---
Ummm lol
---
Okay what about nocturnal? It is worse than a normal variant during the day. Not to mention you cant rn control the time that you play unlike fallout 4 where you could just wait until night. Or what about the effect that gives you 100% vats out of combat but when in combat it gives you a downside. There are turds in the game already aside from these effects. I‚Äôm not saying everything needs to be good, but everything should be viable and not just straight up useless when compared to other legendary items that out perform in every category. It‚Äôs poor game design to shoehorn everyone into only a couple weapon prefixes when playing the game and it only cripples build diversity and makes the game all together less interesting to do because everyone is playing on of a couple builds and that‚Äôs it.
---
Buy the game again and use a different account, learn from your mistake and your fallout experience can continue
---
Thank you! I think I may fire it up tonight!
---
Right after release, Scorchbeasts were so ungodly tanky that they weren't even worth it to kill. After quite a few patches and balance passes to both player damage output and enemy durability they're now much easier to kill.
---
On release when I was doing the main quest and got in the glasses cavern and saw the dozens of Scorchbeasts all dead from BoS soldiers I thought "No fucking way they killed a single one of these things with their laser rifles or gatling lasers"
---
Laser rifles still suck but Gatling Lasers are monstrous now.
---
You probably do have a good case for getting that charge back.
---
The Beam focuser changes the beam color on the Ultracite Gatling Laser.
---
I wish it was possible ü§¶üèº I‚Äôll keep bothering them until they update everyone out here I guess
---
This \^ I was totally thinking the same thing while I was sitting on top of the tea pot the other day :P We need an I'm bored emote too.
---
I have literally nothing to add, you duped, you got banned. You deserved it 100% and shouldn't be unbanned.
---
On ps4? I'll happily help you grind
---
Haha yeah and me a new A button, at least that‚Äôs when I get up and do things just carrying around the controller pressing A lol
---
thanks thats what im currently leaning towards im sure i can pick up a cheap copy
---
I'll have you know the only things I eat are melons straight from my farm, with some occasional blackberries. And then chug it down with a decades old soft drink
---
Thank you for being accountable and not blaming evryone else.  I hope you can find a way to wander once more.
---
Yeah me too, I think they should have just done direct bullion rewards and capped what you can earn at 200 a day if they want to stick to that cap. Treasury notes suck.
---
The mask is always stuck on for me unless I die. Usually I make sure and get mauled by the ghouls right before the end, so that I drop the mask and don't get stuck with it. The alternative is to swap servers afterwards.
---
PvP in large part is just a train wreck  in both Adventure and NW. The devs don't know how to balance it in either in my opinion. I enjoy PvP in both modes. Nuclear Winter has enough hackers to leave you with a soured experience after a few matches with the same hackers every time you play. Adventure mode wouldn't be that bad if there was more of a way to get voluntary fights and less hacked gear. Seems like every other server has someone running around with a hacked 50cal. Even most of the people running the hacked stuff aren't particularly good at PvP. The biggest issue I have seen is there is no way for most people to ease into PvP. Getting repeatedly kill by someone doesn't motivate people to keep doing it. I've offered to fight people using whatever they want and rarely get anyone that will bite. I really hope they implement some way to make it easier for those of us that want to PvP to find willing participants because currently the waste majority of people are very vocal about not wanting it. After a certain point the only challenging enemies in the game are other people.
---
Oh Snap ! don't tempt me it would be the only emote I would use.
---
Ss gilli is the same
---
Lvl 24 on the legendary run or just normal lvl? Don‚Äôt worry about the legendary run as they are having double score weekend so you‚Äôll have time to catch up. 
---
Now if you‚Äôre lvl 24 just normal wise, don‚Äôt sweat it either. Enjoy it honestly.
---
Yeah I couldn't even imagine losing all that. We'll see what happens, at the very least all I want is my money back. If I get my money back and my account remains restricted, I will never play 76 again. They totally failed and the development of this game and all the crap that's happened ever since release. Fallout 4 was a masterpiece, 76 has been a goddamn nightmare
---
This post is also mundane but hey you knew you were up to something when you were cheating the game. Also You could try to appeal the ban but I don‚Äôt think that would help much
---
I‚Äôve heard changing your character appearance works too
---
Someone gets it cheers dude , i recognize the mistake i made and one i wont repeat.
---
They really haven't had time yet to do any meaningful changes to it I guess. Won't surprise me if they didn't even fathom our (testers') overall negative reaction to what they came up with.
---
Fallout Noob here, just hit 60 yesterday, would love to join if I can fit in ü§òüèº
---
Love me some deathclaw gauntlet ü™ì
---
Happens in scorched earth as well, just keep mashing the respawn option. Some friends were able to respawn after the event was finished, just hope you get enough hits to be able to loot the enemies.
---
Holy crap is it a bullet sponge......
---
Let me check the coment... is from beth i will edit.
---
EDIT: to many comments... please share the coment and the user here.
---
Guess they should also get rid of fallout 4 too. The institute had them in cages. Cry me a river
---
Hows it mundane?
---
asking for tips through the appeal system?
---
i see 3 decent contributions so far.
---
When I fantasise about surviving in a post apocalyptic wasteland, it‚Äôs not in a hot tub. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs a stupid idea, perhaps I‚Äôm too pessimistic! 
---
There‚Äôs a line in Pitch Black that comes to mind:  
---
*Amazing how you can do without the essentials of life, so long as you have the little luxuries.*
---
Right... But he doesn't want to use bloodied so options are Junkies, Berserkers or Instigating
---
Yeah if you're on console 2nd hand copies are cheap. If you're on PC its fairly cheap on key sites.
---
I totally agree. I used to not agree with other people and they said that Bethesda brought this on themselves, but they have. They didn't take enough time to polish this game up to near perfection, it's just been a big problem from the very start. I was getting kind of bored anyways but it's just the fact of all the time and money I have spent on that game is what it is hard to let go of
---
What a champ
---
I use The Voip but It lags depending on what server I'm dumped on, and also most of the time I'm talking to my self, because as you said no one uses it.
---
Sometimes we hold on to old behaviors from games we started with. I still tend to over level an area in most games, from when 16 bit RPGs would sometimes give you a thrashing for not being leveled enough.
---
Duped 10 guns. Lol your market place posts don‚Äôt look like it was 10 guns. Alpha Mike Foxtrot.
---
It's on xbox and pc gamepass.. No idea about playstation
---
Thankfully I've completed most of my atom challenges already but I'm also having a similar issue. Rn I'm at 3190 atoms, but sometimes it will say I only have 40 for some reason. Kinda unsettling.
---
There Will be more double xp weekends. So no worries there. The legendary run might be difficult to complete tho
---
Many things in this world ain't fair cupcake.
---
The thing that bothers me the most is how heated people get. It‚Äôs a GAME. Even though it‚Äôs online, it‚Äôs still basically a single player game in which you can run around solo or play in a private world without ever having to run in to another player. Play it any way you want. The duped weapons literally have no effect on other players. If it was a game that involved constant interaction with other players I could see being hard on cheating and hacking. Then again, Bethesda doesn‚Äôt do anything about the rampant hacking in Nuclear Winter, which IS the legitimate multiplayer aspect of the game.
---
Holy, shit, fallout noob here and didnt know I can switch team build mid game, thank you for this bit of info friend üôèüèº
---
Hi! I‚Äôd love to help! My IGN is SwampAstronaut.
---
I mean, pot plants would be cool too. some sort of mutated strain with some status effects would be a hilarious but totally unnecessary addition
---
D'OH! You're absolutely correct, thank you.
---
Very nice shot. Well done.
---
I think if the price is high enough to make players choose between pricy convenience and actually going out and gathering it then it would be nice
---
Hey dude, I posted in your last thread, how far away is 4pm pst? I'm in Australia, so I think thats just under 5 hours away? I should be on sometime around then, feel free to add me to steam (so we can organise what we're doing easier through chat) and I'll help you out.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs just something I hoped to do, I find the game really fun but I don‚Äôt really see myself grinding to like lvl 200
---
No where did you get that?
---
yeah i‚Äôm usually able to i have be2525 fixer so i can take a huge chunk of his health out it‚Äôs just hard not to die since he‚Äôs packing a literal weapon of mass destruction on his face that just snipes u like bradley cooper in american sniper so i die a lot
---
Definitely give it a try, you won‚Äôt be let down.
---
no it genuinely was
---
i never would have got my foot in the door if i didnt happen upon 950+ energy bobbleheads sitting at watoga
---
Serious question..... What's wrong with you? That you have soo much time to have that many? I play a couple hours every day if I can.... And I don't even make the 200 gold every day.
---
Killing a workshop attacker doesn't make you wanted, fyi.
---
On Xbox sorry
---
I think the true masterpiece of the console Fallouts was New Vegas. It stuck very closely to the heart and soul of the originals.
---
did they fix the magic weapons?
---
I get what you're saying and I fully agree.  I dont think people should NOT pvp.  It just seems toxic when someone who is over level 50 decides to kill a brand new player for no apparent reason.  Luckily I was at my base so I went into build mode and they just stood there for like 5 minutes waiting for me to exit out so they could kill me.  Just seems like something toxic players would do, imo.
---
i just change the name of my custom ini when i want to play Nuclear Winter. Its pretty fast thing to do. You should also make a shortcut on your desktop for the folder that contains the ini.
---
*These ten times were my first time!*  
---
#Byeeee!
---
Noice TED talk
---
I had this happen once. Changing world did not fix it but restarting the game did. The cursor stopped right before the social window border. 
---
I think it is a problem with the game keeping your mouse in a 4:3 aspect ratio box even though it is set to a 16:9 resolution.
---
That was me earlier last week lololol xD
---
This is how item spawn works.  If you want to keep going after the paint cans, make a route that has another 255 items on it.  [https://youtu.be/YUGQ0xvqT-0](https://youtu.be/YUGQ0xvqT-0)
---
Was your account wiped though? Also, what were you banned for? If you don‚Äôt mind me asking
---
NV Old World Blues has a jazz sound track.
---
I have a melee fighter, it's actually a very fun build if you build it right.
---
ah damn, im on pc I thank you though kind ButtMud lol
---
Did the polish the game recently with a update? When I got back on it looked good  and crisp.. I have a 2070 super so maybe it‚Äôs just my card but I swear it looked different
---
"He has nothing to add"
---
the seagulls self awareness should be commended why bother malac?
---
If you block for session, it guarantees that person to be in the next NW match.
---
/s in case someone actually tried this, but it wouldn't surprise me if this actually worked...
---
Thank you, I did that this morning. Tested Fallout, it worked for a good while, performance fine as usual, until it crashed the same way that it has been.
---
I don't know what the issue is. I don't have this problem with any other game. Everything runs fine, and runs fine for hours - nothing crashes like this. I've updated my GPU drivers, windows, I've fixed the corrupted files, lowered every setting, I do everything I can to keep the PC cool.
---
The game just doesn't want to work, and right now I feel like I should just take the hint and stop playing.
---
I do. Im as anti duper as they come (at least you can be with the amount of duped shit in the market even pre this wave).  To many people just wanna blame bethesda  or other dupers.  Asking forgiveness even on reddit is something most people arnt programmed to do.  Stay safe 7 -6.
---
Thank
---
low levels are the bravest
---
I typically see any mention of PVP downvoted or deleted by op because of the idea it would take development time away from adventure, which still needs work.  "Find another game if you want good PVP" is the usual chirp.  With the recent rise in posts of people getting griefed, thought I could convert some opposition with a different perspective on it.
---
We need more people like you!
---
In some sense though the tier your describing means nothing. On an alt I got a bloodied explosive gun at level 5 and bam right there I skipped the whole tier list. I‚Äôd agree with you if there was some sort of way that you could upgrade a weapon to give it a better effect, but right now bloodied is king on damage and given that the best thing to do in the game right now it to grind for that perfect gear omg enough get that bloodied gun with good rolls there isn‚Äôt much more to do. I think that if they did change it so zealots did more damage than bloodied it would give people a reason to look for a zealots gun when fighting something like the SBQ and as a result Change the meta for people looking to pack the most punch.
---
so then the gold bars are junk? just to make sure since i am coming up to the part of my experience where my stash is almost full and i go through and make sure i keep essentials
---
Oh 100%!!! New Vegas is my favorite Fallout of all time. Just started a new playthrough about a week ago, this run through I'm doing my best to be a good boy LOL. There's so much to do, it's by far my favorite absolutely. Not to mention the graphics are very good too, I love love love it
---
If you're running a sneak commando build, try a BE laser rifle. It'll be dead before it even sees you, It's a she btw, for a specific reason.
---
If you are lucky enough to find 4 people, one or two have no idea what it is exactly and get upset when a high level kills them. Some people just try to hide which is pretty boring. I've had one time where I got a decent fight with another guy in the entrance of a silo because he was chasing the other two guys that went in there to hide.
---
For me it's on PC, bought from steam. I have the 150 from the legendary run on one hand, and sometime, when I've done a challenge that gives some, I see my, I think, second bank which has around 1000 atoms. When I open the shop It gets back to the 150, it gets pretty annoying not being able to spend it.
---
if usefull, my username bethesda is Worrash and I got the fallout 1st sub.
---
Your probably right I have had my fair share of toxic players unused to hate being melted with one shot things change though and one day of ya keep playing you'll be the one on top and it is a good feelin
---
lol that sounds like it'll be me too. its confusing at times with all the missions that build up so quickly but im trying to pace my story to some degree so i can have lots to do yet. which questline brings my to 79?
---
thx for the new wallpaper
---
bet you cant see your toes lol
---
Got this one last night.
---
‚ÄúPeople call you a horder... me, I understand, You‚Äôll have the last laugh when caps are finally replaced by burnt books and empty glass bottles.‚Äù
---
Nice, and they will make the legendary perks available?
---
Meh men meh, cry me a river so I can lick those sweet tears off your cheeks, hmmm so salty! I hope you guys all get permanent bans for being stupid
---
He‚Äôs still beating me :(
---
They're not teams, they're a minor inconvenience when joining a new server so as to get better rewards/activate perk cards.
---
That's how most players use them anyway.
---
I like the addition, but i'm certainly not using them as Bethesda probably intended, as i'm willing to bet is the same for a majority of players.
---
Maybe you're just not very good at managing your time when you play.
---
Look at that majestic beautiful bastard !
---
How fun! Great job! I do the same thing. Got my videography degree almost 20 years ago, now I use it to make fun shots in 76. üòÇ
---
It kinda depends, I'll talk if other people are responsive. This last weekend I was mostly grinding.
---
I can see my character in game, I know that much üòâ
---
Yes.  Hacker.  Bigtime hacker.  Also chinese stealth suit.  I quit taking my heavy guns build in the silos and started using my power fist and stealth.  It's a bit slower but its actually kind of easy.
---
Yeah those are only used for crafting. Gold bullion is completely separate and is similar to scrip.
---
Oh I completely understand that. The inspirational perk card while on teams plus the food bonuses help to get more XP. That will help you catch up some if you had a lvl goal. Also, if you get find a teammate who‚Äôs higher lvl with good guns, they can help you big game hunt to get a bunch of XP.
---
whilst i agree with you , im not here for sympathy , I messed up I accept it.
---
Just think its a little harsh
---
The thing with adventure PvP is that you a) either have a really, really good gear and build and/or b) don't care about dying.  
---
Also PC landscape is much more barren in this regard, no griefers, no messages, no workshop attackers, no nothing, just people hoarding junk and xp to hoard more junk, xp and silly cosmetics, so there's that.
---
you had to "pawn" your game? What does that mean?
---
Nope that's update 22 in September
---
oh good to know! i have the starched genes maxed out for sure but i didn't know i could stack it, that makes things pretty interesting. can't wait to play with that
---
5 scrip is 5 scrip.  Doesn't matter much at higher levels, but it can be pretty important for SPECIAL people.
---
roger, thank you!
---
I wish the lenses provided foreground depth.
---
In my experience, the damn nukes have been way more of a problem. Not sure how anyone else feels about them but any time they happen, I get really upset because it's doesn't take any skill, especially if they wait &amp; launch it once the arena has shrunk enough that the blast zone is literally the same as the playable area.
---
It's already annoying to be on one side of a field and get sniped by a player you don't even see in a battle royale -- it's even more annoying that in this one, they can now just drop a nuke in an area without even knowing where anyone actually is. If someone outguns me, fair enough -- not to upset. Any time a nuke drops on me, I'm real mad lol
---
touche bobby bouche
---
I realy wish more people fought melee.
---
Ah I didn't think of that. I was disappointed last week when I had to switch. We had a Level 2 join our team and it was fun watching him make it up to level 14, but after doing Monster Mash I was annoyed by the mask instead of my normal head, so I finally swapped server.
---
That is magnificent!
---
Stalkers drops on melee weapons. How worthless is that? It all makes for great scrip.
---
So there will be on only bug fixes basically
---
It feels so true. SBQ in the nuke zone feels way harder.
---
Just because something's easy to accomplish doesn't mean it should have less of a punishment. Imagine applying that to something in real life, say, lying about/concealing something. Easy enough to do, but can cause bigger problems further down the line. I'm pretty sure counterfeit money isn't looked upon lightly.
---
I figured this was most likely the case.
---
That‚Äôs how I use it, but I definitely wouldn‚Äôt mind the social aspect as well.
---
The only 2 I have now are marsupial and speed demon.  
---
I don't need more.
---
Also picture frames you can put on your wall showing off shots you‚Äôve taken in game
---
What are legacy weapons? I've seen that mentioned a few times but I'm not quite sure what it means. I initially thought it was a typo of legendary lol
---
Aw shucks, another graduate from the "school of hard knocks" showing up in a thread about raising awareness to tell us all about life's hard lessons that surely only they have experienced. Please, tell me what other things in life aren't fair, "cupcake". Enlighten me.
---
Did you read the tutorial
---
Exactly there are turds in the game that is one of the most useless weapons in the game
---
I'm Vegan in fallout 76 quit hurting all animals and eat brain fungus.
---
I‚Äôve found I can blip my WiFi out, get booted, then rejoin my team
---
Yet another reason not to join FO1.  What a stupid mechanic. 
---
Just create Fallout SIMS and get it over with already
---
Yep, just part of the game.  But like I said, i've been playing for just over a week and so far that's the only real issue I had.  Everyone is so helpful otherwise. :)
---
IMO, the Gauss Minigun is best used with the Stabilized perk, which requires PA. Without it, it is a bit of a waste of that precious 2mm ammo. Unless you have a AA version of the Gauss Minigun, of course...
---
Oh crap that would be really cool
---
Perk coins are still 1 per perk meaning you will need 1600+ levels to max all 6 slots. :(
---
I had to bring it to a pawn shop to pawn it for some money where they keep it there, after you can get it back for around the amount you pawned it for
---
Marsupial, Speed Demon and Bird Bones, I run an agi build and I like to be as mobile as possible
---
I totally do this whenever I play and some high levels start a mission......Didn't do shit but I ran out of the few bullets I had for my pathetic 10mm and just started using my fire axe to bash those flying scorchbeasts whenever they would land.......Died like 10 times but it was worth it
---
I like the public teams, free caps from teammates completing quests; extra xp/other bonuses, and more free locations to travel to. I only have a few friends that play 76 so I wouldn‚Äôt be getting the free caps and locations to travel to as much, since my friends don‚Äôt play often.
---
Lol how much did you pawn it for? Cause I cant see any pawn shop giving you more then 10 bucks for that game.
---
No YOU‚ÄôRE spectacular
---
With public teams, it seems crazy that anyone would not be using Herd Mentality these days. Even without a teammate there is no downside.
---
You can pick perks that aren't from the SPECIAL you leveled up. Look at the button prompts on the bottom of the screen.
---
I actually posted twice that it was *your* comment. The ITV article you linked.
---
Oh no I pawned the console not the game
---
You admit you probably did wrong, albeit on lesser charges, so the fact that you got suspended shouldn't be a surprise. As I said it's not even been a week and it's likely there are dozens if not hundreds of similar stories that Bethesda are dealing with at the moment.
---
Lol......Thanks I prefer the fire axe myself
---
Herd mentality jumped to top of the list due to public teams I think, but overall from my experience of having and selling 12 serums, Speed Demon, Marsupial, and Eagle Eyes are the most bought still, though Herd Mentality definitely went up exponentially just less data and time selling it. Carnivore/Herbivore also went up because of the XP gains from those foods respectively. 
---
Honestly for like 350-400 people buy serums on the regular, it's a time release piggy bank really to save your max caps buffer and people will buy everything, it just depends on what the person is after at the time.
---
Oof. That‚Äôs gonna be long weekend catch up lol
---
I've experienced both sides and and thankful one does out weigh the other
---
this happened to me yesterday for a solid 3 matches in a row. Same player, most likely. I realized a bit late that I was actually getting back into matches with that same player because I kept watching them cheat from the spectator mode. Finally, exited right after he killed me in third match and found myself in a different series of players. Annoying as heck. They weren't even doing anything like what's been reported in the past (flying and weird glitches), but they clearly knew exactly where every player on the map was located and systematically hunted them down. No exploration, no discovery, just straight up run to next player kill, run to next player kill. Totally obvious as in each of the the matches did we rarely make it past any storms, maybe two storms max. Every player that wasn't killed by him/her was rare and sometimes a whole match the only other deaths other than this player killing you was death by falling or burning up (you can tell by the messages in the top-left). First time I've seen cheating after playing about 70ish rounds.
---
TBH, most games nowadays have duping at some point in their early days.
---
I have this happen a lot but I always have the option to spawn back at 76
---
The 3rd person animation when someone is taking a photo is one of the best additions I didn‚Äôt know I needed
---
Agreed, plus the wastlanders dialogue system? Yes please
---
I know you can get it as a semi rare reward for taking Abandoned Bog Town. I've received it a few times from that workshop.
---
What do you get from looting the scotch beasts and Queen?
---
Times get tough in the freelancer industry lol
---
I run heavy guns in PA, and got a really nice AA Gauss Minigun that just SHREDS. The biggest benefits of PA and heavy weapons is the Stabilized perk (extra accuracy and armor penetration ~~a chance to stagger~~ with heavy guns). But if you have a good set of bolstering or sentinel's, that extra survivability might outweigh the PA. And honestly, with my big ol' backpack and pocketed armor, I can carry more out of PA than in it.
---
So yes, heavy guns without PA is totally viable, and I run around just doing general quests like that all the time with my gatling gun. But I break out the Gauss mini for the bigger stuff. I also had a Gauss Vampire's mini, but it had garbage 2nd and 3rd star rolls. Still, I could tank anything with that gun.
---
Legacy weapons are legendary guns with affects that they shouldn‚Äôt have ex: laser rifle with explosive/ harpoon gun with explosive. These weapons used to drop in ye olden days but they have been removed from the legendary loot pool and can no longer drop. They are extremely powerful and have been duped ever since the games release.
---
I would say that‚Äôs what post is for but that‚Äôs the lazy way out ;)
---
It was easier before the last update
---
a lot easier
---
basically what he‚Äôs going for here lol..
---
I refuse to play NW.  It was poorly conceived and terribly executed including all the cheats and glitches. 
---
I played Survival mode a LOT.  It wasn‚Äôt perfect by any stretch,  but I was very disappointed when it got pulled.
---
Its called "Plan: Signs and Letters" You can usually get it off Grahm, from the Watoga shopping vendor or from one of the vendors in whitesprings, I think it has a lower chance to spawn in the inventory of train station vendors aswell. I've never seen it for sale in player vendors, so I don't know if it can spawn in the world, your best bet is probably just spending a few hours server hopping and checking the watoga and whitesprings vendors before hopping again.
---
Definitely going to take more like that closer to Halloween to get into the spirit
---
*Spot on with the location too lol*
---
I play on console so I've experienced being farmed of all my caps by a Chinese stealth suit guy who kept following me.  I don't mind it that much now but it just feels like a big waste of everyone's time and very malicious.  I just want to raise awareness that there are two sides so I just asked him why and he just wanted to spam me with the usual GG as in got gud.
---
I try lol
---
Much appreciated!
---
There are two version.  The atom shop one and the one they in robot vendors for like 9k caps.  
---
Check robot vendors in whitesprings.
---
Sounds like you have some things to be more concerned about than a 2XP event.
---
Is it a visual error or does the gun actually fire faster?
---
If you merged over from the Bethesda launcher to steam, try looking in both versions of the game. The Bethesda launcher atom pool is separate from the steam launcher atom pool. Probably true for other launchers as well.
---
Thought so, it's basically the raider skull mask
---
I didn't want to play it and have started to enjoy it, but I don't think I would've tried it if it didn't have the challenges in the first place, so win for Beth on that one, in my case.
---
I get like super protective of lower level players. Like if I see one at some high level place I just show up and offer backup. I get immense joy from watching them fearlessly fight super mutants and ghouls at least 2x their level.
---
Is buying weapons from another player against the rules? Even if they are likely duped oh, I'm not the one who broke that rule, and spending my in-game currency on those weapons doesn't seem to be breaking rules. I'm just saying, maybe I was on the edge of breaking the rules but I don't believe I actually did break any. And morso to my point, people that were doing Mass duping are still playing and having fun While others with much less severe cases or no cases at all have been banned. I know it hasn't been a week, but I don't have patience for people that take my money and don't respond about a refund. If they had just suspended me that's one thing, but charging my debit card the day after they cut my access from the game should be f****** illegal.
---
The gun actually fires much faster.
---
I like them for the most part. Met a few nice people that actually got on mic although I usually have mine set to Area chat. The bonuses are nice but I haven't met many people that do much as a team.
---
well I am a junkie player and I just recently rolled a zealots Gauss shot gun.  I primed that thing and it's a beast, works great for SBQ fights.  But I see what your getting at with the other effects
---
Went from zero to one hundred real quick, literally. I just started playing last month and hit one hundred today. Im sure I would be higher if I had more time to grind on the game but prettybimpressive for having a busy schedule. Thanks to the teams, bobbleheads, cranberry nuka, well rested and all the other bonus xp.
---
That‚Äôs how I remembered it.
---
Ah, yeah, I wouldn't put much stock in that. She just has a flat 70% damage reduction plus 300 DR/ER.
---
It likely just feels harder in the nuke zone because there are probably less bloodied builds in there.
---
Just what I mean to say is that people are just playing the best way they can to get resources.
---
People can do whatever they want.
---
Neat
---
i have experience with this. move the C.A.M.P away from the clif edge and rortate it 90 degrees. fast travel to it 5 or 6 times not how the place moved. move it again and repete the process until desired result
---
I've got marsupial, herd mentality, healing factor, speed demon, and electrically charged. I enjoy them a bunch.
---
I checked whitesprings, the raider vendors, everything
---
I know but I mean the non atom shop one!
---
I use a Vampire's Gauss Mini - and I never use it with PA. I'm better without it &amp; think it's a war winner.
---
The rules and mods of this sub protect cheaters, there's just no denying it. I hate people who are so brow beaten and law abiding. Sometimes rules are meant to be broken, not that my post even broke any. They removed it unjustly, there are no rules against posting a picture of someone exploiting.
---
Gotcha is in the main body... 
---
My bad :)
---
Will try this!! Thank u
---
That's me too. Mostly because nobody seems to be able to hold either chokepoint, standing up trying to swipe at them as they sprint by
---
Contact support. We can‚Äôt fix your ban because you decided to dupe.
---
I have 1261 of them...wish I could stop getting them.
---
Exactly,  if I bought the damn card, it's my damn prerogative.
---
(Edit: however, I will agree w you about radiation rumble)
---
Good point
---
Being bloodied even with T-65 the rads up quickly
---
Unfortunately, dead silence it would seem. However, no news of anyone being perma'd after Wednesday, which is good. You'd likely have to look places aside from reddit, as a decent chunk folks here are either silent or will whine at you like children for just trying to get information.
---
I'd be good with paying 1000 caps, as long as there was no stupid limit and I could get any type I wanted on demand.
---
I am like 15 places ahead but whats so special about it? I just played the game and killed everything.
---
It‚Äôs just something my mom does, I‚Äôm getting it out later today
---
Not saying they can't. Just a suggestion so they don't waste their time. But it's their prerogative
---
This was one of the promises used to sell people on the subscription that was never implemented.  They need to do something to make FO1st more enticing.  
---
I have not played adventure mode since I subbed when FO1 was 1st released.  However with the Public Teams and double XP all weekend, I was in Adventure mode all weekend.  It was a lot of fun and too good to pass on these group buffs. 
---
Unless they bring more features to FO1 I will not re-up the subscription.  Its basically a sub for a scrap box at this point... and with no updates seems to be another forgotten game mode of FO76.
---
I know how you feel brother
---
There are griefers and workshop attackers. They seem to be more rare on PC but they are definitely around. I've run into a lot of the wannabe griefers.
---
I'll look when I get home
---
Really.? My exact words were unprintable the first time I went after the SBQ. üòâ
---
that is so true with the correct perk cards, chems, and serums a non legendary weapon can still be really OP.
---
My thoughts: Get rid of traveling pharmacy and get chemist backpack from raiders. Add Barbarian.
---
Get rid of sturdy frame and add Blocker to avoid hits close up.
---
Demolition has diminishing returns. Use 2* and max out Enforcer.
---
Happy Wastlanding!
---
Take 3 points off of intelligence put 2 into strength and you have an extra to do what ever you feel like with. Just have enough intelligence to have gunsmith 5.
---
No reason other than rare plans, legendaries, improved repair kits and fun. I don't see the flux as any more of an end game item than I do a mutation serum recipe Bethesda will gladly sell me for nearly 20,000 caps.
---
Ahhhh gotcha. So that's what the whole duping thing was at least partially about. I just started playing the game with the release of Wastelanders (or actually a little bit after it released) so I've been pretty out of the loop.
---
It would be awesome if us low levels of crazy enough could hear whispers and rumblings of or exploits as tales throughout the game......So like you hear random NPCs talking about this Madlad going into battle with only the vault suit on his back and knuckles on his hand .....lol
---
Having some bloodied or AA gatling lasers melts it pretty quick
---
Thanks man Looks like I might have to give PA a go after some crafting
---
Thanks for.your patience :) 
---
Edited main post :)
---
I tried to avoid talking about balance and hacks because that is a hugee other issue, but you're right.  The ease into it is pretty brutal also, it's a huge power leap between a fresh level 50 and level 50 AssSent J2515 Quantum Lord both in kit and knowledge.  I really just want the suspense of rust in the game and it's so close it's frustrating.  I think PVP teams could be cool, PVP active only to other PVP teams, if two PvP teams end up in a server could be interesting.  Or someone mentioned PVP characters locked to PVP worlds, which could be a great solution.
---
Good faith PVP is just so fun, and you're right, the only worthy challenge for full meta players.
---
A Colossal Problem only being limited to 8 people per instance is still a bad decision imo. you could easily be left out of your own group if a full group and one solo player join into the instance before you. even if you are the one that dropped the nuke. then you are left alone doing an event solo that is meant for 8 people. hell, you could be left being the only person doing anything if you get 7 people who don't know what to do or do not have any good builds to damage the Wendigo Colossus. 
---
it would be like doing the scorched earth event but you are the only to fight the queen because 8 other randoms already filled in their instance.
---
Thanks! It's an honor.
---
I can't really get behind this sorry.   
---
I pay for the encryptid keycard, if I have other things to do and only one other person has showed up after a minute or two, I'll start the event and just ping off robots until more people show up. Its the same with project paradise, I can solo one creature to rank 3 and considering its pretty rare to ever see more than one pet get to rank 3 when the event is full, I'm gonna clear the place and start it, regardless of how many people are there.   
---
Most of the events in this game can be soloed by a competent player and most people don't want to stand around waiting to actually start an event when they've already been waiting for an event to pop in the first place. If people are too busy to go to an event when it pops then its noones problem but their own.
---
if your not gonna mainline NW the stats mean nothing. let's be honest. if there going just for fun by the time they unlock new cards and realize they cant use them cause for some reason 1 card cost 9 agility. and no way are tehy taking points out of perception so they can get goat legs. they will equip the standard ones and not look back
---
Marsupial and speed demon.   Marsupial is such a game changer.
---
I have gunsmith 5 I just didn't think it was worth the extra points to justify it, thus why I have 3. I have enough junk to repair weapons and I swap in the weapons repair perk in INT when I do so.
---
Did you try to revenge him after every death? Not judging, I did the same with nigh unkillable dudes, would revenge again and again until succesfull, with that cap loss (and chems/ammo/etc) as an accepted price for emergent fun.  
---
Also Chinese SS is borderline broken, non-Vatsable, non-detectable by berries, a real pain in the ass to deal with.
---
i feel like this is a lester burnham reference
---
Lol
---
out of curiosity do you know how much additional damage a primed receiver does to scorched?  I primed a Zealots Gauss shot gun and sometimes I think it's doing more damage than my  junkie's Gauss shot gun.
---
So I agree with removing all of the NW challenges and I've heard lots and lots of people talking about cheaters, however never personally seen one. Are there even any on PS4?
---
oh shit yes that would be amazing, imagine coming up on a group of super mutants talking about how joyous it would be to do battle with the melee vault dweller, cool freaking idea, i love it
---
Problem with Stealth option is that yesterdays NW hacker was a different breed. Could see everybody on the map and didn't appear to use any flying or other things you mentioned. BUT ABSOLUTELY KNEW EXACTLY WHERE YOU WERE AT ALL TIMES. You probably could kill them if you knew they knew but most people didn't know until too late. During second match with this hacker I realized after watching them. Third match, I was staying in the open for longer. Long open areas where I would see them have to traverse a long distance in the open or use a scoped rifle from a distance that might take less damage off. Morgantown doesn't have too many of these areas. Someone tried to nuke him/her in the last match I was in with hacker, which was admirable attempt, but just slowed them down. I'm assuming that if they can see the players, they can also see the best loot containers (maybe too big assumption, but equip was not problem for this player, always had marine armor, etc. ) - So sorry Stealth didn't work and nukes didn't work. My only thought is to stay in open areas to see them before they get to you. No obstructions.
---
I say about damn time.
---
You are a disgrace to this family and a traitor to the rebel alliance
---
That's very interesting. I'll check this out tonight. Thanks!
---
interesting, Does the aiming become erratically unsteady once that wonderful machine hits full speed? outside of PA
---
It it is pretty consistently at the robot vendor at Sutton Station. May need to hop a couple times.
---
In a similar vein, I hate how I have to boil dirty water to make soup instead of just using all of the purified water my machines are producing constantly. I know why they do it this way: because their recipe system doesn't allow for substitutions, so they'd need a programmer to change the whole recipe system for them and I'd guess they probably only have a handful of junior programmers doing code maintenance and bug fixing these days.
---
This. There's always plenty of time to prepare to tag the sheep.
---
Ok cool, I'm slowly getting rid of weight reduction perks as that was a habit from earlier in my build and trying to use armor with those effects instead. I also have a +60 backpack, but I will look into the raider chem one good suggestion!
---
So should I maybe knock demo expert down a * or two?
---
Nothing changed , i hated playing with people , and i still do
---
I will still use it because for me its not expensive at all, from the only advantage that I have a scrapbox and grinding
---
No I strictly have chosen to be pacifist as to not ruin another person's experience and I don't find the experience engaging.
---
That‚Äôd be send damage. They don‚Äôt actually know where you are, they can just damage you from anywhere.
---
" I can‚Äôt explain how demoralizing this was.  "  
---
Man, you don't have to explain how demoralizing it was.   We already know.  
---
I'm sorry this happened to you guys.   I wonder if you could try it again on a public server and get help from a higher level to run it?
---
Thanks and yeah I just thought of that reading your comment but that would be awesome
---
It was pretty early on in the game like 2 minutes in. Thought I hit the jackpot finding PA so quickly but nope. This Fortnite hopping guy got some good stuff. 
---
And if should be noted I almost died after the one shot and the accuracy for someone hopping that high with that accuracy with a grenade launcher is suspicious
---
Oh my god, that explains it! Thank you!
---
People want something to chase; but for SBQ fights if Bloody and Junky is Tier 1  then Primed Hunters and Zealots is 1A.   They're easier and cheaper to find and **very** effective.
---
yep, they're listed under misc!
---
hopefully I can get one of those after some crafting
---
How do you even run this game
---
Known issue. If you played before getting the Xbox game pass version, they are probably going to the pool of atoms associated with the Bethesda launcher.
---
It is under misc on the map, but it is under aid in the vendor. I wish serums had their own category on the map since other items also appear under misc.
---
If by griefer you mean a guy that would try to incite pvp outside workshop - personally I have experienced that exactly once since beta. \*shrug\* I'd say they are extremely rare.
---
I play with a similar set up, and have not encountered this problem. 
---
Sorry that doesn‚Äôt help with your issue, but I can at least confirm as a leftie using a left handed mouse with reversed buttons I‚Äôve not had the issue. I use the Logitech software for my mouse if that helps. (I.e. - I‚Äôm not just flipping the buttons in the Win10 settings.)
---
Currently I'm running marsupial, speed demon, twisted muscles, scaly skin, talons, healing factor and carnivore for that tasty meat.
---
This suits my rather chaotic play style. Although now there is easy team building etc I'm gonna invest in some of that fun herd mentality.
---
Get 2 pieces and be immune to fall damage.  It is preferred by Rocketeers of Appalachia.
---
I probably had my best public team experience today, even got a new friend out of it. My partner and I joined a server and quickly looked for a building group we could both join, found one with 2 other players in the high 200s (my partner is 190ish, I'm 327) so it seemed like a good match. I started by buying an assaultron recall card and starting Encryptid, these 2 guys in the group showed up straight away, so we started the event and absolutely destroyed it. Then I noticed they were in a silo, so I teleported to them and we ran the silo together, just absolutely annihilating everything in our path, launched a nuke and then went and killed the queen. Then we launched another and another. Unfortunately once all the silos and encryptid were on cooldown, we parted ways, but I managed to add one of them to friends before heading off.   
---
TL;DR I enjoy public teams, had my best experience just this evening.
---
I would knock it down to 2 and increase the enforcer to a 3.
---
Tbh that‚Äôs my only goal to achieve with the legendary run
---
Fuck Zorbo - I want the coop.
---
That is why you put them in the frontlines. They fear nothing not even death
---
I love the players that show up with a Gauss Rifle. Thanks for helping, bud.
---
(fry meme)
---
Ayyyy, Christmas in July!  Congrats, stranger!
---
the only problem with survival mode was they enticed PVE players to do it. I actually would carry no aid items, and rely on sunkissed and healing factor between combat, and stealth 24/7 to get the weekly, and farm some xp. My camp I had floating, and would just replace it before doing the survival weekly mode and replacing it after.   
---
Sucked more for people in survival because I would show up on the map because my rank, but when they killed me I had no junk or aid items, and didnt even even fight back, as it would reset my score and make me invisible on the map again.   
---
I would like them to implement a way for PVP without them begging PVE players to fill in the gaps, but I don't think enough are interested. There are a good amount, but a lot of this games following are solo much less PVP players. Hell a lot still play it as solo as they can
---
I can craft oil.
---
Wym?
---
All right. I just did it and it took me a while so I thought I'd share it. I don't see why everyone is down voting and being funny about it. I'll happily take some criticism but no need to be like that
---
Thanks, nice to be able to narrow down the search.
---
Im usually in a group but I have joined public teams just knock out some dailies if my teammates arnt on. 
---
But one thing I noticed not one person says a word.  Its not an issue but on that sense I rather just play alone.  It dam well feels like ur playing alone.  
---
I‚Äôve never played an online game that has so many social anxiety people playing.
---
As a pacifist you can't be killed and relieved of your caps outside of workshop; that is impossible afaik.
---
I'll definitely try to find another one then
---
Everything is supposed to have subtitles so I would count this as a bug.
---
Oooh, that's a neat glitch.  Might check it out myself.
---
Thank you! I hope it'll help people to better understand that these changes are not final and there's still plenty of time for the devs to rework the legendary perk system.
---
I feel personally targeted by this comment and I'm ok with it.....lol
---
That would indeed be handy but at least that will help me avoid some unnecessary traveling.  Thank you.
---
I‚Äôm curious how many of those duped weapons did you buy?
---
Hey more power to u I can understand where your coming from. But on the flip side of the coin, if they don't wait for other players to show up, get boned and lose objectives, then that's their problem.
---
I craft cutting fluid and it scraps to oil.
---
I was a pa heavygunner and then a pa demolitionist forever until switching to nonpa and I was apprehensive at first too. However, I said fuck it and I dropped the pa perks, kept junkies and got a sexy armor set. It works great, I can barely tell the difference in damage and I prefer non pa to pa now. Its probably going to show up on a damage calculation if one exists, but I regularly take queen aggro (which is damage based) and can basically instakill anything anyway.
---
Go nuts
---
They actually had to go to the players, found every single bush wookie, every person hiding in the dark, every person hiding in the fire. Made beelines for them. Not another player got a kill in at least one of the matches. I gave benefit of the doubt after first match and watched them for a good 15 minutes over two matches and part of the third before I was convinced. The way you can tell is how exact they were about locating the next player. None of the " let me run this way and look for a guy" or " let me try this area and see who was there" It was go to guy, kill, go to next guy, kill, on and on.
---
Edit: my bad grammar
---
Sounds like someone woke up on the wrong side of their mother this morning
---
Ah man I want those but holy crap, 10.5k Caps without Hard Bargain &amp; being buffed with CHR, is pricey.
---
how much time did u spend to write all of this? u got my upvote just for effort!
---
Impressive
---
If only there was a text chat..
---
Oh damn forreal? Where‚Äôd you get that recipe?
---
And how it would be nice to ban bad minded people like you. Do you hear how you sound?
---
It‚Äôs kind of a hidden system imho. I didn‚Äôt know about this until past level 50 lol
---
1. Choose the special stat you want to increase. Then use R1 or L1 (or whatever the prompt is) to switch between what perks to choose from (can still choose an intelligence card)
---
2. Past level 50, you‚Äôre able to swap SPECIAL stats around as well as choose any perk cards you want
---
I‚Äôve seen in whitespring before, also pleasant valley, grahm, Sutton. I think harpers ferry robot also sells sometimes.
---
It‚Äôs not cheap though. Plan is called ‚Äúsigns &amp; letters‚Äù
---
It opens when you holster your weapon
---
I proposed after I dismissed my own point as illogical and unfair after I read the comments on my original post that they could possibly just allow people to give others the workshop. I usually will just tbag and thumbs up invaders but they just instakill me anyways.  I would rather avoid conflict and give them the workshop.
---
yea I did it for the drugs. Delicious drugs.
---
Same here. I put a ton of effort into my camp.
---
So here‚Äôs the bare minimum that I will do if I‚Äôm short on time. If you aren‚Äôt at max caps, sell out the vendor for the day, sell all your treasury notes, scrap as many legendaries as you can, do the legendary run daily/weekly. For quests do the foundation/crater daily, cop a squatter, overseers daily, red rocket daily, queen of the hunt. For events leader of the pack (3 guaranteed legendaries+ you can finish it quick), otherwise just finish as many events as you can.
---
I have a Bloody one, use with no PA or any heavy gunner perks, no problem with it whatsoever, loving it for the SB, SBQ or that greasy Samsquanch
---
Yeah I was like what is that and then it killed me now I‚Äôm like oh cool a grafton monster and then I one tap it
---
Not logged on ATM.
---
I usually list at 1/2 retail or less.
---
IIRC, each of the plans is ‚Äùvalued‚Äù 500, so I would have them at 200-225 per
---
aj ninetyeight for console messages, aj-98 in game,.
---
I‚Äôll be on again ...probably about 3.15 EST.  I‚Äôm not too far from my camp (just S of Monongah Power plant), and I have a mic.
---
Huh? There is no lootbox way of getting cards. At every level up you can choose exactly what card you want that is available based on your level. The card packs are just bonus cards. If you want a specific card, just select it when you level up. If you don‚Äôt see it, it means it isn‚Äôt available yet.
---
If you are already at 15, select a different category to add your point and then RB (on Xbox) to change category for card selection.
---
Ah I remember when I did radiation rumble at those early levels with nothing but wood armor and a boxing glove to my name. I regret nothing.
---
i mainly just use them to get an INT bonus while playing solo, but one time someone put on a mic and said "I found a wendigo collossus!" and the other three (myself included) all went to go kill it. i've also had times when someone needed help and would actually threw out the "come here" emote so we could join them. so even though i dont typically use them as actual "teams", having a group to communicate with isn't totally pointless.
---
It wasn‚Äôt a mistake.  These dam dupers need to stop saying they made a mistake.  
---
U didn‚Äôt make any mistake.  U knew exactly what u were doing.
---
For next time if your curious;
---
Navigate to the actual subreddit, than click the address bar and type your keyword or keywords into the address bar after the subreddit name.
---
The bar should kinda look like "r/fo76 &lt;keyword(s) here&gt; or r/fo76 score glitch "
---
Than once you get search results sort by new to get the latest info.
---
That's the main reason why I dont even do the nw challenges man.
---
Oh I didn't realize this so I guess I can just switch servers for the workshop if they want it.
---
I think 7 in total, 3 legacies the rest God rolls. I kept two of the Legacies and one of the god rolls. The other weapons I gave to my buddy that I play with, who just happens to still be playing LOL.
---
Huh, I hadn't thought of that.
---
Speak for yourself. I‚Äôve been trying to get a kill for a couple hours now. I die instantly nearly every match. I‚Äôm bad at pvp, which is why I play fallout games, ironically.
---
All my perks/armor/backpacks give me a 425 carry weight,  way beyond my excavator
---
I am a raider I might kill people at workshops once in a while. I mostly just go for loot and scoot or I want the workshop. I bounty hunt and I also hunt grifers since they have loot.
---
Some things are definitely listed oddly. I was on the hunt for some weightless armor in vendors the other day and couldn't tell you the amount of times it said they had lots of armor and when I got there it was just full of fasnacht masks. So disappointing.
---
I meet Insult Bot way too often.  My goal now is to catch him coming and massacre him before he gets a chance to utter his foul poison.
---
That was a nice comeback.  Lol
---
I used a 2 shot gatling lazer
---
I transfered GTA online level, vehicles, cash, really everything I had in game, from PS3 to XBOX1. yeap. cross platformed the shit out of rockstar.
---
so I‚Äôm assuming we‚Äôll be able to do that with fallout.
---
My camp is down by the queen and people use mine all the time! I made some pa stations out front and inside are all the workbenches and vendor. My camp gets pretty crowded when someone nukes the queen
---
no? new events, like A Collosal Problem and the Atlas Observitory community event, are gonna be in it. says so in the roadmap.
---
The scorch killer's receiver, where can we buy it?
---
Haha exactly that's what I'm thinking. just curious if the Gauss minigun in particular without the stabilized PA perk becomes unmanagable once its fully unloading those sweet rounds of hell
---
Ah a fellow 750 TI user lmao
---
I said other than the obvious, but all you've listed comes from scorched earth, so thats 1 reason, no matter how you try to spin it. The other is flux farming as its not really used for serious legendary farming anymore. Serum plans are most definitely an endgame item, you have to progress nearly the entire way through the main quest to get access to them and even then you need 20k caps, which is 66% of all of the caps you can carry. Bethesda clearly intended them to be accessible only to high level players, even if thats not how its panned out.
---
This is a freaking move, I'm going heavy guns so i could really use those extra points for weight mitigation!!
---
Take my updoot, excellent advice
---
Yes! Had some random player hangout at my fort in cranberry bog for an hour jumping around the cat walk, dancing, shooting at targets I put up, etc.. I mean he was probably just bored after hours of grinding xp but it was still nice.
---
Side note, using the hanging cage tree from the Legendary Run you can make a tree house if you place the tree then the floor.
---
I never heard of this, appreciate the PSA!
---
Haha that's so true. I teamed up with a low level player and got to properly test how furious my gatling laser actually was!
---
I haven‚Äôt actually seen many of those duper‚Äôs only a lot of post complaining about the duper‚Äôs crying. I saw the petition which was hilarious and a few replies to posts but no posts on their own
---
Yeah they're super expensive, but I care mostly about camp building so I'm willing to pay haha
---
Perhaps I‚Äôm not noticing them but I haven‚Äôt seen many posts about the bans the past few days.
---
I think they were looking at not only who did the dupe but who had all of said duped items in inventory at once between said dates. Sorry to hear that mate. I hope you get your account back.
---
I mean, my bf and I can do Radiation Rumble with pretty much just the two of us, but when there's incompetent/inexperienced players involved, I understand where your frustration stems from.
---
I‚Äôm pretty certain that a ‚ÄúSo Sorry‚Äù emote was uncovered in a recent datamine. Don‚Äôt quote me on that, but I wanna say I heard something about it in one of Juicehead‚Äôs videos.
---
I was surprised how much fun I had building a camp for my alt...might just do it again for my main character.
---
I'm glad the opposite exists, people who will wave you over when a legendary spawns in events. I was in a Uranium Fever with only 1 other person, and both times a legendary mole miner spawned, the guy would wave me over so I could punch its face in and share in the goodies.
---
Marsupial and speed demon
---
Never played before the game pass :( I hope they give my atoms after the bug patch
---
Only if my pet deathclaw can climb in with us.
---
It really sucks they did that, with such brutal RNG it tempted so many PVE players to do something they didn't want to do and shouldn't have to do.  I would have carried no aid but couldn't fit enough in my stash without weight reduction perks.
---
The games' following at this point is hugely tilted to PVE players, but I think that is mostly because it has no draw for PVP players.  It's cheap enough that most can try it out but without suspense only the PVE interested stick around.  Even to be competitive in Nuclear Winter, the only PVP draw, you have to play adventure first to make a decent build, and then every time you want to change it
---
Doubt you can fix much in life if thats what you took from the post.
---
0.45-0.65% learn chance. 15 radiation doesn't matter, if your ballistic damage 1500 for example
---
i have seen those posts, and people are kinda sad for them.
---
I got it from the vendor at whitesprings that sells all of the resort plans, he always seems to have a bunch of other random plans alongside the resort stuff, but I remember seeing the stone bench plan there fairly frequently.
---
It half the reason why I go to player vendors, to see their awesome camps.
---
In all actuality I really don't mind. Battle Royale are my thing, just doesn't allow me to max my battle pass
---
Then they were likely double exploiting then cause normally you cant sell plans to vendors and they where likely trying to dupe.
---
That is an awesome idea!  I'd use your camp too.  I loot everything and then it's like "man, that train station could stand to be just a little bit closer" as I start waddling west.
---
I like that you've created an actual player hub and people are using it!
---
For bloodied you‚Äôre forced to use those damage mitigation perks such as serendipity, otherwise you die a lot, which is very problematic during events when sometimes the system hover the deathcam around your dead body for 10min before it let you respawn. For non bloodied builds they can dedicate those perk points to Bloody Mess or vats so they can buff their damage while running at full health. Also in nuke zones when you have to wear PA or Chinese Stealth, all the UNY benefits are gone. Similar for Junkies although they can run full HP. Dedicated Legendaries however are free flat buffs that functions no matter what, the only ‚Äòdownside‚Äô is their targeted use, so you just need a few variants to cover all creatures.
---
Thanks man and the aiming recoil at full speed isn't a problem? without the stabilized PA Perk?
---
This sounds fun I‚Äôm all for it
---
Why do people come to a forum full of people that have been playing since beta and say "it was unplayable". Clearly it's been playable from the beginning. And no, they've fixed a bunch of stuff, but definitely not everything. There's still bugs hanging around from the beta. And the game still gets hate because it's a popular thing to be hating on.
---
I use a junkies gauss minigun as my primary weapon and it seems to work perfectly well without aiming issues,but its been long enough now that I may have just forgotten. In any case, aiming accurately isn't hard without stabilized imo. The ultracite gatling laser seems to be more pinpoint accurate, but that makes sense lore wise given that it is a laser where the minigun is ejecting high velocity projectiles via electromagnets and would have a helluva kickback.
---
What appeal? You agreed to TOS that told you about consequences of abuse. You were banned for duping and not mistakenly as you admit here. There's nothing to appeal. It was merited.
---
&gt;My fallout experience is over?
---
Not if you create a new account. However, just as many others who play without duping, please don't for the game's sake. It's got enough problems without people who cheat, claim they accept it yet bitch and moan about how it's unfair.
---
Yes. I'm sick of saying "Alexa, remind me in 20 hours to buy gold/get scrip/get caps" and then getting the reminder "get strips" and "get camps"
---
These are gorgeous!!
---
Me too.  I look at the vendors to be polite usually, then I poke around a bit. :)
---
I have a "school" where I give away free plans, and most of the time, people take all they can grab. Sometimes it's a high-level, and I KNOW they're just gonna sell them.  üò°
---
I went from 375 to 543 ... stopped there after reaching SCORE 100
---
All I‚Äôm saying is why not switch tier 1 and 1a? Bloodied and junkies have better average cases when fighting enemies, but the other tier has a higher roof for its best case situational use. Right now bloodied has both best average case and the best best case situation. So while it may be the case that they are still good it makes no sense that a gun that is meant for killing scorched mobs is out performed by a gun that doesn‚Äôt care if it scorched or not. Make sense?
---
Will they remove atoms and purchases?
---
Same.  The Greek Letters are neat but I want my Capital R, S, etc.
---
Nice one, will check them out - Thanks
---
Leveling up isn't too hard for me (though does get harder as your level increases, obviously), but the kill a player ones I hate. Half the people have that high jump mutation and I just can't keep my crosshair on them for the life of me.
---
They could port the model over from Nuka World DLC so I don't think that would be too tough. Minimal lines and poof, done. It would collect drinks and restock the Nuka Cola Machine.
---
yup
---
4 good. 5 bad
---
I don‚Äôt k ow what build you‚Äôre running, but all my bloodied builds are able to run all the big damage boosting perks, survivability perks and still have room for weight reduction perks.
---
When it comes to accounts and specifics they will announce a ban/suspension wave happened, However they don't discuss account details to others. If I were in the position I would try to find out any others who got banned and what for, and see if anyone from the group got word back or un banned. Its possible the bane was meant to last 1-2 weeks so those banned miss the xp and score weekend. 
---
Also regardless of why you were banned being rightful or wrongful,I could see many accounts getting slapped with a ban because they had multiple legacies and are collectors. The issue ise that Beth should have taken measures faster because a lot of those legacies are widely distributed now.
---
It was my understanding that he moves ahead one square per day until reaching the last one on the last day. If you pass him then you're basically going to finish the event.
---
that is correct. opening more than 4 resets your buff to 0% until you are down to 4 effects.
---
Yes, if more than 4 are opened you lose the buff unfortunately
---
That's cool, but I had some weirdo in his underpants blow past me and start sleeping in my bed as I was walking up to get my well rested bonus. Some folks make themselves a little *too* at home.
---
Not to confuse this with hitting max XP for the kill? Should be capped at 4,000 XP for an enemy, and I believe 6,000 XP for an event.
---
Edit: Appears opening 5 resets you back to zero, which is both sad and crazy.
---
*--gestures wildly at the current buggy mess that is FO76--*
---
it's still tons of fun, and i enjoy it quite a bit, but let's not act like there aren't issues.
---
Just a bug.
---
1 coin per perk is fine, but they need to slash upgrade costs by half or more.
---
Hey if u got the gear and levels then go for it. It just annoys me when lower level ppl go in, screw it up and then higher level ppl have to pick up the slack.
---
Anything I can do about it?
---
You can put the liberty prime on it but the headlamp is bugged and cannot be turned on
---
This is just a ploy to make u start a new account.
---
I have an AA Gauss Minigun, and it absolutely shreds the SMs at West Tek.  I don't wear PA, just some unyielding.  
---
I also have a Hunter Gauss Minigun on which I put Prime, and that thing visibly moves the SBQ's health bar.
---
Have you even played the game nowadays? Its barely as bad as it was in 2018
---
You're a ding dong for turning your back while you're in workshop boundaries. LMAO
---
100% I agree. Situational prefixes should always have a higher top end against those enemy types IMO. It's always baffled me why the game devs are okay with everyone eventually hitting the bloody/junkies ez-button.  Once you're there the game becomes cruise control sadly and only bullshit lag mechanics like vault raids and project paradise offer any difficulty at all.
---
I just wish you could blueprint your entire workshop setup on a public server and then deploy it the next time you take it over.
---
Are you on the Steam version?  I just saw this https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hui4kn/bug_atoms_received_by_challenges_arent/
---
Definitely. If your build isn't made for soloing or you don't know the ins and outs of the event, then it just a waste if you start it and have it fail part way through when you could have waited for help.
---
I grind it as much as possible with my Bloody + Unyielding + Adrenal Gauss Shotgun build (\~2100 dmg).  Use marsupial or jetpack to jump on the ledge/roof of the radiation shower room.  Center yourself so you can VATS enemies coming from three directions.
---
I've never had a NPC die being the defender.  You're main issue is magazine size.  Make it maximum capacity.  VATS lock one shot one kill.  You can cover both main entrypoints and even get the ones that get through.
---
You are basically a glass cannon and can't take a single hit. I'll try to be cognizant of if it is legendary or just cover those that get to/past the turrets so other players can get XP and legendaries.  I'm there mainly grinding for the barrel and notes.
---
But this build is fracking insane if you are ok with dying alot.  Don't even bother with Enforcer.  
---
If you've got high enough perception, you can VATS snipe with it during Guided Meditation.  Jump on a tower so you can cover most of all three defending points.  I've destroyed enemies on the other side of the complex 3-4x per magazine.
---
Uranium fever, switch to a non-gauss gun because even Dense UY SS armor + fireproof 3 won't save you from yourself.  I usually go 1/2-3/4 health with a non-bloodied weapon so I don't accidentally murder the legendaries before others get a chance at a hit..
---
Anything in your stash box including armor.  Mod it with the ultra light and you can free up a bunch of space.
---
It's learned iirc from the firebreathers questline. I may be wrong though.
---
It does fine.  I use VATS and no PA for clearing West Tek.
---
Excellent Thanks for the replys man that helps a lot. I had been previously searching reddit and Youtube for a couple of hours to no avail before posting.
---
Because it‚Äôs absolute shit
---
Well it‚Äôs because Bethesda really fell far from grace. No one expected a triple A game to release like that and that permanently scared Bethesda‚Äôs reputation and now they have a lot of work to do to earn back people‚Äôs trust.
---
Yes they have made improvements to the game, but along the way they have made even more questionable decisions. 
---
Todd Howard claimed that ‚Äúit‚Äôs not about how it is at launch it‚Äôs about what it evolves into.‚Äù This is a sentiment only shared by other game devs who have failed to bring a fully functional product to the market on release. Even No Man‚Äôs Sky, a game that has gotten a total makeover with a dev team that stuck with it has a reputation that is still ‚Äúthe devs released it unfinished on release‚Äù (although that game has turned itself around majorly back into the public‚Äôs good opinion)
---
This is especially fueled by a seemingly large disconnect between Bethesda and it‚Äôs players. A lot of players wanted a great story that involved choices and consequences, but even with wastelanders, the only real choice you have to make is the final mission. Even that has no lasting effects. The old storyline‚Äôs endgame was taking down the scorchbeast Queen. Taking her down shows ‚ÄúThe scorchbeast Queen‚Äôs reign of terror has ended!‚Äù But it has no lasting effects. The scorched still exist and no visible changes happen within the world. 
---
TL;DR: Bethesda has had a troubled development and the fact that they have relatively poor communication with its player base is not helping.
---
As for the people who come here to harass others, that isn‚Äôt right. Never harass someone just because they like something
---
we were playing together on that event lol?
---
Then why are you on the fallout 76 sub buddy
---
After four are popped: run
---
Tbh I'm saving them all for next season. I'm ahead of the game so no need to be greedy.
---
Well while using heavy guns stealth suit will not help much. As heavies don't have suppressor.
---
I won‚Äôt be on until after 5 est anyway. My PSN is Rarthin. I‚Äôll send you a friend request when I get on. Just for clarification, you have the plans, not the pieces and you have the rest of the pieces I do not have?
---
That's where most of my frustration stems from. Where lower level ppl screw up and higher level ppl have to pick up the slack. If ur bot confident you can take it solo, then just wait a bit before starting the event for more ppl to show, then do it.
---
- Check your map and see if they're displayed in the bottom right.
---
- Check the Atom Store itself and see if they're listed.
---
- Restart your entire system and check again.
---
They do come back eventually. I've had this happen myself a couple times.
---
Gauss Shotguns are beast mode. Gauss Rifles aren‚Äôt suited for Radiation Rumble. I‚Äôm not sure if you misread what I typed.
---
I do it every time it‚Äôs up, so possibly :)
---
Good luck. This has been requested right up there with text chat.
---
There are so many types of nuka cola in the game that a collection would just work
---
"Have you even been punched in the stomach? It's nowhere near as bad as being kicked in the face!"
---
But seriously, look at some of the bugs that are still around. Lunchbox buffs cancelling out the xp boost, visual and audio bugs after playing NW, SCORE challenges auto-completing..
---
Yes, I play the game now.  Yes, the servers are much more stable. I bought the game full price at launch, and enjoyed it then too.
---
I'm all for more fun group events that aren't just mindless killing.
---
If you own other collections you can use the terminal to change what they pick up. I have my commie bot picking up drugs from the raider bot.
---
Alright, I'll try that. Thank you. I've checked in game and on main screen, and restarted so far already and nothing. Its reassuring to know they come back at some point :) thank you
---
and it never will be anything "super helpful". Because the community has told Bethesda that they don't want "pay to win".
---
Pay to win is a scourge on gaming.
---
I got it free because it was on gamepass
---
Lol. Ya, there are always the weirdos. 
---
I had one guy trying to get on my roof.  I don't know why.  They didn't have marsupial so they were really trying to figure it out.  I finally build him stairs.  He ran right up them, looked around, then fast traveled out.
---
So I was left there like "but why? Why would you want to do that?
---
(todd cancels your sub without notice)
---
(Todd laughing face)
---
yep, you got it! About 4 hours from now! Stupid question here: I use the Bethesda launcher, would I lose anything by going over to steam?
---
only the rank up as overseer bothers me, the rest are fine. i have to keep burner alts to do the overseer one, its too timeconsuming to rank up beyond like 10.
---
Is there any reason to launch a nuke to start A Colossal Problem when you can do Scorched Earth and fight both the Queen and the Wendigo Colossus?
---
...you...
---
.... you did this....
---
thank you so much!!!! I'll ding you once im online and ready!
---
They will come back. The panic, however, will take a bit to leave you..lol.
---
Good luck.
---
Because it gives you views on YouTube
---
That is so cool. I have one similar but with nuke in background
---
I hate to say it but just saying ‚Äúwell it was worse before‚Äù isn‚Äôt a valid excuse for how bad it is now. It‚Äôs really bad, yet I have stuck with it since that BETA. 
---
I can see slowly but surely Bethesda is improving it, but it‚Äôs only up to time to see if they pull through
---
Oh man. I need to check mine now.
---
brb getting overencucumbered
---
PC player here. I gave up on trying in NW forever ago. In june I afk'ed matches by lobbying, and then tabbing to netflix. Went from 20-100 in 3 weeks. only time i was active was if i joined with a group on accident or wanted to swim to win for more xp. Only did it for the cosmetics for PVE, and only decided to go for rank 100 because I was unlocking other cosmetics, so I figured I would get the rest in there.  Even then I am perked out for survival not killing, as I get more xp to sit in a bush than try to out aim someone who i failed to hit when I had the drop on them. that's right forget killing. I miss entirely lol.
---
As a fellow builder, let‚Äôs see that camp! 
---
My personal goal with camps is trying to make them blend in to the world as much as possible. I‚Äôd love someone to see my camp and maybe, for just a second, think it‚Äôs a pre-existing location.
---
Thanks man I appreciate that, either way in the end it is just a video game. But at the same time money is money and they took $13 out of my bank account the day after they suspended me. Normally I wouldn't care so much about a measly $13, but it's the principal and the fact that I'm dealing with one of the world's biggest game developers oh, you would think they would refund or at least respond to me by now. I'm giving them till Friday to give me my money or my account back then I'm taking it to social media. I have all the screenshots and everything to prove it. Normally I wouldn't be this dramatic about something like this but I've tried to be patient with these people for a long time. Every time I've had a problem with this game they have never fixed the problem, most of the time they never even bother to reply. It's the lack of respect that pisses me off the most
---
As a photography enthusiast, great job! Really like the photomode on fallout 76, and the pics you can take with it are amazing! Good job dude!
---
 That would make me a sad panda.
---
Insane
---
never seen it got past 2/4 and 9/10 it would only go as high as 1/4 needed
---
I think it's because of the story bit being the best especially compared to other fallout games. And how much they push micro transactions. For example no man's sky released as a buggy mess at launch and has been out longer with out a single paid item. Unlike 76 with a battle pass am atom shop and the worst of all a subscription system. 
---
This is how I personally feel at least and I think others could agree with me on this.
---
What if you buy atoms, use them to buy a rank on the board that gives you scrip, then that scrip gets you a god tier fixer from the Purveyor? Is that pay to win? Maybe.
---
i went from 393-&gt;434, so pretty good weekend from my pov
---
I had to do in two different loads. It finally told me I couldn't take anything else out once my carry weight hit the 1700 mark.
---
Exactly. Personally with my bloodied gauss shotty it does +2300 damage per shot I find it hard to find a single enemy in the game that gives me any hard time. I can easily solo every event and the wendigo collosus. I‚Äôm hoping that once the devs nerf bloodied other effects are able to see some play time because it‚Äôs honestly really boring using only bloodied weapons.
---
I mean, all they have to do is drop the tent, warp back to their main camp, break everything down, then warp back to their tent. Sure, it takes 1 or 2 extra minutes, but it's a free ride back and forth. 
---
So really they already have a portable version of all workbenches.
---
lmao, yes, i had that once too, stuff of nightmares
---
Is he coming on or going?
---
LOL WUT
---
Isn't it like a meme of sorts, like putting the you have been insulted notes at 30k.
---
You have this huge bunker alike camp near the site where we fight the Queen?
---
Fab! Just shoot me a DM when you‚Äôre ready! :)
---
I need to get a pic up there. I have a few up but they are more about the random things that have happened while I'm there.
---
Now that 2x Xp is over I'm going to do some structural changes.  I want a 3 tiered layout and I think I will have to do some major reno to adjust the floors.
---
Come 5pm I'm logging in and getting started!
---
Do you have a pic of your camp?
---
Cursed weapons:)
---
And others surprises... like a quest..lore...some dialogues... is a nice quest/event
---
(todd eats sad panda)
---
(todd waits for more sad panda)
---
Well i tried to remove just the steel scrap and it said i'd reached max weight limit =0 
---
So i took a 10th out and apparently i have over 3500lbs of steel in my box
---
AWWW YEAHHHHH
---
thank you
---
Put power armor on then exit takes it off as well
---
I forgot to attempt the NW challenge until it was about 30 minutes till reset, so I hop on and hope, not to win, not to get a kill, but to stay alive long enough to level up. So I'm sneaking around in the bushes and trees, and I see this weird purple glint. And I'm like, what's this? and that's when I get the face full of lead. My bar moves sooooo close to the next level. If I'd not gone through this one bush, I'd have made it on that game. Anyway, there was still plenty to time to play another round and I got the SCORE. Thank you for listening to my boring story.
---
I appreciate your input and speculation, and for not being a dick LOL. I posted this because I was honestly just curious if anybody knew anything so I appreciate people who are constructed not destructive
---
You have a radium rifle that does 1500 damage? I get your point that radium rifles can still kill with the ballistic damage, but they should scale the damage up a little bit on the gun.
---
Yeah, the not possible where I camped 
---
Guess gonna have to wait for a patch.
---
Constructive *
---
Safe and fairly common.
---
Post some pictures! I built mine along the road near Slocum‚Äôs Joe, on both sides so it‚Äôs like a small town.
---
A lot of people, NPCs pass through it. It gets busy sometimes.
---
I personally think it made the servers feel crowded but I like how it's bringing people together who would like more comradery. 
---
Also I think there's growing pains that come with the new level of proximity. Ppl stepping on each other's toes more. 
---
Like the other night I was helping my friend who is new to the game level up and high levels kept swooping in and nailing her kills, it was driving me nuts. 
---
And you see more and more people who don't like how others play leading to abusive rants on the mic..
---
I hope we get past it soon and learn how to communicate and respect each other's spaces.
---
Well if you are suspended then you didn‚Äôt make any purchases on the month that they charged you. They probably would take away atoms for that month. 
---
Also remember that fo1st is being processed through third parties for a lot of people. Microsoft and steam and Sony have no idea that you were suspended. It is up to you to cancel the monthly subscription.
---
because bethesda doesn't know the meaning of the word balance.
---
Ha yeah man thats why I want one they looks incredible.  plus I can switch to other big fierce looking weapons easily
---
I'm usually there for the barrel plan, but I've found I do the best defending the center in my bloodied gauss shotgun build.  So I am normally solely defending the area so everyone else goes after the ore.  If I get it more than once in a play session with a bunch of high level players, I'll drop a lunchbox and hope for the best.
---
Unfortunately, my area voice chat doesn't seem to work even when testing with friends.  I'll see the icon move, but my friends can't hear me even with area on themselves.  I can't just tell people to get ore and I will take primary defense role.  I think it started with public teams because it used to work (and I can hear others using area just fine).
---
Awesome read, so incredibly sorry for you though. I have not launched a nuke yet either and this makes new very scared. Big time F for you!
---
I'd say an upgrade would be worth it. Bethesda is not known for very good graphics but 76 suprised me with the reasonably high def textures and models.
---
I use GTX1070 and I can go ultra on everything, for reference.
---
As of public teams I have been selling a lot more herd mentality serums so that has to be my favorite
---
Playing since beta here's the biggest gripes from the seasoned players:
---
Bugs: it's one thing to have bugs in a game. another when they've been around since beta and we still seem them. Challenges for example.
---
False promises: first subs were promised a lot and they haven't delivered. Pay to win is definitely a thing now and they said it would never be.
---
Not listening to the community: we voice our top priority concerns and it's usually sidelined.
---
Stability: Server crashes. Lag. Enemy not dying when you swing on them. 
---
Ultimately the priority for bethesda and this game seems to revolve around their bottom line and not making the lives of the players a little bit better. We tolerate a lot as a community. I think the fallout 76 community are some of the most patient and tenacious players. We tolerate a lot. But I think those who've been around since day one understand the potential. The game could be so amazing. Nuclear winter is one of the funnest PvP game modes I've ever played (when the hackers don't exist). When modders get ahold of the ecosystem the potential is limitless. I'm holding on for dear life and finding my own enjoyment in Appalachia.
---
This so true they are the one only thing that can kill me
---
It's coz a large number of the player base aren't multiplayer gamers- they primarily play single player games.
---
My prices are 
---
2 for Diluted
---
5 for a stim
---
10 for a super
---
Fucking majestic
---
yeah they port stuff over alot so it wouldnt be that hard for them
---
Sounds good thanks!
---
That's a good idea actually, though I prefer full stems because if you overheal with something that heals over time it keeps trying to heal you so it will cover any damage you take after the stims applied and if you stack it you both regen faster and can cover more damage with the overheal. Works with AP too, I use canned coffee to stay in vats way longer than I would normally need to be.
---
Uh ok. Thanks for the assumption, I actually fix a lot of stuff irl. I was actually laughing at this post because it was pretty pointless since you covered your own points in it anyway, that was the only reason I thought it was funny you calling that other dude mundane. And now it‚Äôs time to sign off reddit and leave this thread since I barely play this and it also has people posting the same stuff.
---
for real it would be so helpful to get the other types
---
He should go find all the sad pandas that play NW in pc.
---
Don't spend atoms just yet.  You're not too far behind. By the time of Tuesday's weekly challenge reset you should be at level 45 to be on track. Bethesda has also indicated they may increase the number of daily challenges towards the end.
---
FOR REAL.
---
Epic. Good job.
---
I'm hoping for a surly, paranoid BoS veteran.  Like, I want him to be verbally suspicious of my scraptron and complain when I'm not wearing power armor.
---
I want his workstation to be a table with a field stripped gauss rifle that he cleans while mean mugging everyone that walks in.
---
There‚Äôs a major bug going on with atoms not being awarded from challenges.  It‚Äôs been documented and reported.  No word on a fix. 
---
I myself am short about 500 atoms since the legendary day run started.  Trying to avoid lifetime challenges until this is fixed 
---
Not to be confused with the score bug
---
yes, they stack. use bloody mess, too.
---
I went from 196 to 302. Rank 67 now
---
Monster mash is my favorite event
---
For fuck sake stop complaining about NW challenges already, even with cheaters they're easy as shit and Bethesda has already said they're looking into scaling back on when they do get out of hand (i.e. when people whined about needing to kill nine creatures)
---
Creature kills? There are parts of the map that are almost guaranteed to have at least two or three spawns at the start.  Deploying your camp?  Easiest out of all of them.  Use stimpaks?  Hack a few consoles or Pharma Farmer.  Player kills?  Equip all survivability/h2h perks, spawn in a populated area and punch someone to death before they can punch you to death.  Thirty minutes of play?  Literally as easy as hiding in a bush for 2-3 games. Rank up?  Make a new character and you can get 1-3 rank ups in a single game.
---
this same mechanic basically makes many of those weapons unobtainable via vending (workaround not withstanding). 
---
imo, if someone wants to go full bore nocturnal, they should be better than most other builds at night.
---
Absolutely this right here! I love 76, but it is far from perfect. I myself am frustrated with broken core mechanics like Hit detection and V.A.T.S. and annoyances like rubberbanding, and clipping that persist patch after patch after patch.
---
good to know. What does bloody mess do?
---
Same, but for Vanguards. That never drops. I've rolled 20 arms already and hit just one 1*.
---
I play NW quite regularly (+- one game per day since the last event with limited-time rewards). I don't remember seeing any blatant cheaters. Sure, quite often I get killed by people who seem to have amazing aim, because I get downed by a single burst that hits me perfectly. But I tend to give those people the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are just skilled and know the weapons well..
---
Nope. They disappear inexplicably into an unknown void.
---
sorry to see you go
---
Scorchbeasts been dogging my all night and day. After we failed the SBQ fight, I put on my Chinese Stealth Armor and went into the blast zone hunting for High Radiation Fluids and flux. Everywhere I go, I'm hounded by these mofos. Had to take down 2 legendaries and a normal one before they stopped coming. Then later I'm wandering around territory I hadn't been to before in the Savage Divide, and what do I come upon but a fissure site and another batty bastard.
---
Lv. 276 or something to 311. My biggest double xp haul yet thanks to the new system
---
I see, thx for the answer, it is a pity for the user share his lunchbox
---
A "Thanks" emote would be great too.  As well as a "Yes" and "No" emote.
---
Maybe even a "Hold On" or "Wait a Minute."
---
Would have gotten on area chat and start playing the Rocky movie intro song.
---
Not entirely true, you can switch the pipboy view so ot uses the same UI as PA, even when you aren't in PA. I haven't had a pipboy block my screen for a year.
---
Toss in incisor and martial arts as well
---
I do just about the opposite with my shotgun character.  Blast everything with an explosive shotgun and cripple it, leaving a mass of helpless ghouls dragging themselves forward.  If people don't kill them, more don't spawn and it's easy to win.  If people do kill them, I get lots of exp and so do they.  I have a few Gauss shotguns, but don't usually use them for this event (though I did just roll a quad + limb damage one, so we'll see).
---
I do the same thing at Uranium Fever, Guided Meditation, etc.  It's strange how often people don't seem to notice I've left half-dead things for them.   A lower level and I were doing Guided Meditation, and I left a legendary crawling on the ground.  Made the "come here" emote once the event ended, shone my light on it, and it was still a good minute after coming over before they finally noticed and shot it a few times.
---
15% Bonus damage, under luck
---
Wasteland Justice‚Ñ¢ knows no level bounds.  Kill away.  Drop some stimpacks, purified water and spare plans to let 'em know it wasn't personal.
---
&gt;Question: I have the twisted muscle mutation with a melee build but see the marsupial mutation frequently. How hard is that to get and is it worth it for a melee build already with a damage buff from mut?
---
You're best trying to find it at a player vendor.  Usually see them from 250 to 500caps.  If you're in Enclave, you can get the serum for 3500 caps with maxed out charisma (including the complete UY + Magnet Personality + Hardbargain 3 + charisma drugs).  I average around 30 charisma and I see serums go as low as 3500 if you buy from the vendor modus in Science wing.
---
I just have a guy on my friendlist solely because he is a "professional" serum dealer.  I accidentally showered without starched genes (STUPID STUPID STUPID) and lost Herd Mentality.
---
Extra 5/10/15% damage and the enemy can explode in a bloody mess when you kill them.
---
Same.  Started the event at 27, just hit 50 this morning.  Now I can do ALL the main quest junk!
---
increases all damage by 15% at max rank (3) and stacks with other damage increasing perks. Also makes enemies explode into a gory mess sometimes.
---
will do. What do they do?
---
They're like: "IM INVINCIBUUUUUULL!!!"
---
The hot tub will make our pets invincible.
---
he does...
---
15% bonus damage means enemies may explode into a gory red paste.
---
3 points in luck, applies to all of your weapons
---
Sunken Coast Fallacy
---
Wouldn't fallout have to be cross platformed first?   As of now, I can only play with other PS4 users.
---
People that use explosive bait to destroy low level players bases or trick them into pvp so they can destroy their base. I had my base repeatedly destroyed in the early days before player vending. They weren't looking for pvp. They just wanted someone dumb enough to give them caps. I don't mind people shooting me trying to get a fight. I usually oblige and kill them a few times. I had it happen last night. People that use exploits or target people low level players that to get free junk, caps or just ruin other peoples experience are just doing it to be assholes.
---
Get an m.2 drive and stop playing on a potato, all bethesda cares about at this point is $$$
---
Youre taking it in the literal sense. When people.
---
say bloodied they are usually refering to the whole kit and kabootle. Meaning Bloodied legendary   wep+ unyielding + adrenal reaction+ nerd rage + serendipity. Bloodied is just alot easier to say, especially since there was never an actual name devoted to the use of those effects together. 
---
As i said (and got down voted for it as usual) unyielding and serendipity are what make it OP. Without those two effects in their current state, you may actually become the glass cannon people like make bloodied out to be.
---
Ive suggested make unyielding +1 when below 50% health +2 when below 25% . Than  make serendipity  a 45% chance to avoid 60% damage when below 30% health. Doing this makes serendipity stack with other % reduction effects and suffer from deminishing returns , and the +10 special makes it a bit more reasonable and force players to use stuff like crit savy if they want the crit every third shot (30 luck bekng the point inwhich you no longer need xrit savy). 
---
 But everytime you threaten a nerf to bloodied people get butt hurt because it directly affects the build their using.
---
GO GET ‚ÄòEM TIGER!!!
---
same always instakilled now playing pacifist.  They must have something up their sleeve
---
Bug, bugs everywhere.

Still no real end game.

Did that at like lvl 19 with my 1 star vamp sledge
---
Martial artist reduces the weight of your weapons and you swing them faster and incisor reduces enemies armor

---
The lvl of spawned PA is based on who entered the area IIRC. Which means if you keep going to an area with your main youll likely be spawning max lvl PA, best bet is to find an unpopular PA spawn area and go there on your alt or private if you can.
---
Also I believe the last frame youve grabbed wont spawn for you(similar to how you have to grab x amount of items before you grab the first one again)
---
That‚Äôs... Peculiar. Never seen that before. Seems horribly in efficient.
---
I‚Äôve noticed a lot more people do this, almost consistently, it helps a lot for a bloodied who wants to wear his UNY armor set haha!
---
They want to force everyone into all the content but it just waters down the actually interested players which lowers enjoyment for everyone.
---
It really is kinda bizarre how the rewards are.  They've gotta be desperate for daily player metrics to encourage the PVE players to log in and afk.   Pretty glad they went with the legendary run instead of adding a new NW grind, just wish NW could progress it more, even just one repeatable.
---
Considering I just lost both frames mid transfer to shitty internet crashing, I‚Äôve just given up for now.
---
I wish I had a deep threatening voice. Time to get a voice changer.
---
Another consideration: meat week is coming. Maybe make a camp near Graham‚Äôs location or at one of the prime meat event locations. Just for thematics.
---
I can‚Äôt remember the last time I died with my bloodied build in a SBQ fight. I typically get clipped by one of her dumb minions.
---
It's a reward you get from NW christmas 2019. Have no idea if they can be sold or not. They do have the atomic shop icon when you craft them
---
Oh yeah, it would still work if you are a public team of one.
---
If No Man's Sky and Battlefront 2 can bounce back, so can this game.
---
Nw is still broken but still ita entertaining if you have nothing better todo im not good at it so it don't bug me much. But yea the cheaters are irrating
---
That seems a bit more tedious.  I need to be able to (and have) immediately take out 4-6+ ghouls in 2-3 seconds that get through and risk failing our event.  If I'm not grinding legendaries or XP (I'm in my 220s now).  I'll calm down and chillax.  9/10 the people just go to the corridors anyway so I'll leave that be.
---
I have solo'd Radiation Rumble this way.  No ore, but no one dies.  Some get hurt (I now use two max GS on hotswap).  Totally useless against Scorchbeast though.  I just built a Bloodied 1-star Gauss Minigun for that.
---
I still need a ton of notes, so I need the events to succeed. Need SS jetpack, helmet, and T-65 full set + EP + calibrated
---
I totally get it, I'm level 298 and a coupe other high levels waiting on radiation rumble with 6 minutes on the clock when a level 22 came along and started the event early
---
When I never had a decent enough gun I used to throw plasma grenades and they damaged her good. Is this because its energy damage and not explosive?
---
Look I'm ordinarily very respectful but if your CAMP is right next to where I'd have to nuke anyways, well...
---
That happens to me sometimes (shotty/melee bloodied) even when I rush her the whole time. It‚Äôs a weird issue.
---
A dusty casual, if you will.
---
It‚Äôs supposed to be a sandbox
---
If you‚Äôre on right now I can help you
---
My first encounter was when I decided to explore the bog at like level 15. My first kill was at Whitesprings thanks to some help from the robots. Now I can kill them in like 3 seconds lol
---
It's like having access to an automated 'follow me Mr Puppy' service.
---
Most of the time I join/create a team and still play essentially solo giving a perk card and xp buff to others and hoping they return the favour. Everyones happy. 
---
Just occasionally it ends up as a baby sitting service as low level players follow you around the map despite being woefully under equipped. Even worst than having to spend more stimpaks on others than yourself is if you get that odd lapdog who bombards you with Trade emotes, or 'can you give me some junk?'
---
So on the whole it's a positive experience, sometimes a little annoying but survivable, and just rarely makes you want to scream - much like the game as whole then!
---
It talked trash to me and I got mad because his insult was true. So he went to bed and I walked away feeling a little less salty. Lol
---
Just enable the mod. Bethesda is heavily prioritizing new content right now that we are probably years away from QoL changes.
---
Yes I can be. What‚Äôs your GT I‚Äôll invite you
---
Me too, just like pazaak in KOTOR. And Triple Triad in FFXIV. Never played Witcher 3 but I'm sure I'll ignore Gwent too.
---
I would suggest that having 2300 notes is actually a sign of wasted time. Time that would have been better spent power levelling and not doing crappy events with level 5 enemies.
---
Especially with the way the new legendary perk cards work..... So that's check mate, mate.
---
I use diluted Rad Away as that doesn‚Äôt effect the mutations at all!
---
No I‚Äôll be on probably from now for the next few hours you don‚Äôt have to get on right now. I was just letting you know that I am on
---
Just my luck!
---
turn off auto-fill team and hide in bushes. unfourtunately, i'm serious.
---
you get more exp for staying alive than you do for kills.
---
Thanks for the info, but I have been running through Steam since I purchased the game.  The only thing I sometimes do is open via the desktop shortcut as opposed to opening up Steam itself but I doubt that could cause it.  At least I don't think so. The other weird thing is that it only seemed to happen after the double xp weekend started.  Not sure how that could have happened...probably just coincidence.
---
Oh well I‚Äôm on now. I was just watching Netflix
---
Yes.  Using all 3 of those at Lv. 1 Rank, gives you 30% more damage with 1-Handed Weapons.
---
Thank you! Much appreciated!
---
No, I read it correctly.  I just want more people to be aware that GS builds done right are well worth getting Foundation Ally.  I made the mistake of doing Foundation last.
---
I got one you can have but I'm at the bar right now pm me your PSN you can have it for free I have plenty but I won't be online for at least 5 hours or maybe tomorrow if I go to someone's place
---
I got second hand stress from reading that. I'm sorry you had such a terrible time!! I'd have probably dissolved into a little puddle of tears.
---
Someone needs to hire you
---
Get a friend if you need to exchange kills.  The other nw dailies can be soloed without too much effort.
---
I started this week and after relentless grinding im nearing level 60.
---
Some tips:
---
This isn't TDM. You get more XP for high placement/survival than fragging out.
---
Gatling gun can't hit the broad side of a barn.
---
Playing in third person gives you a big advantage.
---
But also a LOT of non scumbags thank goodness!
---
Embrace the bush god.

I'm the one who is still waiting for two weeks now on Fallout 1st to show up on my account. But it turns out it was applied to my girlfriend's Bethesda account (but only when logged in via steam?) and not my steam account. Even though I verified it was purchased on my steam account and my Bethesda login. Could it be possible this same bug is what caused it because they're on the same computer? I haven't heard from support in four days and they don't understand what's happened.
---
Reading all these posts makes me think it's related maybe...
---
I tried it.
---
Went from bloodied to low health suppressors. Spent a bunch of caps to get some suppressors explody guns. Faster swing speed melee... the works. Moved some points around. Switched up my perks...
---
Did I notice a decrease in damage done to me? Eh... Maybe a little. I did notice a serious decrease in damage dealt by me, that's for sure. In the end I went back to bloodied. 
---
It had more survivability, but the drop in damage was too much. So, good on you for trying different stuff. But... once you go bloodied its hard to get away from it.
---
Basically, you‚Äôll need to manage your SPECIAL in order to fully be efficient in a certain build.  Even with 15 points in STR you‚Äôll need to decide whether to max out each damage perk, or if you‚Äôll want any weight negating perks.  With 9 points in damage, 3 in incisor and 3 in martial you‚Äôre already maxed.  
---
This is where perk loadout managers are really useful
---
Finish what you‚Äôre watching and then get on or whatever. I‚Äôll be on. I should‚Äôve responded with my original comment a little differently. I‚Äôm going to be on for a while, didn‚Äôt mean to sound like it was a now or never
---
Reasonably high def textures? Believe me, as a modder I browsed and looked closely at hundreds of these textures and edited hell of a lot of stuff there. It's pretty safe to say most textures in this game are of really low quality. Sadly, even the things they make for the atomic shop and 1st exclusive stuff suffer from the same design approach.
---
But yet I have to admit, sometimes this game does look pretty. But only sometimes and if you won't make close up shots.
---
That sick bastard!
---
If that doesn't sound like something I'd do, my lord. Lol! I'll probably take you up on that! Busy with work the next week or so, sadly, but I'll keep you in mind. My handle is the same here as there!
---
That's my new desktop background. I love it!
---
Have high stakes Texas Hold 'em like in Red Dead Redemption. Winning a game nets you a poker perk card. Perk cards can allow you to cheat successfully. Black Jack against a bot where a perk card gives you better odds at winning. Your luck stats should come into play. Hell let's open up a whole damn casino.
---
They never expect you to barrage them with plasma grenades. I save them exclusively for bounty hunters. Run in a building around the corner they never know what‚Äôs about to hit them.
---
Oh, I had a crazy Scorchbeast encounter the other day. I finally got around to that "mayor for a day" quest in Watoga, and just as I come out of the elevator for the final part of the quest on the rooftop, what do I hear but that familiar screech and a dozen robot voices. It is ON. Every Handy, Gutsy, Protectron, Eyebot, and Assaultron in Watoga is gunning for this son of a b, and I have an amazing view from atop a skyscraper. It's a legendary, so I take a few potshots so when this beast is slain, I might be able to get a little something if I can find the body. Also, all the Gutsys who spawn to try to stop you accomplishing your goal on this quest are aggroing at the scorchbeast and myself, so it's insane. Then, when the timer to mission completion is at like 9 seconds, the scorchbeast flies up to our rooftop battle and downs me. I'm hoping my death counter is longer than it takes this mission to complete, and it is. whew!  By the time I respawn and get back up to the roof, I get a large chunk of dead scorchbeast XP, and and a legendary weapon even though I never found the body.  It also triggered the next part of that daily quest where you acquire viable scorchbeast DNA. Again, never got near the corpse so it must have splattered all over me at some point.
---
Oh no it‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôm on now. Just hit me with your GT and I‚Äôll invite. Just had Netflix on for background noise really
---
I swear I read lobster barrel
---
nearly all my display weapons are 90%rw otherwise they just chew up the budget.
---
I'm so glad I'm not the only emotional lady playing this game. Lmao. When I have time, maybe we will do this and if it doesn't go well, we can just sob together.
---
I believe si yes i havent seen one in a while but know a few people that have gotten it before

Me and my mates call anyone (ourselves included) hiding in the foliage, Bush Babies

I went from 180 to 333. Went from rant 30 to 76. Glassed Caverns the whole weekend!

Congrats ! That mask is so cool looking , I love seeing players running around the wasteland in one
---
Is it similar to faschnat where it's active on the hour every hour?
---
Thank covid-19.
---
There is a little recoil but I only keep a continuous fire if it is not moving much. When I do pull it out the animation has it swaying around, but as soon as I pull the trigger the swaying is gone and all I have to do is keep it on the target. I do have a mod for extra ammo (625) with the added electrical damage and running anywhere from 55 to 29 HP and I do around 136 damage (and I think 40ish electrical) without any perks, But the thing with that weapon is unlike any of the other gauss weapons, it charges when it is firing plus with added splash damage. If a SB lands it will go down in 50 (+-) rounds. I have took down 3 SB in a row in about 250-300 rounds. 
---
I use PA to jump off a cliff and get out, so I don't really use the Batteries Included perk and the ammo will weigh me down a little so 2500 round is max I carry.
---
Ooh, smart. Thanks for that tip! I didn't even know berry mentats did that. Doh.
---
Mostly neutral. One with a talkative teen that was border obnoxious. One with a guy that we took around helping him get Xp to level. 
---
Mostly seems people join for the bonus and go their own thing.
---
But yes, no one but me and my friend talk.
---
If this is true, that is a dumb mechanic.
---
Don't worry usually I don't get nuked unless it someone's first time and they don't know to keep the dropsite v9 out of the nuke zone you can fight her without radiation that way!
---
It should still spawn at the crater, in the comms room where Wren is. Someone might've picked up the suits before you got there
---
Look on the shelves in Wren's area.
---
Hide in a bush, works every time.
---
Not huge but you will know it's mine I have deathclaw statues all over the place.
---
yeah lol. it weighs 2 pounds. and each mininuke weighs 6 XD
---
I realized that later and was like UGH all that lead and steel and I just didn't think to make more ammo. I'm on ps4 but thank you for the kind offer!
---
Big tip, networking will get you farther than any of your schooling. Trust me.
---
You can one or two shot a lot of enemies without bloodied or junkies. I'm a mutated, full health, stealth commando and I wipe out most mobs in a few headshots. Mirelurk kings, assaultrons, some robots and Sheepsquatches take a few more bullets though. You don't need to have a meta build to be OP.
---
There are a couple in the communications center at the crater in the lockers. You can often find the clean version in my vendor.
---
Oooh, I'll try this!
---
If any of you saw the Wasteland HOA streams, I kind of wish we had something like that. I put tons of time in my camp, and I‚Äôd love to just have some people come over and vibe there.
---
I think I'll apply the new Blood Eagle super sledge skin to the All Rise i just got the other day (90% reduced weight) and display it in my camp.
---
I wouldn't worry about a wood extraction point, just go to the logging camp and other area with the massive piles and load up.
---
I just moved over near the Food Factory and am loving it! Turned a power line tower into a sweet base with industrial water purifiers, and there's plenty of glowing fungus, blood leaf, etc around. Food, Water, and most Med Supplies are coming so easy now, and the Workshop next door can be taken and set to pump out Sugar Bombs for Sweet Rolls, or Salisbury Steaks for eating.
---
It's just north of the dropsite v9 so not very far at all from the queen a few minutes walk for those with weight issues lol
---
Thanks all!
---
Agree with you 100%.
---
I have an older ps4 and it loads slower than my wife's newer one (not even pro) by a good 10-20 seconds. Both on the same wired internet, so its definitely hardware related.
---
I'm(sadly) on ps4, you kind soul.
---
To the level 400+ named 6yearoldkid, thanks for the giggles mah dude/dudette
---
I posted that prior to the 'get a kill' challenge. I'm taking back what I said. This sucks.
---
Its the point of paying for the camp. Owner gets a scrapbox those of us that dont pay dont. Or buy scrap kits with atoms.
---
I‚Äôm joining your server I accidentally deleted your message. This was quicker than typing in your GT lol
---
Just got all these a few days ago. Once you get the halloween combat armor you need a few thousand xp for seleton, however once you get the beanie you need a whole 14k xp for the fur jacket.
---
Lol ok
---
I believe they recently changed the chat volume to be separate from the master volume so that you can turn down the game without affecting chat.
---
There's the brooch from the Mistress of Mysteries quest. You can also wear a gas mask with the ghillie hood.
---
Good tip, thank you
---
It should be in the room with the communications equipment
---
What I do (stuck at home, but working), is I just make it my lunch hour.  Go in, sell something, scrip something, and trade my notes.  In the evening I just grind to 20+ notes.  I'm relatively happy with my bloodied Gauss and Unyielding SS so Legendary/scrip farming isn't that big a deal.
---
But yeah, I just do it at noon everyday despite the 20hr timer.  Keeps it consistent and my sanity sane.
---
I've done it with X-01 as bloodied but you definitely have to pop a diluted radaway fairly often to keep in the fight, or have someone pick you up every so often, which isn't so bad if you rank 2 revenant since it gives you a 50% damage buff after getting revived by a player for 2 minutes and your rads go to I think 30% after revive. Rinse, repeat, profit. Just gotta hope someone has stim packs they are willing to use.
---
Ok, I do agree with that; griefers and cheaters are truly scourge of this game.
---
I felt that way too! I feel better now because it is just a game and I learned valuable strategies and got to see the kind side of FO76 from this post so I feel much better about it today. Still a LITTLE bitter, but ya know. 
---
Thank you for sharing this with me. It feels great to have validation for something that some outside the experience would probably find silly!
---
Either that, or give us more ways to earn coins or perk card packs
---
How do you make sure you are in the same match and able to kill each other? I read someplace that you can‚Äôt team kill.
---
I use to get excited finding energy weapons in fallout games before F4. I always liked them being as rare as they were. I mean, the over abundance of them in Fallout 4 and 76 is just criminal. These expensive, high tech weapons are used by every mutant and brain dead raider.
---
I'll keep repeating - this scrap box should be shared across account!via the quest or whatever (for those who want to start new character without any help from his/her high level alt).and the scrip/gold/untradeable scrap should be be bound just to character who owns it.it's just a QoL feature, in any case if you have fo1st you may grab a lot of scrap, jump to private server, drop, switch character and pray to GABE(lol) that your server won't crash.
---
PA has emergency protocol, nuff said
---
You could use the hot tub to conceal an entrance to a secret underground glitches camp. Imagine walking past someone only to see them disappear beneath that hot bubbling water.
---
I'm a casual. There are definitely other games (mainly PVP types) where you're thrown onto a team randomly. I can't think of any others where you queue after spawning though.
---
I'm not above cheesing. ;) I've got a lot of work and a lot of offers, but my name is the same there as here!
---
Oh please no
---
It's true, there are some really great people. But like any mass grouping of humanity we take the good with the bad.
---
What would you classify as 'abusers'?
---
I just now picked up a set by Wren. If you're on PC you can have it.
---
Oh boiiii. Show me that cheese.
---
Lol yeah, I‚Äôm an explorer and I remember stumbling upon the cranberry bog sometime in my level 20s. It was very scary!

Sorry, I'm on PS4

That is a laugh or cry moment if I ever heard one. Get your shit together, Bethesda. I'm screaming internally for you!!
---
Pretty sure it's Graham only as I got it off him myself not long ago. Not always on his list either, so it's a crap shoot.
---
Keep at it, and you'll get one.
---
I'd be more interested in a mod to integrate Fed76 so I don't have to lookup everything just to make my machines more viable.  Maybe even feed the DB itself to better keep track of the market.  I always need caps despite easily getting 5-10K in a day or two of grinding.
---
For me it's like interiors looks Hella ugly. Not these open world interiors but interior in separate cell by loading screen. You would think a interior in different world would be much higher detailed with better dynamic lights etc.
---
But gosh Poseidon/monogah all these hornwright and offices interiors looks very blurry with terrible ambient light. It's like ultra bright
---
I know they fixed exterior lighting but I feel like they left interior lighting untouched.
---
Exterior graphics is very nice, each zone despite toxic valley at certain weather conditions looks great.
---
Playing f4 and custom made interior mods it's like whole new game.
---
But you have to give Beth props. If textures are such low Res they do look nice in this ancient engine.
---
English isn't my native language. Just don't know how to call people who use cheats, bugs,  glitches. Abuser most likely fits here.
---
imagine in 2K20 playing bethesda game without abusing glitches
---
Still, those who don‚Äôt need those survivability perks can always buff their damage aspects. I run bloodied on two mains, when I replace survival perks with damage perks I can one shot most things but a ghoul or unarmed scorched can one-shot me too. This won‚Äôt ever happen when I run full hp and AA or TS weapons. I lost lots of fluxes after SBQ event just because some mirelurk king one-spat me when I thought the battle is over.
---
"Does the fallout help/panic emoji"
---
LMAO. If I ever see them on my map again, may Mothman have mercy on their soul.
---
That's actually how I play NW pmuch all the time, just sneaking around, hiding until the storm subsides, keeping my back towards the wall because I am NOT cut out for PvP, let alone Battle Royale type of games  but I need that SCORE! xD
---
Most of the time people surprise me so badly I accidentally panic switch weapons or use items xD
---
I'm glad when this is over and man do I agree with that one post that said how NW challenges suck regardless if you enjoy the mode or not &gt;&gt;
---
Hah! Yeah, a presentable-on-the-street-but-probably-won't-get-hired-for-that-corporate-job casual. Rolls right off the tongue.
---
I'd love to see that pic during loading screen
---
Yes!  I am the same way.  All my doors are unlocked and anyone can go anywhere in my base.  I want people to see what ive done, maybe it will give them inspiration.  Ive come across several bases that are all locked away and the only thing you can access is the vendors.  I like looking around other peoples bases and seeing how much detail they put into it.
---
There was an exploit that allowed you to craft and sell atomic items that weren't classified as atomic late 2019. I'm pretty sure this would be one of the items that came of that
---
Should be safe to purchase and use, nobody got in any serious trouble for creating the items or using them
---
I like red more than green
---
Lol. It would be better than using instruments.
---
gta is not cross platform. what I wanted to show is that, one generation behind, I was able to transfer my progress to another generation and another platform, so is very likely that we will be able to transfer our progress within fallout.
---
I'm on ps4! You're too sweet!
---
I‚Äôll suggest watching a YouTube video and basing it off that
---
It's wildly overpriced given both the state of the game and the state of the subscription.
---
By comparison a sub to another Zenimax online game, ESO, costs the same amount per month, but that game has about 50x as much content, and while the core of the subscription is the same (scrap inventory and monthly currency) it also comes with access to DLC, faster crafting XP, and in-store discounts.  There may be some other small perks in there.
---
Fallout 1st should cost about $5 a month given the value proposition.
---
Yeah think so too. When ur not looking for him you see him everyday :) Thanks!
---
Diluted RadX (I messed up originally) but yeah. I use that and glowing blood packs to try and keep my rads from increasing.
---
That's good news.   Thank you.
---
That's the whole point.  
---
You saw some glitch/bug whatever - you'll immediately report it, since you could get a bounty for that, instead of silently abusing it or just doing nothing.  
---
note: you - I don't mean exactly you, but anyone else, literally.
---
YOU‚ÄôRE ALL SPECTACULAR!!!
---
There's raising awareness and then there's whining, bitching and moaning.
---
Stack perks for your weapon of choice. I have a similar build to yours and my turning point was getting a good level 50 legendary shotgun. With perks stacked for the shotgun I can one-shot pretty much anything.
---
Ninja edit to say my armor is garbage and it's never been an issue. I only use armor for the legendary buffs.
---
Would you? That would be amazing! What paints do they have that are non atomic shop?
---
What platform. Hunting humans or animal? I love things like this. RP a business service.
---
Yeah it's hilariously stupid. I run the game on a pretty good laptop with a SSD. I usually load in faster than others. My fiance uses a PC with a harddrive and loads times are noticeably longer. 
---
It is a huuuge advantage, especially if you land in the same area with other players. There's countless times where I get a power armor or weapon chest seconds before someone else because I loaded in faster. It's pretty stupid and easily fixed
---
I'll give ppl some leeway when it comes to encriptid cus u actually by the circuit board to activate the event. It's just annoying is all
---
That fits actually, so don't worry about that
---
But why put an in game bounty on them? Why not just ban them like it seems Bethesda is starting to do? There are some harmless bugs and glitches that shouldnt be punished for exploiting, but it seems like Bethesda has had a change in their ways of punishment, and are now banning people for abusing things
---
Ugh, my stomach dropped. And I love that idea, taking it a little further and surprising them with a "Nope!" moment. Muahaha.
---
I went to Camp Venture for Forbidden Knowledge and he caught me after I killed the ghouls.
---
&gt; Your CAMP vending machine prices are outrageous! The only worse deal I've seen is the hand you were dealt when you were born!
---
Then I shot him for the umpteenth-thousanth time.
---
that engine of their is like 1 or 2 decades old, they know about almost everything but the real problem is how to fix them, thats just impossible
---
Ps4. I don't mind jumping around until I find the one I find the one I am after. It's nice to visit folk's camps and check out different builds. Plus occasionally I'll find something for sale that I wasn't looking for but now just have to have. Just looking to narrow this specific search down a bit.
---
ok yeah I get you, the challenges I complete say they only give 20/30/40 ect but upon completing I get 1000-2000 then when going into the atom store they disappear and I go back to 301
---
I've had some lovely people do similar stuff, too! I had this one guy give me all this amazing stuff when inwas a level 3 or so! I'm glad you had that good experience! That's so wonderful!
---
What I've done is coordinate and enter NW mode at the exact same time. Much easier done if playing together in person or on voicechat or something to coordinate.
---
I've always gotten in the same match using this technique, though I'm sure there's an off chance it'll fail
---
I think I'm approaching close to a million lbs of scrap in the box
---
yeah pretty safe to own I assume but it isn't really meant to own if you didnt earn it
---
Check the atomic shop and see if it's shows as owned. If it does screenshot and send a ticket to bethesda.
---
There is a glitch that's been around that lets people use wallpapers they don't own, I think you might be experiencing it
---
Video or it didn‚Äôt happen!
---
Just hunting animals. I play on PlayStation, so if you do the same you're in luck. Besides, hunting players is a helluva lot harder that Radstags and Deathclaws :)
---
Um... sure, why not. I only have the one character but I don't see anything wrong with what you're proposing.
---
I don't do it because it fails more than it succeeds.
---
I have a 1070ti and I run everything on low to get a reasonable frame rate, wtf
---
Nope! It's the Brotherhood of Steel Officer paint, you get it from grinding Technical Data (I usually hit up the Whitespring bunker Military Wing and then server hop)
---
You are a hoarding god!
---
I'm on ps4, sadly. Could use dumb jokes.
---
Do heavy guns work without power armor? Yes of course. But it's not possible to maximize your damage output if you aren't in power armor. The stabilized perk ignores 45 percent of your target's armor.   And it only works in power armor. If you aren't in power armor then you simply aren't doing max damage.
---
This don't make sense in consoles. 
---
A better option is a spinbox for each digit. (think of a numeric lock)
---
Idk I think they did a good job. Licensing all of that music can't be cheap and probally takes a while. Also it is most likely hard to find more songs from the 50's that feel fallout. Its not like they are writing new ones
---
I would not pay 10k to this guy for an outfit, even if he is giving me 20 level ups included in the price
---
Lol add me warrior_king99 and we can do it whenever, I just read out your post To my wife and she would also like to give you some keycards she is Lauire444
---
What are the builds that can survive it?
---
It doesn't need changed, it needs deleted.
---
They are literally in the same exact place as it was when that was ‚ÄúCrashed Space Station‚Äù.
---
Sort of. You have the main cookout event and the prime meat gathering events.
---
That's most played on the MS store, not best selling.  The game is free right now with game pass, starting a few days ago, combined with a double XP event.  Of course the hours played are going to be up.
---
+karma
---
What the fuuuuuck, what's wrong with people. I died at cuck muffin. That's a new one for me.
---
Just realized I‚Äôm missing a lot more than wallpapers! Faces of fasnacht, moth man print, and the stone wallpapers.. wtf
---
Then being able to scrap weapons/armor in the box would be real nice.  I do see it being a balance problem possibly.  The scrapbox is pretty OP, but you pay $12 for the private server (Amazon EC2 IIRC) potential hard cost, $16 in Monopoly money, and that comes on the side.  
---
Problem is, the private world is getting less viable since there is so much more to gain thanks to higher charisma and team builds.  For example, you could be strategic with your team choice to save more on fast travel.  Also all the other perks in Charisma that really help.  I used to solely do private.  Now I solely do public unless I need to get resources like acid. 
---
Would be nice to be able to get more value out of the scrap box.  Bethesda still gets your money, but now they have less Amazon EC2 costs for you spinning up another instance.
---
So is it the total weight of the weapon that's displayed that affects how much camp space it takes up? Or is it the amount of mods on it?
---
It was on that list since Wastelanders came out.
---
My new account I'm a level 20 and havent added points to my SPECIAL yet
---
It's why they have Starched Genes. Keeps you from gaining any unwanted mutations and losing wanted mutations.
---
That would be nice but I don't think it's accurate. Why do you think it is?
---
A total butthead! You're probably right on the build front but I'm such a stubborn lady.
---
I've got 5k on behemoths
---
Are you taking armor and resistances in to consideration?
---
I use T-65 although rad resistance is much to be considered 
---
I honestly prefer staying outside if I can help it otherwise my damage goes all haywire and I get killed easier, its annoying lol
---
Damn I'm on pc. I'd definitely do a gun for hire for some meats. I'm always looking for gulper innards for the pepperoni roll.
---
It's an honor. Thank you!
---
I actually noticed this while wearing the perk. Thought the vendors was bugged at first, but then thought it might be the perk so removed it and didnt think much of it, but found it kinda funny after. Almost as if the bug had turned into a feature..
---
I‚Äôm running nearly every damaging boosting perk and still survive. I don‚Äôt given my current build in the game I‚Äôm able to out damage nearly every other player and still survive damage from mobs. The only time I die is when I kill myself with explosives. Idk if you‚Äôre just not as optimized as I am but given all the support that bloodied has you can be tanky and one snot anything. You‚Äôre very easily able to get the most damage with that build and have survivability.
---
Update!  It mostly (still had some days with no daily trigger) worked, and I got the plan.  Just in time for 2x XP, too.
---
Zero chance I didn't do that much
---
Thanks. It doesn‚Äôt show them as owned.. the only proof I have is that I currently have the black and red wallpaper in my camp and the other stuff from the bundle.
---
Clearly a cat was taught to play fo76
---
Well it was about this time I noticed that Todd Howard was about 8 stories tall and was a three-headed nuclear monstrosity from the backwoods of Appalachia
---
I heard it gets tougher the more people that are around.
---
I spawn in at the bottom right corner of Morgantown High School (the back of the building). There's a staircase leading to the roof. 99/100 times there is a case up there. I've seen another player go up there maybe once or twice. I hide up there until it's time to move. Then it's bush wookie time. I stay on the outer rim of the safe area as long as I can.
---
Hot damn thats a hefty improvement! Nice work!
---
I generally don't talk in game chat. Even in party chat with friends, I tend to be quiet. Most of the time, most people have been quiet, which is perfectly fine by me. It is grating when people aren't talking to each other in-game, but still don't mute their mic, so you get all the sound effects of eating, talking, etc. It makes it hard for me to focus sometimes. (Not that this is the other player's fault. I just duck into my own private party chat and it solves the problem.)
---
99% of the time, I create the INT Building team, and I either never get people to join, or have a hard time getting people to stay. They join Legendary Hunting teams or Event teams, and then there aren't a ton of events, or they don't play.
---
When I join another created team, I get removed in favor of someone's friends joining.
---
I have my own stuff to do, so being able to do it between big events and still get the buffs is what I'm looking for.
---
I think there's probably a good balance for me that's fun and feasible. Your take on what makes a game fun is really interesting and has given me some things to think about. Because I'm not really having fun when I'm constantly dying and ammo less. 
---
Great idea on selling water!!
---
Canned Coffee is my FAVORITE. I feel like it does not get mentioned nearly enough. That‚Äôs a solid point about healing over time. I usually mention diluted for the weight. Most times I end up using Super Stimpaks accidentally because I have them on me as reward for Scorched Earth, but I do try to save them. I alternate builds between Junkie or Low Hp. I sometimes even do a low hp Junkie.
---
So stupid question from somebody who sucks at PVP and plays PVE.  Lower level player comes to my camp starts shooting me.  I ignore, keeps going eventually pisses me off so I decide wtf why not.  Take a shot (with vats chem, etc.)do literally no damage with a great weapon then get insta killed.  What does this player have up their sleeve and or what am I doing wrong?  This is not the first time this has happened, it happens every time.  Does not matter if they are melee or not.
---
Sorta breaks the idea of a mobile tent if you think in terms of role play.  Let's pretend you go camping IRL.  You setup your tent.  Are you now going to drill a water well too hoping you find an underwater pocket you can draw from?  Probably easier to just collect from a water source.
---
Aqua boy perk is useful for Morgantown map.  I just spawn in the middle of Grafton lake and swim to the bottom and hide.   It's 100 XP that is virtually guaranteed. More than than of the lake is in the safe zone and the storm moves in a direction that is favorable to you position.  When  the storm forces you to move find a bush.
---
That's if you are farming XP.
---
But I don't always play it that way. I have friends that I team up with where we focus more on hunting other players.  That's actually more fun.  But I am trying to get to level 100 for hellfire power armor, so I spent most of the double XP weekend at the bottom of Grafton lake.   It worked. I made it to level 92.
---
Shit probably not, didn‚Äôt even think of that. I just wanna maximise my damage output as much as possible!
---
My favorite part is that you essentially have a plug for serums lol. Thats cool though, I gotta find a guy
---
I'm a philosophy nerd and there's a concept of what's good for us and not and what that might mean. (Ice cream is bad for us because it's high in fat vs ice cream is good for us because it makes us happy) so this conversation on what makes fun FUN is neato to me!
---
How the hell is it so clean ü§Øü§Øü§Ø
---
Banning isn't bad for abusers.  
---
Just I don't think it is good at this moment.  
---
Worth getting much bigger online and then - let the ban-hammer war begin.  
---
IMO - the top priority at this moment should be fixing game issues and providing new content.  
---
According to road map some new content is arriving, but still end game is pretty dull.  
---
But amount of bugs/glitches/different issues only increases and majority of them are missed(e.g. they even might don't know about that) by dev team - this is based on my personal experience as dev with more then 6 years of work in totally different areas.  
---
As a summary - bug bounty is needed to force users to report issues ASAP and those they should be fixed ASAP. Bounty itself shouldn't be big enough, but definitely should worth reporting an issue.  
---
Of course, implementing this on the first wave there will be tons of issues "wrong translation", "my npc is naked while loading", which should be awarded.  
---
So list of rules - must have.
---
I have been known to be dragon like around precious loot
---
&gt; Main Menu:¬†On PC, pressing TAB after opening the Main Menu from the Map now correctly returns the player to the Map view. 
---
How about clicking Right on the Map screen to navigate challenges? We lost that ability at some point.
---
StlGhost022. I really appreciate it. You are whats good with this community. Just let me know whenever you can and I will jump on.
---
I'm completely with you, games from other companies released in the same time period with the same performance usage looks better.
---
I meant reasonably as in compared to previous Bethesda games. IMO 76 looks a whole lot better than vanilla fo4.
---
thers a setting for that last update
---
Ah, okay. Thanks for taking interest, though! If you ever have friends on PS4 that need a service, let me know! :)
---
Bethesda's scrap kits (a source of money I desperately try to discourage new player from spending atoms on) would then be moot.  Maybe make it a legendary perk?
---
I still use the Chinese stealth armor.  Mainly because of rad resistance and low weight.  Being able to move constantly while stealth killing enemies with a shotgun is so clutch.  It allows me to get out of most situations if I‚Äôm being over-run, like in your case OP.  Only a few enemies with high PER can see through it - Scortchbeats, Mothman being a couple
---
Fixer Q:  The plan only drops from the Encryptid quest.  It is uncommon/rare. I had to buy mine.  It‚Äôs an upgrade over the standard combat rifle with a 10% inherent damage increase.  This puts it on par damage wise with the handmade.  However, I find the handmade handles better with a scope due to less recoil.  I use both.
---
Herbivore. Hear me out.
---
Eating anything whenever whereever and thru radx and radx del you can use carnivore card for best of both. I am human. I am omnivore.
---
Right, my bad, forgot those don‚Äôt drop. Uhhh well I can do Nuka paint, and can do the steel mill helmet but it doesn‚Äôt have any other pieces.
---
Cheater i had one aswell. reported and blocked
---
I would have flipped out
---
Some people have done the math but it doesn‚Äôt include double xp
---
Ill add you. I usually play 9 to midnight central time.  I started playing about the same time as you.
---
You don't sound rude at all! This is all great advice. I have a tendency to want to just DO without researching and you're totally right that this is part of why I'm struggling. 
---
Off to watch some videos! Thanks for the tips here, too!
---
My first try, I broke all my guns or ran out of ammo.   Went back to camp loaded up again, and did the same thing.     It's now obvious to me that brute force is not a good way to approach a silo run.
---
I also learned that my first build sucks.
---
Its a whats the benefit to fallout first then? It was introduced as s paid benefit. Give it to everybody and lose the revenue? Yes its nice but its a paid item that you can also pay for.
---
If so, I‚Äôd pay top dollar for a bloodied or vampires one. My regular non legendary lobber is one of my favorite meme guns to use.  It‚Äôs an excellent limb crippler. And the orbs are quite fun to shoot around imo.
---
Also a high chance of AFK players spawn there as well so easy kill or three
---
All good, I picked up the atomic onslaught paint the other day, and I‚Äôll keep an eye out on the atomic shop
---
I missed this entire xp weekend, sadly.
---
It was ps4. WHY, DID YOU NAB A NUKE? FEELING GUILTY SIR?
---
I think to be on track to finish it you had to be level 40-44 by July 16th 
---
So you are a little behind, but the double daily weekand might help you close that gap
---
Bug. Use it or lose it
---
Holy shit!! That's amazing!! I got a shot too
---
Of her headbutting me lol
---
You're talking about head gear but there is two rings you can get. Old Ring and Wedding Ring. I don't know where the Old Ring is from, but I do know where the wedding ring is.
---
i ll give u example, u can reload/use stimpaks while sprinting , all u need to do is jump in 1st person while sprinting and after landing change to 3rd person. How they gonna fix that, they must rewrite the entire movement/equip codes just for this, mate please
---
Because I love the game. But it‚Äôs just not good
---
Tactics is semi cannon (Bethesda‚Äôs words not mine)
---
I need to spend more time getting my camp better.  I was thinking about moving so maybe I will start all over.
---
I'd check and see if there is a bestiary for Fallout 76 with resistances and such to see if the math adds up. I'm not sure on how Fallout 76 calculates damage. Is the damage per shot in regards to if you hit them in the torso? What about limbs? What about head? I wouldn't be surprised if the calculations are jacked up because... well Bethesda.
---
My five chars show some guts and help the guy out, every day, week after week, and instead of some honest appreciation all they ever hear is, "we could have used those detonators to build a well in another community," and I don't even know what detonators he's complaining about...
---
Repair kits I can see still being viable for 1st members to bleed us dry of money.  If you're a member, I'd question your sanity spending atoms on scrap kits.  Just add more tabs to the scrapbox.
---
PC?  You guys get the best photos

am I missing a reference?

So damage is scaled in PvP a low will do as much damage as possible to a high level player and vice versa. When instigated PvP there is a timer you when to attack back I think it almost about 15 secs, if you dont then you go over and hit them they have protection till they hit you back , instigator tends to loss most often .
---
The taking no damgae can be a few things there is a pretty common sentinel assassin set for level 10s out there or they are using nuka cola quantum with cola nut basiclly food based god mode

I use the grocery backpack mod from the settlers, 90% reduced weight from drinks and food.  I switch on thru-hiker when I use PA.
---
There's a reason people suggest not doing trades like that, or just doing trades in general. If they dont drop first, or it's not a deal done with caps, just walk away. There's facebook groups and reddit subs that have couriers you can hire to do trades like that

Yes, it's PC :)

Haven't seen that yet, but that would be great for today's daily challenge.

It was cunt muffin but that seemed to harsh so I changed it
---
The cluelessness was astounding on their part. And also like...why make a game meant for people to be mean to each other? Kinda gross.
---
I must have bought a bundle or something. I don‚Äôt remember doing so, but I gave a few of both in my inventory.
---
Alright sweet. Love the AO paint. I‚Äôve got a Nuka set you can have, got some mods in it. Target hud, hydraulic arms, and motion assist torso. Tag is same as on here, drop in whenever.
---
No. 
---
Read the rules of this sub. **No Witch-Hunting** is allowed.

And you should use a courier next time.  There are subs and groups dedicated to assist with this.

Haha same, it feels good

I don't like pvp games in general so as long bethesda keep putting limited time rewards on NW I'll keep following the bush god teachings (right now I'm on my way to unlock the Fur-lined jacket and jeans before update 21)

The captain cosmos power armor? Funny way to describe, but accurate none the less

You should be able to get it, I think it's in the 70-80 range though

I feel so much better. I'm level 88 so maybe I'm rushing it.

Hahahaha! Angry potato. I couldn't help but laugh. Thank you.

I get that you‚Äôre able to do lots of damage full health (good on you for playing a build that‚Äôs not meta), but have you played a bloodied stealth commando? If you have adrenal reaction and a bloodied weapons you deal significantly more damage per shot and you also get the benefits of having crazy high special stats. Angry turtle did a video recently comparing damage of a weapon when at high health and when at bloodied. You go from decent damage to maybe sometimes very powerful to absolutely insane damage and having easily over 30 agility if you‚Äôre playing stealth so you‚Äôre even harder to detect. 
---
I‚Äôm thinking that the other effects should have higher caps for those situations with bosses like the SBQ or encrypted.
---
Wow I feel so dumb, never thought PC graphics would look different than console's ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I second the hiding tactic at first. Just get used to the mechanics of the world. It's not hugely different from adventure but some things are.
---
After that start joining world teams. I found my current NW crew doing this. They are very good players and super chill. I only play with the two of them. I don't play with anyone else. 
---
With a crew you can be more battle assertive.
---
Also I suggest blueprinting small bases in adventure and dropping them in NW. They can change the dynamic.
---
Take the high spots. Cliffs and mountains. Read the land. This game is one of the few where the design of the map can make or break you.
---
Yeah i forgot the name. Is there a double S.C.O.R.E weekend coming up too? If so, my hope is restored.
---
Yea ik. I put something on the market but no one has commented and I haven't found anyone selling them in game. Maybe I'm just super unlucky lol
---
No problem! Bethesda is adding extra daily challenges to help with the folks experiencing the auto completion bug. With the extra challenges and double score event, there will be opportunities to get that extra score to help get you to rank 100.
---
first of all, BoS is super non-canon. Tactics is vaguely canon (terminals in 3 and 4 mention a group of brotherhood soldiers going to the midwest and never being heard from again. closest we got to Tactics being confirmed canon.)
---
second, this early on i doubt the Brotherhood knows who the Enclave are, and with the real former US Government in the area being gone thanks to MODUS, I doubt they'll care you're technically leading the Appalachian enclave.
---
The card doesn't say it but I've been running with Starched Genes for over a year and never gained a mutation nor lost one.
---
I think they could've worded the card better.
---
Thanks a ton! I'll do my best.
---
Exactly, you just need to be high lvl to find raiders with plasma rifle, even in fallout 3 the plasma rifle was really powerful and quite feared when you see it for the first time in the hands of the Enclave guys.
---
Make a few different portable floating structures that you can blueprint from adventure mode and plop down on demand in NW for quick defenses.
---
Worst part still is although the hot doesn‚Äôt register it still aggros them to you üòÖ
---
No salt tho im genuinely curious, you relay the message you want the messenger to convey to the other end. Its not rhetorical. I am kinda proud of that score tho pretty nice one, maybe this one can go lower. My point is that while passive aggressive, they were not rhetorical. I could care less bout karma or feelings, so long as the problems get resolved or the questions get answered
---
You sell a weapon to the robot, hack it, take it from inventory and repeat.
---
I  see thank you.  Don't get me wrong I still suck at it but I thought things seemed odd.
---
EPIC!
---
God forbid anyone ask the hard questions of a community manager. This isn‚Äôt a new problem, people are reasonably upset because the current system isn‚Äôt working. My first game of last night I encountered the same issue - insta-killed my whole team flying higher in the air than anyone can normally reach, no-clipping shooting a crossbow like an assault rifle killing everyone without even aiming at them as they kid into view. Worst part is they are probably on a burner account boosting a teammate. Happens every 2x exp weekend. I feel for the community manager, but the negative feelings are justified.
---
What you're saying is like, when your light bulb burned out in bathroom you have to rebuild entire bathroom.
---
This can be true, but I haven't seen such situations ever  (about re-writing entire modules code for entire old feature; for new feature - yes, sometimes shit happens).  
---
edit: fat fingers typos
---
This is wholesome. I don‚Äôt often get people sending messages, but they‚Äôll follow me and drop extra ammo they don‚Äôt need usually. I use .45/5.56 always fun watching a low level run up to me throw the heart emote and run away (level 235 here). Makes me smile.
---
u can rejoin the same world after crash but first u must be in team . It works this way on PC, idk about other platforms
---
Conflict started on F2, been awhile since I played it or even gone over the lore. But the Enclave was kidnapping people, and just murdering anybody else that really stood in there way. Also the BoS come from a military detachment that seceded when they found out the horrible experiments going on with FEV at the lab they guarded. The FEV projects were of Enclave design so you can also say it started pre-war at the Mariposa laboratory
---
If they didn‚Äôt stack they would be pretty pointless...
---
Yes they stack. Same thing for rifleman, slugger, commando, picklock, hacker.
---
Sounds about right! :)
---
Hrmmm I'm on Xbox too and the skins apply fine for me. With exception to the future tech one
---
It's not odd at all. It is well known how terribly the game runs.
---
I empathize with you completely. As I type this there are at least 2 people on my Xbox friend list playing 76 and they duped and STILL possess thousands and thousands of items. I traded my best weapon for the dream B2525 Fixer and I'm suspended. Fine, I get why I'm not allowed to play right now, but seeing these two enjoying double XP weekend and continuing to trade with other players in the Xbox lfg...man, it's taking a lot of self-control to remain calm enough to not cancel Fallout 1st and say eff Beth forever.
---
Their dupe detection is awfully inept. It's both impressive and enraging that they can spot a single gun but not thousands of duped items on another account.
---
That said, we're at their mercy if we ever want to play again. It's unfortunate to be in this situation, but we own our part in this as well. However, this radio silence by Beth is almost worse than an outright ban because we have no idea what's happening with our accounts. We could still end up banned. We could get a character or inventory wipe. We may not hear from them until patch 21 comes out August 4th. This not knowing is torture. It's a bit of a cruel and unusual punishment for having possession of a few duped items.
---
Let's try to take comfort in the fact that we weren't banned last week. It may be a case of no news is good news. But let's also be ready to move on if we need to. I'm like a junkie with this game, but like any addiction it can be overcome with the right mindset. Beth made us go cold turkey and it generally takes about 3 days for withdrawals to subside, so we'll be ok.
---
I hope we get our accounts back soon. My 1st renewal is next week, so I'm planning to drop it Friday if we still have no updates from Beth.
---
Good luck man.
---
Bless you.
---
I'm taking your image and having it as a background for my laptop lol that image is Godly my dude
---
Here's my version: http://imgur.com/gallery/BeIIf5D 
---
considering I'm level 207 now this is old lol
---
This. Nothing is personal lmaoo. Kill the guy but dont take junk, like theres no need
---
I‚Äôve never been able to turn in more than once (in a session).  No idea what the cool down is, if any.
---
ok i appreciate the efficiency, have a nice day
---
i have had the same bug since Wastelanders dropped. ultimately harmless, but i dont think bethesda is aware if it. given it cuts off revenue (why pay for atoms and buy wallpapers when i got em all?) once they realize it's a thing i'm sure it'll get fixed quickly.
---
The upcoming weekand is double daily challenges. So you should be able to 4500+ SCORE rather than 2500 this weekand
---
yeah that's what I was wondering, if they even know yet, and if we will have any conflict and if we are the first contact with the enclave they'll ever have
---
Really hoping for a Halloween collectron that makes spooky noises/ plays spooky music like the halloween vending machines.
---
Interesting, I thought the limit was 4k but it's hard to keep track these days! :)
---
No u can‚Äôt use already pick up tech.
---
Alrighty. Thank you!
---
Possibly, i was able to kill it solo faster than when there was three of us.
---
Im not sure about 4 but isn‚Äôt the supermutants having them in 76 explained by them raiding military bases and the brotherhood when they where still around? I thought one of roses quests talks about the brotherhood being raided by super mutants and then one of the raider groups stole loot from the super mutant? 
---
Also did they ever update non legacy energy weapons to be worth actual using in 76?
---
are u referring to that enemies (sometimes) always instantly regenerate part of their HP back? If youre talking about that and yeah, its a glitch from day 1. U can see it more often with shotguns
---
i feel if they thought you were an ACTUAL pre-war government person, they'd care. but since you're some rando from a vault, the worst they'll have issue with is you being in control of literal nukes.
---
they might also hate MODUS on principle, who knows.
---
YES.
---
For one thing, the yield on crafting prime 2mm is so much higher than regular. I didn't have much use for crimson flux before, and now I do.
---
I can't speak to the damage boost, mine is one of the magic effect guns so I can't fire it too long without getting a lot of thumbs-down emotes. I assume it's significant.
---
They should let us decorate them at a reduced budget
---
there is also [this](https://m.imgur.com/wH4Uv2q), showing what level you should be by now to do it to rank 100. i dont know if the math is correct nor is it made by me, it was posted some time ago here
---
It's odd because his hardware is better than mine but gets worse performance. Yes, well known that Bethesda does not optimize games since like Morrowind.
---
People love to overreact. I can‚Äôt imagine anyone who plays now thinks it‚Äôs as bad as they make it out to be.
---
When I first started my camp, all I cared about were water purifiers and an adehesive farm.  Later on, I scaled it all back and now have a nice shopping gallery of sorts and living quarters on the second floor.
---
Only if you need to ePeen your damage numbers. 
---
Invariably there‚Äôs always more than enough people to kill her, so anything above the minimum to qualify for loot is overkill and you can get that with a Gatling laser and freebie power cores from a power station workshop.
---
Those Scorched Ticks are no joke.
---
Agreed, the principals announcement is pretty much permanently etched into my head at this point
---
You exploited and got banned my dude. There is no help.
---
Cheers. All i really want is the marshmallow power armor, and with the double S.C.O.R.E coming up, i'll play as much as possible.
---
What plaform?
---
The duper‚Äôs are the boogeyman of r/fo76, lol. Duper‚Äôs dupe, troll‚Äôs troll. These people are trolls or they are people exploiting the ammo machines themselves to force it into others peoples camps. Now Bethesda can‚Äôt know who took advantage and who was an innocent victim. If Bethesda doesn‚Äôt handle this correctly they may ban innocent people. But, like with duper‚Äôs, they may also just go by how much ammo you acquired in x amount of time.
---
I wish some people hadnt their head far in the clouds
---
It wasn‚Äôt me! It was my friend! Sure it was my dream gun, but i got 5 kids to feed officer!
---
The DOF options are amazing, if we had spotlight/ soft light sources it would be perfect
---
Xb1
---
*looking at you Bethesda marketing*
---
Same problem üò™
---
Yeah, I feel like if you like the NW mode, you aren't going to be thrilled with a bunch of doofuses running around not really playing the game, trying to punch bloatflies to death and jumping off cliffs to revive each other.
---
Absolutely! One of the massive lessons they reminded us of throughout the semesters
---
Its the surprise attack. Laser from nowhere sucking your life away usually after you have dispatched other baddies and are in cooldown mode.
---
Ah yes, I remember my first SBQ fight. FT in, wonder why everything is orange, die of rads. Spawn, die of rads. Spawn, die of rads, spawn, realize I'm not in the rad zone, go to fast travel, SBQ drops on my head. Spawn, die of rads. Spawn, die of rads. Spawn, not in the rad zone, try to make a break for it, swarmed by scorched. Spawn, die of rads...
---
Ryzen 1700 16gb 3000 MHz ram so I have no idea why it runs like shit besides Bethesda not doing their job
---
Don‚Äôt exploit loser
---
I know the brotherhood came to be just before the war and if that happened exactly how you're saying it, won't there be conflict between them since they know the enclave did the FEV experiments, and that we are the head of the enclave? another guy is saying the conflict started in Fo2 with the enclave kidnapping and killing people which I'm pretty sure I hear that before but I'm just wondering, did the beef start pre or post war?
---
The same here qua psn hahaha and yeah anytime im mostly good to go but ill add you. I will say this dont pay attention to my rank I played it with higher ranked friends and they fed me kills lol.
---
Well, most textures were ported directly from fo4. I still have to learn a lot about how lighting works in these games, but the difference in picture must come mostly from difference in lighting system and some engine tweaks... All that famous "16 times the detail" marketing crap has some truth behind it but it's still mostly marketing crap :D
---
You buy a new account and stop duping.
---
Sweet, thanks for the heads up!
---
I feel the same way. I still see evidence in even the new content that the mentality is still there clinging on too, for instance the raider quest line and characters are far, far more fleshed out than their settler counterparts in the wastelanders expansion, and raiders have received more atomic shop bundles and addons than any other faction or group. 
---
I genuinely do not understand this leaning towards the bad in every way with this game, especially when "Rebuilding America" is one of the major underlying themes. 
---
My own perceptions on this topic have been made worse by the praise that some of the Bethesda community managers have rained on trap camps that are specifically designed to kill other players.
---
"I went to eat dinner."
---
Nice alibi, seems airtight.
---
It does fit lore wise why the mutants have them in this game. But energy weapons should be a rare occurrence and not something every other mutant has 
---
Blood Eagles shouldnt have them, or very little if them as they are entirely new to Appalachia (mostly)
---
Meg's diehard raiders might have some, but considering most of the orginal raiders died out, their stores of raised energy weapons should be low
---
Love doing this type of field work too!
---
I really wish my PC area voice chat wasn't busted (no audio goes through to others but message appears). I have to do this odd dance to try and tell them LOOK AT THIS TAKE THIS FOR FREE.
---
Goddamnit Bethesda I'm trying and you aren't making it easy.
---
I put his bar so the back is right against the edge of a big drop-off. His dumbass continuously spawn-falls to his near death.
---
Well I have had the game since launch and played alot but fell off and got back into in HARD when wastelanders came out and now I'm hooked again just got 152 this morning 
---
But if your a lower lvl I am always down to help out in whatever you need
---
Jan ‚Äò19? Probably duping.
---
Bought mine in White Springs yesterday, about shed a tear when I spent that many caps. 
---
PSA - Make sure you get the vendor down to zero caps before you buy so they will replenish back to 1,400 caps so you can sell more stuff to them again.
---
What getting shot from across the map isn't normal?
---
100% agreed
---
wouldn't we still be of interest whatsoever? it's kind of lackluster that we come from the prestigious vault, the one that's supposed to rebuild America, I feel like the BOS would have high interest in us and with our overseer
---
Actually i don't even know if the brotherhood of steel even had plasma technology, in fallout 3 it seems that the Enclave are the only one to possess plasma tech, until we destroy them of course. 
---
But i don't even know the lore before fallout 3 so i can't tell.
---
ok, i am a firm supporter of helping banned guys and my history can prove that but bro, this is by far, by far the stupidest post ive read. You literally admitted to what you did and why you did it? Does that in any logical manner make sense to you? Help me i confessed to doing it but i dont deserve the sentence? Do thieves call 12 when their shit gets stolen? Just based on how stupid u sound, i hope you stay banned. Miss me with that Help me i did what they said i did but im innocent bullshit. Shoulda justa taken the L like a champ like everyone else but you had to fuck it up. You do know that the community managers check here too so you be foldin on yourself bucket. Like you sound like that white kid crying to his mom sayin the weed is your friends lmao. Grow a pair
---
No clue, probably all of the cow hungry carnivores, poor Nuka-Cowla. I'll keep fighting the good fight.
---
yeah I did um...something we shouldn't talk about one time just to try it out and it didnt end up working towards...my goal, but I got a lot of xp and I'm pretty sure it was 5o from a leveln95 glowing behemoth
---
Im quite enjoying shotguns being viable again tho
---
I don't understand why you're complaining.  
---
My idea isn't great but a least it could help reduce amount of abusers and let dev team know about much more issues then they know right now.  
---
If the issue cannot be fixed - there is always a workaround (like with players vendors months ago).
---
Oh, no. Not just PvP types of games, brother. I played WoW since Closed Beta 1. I know Blizzard pioneered a lot of systems but pretty much every themepark MMORPG has carried on for the past decade or so with similar systems. 
---
Honestly, the first thing that came to mind was Final Fantasy 14, an amazing game which I‚Äôm currently a subscribe but how they certainly have the same systems as WoW as far as the thing you mentioned and much more in common as well (the game‚Äôs director formerly played WoW, a Blizzard fan, and it‚Äôs industry standard nowadays anyway). The reason FFFXIV came to mind, aside from being a current subscriber and player, was because they certainly don‚Äôt have a handle on *all* cheating. Ban waves go out but there is botting, especially used to advertised RMT, and other things which don‚Äôt disrupt the general population. I‚Äôm pretty sure WoW also still has its with cheaters though, but I was just telling my girlfriend a day or two ago that Blizzard seemed to have much tighter security.
---
Not just MMORPG‚Äôs, many looter-shooters such as Destiny (1 and 2), The Division (1 and 2) and other games which are much more similar to Fallout 76, give or take some gameplay elements (such as base building) also use matchmaking, queueing, parties (which are from before WoW‚Äôs time in the MMO genre), etc.. 
---
I wasn‚Äôt trying to hate on you or stomp on your comment, was genuinely curious and felt I was reading something from the past haha. Like I said, I‚Äôm a big fan too and like your sentiment. No disrespect intended, just passing on info!
---
I managed to just make a post about this for the SS armor.  I'm going to leave it and hope enough noise gets through to fix it.  I dropped a ton of atoms to finally get the first skin for the SS armor, and it makes it unplayable.
---
Here's how I fixed it on my SS armor.  Remove the skin from your right arm.  I no longer have this issue, but now my OCD is going to go wild.
---
But wouldn't carnivore and herbivore cancel each other out?
---
Good god, this picture really captures how terrible the 'shiny' lighting and cube map issue is.
---
I always drop extra plans to my nicests costumers. Saying hi is a great begining
---
yeah, separate cell interiors really need some work. yesterday i was in the wendigo cave collecting brain fungus, and many of them were floating along with vines curved around invisible rock walls, and some of the lights from the brain fungus were pointing straight into another wall right next to it so instead of making a radiant green glow, it just made a tiny bright green circle. and some lights were even floating in mid air in front of the fungus so you could actually see the light source lol.
---
I also have a 750 Ti and let's just say it's not great.
---
Things have gotten a little better after using Angry Turtle's FOS fixes and grass disable tips.  I am hoping to be able to upgrade my computer in the next 6 months to a year...but since my newborn daughter will be joining us in October, I doubt this will happen.
---
The Funky Duds perk card had better be a vault boy onna 70s Hippie suit.
---
I knew I wasn't the only one misreading Monongah for all this time. Such a silly name.
---
I have come to despise floaters recently.   And i have learned to leave most mothman alone
---
Healing factor and Carnivore for me, I use to have cannibal perks and now it freed up my endurance perks.
---
Also let us keep dancing when entering photomode.
---
What does that mean
---
I'm not saying they aren't. I also play that mode, I also encountered the flying people. But the way he lashed out at him was too much.
---
They also cut graphics in half for Wastelanders release
---
See: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/g2o1wz/texture_resolution_went_down_for_many_assets_with/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
---
Okay then.
---
Yeah but I don't wanna run the whole silo again... Lol.
---
Good question
---
 Pop rad x reg. Suppresses mutations [ergo herb]. Eat all that delicious meat (equip carn perk if you got it). Then rad x deluded after. It doesnt suppress mutations or stack. :)
---
I'm pretty sure the Brotherhood doesn't have a conflict with the Enclave yet, but since the Scorched plague came from someone in the government messing with what they shouldn't, that could be a start.
---
Chinese Stealth Armor. Weapons, Instigating is the friend of sneaks.
---
Wish i could help you.
---
Dudey_Mcdudeface im normally on from 7-9 most days.
---
No because scrap kits are for scrapping junk and sending it to the stash box.
---
I'm suggesting a way to scrap weapons without a work bench, the junk obtained would still remain on the character until they found a stash box.
---
Do i need to remind you how many problems dupers created in the past, with server lag and crashes? Fuk em
---
Theres no subtitle option?
---
F2 is where we first saw conflict, and where the majority of the hatred between the two started.
---
But Maxson's BoS scuttled the Marsipoa laboratory as well as kill the scientists there when they seceded from the USA. Those scientists and that base were most likely Enclave owned/employed. I'm guessing the Enclave were not too happy about that and knew the BoS existed and had a bone to pick with them when the time was right
---
The BoS didnt know the Enclave existed until F2, they knew the Mariposa laboratory was government owned and operated, but I doubt they knew it was the Enclave (at the time) that contracted that work to be done
---
lulz cheers!
---
Man if you're ever missing them, get yourself a Raider Collectron. Try interacting with him and he will roast your ass all day.
---
One of the best things I really admire about the FO4/FO76 engine is the lighting. They really got that spot on. Especially to highlight things in an otherwise dark environment.
---
These are nice, gg !

---
Coincidence? I don't think so  
---
^(just kidding)
---
I don't bother with stim weight or which I use as I consistently have about 50 of super and regular due to events and the fact that I usually pick up plenty off of blood eagles and cultists. And lord forbid I store them cause due to having max traveling pharmacy they weigh next to nothing. 
---
Yeah I learned the canned coffee/other AP items trick because when I was going through a cooking phase I never used the AP ones cause by the time the battle was over I forgot to use them. So I just used them quickly and saw it pretty much let me power attack for free. As for stims its cause I panic heal a lot and just saw something similar. I think it's a very neat trick that I'm not sure many players know about.
---
Check out Angry Turtle's fps fix video, he has a section on the Nvidia settings that he uses to get better performance.
---
It might help.
---
&gt;I actually didn‚Äôt know that he duped.
---
&gt;After a while i had 5 b2525 fixers on me to sell for him.
---
Makes sense...
---
Oh, no even if I put stuff in the venders my camp icon doesn‚Äôt show up I just filled them real quick to check and still doesn‚Äôt do anything
---
remember , ultracite 2mm EC ammo is 2times heavier than regular 2mm EC. for example, 1K ultracite ammo=50pounds
---
But carnivore is a mutation,  not a perk.  If you lose a mutation you'd need another serum, right?
---
People, who adjusted their skill points instead of buying cards are absolutely screwed by this system
---
Got a two shot gauss mini......it melts everything!!!!!
---
I haven't moved mine in months, just curated things here and there over time till I got it exactly the way I wanted 
---
I know I don't have alot for sale but come by and look at my hard work damnit xD
---
Lol he has all my wallpapers!!! The bastard!
---
i mean in that sense, sure, they would be interested in us. but the Brotherhood is made up of military who secceeded from the government literal days before the bombs dropped, and the enclave is made up of the former government, hence why i imagine there'd be outright hostilities if the appalachian enclave were still alive. but with Johnny Randomson, from that one vault with the smart folks in it, in charge instead of Thomas Eckhart, they arent gonna be immediately hostile just cuz we are technically the Enclave General.
---
"you lead the enclave? what's that?"
---
"these idiot senators hid in a bunker with an AI named MODUS and tried to rule the world by destroying it but then MODUS killed them all and then i showed up and he said 'you're in charge now, have some nukes'."
---
Incredible!
---
You don't mind if I put this in my pics folder for desktop pic rotation, do you? :)
---
The new Godzilla movie looks cool
---
Better than 80% of other legendary rolls you can get
---
Dont overestimate lol, more like 5%
---
Starch genes *2 never lose mutations.
---
Yes it is a mutation but in end there is a card for it.
---
Serum or radiation. I love me my mutations.
---
In case i wasnt clear look up perk card carnivore in endurance.
---
if they find out the enclave released the scorchbeasts then I feel like this could be the start of main beef since the scorchbeasts are the worst thing to happen to probably the entirety of the eastern U.S., surprised they introduced such a huge menace and never had it in any of the other fallout games, I wonder if with the BOS they will find a way to eradicate the scorched plague once and for all since it isn't even mentioned anywhere in the universe
---
Yes dude im playing in third person now but if you think that is bad try holding the 50 cal in first person
---
Will check it out, thank you!
---
So majestic.
---
there are shortcuts , like that terminal doors in that room where u must replace around 15cores, u ll run it to launch room in less than 1min. The whole silo should reset in 10mins, u got plenty of time
---
That kind of depends on the the expeditionary force personnel, doesn't it?  
---
If they're particularly zealous, violently blaming scientists and the pre-war government for the end of the world, they might respond badly to us, given we're the legacy of those groups and that world.  
---
But that also puts them more in line with the isolationist versions of the Brotherhood from further down the line, and also really just makes'em Raiders in fancier suits.  
---
If they're really more concerned with the state of Appalachia and Taggerdy's forces, they'll likely be intrigued to find out what we know, with trouble coming in just how we came to know it and what we've done, given Maxson's stance on the bombs.  
---
Given Taggerdy's forces didn't seem to pay any of the local Vaults any mind, I don't those folks'll specifically care either, beyond just "You're Vault Dwellers huh? That's some luck." Unless of course they have specific orders to do so, which would still feel more adjacent to the "Find out what happen to Liz and her troops" concern.
---
Is it the one where he tries to defend himself by calling people pigeons?
---
They should ban or not ban. If they don't, I don't think they should touch your atoms or atom shop purchases.  Clearing inventories and wiping levels is one thing. If a player made legitimate purchases, that can be proven with a bank statement, those purchases shouldn't be removed. 
---
Ban or don't ban, they are putting to much thought into this and we all know they aren't good at thinking. 
---
On the flip side, I'm loving the new players. They are so much more pleasant.
---
Thanks, I should have done more research when I bought the card.  For probably 25 to 50 bucks more money, I could have gotten a more performance.
---
You can post a link to it. Or just pm me. I‚Äôd love to just read it.
---
Because not much has changed really. Especially when you look at Zenimax Online Studios, which is under the same family COMPANIES and what they did with ESO.
---
You mean the damage stat on your weapon does not equal the damage being done to the enemy?
---
If yes, then that is fairly normal. You probably aren't taking the enemy's armor or resistance in to play.
---
just thought of something else, maybe the brotherhood will try to infiltrate the enclave with us leading it, to seize access to the nukes, but then again the continuity and contingency of the whole fallout universe would be in jeopardy, if the brotherhood had nukes throughout the whole franchise it would change everything, which is what sucks about having a "prequel" fallout, you know what's gonna happen eventually, the brotherhood cant keep the nukes or they would've used them in any of the other games
---
Looks far more epic than it actually, usually is. I do wish they‚Äôd re-do the event and make her more deadly.
---
Yes, I have starched genes 2.  Put it on as soon as I caught healing factor.  So if I take off starched genes and take rad x it will temporarily suppress mutations?
---
Last year they combined it with a double XP weekend and I gained so many levels from those events.
---
Maybe it will appear in the future
---
thank you much appreciated
---
I couldn't tell you whose CAMP this was, but this is probably the most clever integration I've come across: [https://imgur.com/a/310xfnu](https://imgur.com/a/310xfnu)
---
Absolutely a flop compared tot he E3 promises.
---
I try to keep positive, most of the time it's a fum game. :)
---
I play RR extrictly for XP and legendaries, so the less people involved the better the profit. This is applicable to almost all events with a large number of enemies...
---
I know that you can get insane amounts of damage but it's not needed in 90% of this game because it's easy. If you want to kill the SBQ in 5 shots then yeah, go for the max. I just get enough to put most of this game on cruise control. I'm not that invested to min max myself but I get why others do it.
---
Also, if I get my account back this week, and didn't receive a character or inventory wipe, I'm never again going to trade or buy weapons from other players. That whole system is dead to me now. If I don't get it from the Purveyor, or from legendary enemies, or I don't craft it myself, I'm not going near it. I'll never be accused of possessing a duped item again. I won't even play with the general public anymore. Nope. That is dead to me as well. I have one friend who wouldn't ever do any of that stuff who I'll play with. The rest of the community is gone now. No more helping new players like I used to. No more buying stuff at every camp I visit. I'll use the caps I get from playing to buy gold from Smiley. That's it.
---
Reminds me of the time I went exploring and came to Whitesprings on level 15 or so. A level 60 charred ghoul munched on me, before I knew what hit me.
---
I had to play 8 GAMES to get a single kill today. absolutely the worst challenge
---
assaultrons are the hardest enemies in the game, a lvl 91 glowing deathclaw is a lame joke next to that facelaser shooting pile of junk. so dont be disappointed, everyone struggles with them at the beginning.   
---
the CSA is awesome. cheap and doing a great job, i used it up into the 150ies, so stick to that for now.  
---
my character made a huge jump at damage, when i switched from rifleman to commando and started using automated weapons. fixer would be the best of course but even a 1* two shot handmade does a great job to start over. before i switched to bloodied playstyle, i used a furios handmade with 25% less vats cost (for bigger enemies) and an Instigating 25 lvc combat rifle. quite cheap to get and it nearly oneshots still everything with some damage related perks (bloody mess 3 in luck, tenderizer 3 in CHA and three times commando 3). it dont have to be a fixer, work your way up. but to mention it: fixer plan can be found as a reward at the encrypted event which is an event with a legendary assaultron (yay!), i think its the hardest enemy in the game, so you wont do it alone but perhaps you get lucky, so join it when it pops up and try to stay alive :)  
---
(also, to mention it: legendary fixers cant be dropped by enemies. you have to learn the plan and then hope on good rolls from mama murgh)
---
Awesome! But it‚Äôs as if the CAMP was built around it.
---
Exactly this. I‚Äôve noticed this a lot! It‚Äôs obvious and everyone knows they suck without cheats but as long as they can take out one unsuspecting low level, then their ego appetite is feed.
---
yeah but what did happen, the enclave released the scorchbeasts and the brotherhood is going to respond very very poorly to us being head if the enclave, the organization that released this plague and subsequently wiped out taggerdy's forces and wiped out all of Appalachia's residents for years
---
Alright , thanks!
---
I definitely can turn in more than one a session, although that wasn‚Äôt really what I asked.
---
Practice is the best answer there is a counter to every meta strategy
---
The option is there, just not everything has them.
---
Close but not quite.
---
Never take it off unless trying to *lose* one.
---
Taking rad x full strength suppresses your mutations for 9m.
---
Step one is take a rad x. Step two is eat all the meat you want/need for buffs ECT. [Sidenote carnivore perk works same as herb/carn mutations for inc benwfit of food buff]
---
Finally step 3. After eating meat THEN take rad x deluded. Because the rad x's dont stack. AND rad x deluded doesnt suppress you can "temporarily remove" your mutations to benefot from meat.
---
*phew
---
Let me rewrite the story so i can better confess my ‚Äúcrimes‚Äù ill send it to you in PM when im done aight?
---
No this is the one where he says he had someone dupe and he sold them for profit for him and he had 5 fixers and complained that bethesda was banning people for no reason after explaining what he did, when he did it and why he did it. Top class intellectual honestly
---
You're making them a favor. Don't loot the corpse tho
---
you dont want to use the cryolater on the queen for damage anyways,
---
the benefit of using it against her is the freezing effect that keeps her on the ground
---
on a sidenote though both hunter and zealots effect work on the queen as far as i know
---
That's most likely because of the CVAA.

I would bet a good amount of money that Beth won't ever implement text chat just so they don't have to fork over cash.
---
Nono dont waste your time, what was your process of thinking, that is all. Duping is fine idrc but stupidity is hilarious and you sir are a comedian
---
It says Full Game. Must be typo.
---
I had to move two of my camps to get the settlers and raiders skins to apply. The other three I didn't move, and they all still have the default skin.
---
Sounds to me like we might get what we were promised after we pay a few hundred thousand in subscription fees...
---
That‚Äôs fair but my point still remains. Bloodied shouldn‚Äôt do more damage than zealots when fighting scorched mobs.
---
BUT ALSO THE MAN THE MYTH THE LEGEND HIMSELF
---
Whenever I'm on crook duty, I make sure I am ahead of the cows with blocker perk equipped, so the sheepsquatch targets me first before it can even 1-shot the cows. I usually quick swap (press button not scroll wheel) to a shotty to get a VATS hit that will take care of loot.
---
I think a lot of people just unload because you get worse rewards if all 3 cows don't survive, and the sheepsquatch can 1-hit the cows. However, simply body blocking the boss will prevent that from happening.
---
I know your struggle and how you feel. Always had sh*tty computer by myself for really long until I started to work. Well my laptop is now pretty old-fashioned compare to latest games. But I enjoy like I enjoyed in past. Hope everything works! Your priority is your daughter now. I hope she be healthy. That is more important.
---
PA with Medical Pump + First Aid or Field Surgeon
---
the trade-off with rad-x is that you spend 10 minutes with your mutations suppressed, then after that the negative effects become suppressed for 50 minutes whilst your mutations become once again active
---
The Line in the Sand event with the tent trick and an explosive gun was my cash cow.
---
Agree!
---
I didnt see that one! Funny how they're all coming out of the cracks to complain en masse.
---
He removed it so quick im tryna do an imgur thing
---
I've played on ps4 regularly for a while and lobbies are (well...were, pre-covid) only 30ish people on weekdays when most us players would be at work. Other than that, my matches are the full 52, give or take a dc or two during load in
---
Marsupial and speed demon are must haves imho for basically every build.  Adrenal reaction is close but if you go full hp and don't have space for class freak then don't take it.
---
After that, it depends.  I have two characters atm, one is stealth rifle/shotgun hybrid and the other junky unarmed.  I use bird bones and eagle eyes for stealth ranged build and twisted muscles and talons for unarmed.
---
You weren‚Äôt promised those things as part of your subscription. They were always future feature. You don‚Äôt pay today for something that is released in the future with a subscription service. That‚Äôs not how it works.
---
You become an Enclave general to gain entrance to the silo, not  because you are an Enclave true believer.  I don't think BOS will know or care that you an Enclave general, since there is no real Enclave presence in Appalachia.
---
I haven't bought atomic shop apparel so I don't know any.
---
*Wheeze*
---
He deleted it within 5 mins tho
---
the brotherhood are usually very close minded, what if they just learn this and learn what the enclave have done and it goes down from there?
---
Any Ghillie skins will have problems with certain weapons and vision. I found that Heavy Guns are the most problematic when I had Ghillie Metal Armor.
---
It's my fav gun to shoot for all the reasons you noted. More options would be more fun though.
---
Then she goes underworld and then again is flying.
---
That's not true. Legacy are guns you can't get from drops anymore, they were removed from the pool but they didn't remove the ones that were already dropped.
---
Nice picture!   Very cool.
---
Yes! You said it perfectly. They were running from one area to the next and they weren‚Äôt even looking. They just *knew* where everyone was. It was infuriating.
---
Has to be some lag or some bug then.. dont know man
---
It does but the the damage figures are broken and don‚Äôt show it correctly. Angry Turtle does a video to prove the math and shows it working.
---
Up for a quick soul bond?
---
how about flatwoods? there are many trees and houses, especially the diner opposite to the church always have salt, pepper and spices.  
---
edit: and btw, i dont get the map. the charlston fire dept with its gym, the number one spot of lead in the whole game, isnt even marked.
---
My bloodied deathclaw says it does about 1,900 damage. Sometimes 2,000 when I take food buffs and drugs. 
---
But when I fight the queen the damage numbers are usually between 900-1200. 
---
It‚Äôs because of the armor, and resistance the queen has. Each enemy has a specific damage resistance. Depending on the enemy, the level, the type, etc.  So let‚Äôs say your gun does 100 damage right. If the enemy has no protection, then the numbers that will show when you hit an enemy will be 100. 
---
But if he has 50% resistance to your gun; then the number will show up as 50% whatever your damage says on your pip boy.
---
Check my profile just uploaded an imagr
---
Yes my guy its me.
---
 I read it agian myself.
---
Not very smart indeed.
---
I get that your upset.
---
I wasnt smart.
---
I am sorry.
---
I see why i am banned.
---
I did dumb thing‚Äôs
---
You guys should be mad.
---
I am gonna delete my mail to bethesda.
---
Regards tonijn11.
---
Just uploaded a picture check my profile
---
Hey guys what about adrenaline doesnt work in its current format? I'm still trying to learn everything but I'm currently running it on my melee build
---
Lol that was what I noticed after I finished dying of laughter when I caught that image
---
Timer would be perfect, like the old minecraft hunger games.  I ended up moving the game to my m.2 drive, and now I'm the piece of shit I hated before
---
Yeah definitely a worthwhile weekend to put life on hold haha. I went from 27 to 49, going back to normal is going to be hard!
---
Im not mad, idrc u duped. you just mad stupid and its funny. Dupers benefit everyone but idiots ruin everything
---
Dang xbox is way better about this you wait maybe 2 to 3 minutes boom then your in a n game
---
This is Art. Looks like drawn. Awesome shot.üòÉüëç
---
Some things in this game look straight out of a mobile game on low settings.
---
It's not too bad if you play as a sniper or utilize some other tricks like using stealth boys to get up behind someone and shotgun their head off.
---
The first comment implies they must be possible to have if people are shooting the queen with them. If you didnt see that, then you really wanted to jump the gun on pointing out stuff i said thats wrong
---
88 is the white captain Cosmo power armor. Although the cool black is the last one
---
i'm figuring that the new appalachian chapter coming with patch 22 is gonna eventually (not right away, but after a few irl years of story updates) defect from the main branch like Lyons in Fallout 3 did and turn from "collect texhnology and fight mutants" into "protect Appalachia's people by killing mutants", and down the road may just use the BoS branding out of convenience cuz they already have it. just my speculation there though, but it would explain why the main BoS never mentions an Appalachian group in other games- "we dont talk about those defectors and honestly hope they're all dead."
---
Haha i know, I find solace in the fact that ill start hoarding rank ups for a bit until I choose to change my build around lol
---
Good to hear.
---
I believe August? like a little while into august
---
We were promised those features in the beginning! And I am not getting into this back and forth you people that think "Bethesda does no wrong" likes to get in! Go back and read all the treads about this issue over the past nine months.
---
If you're in the states I have a full size gtx 970 sitting in my pc box-o-parts I can mail you. It's a small upgrade from the 750. DM me if you're interested.
---
The, "pride and satisfaction" route might work if getting Bloodied/Junkied stuff was any more challenging than getting anything else.  
---
The good stuff isn't good because of any deliberate attempt to create tiers.  Bethesda just can't balance for shit.
---
I saw that post earlier. You knew they were duped, you even looked it up and you STILL BOUGHT IT. And you don't know why you were banned? You knew it was a dupe!
---
Agree
---
but if the Appalachian chapter survives even just 20, 30 years they have access to unlimited nuclear warheads, and if one stupid vault dweller with a big gun can clear a nuclear silo and launch a nuke I guarantee a whole squad of BOS Paladins could launch a nuke without trying, they would have limitless power over the whole country, launching nukes whenever they want, but I'm assuming they dont last long since they're never mentioned and no nukes get launched in the future
---
I mean if theyre gonna release it polished, last thing I want is another buggy mess on release
---
Wendigo colossus, how about fixing it so I can finally find one üòÇ
---
This too, yeah. Well, while they miserably fail at optimizing their engine, there's always an option to further downscale the game's assets to accommodate tolerable framerates on a wider spectrum of end-user rigs. I guess relatively small part of the playerbase have got high end computers, many people play the game at potato quality and Beth has this statistical data at hand so their decision to default to such dirty tricks kinda makes sense.
---
Yes you just have to ticket them but there's been numerous accounts of people doing it for that same reason.
---
That is an amazing screenshot oh my god!
---
But how are they going to know that? Hell, half the 76'ers don't know that.
---
For the Appalachian factions, the blasted things came out of nowhere and tore into them in a way that made finding their true source all but impossible.
---
We only know because MODUS recorded so much of the going's on in the bunker.
---
So for this troop to find out, they'd either have to access the bunker, and I really don't think MODUS'll take kindly to that, or one of us has to tell them and that's almost guaranteed to be parsed in such a way as to shield us from blame, given we had nothing to do with it anyway and neither did most of the Bunker residents who were present at the time.
---
It was Eckhart and a handful of scientists.
---
More likely they'll be mad at us for the nukes, given those are our fault.
---
Nope. Stopped playing BECAUSE of that stuff.
---
Thanks Valseek!
---
I actually clicked on your previous post with the picture, that‚Äôs funny shit...Even funnier is I backed out of it and went back in a couple times thinking to myself, I‚Äôm not trying to comment on this post
---
I hit level 50 thursday night, bought a full set of Unyielding Combat armor, and hit 148 without playing yesterday. 
---
That‚Äôs how OP Uny. is.
---
They were future features... they never said they were included in your subscription. 
---
That‚Äôs just a fact. Show me where they said ‚Äúif you buy a subscription and you will get these features‚Äù. 
---
I agree it would be nice if they moved faster. But the fact is these were always future features.
---
[Edit: original announcement](https://bethesda.net/en/article/3r1YDnDtyO1CtNFbJX6RBJ/fallout-76-fallout-1st-launch)
---
I provided my source. Now you show me yours where they promised you these things with your subscription.
---
&gt;Only if you need to ePeen your damage numbers.
---
What if you want to craft a decent amount of ammo so you can use the gun for more than 3 seconds?  
---
Or is that too, "ePeen"?
---
Righteous play here.
---
184 to 306.
---
Bethesda will get rid of them for you.  Or you could wait and see if you get banned then email them
---
The HOA is back actually just under a new name. They‚Äôre on twitter mostly.
---
what kind of XP does claiming a workshop get you ?
---
My bloodied did go from 75 to 127. Dmg went from 98 to 73, still enough to melt nearly all, and with the 50% increase... lets see how it fares against the sbq. Math says it should do even more dmg than the prime receiver.
---
Yeah they'll issue you a one-time refund.
---
yeah I feel like they're going to infiltrate the bunker, and you know the brotherhood they're going to collect all the data they can, find out about it, and maybe destroy the bunker/modus
---
Fastest way is to buy gatling gun blueprint either from Players Shops if ure lucky, or from the robot vendor in watoga Shopping plaza, build some at the workbench and scrap them right away. I think i never have found a World item gatling gun mod as the weapon itself isnt that common i would say
---
I don't know about removing them but I think they should give more score considering the amount of time they take. You could run West Tek quite a few times in what it takes to get into a game.
---
Really? What‚Äôs the new name?
---
Friend of mine was on there a few times, figure he would want to know.
---
You could convert them to scrip at the machines at the train stations - or - just hold on to them. You didn't dupe them so no harm.
---
I often sell 3 star weapons for 100 caps as a way to quickly get rid of them instead of dropping them when I reach the daily scrip limit. Its not your problem to have to worry about the source.
---
Ok the only time I‚Äôve seen one spawn is a cultist in point pleasant
---
And he would get 25%. Yeah I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs the sharpest tool in the shed
---
Thats just a load of nonsense
---
if you‚Äôre talking about amounts 350 usually with not boosters i believe, around 1,000 with a teammate and double xp weekend
---
Lm-balls-off
---
Ha! That's great. It's always the same story. And they think people are going to just accept it, when we are literally reading the same exact story. And it's seldom them that duped the item, but a friend. 
---
Read one today the guy was literally bitching about how much the dupers are greedy, when they are supposed to be doing this for the good of the game. He was literally buying the whole Robin Hood story. I told him he needs to go away with his cheating ways.
---
He got salty with me, saying. Ask me if I care. I said you may not now, but when your account gets banned for buying duped items, you'll be coming here posting about how unfair it was. 
---
He replied, you don't get banned for buying duped items, only for duping them, I should read the TOS.
---
I laughed and told him that there was literally just a big wave of bans on players for buying duped items. And that talking about wanting to buy duped items in this forum can get you banned from it.
---
He deleted his post. I guess he did care after all.
---
Thank you, that made much more sense!  I've only been playing this fallout for 2 months, so a lot of it is still new and different.
---
I‚Äôm actually quite enjoying going in. Having to do so has made me unlock a bunch of stuff lately. And if you really object just grind an extra twenty minutes of so in adventure to get the repeatable
---
Yes it's possible, my friend has a 2* ts/10wa lobber. He got it from a random legandary mole miner in welch.
---
Since all you can possibly lose is junk... and bragging rights... nO FeAr!!!!
---
My proverbial [Reddit] and virtual [appalachian] door(s) is/are always open! If you're on psn i can give you some helpful how to-s or answer highh level questions.
---
Ootp?
---
I thought the Colossus was being moved to only spawn at this event in the mine. The wild one in the Mire will go away? I don't play on the PTS though, just what I remember reading someplace. Also, they mine will get auto-nuked once per hour on each server.
---
It's why I keep even shit legendary versions of some guns if they have reduced weight 90%. They make great display pieces and are light enough to display modded as well.
---
I really wish we had a Respec system tbh.
---
Sounds oddly weird
---
I‚Äôm level 321 on Xbox my gamer tag is its her daddy, come check out my house. I agree houses feel more end game than endgame. I put everything into mine.
---
Ima be honest, i dont mind dupers but thats cause i dont trade high tier weapons. Duping clothes and stuff I genuinely dont think is that bad and honestly if they dupin literally just to gove it out, who can really hate on genorisity. Thats only if they fr bout it and aint on some profit shit yk
---
I suggest you get over it now. The last thing this forum needs more of is a hundred posts whing how unfair the game is to them and they deserve double of everything. 
---
Just play the game, get new perk cards, and deal with it. You aren't in competition with anyone about what you have in the game. So you aren't losing out. It's not unfair if someone has a few more perk cards because they didn't swap their points around.
---
If there‚Äôs any junkie weapon I could buy it off you
---
Making YouTube vids has been a decent side hustle for me, might as well keep the editing speed and skills from getting rusty, and sometimes you can make some decent pocket change
---
Ah i‚Äôm ps4. Too bad
---
Thats pretty nutty, damn! I havent even compiled an armor set yet, thats next on my list
---
If the atoms are going to the bethesda client for steam users, are they just gone for pc gamepass users?  I've never bought or played the steam or Bethesda launcher version, but I did own the original xbox version.  I wonder if they are being transferred to the original xbox account on console version and can't be accessed on the pc gamepass version?
---
I‚Äôve been trying to do this since i launched my first nuke, it looks awesome
---
Cause everyone reads the 100+ page terms of service before they play the game...
---
I want to say neither? Think they use the same amount of CAMP Budget regardless. If you're trying to save Stash capacity, though, that is determined by weight.
---
Remove the future tec skin, off your camp module
---
Just shoot them in the thruster, they melt like butter every time. :P
---
I'm on Xbox.   I've been playing Fallout in general since 1999.  FO76 seemed like it would be so bad at launch, that we didn't start it until free play weekend in May.
---
Hey ikki, we traded some 556 for mats yesterday. You should come check out my camp someday, guarantee you‚Äôll leave saying it‚Äôs one of the most elaborate and crazy camps you‚Äôve ever see.
---
I have one spare fixer plan and I'm looking for a nice bloodied short gun or combat knife [xbox]
---
Endangered my ass they're an invasive species! lol
---
Gotcha. I don't have any family on Xbox but if they ever invent cross play in at your camp door knocking and waving friendly!
---
If there are any questions you have the proverbial door is still optional :)
---
I wear the moniker proudly....
---
Oh yeah definitely. Check out mine too. It is small but I am pretty proud of it.
---
Or just have all legendarys in an event give xp and the loot to any player not just who shot it, although this would probably create an afk problem
---
Duping doesn't affect my game, because I don't really buy stuff. But things like costumes, weapons, plans and such. Those are the rewards of the game. And when they get duped and are too common, it removes the reward for many players, and makes people lose interest in the game if they get to many rewards without any playing.
---
Take mounted heads. I thought they were great. But the plans, even the rare ones, are so common because of dupers, they don't mean anything anymore. They don't make you play better, or give you any benefit. 
---
But they were a reward and not they are not. Or won't be for like a year or more.
---
Ah, I truly can‚Äôt recall it off the top of my head but I follow a few accounts who retweeted it. I know the PKOA is still active, but HOA was hilarious with their commentary.
---
It still displays your gamer tag to everyone else. Just shows you your ‚Äúname‚Äù
---
When I tried it, I was ignored
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a good feeling when people stop in for a while and have a look around. That‚Äôs what my entire gameplay is centered around now. If they seem interested, I‚Äôll give them a tour that‚Äôll blow their minds. I literally can‚Äôt even count how many friend request and direct messages I‚Äôve gotten saying it‚Äôs the most crazy camp they‚Äôve ever seen
---
Oh believe me I know. Poison, burning damage, and rads are the biggest threats. I have more trouble with mirelurk kings and assaultrons than anything else in the game, anything else goes down easy.
---
I'm set to run one of 3 weapon types(mele, shotguns, heavy), though I generally just run heavy. Bloodied gat for trash mobs, and bloodied minigun for the queen's face. I'm still tweaking my build but it does work.

My build:

---
I will! Should be on later
---
When I did the quest it didn‚Äôt allow me to turn in any previously gathered data.  
---
I‚Äôm not sure what triggers the quest though.  You‚Äôre saying you can keep turning in the data over and over?  I turn it in and still end up with all the excess to sell as junk
---
The lobbies on xbox are almost always full and you find games instantly.  I have watched a lot of NW on livestreams on all platforms and it seems like the Playstation NW population is by far the lowest out of all the platforms.  I am not sure why.  On xbox the population is quite healthy actually.  During prime time I bet we'd even be able to support different queues for solo/duo etc.
---
That is so true. 
---
This whole system needs damn rework lol. Maybe they should give everyone coins based on the level... lets say level 100 would get 100+20\*5 (packs) coins, like 200 total. And for the coins you would buy other cards and/or upgrade them.
---
I cant imagine how are they going to track if someone spent 10 or 100 points for points reassignment . :(
---
That worked thank you very much, is there something wrong with the legendary run ?
---
Yeah, before I played wastelanders, the radiation wasn't that bad at all. Then after the dlc, I walked in because I thought it'd be the same. *Insert melting gif*
---
I'm into modding but mostly sound/texture replacers. Still have to learn a lot about all that scriptable stuff.
---
What I always wanted for this game is a HUD module with current buffs like chems/food and other temporary stuff (with number of minutes remaining) as well as a numerical xp counter with numbers for current xp/total xp needed for the next level. Is there a possibility to implement that kind of stuff at the current point with no full mod support?
---
And if there is, can you explain me how one would do that?
---
Is your fire rate over 200?
---
I mean AC Odyssey is on that list so if anything it just shows people buy big franchise names not particularly people buy quality.
---
Would you have not adjusted your build if you knew about legendary perks?
---
This is not proof This is a rework of the original that Bethesda added when everyone started complaining.The original statement back in Oct. of last year was worded different.
---
My 70 ranks says your life expectancy is much to low. Anyone who does it wisely is almost always going to end up in the final 10.
---
Not that I‚Äôm aware of, that skin is just bugged
---
That's correct.
---
Some decent shots there, particularly 4 &amp; 5 are my favourites.
---
Wish there were fewer composition limitations &amp; more post controls within photo mode itself.

Keep it up. Would love to see a series of these photos.

Go to the vault 79 icon on the map, then enter the small run-down shack. There's an elevator in there that takes you directly down into the SS part of the vault.

Amazing picture, the laser fire makes its better.

Can‚Äôt the same argument be made for anyone who wanted to start a new character with a new build?  If a new system is in place, then it ‚Äúpunishes‚Äù those who leveled up alts - when they could have just swapped specials whenever they want.  Not saying I agree with how the system is, and a respec option would be nice.  I know a perk loadout is coming. So who knows 
---
I haven‚Äôt even followed the PTS, but how many of these legendary perks will even be viable with current builds?  Seems like people will pick and choose a few regardless, and many won‚Äôt even be used.
---
Wasn't me, but I was witness.
---
Alright thanks!
---
yah but the game is extremely saturated so one more drop in the ocean dont really matter to me. Mount heads are still cool imo i have all of em and the bigger ones are still pretty rare at least on pc
---
I just started and I have have been in awe of some of the camps people have built. Something to aim for onmy own. I was think it would be cool to have something like a guest book for people to sign, even though there would be a few trolls I feel like it would be mostly positive.
---
1. U won‚Äôt get banned. 2. They‚Äôre probably a scrip weapons. Just because it‚Äôs got 3* doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre any good.
---
do ppl think bethesda will actually fix this in a timely manner? esp since it might make them more atom money since our atoms are being split.
---
Appreciate you linking that, I'll definitely stay tuned to it haha
---
I think you're giving the Brotherhood far too much credit here.
---
First, they need to know about the Bunker. We discovered it, sure, but that was via a round-about bread crumb quest which they'd have no reason to be seeking out.
---
They then need to get in at all, which is a challenge given its location and numerous defenses.
---
Once inside they need to, yuh know: live.
---
Last time the place was "accidentally" flooded with poison gas, this time it may not be as accidental. Plus, MODUS has access to an army on command and a blistering array of turrets.
---
MODUS seems to play nice with us because we play nice with it, and it suited it at the time to get the connection to the Kovac back up and running.
---
Hell, that reminds me: the Kovac.
---
We know MODUS is always watching, that's what it does, that's why it wanted to access the Kovac-Muldoon again in the first place.
---
So, if the Brotherhood are perceived as a threat, in the very least we'll be getting a buzz from our favorite AI to deal with a new kind of... "vermin."
---
Now, all that said, if it's true that it tried to contact Captain Fields for some purpose, then it may respond cordially if they may their military credentials known.
---
But better armed, better informed troops tried to kill MODUS once before, knowing full well they only had one crack at it and they were already inside. 
---
They failed spectacularly.
---
I don't imagine a second attempt will somehow go better.
---
&gt; The last thing this forum needs more of is a hundred posts whing how unfair the game is to them and they deserve double of everything.
---
There's already too much of this.
---
I‚Äôm not sure what you mean by Saturated
---
Drop a nuke and give me a few mininukes, I got a bloodied fatman, we'll debunk this together. Lol
---
This message brought to you by an instigating fat man. We're all in this together.
---
Hell I have a melee build and in events like uranium I've definitely punched other people in the madness of it, def wish there was a sorry emote. Does it notify the person you hit that you did such?
---
I like to go to player camps to see what creative ways they use the build engine. While I'm there I repair turrets and stuff like that. Occasionally, I will drop some items if I notice a piece missing from a display collection or plans for different types of walls and stuff like that.
---
No. That‚Äôs exactly how it was communicated last year. That is the link from October 23, 2019. Show me the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù version.
---
This is why it always said:
---
&gt;	Private worlds will continue to evolve with new features such as expanded building areas, increased C.A.M.P. budgets and Workshop persistence. We‚Äôve also received a lot of questions about playing Fallout 76 with mods and this, too, is something we‚Äôre excited to add to private worlds **in the future.**
---
Facts aren‚Äôt up for debate. If you have something else as a source I would love to see it.
---
People who leveled alts instead will most likely scrap all of the perk cards they got to get coins, since legendary cards are shared between characters in the same account.
---
No problem, glad to help.
---
Hmm it never showed up. I‚Äôm set appear offline btw, but I‚Äôm here.
---
What's with the perk name changes? I liked the old one better.
---
Also why does Bethesda keep changing things no one asked for (perk names) &amp; does nothing towards things we did ask for (fixing the perk coin system to not be overbearingly grind).
---
thanks
---
Anything that helps basic communication. I'd love a hang on for when I'm being old and trying to find my lunchbox in my inv on the fly

I made a desktop shortcut for the game on the xbox app and then ran that as admin and it worked for me.

You can add me so you won't need to look any further for the serums you need, I almost always have a full stock of every one of them at my shop at a relatively low price of 349c per piece -)) Ign's VvT.
---
You should be on whenever DuyDevilDog is on because he launches 3 nukes Everytime he's in a server. ü§£ü§£
---
Edit: I should have added I'm an Xbox player.
---
Always choose the price point for you.
---
You have your top of the line cards that cost way too much for something that will be over taken in months.
---
You have your first price (break?) point that is still very expensive but offers better bang for buck.
---
Your second that offers great performance for a better (but still expensive) price.
---
Then a few more (usually at least 2) where you go to performance on a budget then cheapest that can run most things right now on high settings usually.
---
(You‚Äôre probably aware of all the above, I‚Äôm just stating it in case someone comes along who isn‚Äôt aware).
---
The above is the same for most PC components, including CPI, graphics card, RAM, hard drive (SSD now), sound card (I think these are obsolete now and not needed), motherboard, hell, even custom cooling solutions.
---
I used to build my PCs and some for family and friends...now I‚Äôm married with kids and play on the PS4 and don‚Äôt even have a PC because I have nowhere to put it and use it...at least I got to upgrade the PS4 hard drive to an SSD.
---
Date is right. it's the only thing they did not change.
---
What system?
---
Or did I miss it?
---
Oh see I didn‚Äôt know that.  Guess I gotta read up on it
---
Which is odd cause the game looks amazing
---
Wow thank you! I'll do that my next login :D
---
LOL I just came here for the cursing and ranting.  GG
---
Just claim the workshop and get the hell out.  Usually ends this way if you hang around.  Eventually some dickwad will show up with his E-Peen fully erect.
---
Bro calm down... we can all see your feelings
---
Uh the challenge is to claim a workshop, not build and defend it.
---
Talk about fearless
---
I feel like it actually has really nice control. The mods for it are pretty cool as well. I have the Gunner Sights and Tesla Coil Dynamo and I just love it. Plus, it only takes lead and steel to make ammo, so my acid needs are way reduced.
---
God I hate the fucking Mirelurk Kings... Assaultrons are easier to deal with but an ass to deal with 
---
I'm a Bloodied rifleman/marksman, I think my build fully functional so
---
Are the weapons good? like REALLY good, im not just talking having one good prefix but 2 or more on every weapon.
---
If they are, either dump then in some remote corner of the map and let the m despawn, or sell them for Scrip, this might take longer but you get something out of them.
---
If they're not, keep them and do whatever you want with them.
---
I don't want to swear hear, but fuck that shitI joined all possible fo4 / fo76 discord/reddits whatever, literally there is nothing info.
---
I've already build a utility tool to be able to mod UI. But the documentation lacks a lot.
---
Currently I'm modifying Cloudy01's mod manager (not sure if that will be public, he hasn't responded to me yet - according to rules, if I want to modify it, I need to ask permissions).
---
For UI modding it's completely my tool, written from scratch, if my real world job won't bother me too much in a couple of days I'll finish it and post it on github and make a post here.
---
But if you want to mod UI (not textures), but actually add some text to weapon info (for example) - prepare learning action script, that fucking piece of dying shit.
---
I'm sorry for swearing, I spent couple of night figuring out how to properly compile everything without single piece of documentation, just reverse engineering.
---
My top priority - finish mod manager (few days)
---
Then - utility for swf modding, since it will be open sourced - for sure, I'll help anyone who will ask.
---
Sorry for swearing.
---
lol. Show me the ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù then. 
---
*hint* it‚Äôs exactly what I posted.
---
Bro why do you just complain ? All your previous post are you just arguing with your self gtfo
---
That Vampire's Gauss is the stuff that dreams are made of!
---
Its coming 2nd half of august if i remember correctly.
---
That's hardly an excuse... "Sorry officer, I didn't notice the sign saying it was 30. Apologies for doing 90, please let me off!"
---
We all agreed to them, it's our duty to be in the know on what you're agreeing to when creating an account and use the services. Don't like them, you don't agree and miss out on services provided.
---
You  can't agree to something, then cry "I didn't read it!!". It's like the South Park episode all over again üòÇ
---
Thank you man I had 500 missing atoms lol
---
I feel you. I‚Äôve had this happen.
---
There are groups of players who claim they are just into PvP. But it‚Äôs an excuse to grief players. They gank people at workshops because it‚Äôs auto PvP. 
---
They are also supper pissed about the recent change to PvP, were it‚Äôs just one on one instead of the group. That was another truck they would use. A low level attacking with a simple weapon to truck a player into fighting back. 
---
If they do, the rest of the group jump them.
---
It‚Äôs not worth it. It‚Äôs always frustrating. But not worth it.
---
I guess it is true what they say, you can‚Äôt teach creativity.
---
I am sure someone has a screen shot of the original.
---
Yes, but the queen herself emits a fair amount of radiation, so if you find yourself in close proximity without protection you‚Äôll get messed up fast...especially if you‚Äôre a bloody build.
---
Rad shield is a life saver there, especially considering my current character is a shotgun build, so I may as well be literally standing on top of her head and firing downwards through her skull.
---
Absolutely, I'm not knocking your point. It is valid. This game needs balancing.
---
Yeah I'm lvl 194 and I camped some lvl 13 and 30 and 40 with a bloodied stealth build. Signed off for the night and flogged it so good
---
Sometimes I can't believe how easy it is to make the final 10
---
I mean, for fo4 there is tons of modding info, but since fo76 has no creation kit you have to make everything manually (or at least nobody shares this info).  
---
Regarding SWF (almost dead technology) I haven't info at all. Just decompilers that won't compile mod back (I mean that it will be working)
---
Yes but do you know how many other workshops there are? Go take one that hasn‚Äôt been claimed yet. And they shot at me first.
---
i'm rather enjoying the population boost to NW with the score points. a long time ago i'd have to wait 15-20 minutes to find a single match that would, without fail, fall below 20 people playing and boot people back to the main menu to the point i gave up on NW outside double XP events. now i can reliably find a game within 5 minutes and have a healthy number of player.
---
sure there are some tough opponents and when you encounter a hacker its a pain in the butt, but by no means is the PVP game mode extraordinarily unfair. boss mobs (scorchbeast, grafton monster and megasloth) also drop legendary weapons and serums so its not all tied behind terminals. and its not as if you need legendary gear to win. heck half the legendary weapons are garbage.
---
Oh sorry, I didn't put it in my post cause I thought it was such a long shot anyway but I play on pc
---
I sent you a link to the original. 
---
So am I to assume you don‚Äôt have a source for your statement?
---
Cool. I am about to be a level 100 I think. I started playing when it first came out to but it didn't want to fall around messages from dead people and robots. But now I'm really into it.
---
And a mailbox/ postbox system would be nice. So too would be perk loadouts...
---
I‚Äôll do your work for you.

---
I have several high level toons with rank 1, 2 and 3 of most useful cards.  I don't want to have to scrap them to get perk points.  I want to keep the set that I have.  Will I be at a disadvantage doing that?, I do have 125 level ups and 40 something perk packs saved on my main.  No idea how everything works exactly because I haven't played the PTS, but my understanding now is that I will be forced to scrap some of my cards in order to get the maximum perk points per new card.  This seems silly.  For someone in the know, how many cards might I be able to rank up with what I have?
---
To be honest, that's why XP split needs to happen sooner rather then later. Just get over the shit, Bethesda. Let everyone in an area get XP for a mob kill.
---
They're griefers bro. As long as they saw you there, they were going to go stomp on you. When you're at a workshop, go crouched and gtfo asap.
---
I get what you're saying and fully sympathise, the challenges should be able to be completed in either campaign mode or NW but there's no need to go off on the high level players with these kind of old school "gamer insults" - everyone is just trying to move ahead with the season
---
yeah but I'm just working off the assumption and pretty sure the confirmation the brotherhood is here specifically for access to the nukes, and they know that they would need top level government clearance and would try to find a way in the bunker etc. etc. but I think the brotherhood would be determined enough to try and play nice with MODUS or bypass him and the enclave entirely, and find a way to access nukes without him
---
How magnificent
---
I go events as a level 198 and fail to hit anything as Johnny 1 shot explodes everything in sight....

This is why I only display weapons with the weight reduction legendary effect. Even without mods, weapons can be heavy. I also like to show off with the cooler looking mods.
---
Dangit...
---
I got 2 of em on my alt I woulda gave ya at half price‚Äôish,just too put some caps In his pocket.
---
Sorry,I hope someone hooks ya up.
---
Yeah the bonuses from Uny. is honestly unfair. With the right perks you don‚Äôt die nearly as much as you think.
---
I like my rural settlement feel with the log cabins...even if I am close to the whitesprings golf club.
---
One cabin for my ‚Äúhome‚Äù, one for crafting, and one for my vendors.
---
Stick a communal fire pit in the middle of them.
---
Then throw in some crops out the back (which is conveniently protected by the whitesprings fence), a grain silo, a watermill generator, a few water purifiers and some fences, and then some basic turrets on top of the free states truck backs and I‚Äôm happy.
---
I used to use so much budget on foundations for a house and then making that look good...and the log cabins do that for me by themselves.
---
Only problem is some people seem to never leave and just raid my purifiers and crops for adhesive for an hour or two lol.  Doesn‚Äôt bother me at all but I do find it funny.
---
What part of only have like two hours a week do u not understand, also that is bad game design if I have to Google shit just to enjoy the game proper. Just simply bad game design, any game that makes its users have to leave it just to understand game mechanics is fucked. Even when I had more time during beta it's just fucked. And yeah thanks man for being a grade A jackass to someone that just wants to enjoy the same game, quality fucking dude right there lol, try not being a dick all the time, wouldn't kill you. Also I have gotten mutations and understand how they work enough. I just don't get why they thought it's a good think for every player to be the equivalent of a super hero, the draw backs should be more... The game can't pick a lane, is it a survival game, a super hero simulator with guns, or is it fucking fallout game...? What the fuck happened to the tone of this series? It used to make us question stuff, made us think...  Even if it was just a set up to a dark joke, not even the dark comedy is around. Now, now it's just how many fucking special points u can stack, or how much shit I can pack rat in my camp. And yeah I get it this isn't those games, but at the end of the day this game should not be called fallout. It's a fallout game without a fucking wasteland! I get it they used smaller nukes and shit yeah yeah yeah, but seriously... A fucking lush forest for almost all the map? Ok u go ahead and play ur fake fallout game.
---
It‚Äôs probably one of my favorite features in the game :)
---
who knows. was probably thought of by the same person who thought that to max out 6 legendary perk cards would take at least 1335 levels. which at my current pace would take me 8 years and I am only at 270 after a year and a half
---
Upvoted for gratuitous flogging.
---
Its simple, if you can solo it - go right ahead.
---
Otherwise - wait.
---
Especially if it‚Äôs encryptid and it‚Äôs not your key card.
---
Yeah, this has been happening to me too on the gamepass version. I started playing around the 12th of July. I earned Atoms for a couple days and then about 2-3 days later I noticed that when I went into the atom shop it was showing me different amounts. It always drops back to 420.
---
I have a couple videos of me gaining atoms and then it dropping when I go back into the atom shop.

It bums me out because I wanted that wall paper set that is leaving but I doubt this will be fixed before it is gone.
---
Well, shit. That is perfect!
---
When you claim a workshop, you paint a massive target on yourself that says ‚ÄúFREE MONEY‚Äù
---
In earlier states of the game, where caps and junk mattered much more, it was a completely viable option to use workshop PvP as a form of gaining capital. Survival mode, in its best days, also filled this role, as well as dropping aid items.
---
In the current state of the game, PvP in the base game has little representation, so people nowadays just hawk the various Workshops so they can kill someone, and hope they put up a fight. 
---
It has probably been said more times than anyone can count on here: If you claim a workshop, expect PvP.
---
Well i seen a communist bundle was leaked and one or two pics and that was it.
---
It's 25, 50, 100 and 200  perk coins to max one legendary perk. Each perk card gives you 1 perk coin. Since you have 165 perk cards to be used in total for perk coins, you can get a legendary perk card in rank 3.
---
I‚Äôve had varying experiences honestly,but more often then not lately people have been decent,
---
In my experience.
---
Seems like a lot of toxic players made there way too other games,or started givin the little guys a chance.
---
Yeah team split would be a good thing to those who joined an evet together. Makes everyone happy even it‚Äôs just 1/2 xp
---
You swooped in and got the shot! Great pic!
---
Don't worry we all make mistakes believe me I'm a fool so I make plenty
---
Do you play on Steam?
---
Romour has it, the atoms are going to the Bethesda store version and if you log in there you'd see them, but not the steam ones.
---
Damn.. if I would‚Äôve know you could‚Äôve did that would have played during double Xp hahaha
---
Update 20 should have been text chat and perk loadouts. But instead we got a season cosmetic farm ans public teams. Imagine joining teams with random people but be unable to speak.
---
Wow so because I‚Äôm pissed off I get downvoted and my post removed. Great job everybody
---
Yeah I know I just want to keep her on the ground. I will keep the hunter then since I can use it on honeybeat
---
How about you go here: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
Look at the perks and make a build that seems interesting to you and we can go from there.
---
There's currently not enough SPECIAL points in the game to make a "recommended build" that can dip into perk cards for two different Weapon types right now BUT ASSUMING that nothing changes effect wise between now and September you might be able to pull this off in September once they implement the Legendary Perks with Patch 22. 
---
Simply don't horde so much but otherwise get a High Capacity Backpack to help (it increases carry weight by 120 lbs)
---
Every time I claim a few workshops on my private server, the server crashes before I get to reap the rewards.  I don't think I've ever had multiple workshops claimed for more than a few hours.
---
Oh ok
---
Hit abandoned bog town &amp; kill the behemoth as well then server hop after claiming workshop. Major exp.
---
Oh my goodness that might have been me haha. Was the guy wearing a responders jumpsuit?
---
Me too! Camp building is my endgame. I run a bed-breakfast-bar in the Forest, complete with cheap breakfast food (Awesome Opossum Bacon, omelette, Fasnacht donuts) and cheep drinks in my vendor. Future ideas are a frat house as close as I can build to the other houses on Fraternity Row and a motel near the Overseer‚Äôs camp. Visitor experience is my main focus when I build my CAMPs ... I want the other players to come in and be happy to visit.
---
 LOL! "Map was crawled by the¬†Wayback¬†Machine, *not* how many times the site was actually updated. "
---
Let‚Äôs hope johnny get his lvl 100  soon and will calm down.
---
2x XP ended early this morning but I don‚Äôt think anybody is farming xp at mama dulces feed the peeps. I smash everything at events because I KNOW if I didn‚Äôt then people would let events fail or get less rewards. I was server hopping white springs taking out the sentry bot all weekend and gained 50 levels
---
i can already tell my world is bugging a little
---
I lowkey love getting compliments on my base from randoms.
---
Profit card?
---
I would rather have a perk that lets me detect the nearest workbench.
---
Gauss minigun and mod plans are only purchasable with gold and can‚Äôt be traded afaik
---
Were you here for triple XP? It turns you into an addict.
---
you can only buy the guass minigun stuff with bullion
---
Meanwhile i need 5 Fatman mini nuke shots to kill a mirelurk queen................
---
(and thats with maxed Demo expert)
---
No. Only iron fist. But unarmed weapons are way better than 1-2handed ones, even with just iron fist.
---
Wholesome moment on reddit
---
I have 47 perk packs, thats 4 cards each right? So 125 plus 188 from packs for a total of 313 right?  I'd be happy if that is right because I should be able to rank up two of them to around level 2-3.  2 Special perks ranked to 3 would be nice.
---
I couldn't sell mine for 4caps. PC, camp near wayward. I just stopped offering them in my shop. Better off selling them for 5 caps to the bots / vendors.
---
The perk card was broken in the last patch.
---
It just doesn‚Äôt work currently (no increase in damage per kill)
---
I think some other perks were also broken or half broken (I know action boy doesn‚Äôt work sometimes for some reason, and it is really noticeable even with some increased AP refresh armour on...then other times it works fine).
---
Probably trying to find names with a more ‚Äúfallout(y)‚Äù feel that fits the humour.
---
UGL- https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:_Ultracite_Gatling_laser
---
Or player vendors
---
Gauss minigun- you gotta complete the wastelanders quest line, get allied rep with settlers irc than buy the plan with bullion, you cannot buy the wastelanders plans from another player
---
And idk about the prime plan, not sure if it drops off the queen after you learn the base plan or if it is known after learning the base weapon plan bought with bullion.
---
Similar. Main cookout event is every hour. The prime meat events activates every 15 mins. Those prime meat events were great for xp farming.
---
What it seems like is we're not even seeing legendary perks until at least update 22 and the fucking coins aren't what they want or need people testing for bugs.
---
For sure. The bad thing about this is when people use levels to reassign points. At least for me, I'm losing around 35 perk coins
---
Is there some playstyle that doesn't involve hiding that you guys know about that I don't? Haha
---
Or writing trash out of bounds usually does that when it overwrites over this area of memory
---
Which, technically, they can with a bit easier of a time than messing with our mechanical "big brother."  
---
All they've really gotta do is look up.  
---
Most of my nuclear keycards are a consequence of  wandering the countryside only to spot the little convoy flying by.  
---
It'd be fair to assume the Brotherhood has at least some understanding of the function of the vertibots and may shoot that down for supplies, if nothing else.  
---
Finding the keycard is going to set them running, especially if any of the troops are actually flagged as an active general in the silo databases.  
---
We found the entrances easy enough, I would imagine they can do the same.  
---
Sure, they need to find and crack the code, but again: we've done that largely by accident.  
---
The question then becomes: what are they going to do with the Silos once they have them?  
---
Like it or not, it's the only really effective solution we have for the Scorched so far, and if they don't wanna use it thus, then there's gonna be problems in short order.  
---
Heck: are we going to have to vaccinate them? 'cause if they won't let us, they've got a much bigger hurdle to clear well before they go anywhere near the silos.
---
Yeah I feel ya there.
---
Stack damage with food and talons serum
---
It's not necessarily that they're farming the mobs specifically, but nobody has incentive to not just blow things up any more. You kill a mob, you get fifty. You want to shoot everything. And it's not unfair nor unwarranted to suggest that such a thing has encouraged everyone to go out of their way to blow shit up more then ever.
---
I resent but if that doesn‚Äôt come through my PSN: Xatuken
---
Marsupial and Adrenal Reaction all the way
---
It works most times for me with my shotgun(s).
---
I had a period during a SBQ fight last night where it was terrible though.  Had to exit and leave VATS over and over...BUT enemies being TOO close also causes it to not work.
---
Ultracite Gatling Laser plans I believe were included as rare drops in the Christmas presents that were widely duped. Check any player vendors that have 200+ plans for sale and you should be able to track one down after a while. It is possible that more recent duping of weapons led people to toss out their excess plans to make space though.
---
Better than a run thru lucky hole mine?
---
I was going to say get one of the backpack mods from Raiders/Settlers until you said power armor. PA just gets a big fat middle finger with carry weight. Calibrated shocks will never, ever be comparable to the weight reduction and carry bonus perks you can reach without it.
---
If you're a bloody build use Radicool, that's one I discovered the use of recently.
---
Ouch, that's horrible.
---
You need to do the PA glitch
---
Could always have Beckett put on a creepy nurse fashion show perhaps?
---
Not tryin to shit on all the low levels out there. Just don't know if they are actually noobs who just don't know or if they r trolls
---
Ouch
---
Part of the game design is making choices
---
The real question is why did you bother posting in this thread if you weren't even going to read the op that literally tells you the answer to your question?
---
When you toggle option for friend only\tram only world, what is displayed is the current setting
---
So; if you want them to be able to join/invite it should read "x/‚óª/whatever pc button"+ all friends.
---
Ie it should say all friends :)
---
I like it. But i wish people relised the building teams are for farming xp and would actually group up with me. Seems like i dontsee anyone unless theyve fast traveled to my camp for free or if a high level public event pops up.
---
I‚Äôve always hated the foliage of Bethesda games.
---
I'm waiting for the third person aiming glitch to be done
---
Game is easy enough as it is
---
Probably use exiting PA to glitch thru walls.
---
There is. Simply give up the idea if carrying around a lot of Meds and Foods......or you could wait until September when Legendary Perks drop and you can have it both ways.
---
But that‚Äôs the thing... it‚Äôs not a locked in choice when it can be swapped out. It‚Äôs just an inconvenience. Perks used to be a choice when you get locked out of changing it. Now it‚Äôs just an annoyance
---
Yep. Claiming workshops and doing subsequent defend events is an easy way to get XP.
---
Guess I can stick out the slower reload till they release
---
Just got the Scrapbox today and as a hoarder I am so happy to be able to just grab and stash everything!!
---
Lol. Maybe if you weren‚Äôt addicted to chems and booze.
---
To me, it would be much less confusing to just allow us to redeem level ups and perk packs directly into perk points without all this perk ranking/voodoo shuffle.
---
I can relate to losing points to respec.  I wish ranking up the legendary cards granted that many points to respec.
---
I'm new to FO76, haven't set up a camp yet.  I have what might be a dumb question for this game, but not from my experience in other MMOs.  Aren't you overrun by players trying to steal anything not nailed down, destroy anything they can't steal, and otherwise grief up your homestead?
---
This game makes you fear running out of supplies so naturally we hoard food, water, and chems. I found the best thing to do is use Carnivore Mutation and eat raw meat of animals as you travel, and carry 10 water with you. Stop by your camp every 20 minutes to reload on water and drop off loot.
---
I dilute my Stimpaks and sell them in my vendor, but also use the Raider chem Backpack so I can't really tell you what to do about that. PA needs Backpack mods.
---
I have this right now, I thought it was a good idea to use one of the holotapes to get a supply drop, I got a legendary the last time so I thought maybe you get one everytime but it doesn't even spawn. I have been waiting for 20 minutes now.
---
carry the bare minimum with a little bit extra.
---
dont be a twat
---
My present internet connection would laugh in my face if I actually tried to maintain the workshops for a few hours. I've had my shit crash too many times for it to be worth the frustration of building everything up just to lose it all.
---
usually involves putting your PA chasis behind the counter and enter spam until you warp into it ... then exit out. Same can be done in enclave bunker in military wing, the Gutsy's there even have special voice over for that occasion ...
---
I like selling dense chest pieces though
---
Oh for the... I never even thought about asking platform. 
---
I‚Äôm XB1.
---
It current says "change to team world", doesnt that mean it's currently a friend world?
---
Not really. It‚Äôs not. Your pushing buttons, and it‚Äôs only an annoyance because in an age we‚Äôre everything is digital people find waiting a second the worst
---
Only had it happen to me once but I lost 4k score. More than made it up now, but still.
---
This whole perk card system fucking sucks and needs rebuilt from the ground up.
---
Been wondering where the people were to ask if anyone else had also had their problem.
---
The Ultracite Gatling Laser plan you might be able to buy from the BOS vendor in watoga. Or I think you have a chance of getting it as a reward, I don‚Äôt remember too well sorry. If you‚Äôre on PS4 I could craft one for you since I learned the plan a while ago. 
---
But the gauss mini gun/shotgun/pistol along with all of the mods, need to be purchased with gold. 
---
Not caps, not script, you need to purchase the gun plans with gold. Along with each mod for each specific weapon. It‚Äôs all about the gold. 
---
Which means not only do you need to beat the quest line for wastelanders, in order for you to even unlock the gold currency, but you need to reach max reputation with both factions, Foundation and Crater, in order to purchase those weapons. 
---
Caps are meaningless in this situation. 
---
You can‚Äôt craft, trade or sell any of those weapons or armor that you bought with gold. And you can‚Äôt build any items you bought with gold at another person‚Äôs camp either. 
---
So finish the quest line. Rank up your reputation with both Factions. Save up gold. And purchase everything little by little.
---
Throw in the circus trailer i missed and youve got yourself a deal.
---
And I got the atom challenge bug too where it's putting all new atoms on my bethesda client instead of steam, so I again have two totals for my atoms. I mean I can go on the bethesda client and spend them but I'd prefer having them all in one spot.
---
Wait are you a Heavy Weapons player? Just get Speed Demon mutation it increases Reload Speed enough without the need of Lock and Load.
---
It just dawned on me that that could have been the case. Oh well, thank you for the offer. You‚Äôre the kind of player that makes the community great!
---
If they are in a team the option wont show to invite... Maybe that? I'm just referring to the private world settings
---
I'm one of those "terrible" griefers you hear about, but tbh, my bf and I spent a couple of hours last night outfitting a new player and helping him learn how 76 works. We took him on XP runs through various areas. He couldn't have been more than 14 or 15 and was so excited that we brought him into our team and were answering all of his questions.
---
I'm not always the big bad griefer lady. ;)
---
I'm a distant relative a Box Wookie lol
---
But what‚Äôs the problem with just letting us have more perk cards instead of having to go into the menu and exchange perk cards? Instead of creating extra steps, just give us the perks or take away the ability to exchange them
---
Agreed
---
Oh really? I'll check it out. Thanks!!!
---
That setting has been in since before Wastelanders. I‚Äôm not sure where Juicehead, or anyone else got that information.
---
And it is definitely not the same as being able to change the voice output device, far from it.
---
I'm more annoyed with the latter.
---
Yesterday my team went awol, one guy spawned away from the group and died quickly, one disconnected and one AFK.... so, alone then. Made it to the last 6, could have lasted longer in the tiny circle but the temptation to take an easy shot to down one of the others was too strong. Would have got more xp for hiding but I‚Äôll take the kill
---
The Raider collection is my favorite so far cause it collects so much ammo.
---
Good pic
---
Aurum is the name of the shop.
---
That is true, but there are like 8 Asylum worker uniforms and only one of Beckett lol.
---
I don‚Äôt believe so. Every time I complete a challenge that rewards atoms I can see the secondary pile of atoms adding up like other people have said. I see it on the map but then when I go to the store it reverts back to the original number. Then again I haven‚Äôt checked the Xbox version so maybe it‚Äôs all going there. But like I said it all happened after they hotfixed the Score. I was accumulating the atoms normally until then and had about 270 before it stoped counting.
---
Blocker, incisor, and martial artist...And barbarian is super helpful to. Not unarmed specific perks, Super helpful in an unarmed build
---
Completely agreed. They need to bring back the skill point system and get rid of the perks that they added to replace that and rework the remaining perks so they're unique and fitting.
---
Yeah so am I. They aren't in any team right now either. I'm not sure what's really going on. The option just isnt there for an invite
---
I'd recommend just carrying enough food and water for one play session.  It's so easy to get that stuff from just doing events.
---
That's a sad truth
---
Yes Speaking as Full Health non PA Heavy Weapons player I have both Thru Hiker and Traveling Pharmacy with Speed Demon and I can tell you that it works for me.
---
And just adjusting volume settings is not an acceptable ‚Äúfix‚Äù to hear players, instead of giving us actual options to change our voice chat output device.
---
That‚Äôs it‚Äôs own situation, but yes heavy explosive guns needs major help
---
I've done that.  
---
Basically logged the ticket immediately. Took a couple days to hear back but they gave me a refund.  
---
Given everything going on right now your's might take longer, but it's still worth giving it a shot.
---
Alternatively the Medic Pump is cheaper alternative that also allows not to care about health, you have tons of stimpaks anyway
---
Either rhey are on a team or your world setting needs changing. Hope I helped
---
Same. I'm much more forgiving with new players who just simply don't know any better
---
What is there to fear no matter what your level is?  There is absolutely 0 consequences to dying in this game except for potentially losing a little junk.  But being in an event like rad rumble that wouldn‚Äôt even happen anyways.
---
Are you playing on 76 with multiple xbox profiles?  Because I also get this bug but only after I sign out of my main account and load up my mule account then load back into my main.  So for me, whenever I switch profiles this happens.  Yes it is annoying.
---
I was levelled to 200 after playing since beta 1-2 months ago, now I'm closer to 350 after the exp buffs and 2x exp weekend. I think easier levels are a more fun approach than shaving off the required levels for all (!) Legendary Perks at max (!) level
---
This! I was scared to get speedy demon cause of the eating &amp; drinking effects, but with the perk that lessens the negative effects of mutations, I never even noticed to additional food/drink cost and the reload/movement speed is WONDERFUL. It's a serious game changer. (I also did carnivour so all the meat I eat does quite a bit more food%, really offsetting any negative effect of speed demon.) 
---
Get speed demon, you'll love it, I highly recommend.
---
Seriously, The Freakshow has WAYYY too much missing potential.
---
I hope they make something there soon. It‚Äôs a great place to pick up caps when your low (as long as someone else hasn‚Äôt gone through)
---
Why are you planning to leave us, the bloodied elite players?
---
Raleigh Clay is alive!!!!
---
No, just one profile.
---
Fuck, is that today‚Äôs challenge? Haven‚Äôt checked yet.
---
Here‚Äôs my strategy though, from someone who is also awful at PVP: I have the aquagirl perk. I spawn at the Pioneer Scouts Camp, there‚Äôs really good loot all around. Check the map while the match loads to see if there are enemies nearby. If so, jump in to the water ASAP. There‚Äôs some loot you can swim to on the docks and on the islands.
---
To try to get a kill, watch the other players and stalk them. I had a fun kill a few days ago from this. Watched a guy run across to a little boat on the edge of the lake and when he went to pick the safe in the boat I came out of nowhere and off‚Äôed him.
---
Lotta weapons are fun to use, but they're not really worth much more than scrip value unless someone is specifically looking to roleplay etc. 
---
Pistols are very meh in the game, bloodied are better than most though. I had a day using one very similar to that, just wandering the map popping stuff, and I enjoyed the hell out of it, but it's very unlikely someone will play much for one for more than just scrip fodder.
---
Having said that, they don't weight much, so you're not losing much by listing one for 5-600 but I wouldn't expect it to sell fast.
---
Seriously doesn't need more. I can do like 4k damage with just food
---
I run bloody all the time and it's "weaknesses" are minor compared to it's power.  It's seriously OP.  And I'm often less crunchy than other's around me.  PvE just doesn't do the right kind of damage to fight bloodied.
---
Wait really ? Ghoulified ?
---
hmm no idea then.  that definitely is annoying.
---
I‚Äôd rather always play with people like this than the people who just stand around no matter what level. People who stand around deserve to be kicked from the team right before the event ends.
---
Yeah you need any explosive weapon to make use of this event in that setup, though said ghouls drop a lot of 40mm and weapons to use for it.
---
I‚Äôd love to know what your perks are, mine is pretty much full of damage perks and no room for survival perks, i can only swap them back and forth but don‚Äôt have room for both. For example my heavy gunner have 9 HG, one Traveling Pharma, two Bandolier and three Bear Arms. I can replace three HG with Blocker but I don‚Äôt do it. For Luck perks I have Class Freak and Starched Genes so there‚Äôs only room left for either Bloody Mess or Serendipity. In PA I don‚Äôt easily die, but with normal armor I can get killed easily by poison, tougher melee enemies and my own explosive rounds.
---
Yeah! Tag three skills, have a level cap, have finite points.  Much too late for that though.
---
It could be.  Perhaps if they just capped the amplitude from unyielding, and frankly any other compounding stat bump type thing.
---
Hi OP :)
---
I recommend taking a look at the character planner over at  [nukes and dragons](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks) to help you figure out a bit more about your build! You can put one point into your specials for each level up to level 50 so it's worth thinking about what you want to max.
---
For rifles, perception is probably your priority and then maybe strength for your base carry weight and either shotgun or melee weapon perks.
---
My build, for example, is a stealth archer with melee backup but I knew I wanted to be able to max out lone wanderer and gunsmith/makeshift warrior so my points accounted for that. I also found that I needed some specific endurance perks around food and drink to make the game fun for me.
---
My current points are:
---
Strength 10
---
Perception 14
---
Endurance 10
---
Charisma 4
---
Intelligence 5
---
Agility 10
---
Luck 3
---
You can increase how much you carry with perks to reduce the weight of items. I have these for junk, chems and food/drink. They're hopefully planning to add perk loadouts to a later update but it's still totally valid to swap perks in and out (just hard to remember to switch back afterwards!) so, for example, I switch to these perks when I'm overburdened to give me more carrying capacity and make everything lighter, then I fast travel to a stash box.
---
Ammo can be hard to come by but there's a perk you can equip to make it more likely you'll find some. Many player vendors offer ammo for 1 or 2 caps and if you get the legendary race ammo converter (level 5) and can bear to spend 20 minutes in the menus, you can swap out all the ammo you won't use for some you will. The return rate isn't amazing but it's better than nothing.
---
I probably didn't answer everything but this got super long and I'm on my phone so I hope it's at least somewhat helpful :)
---
Good luck out there in the wasteland, 76.
---
Things I learned the hard way:
---
You can put points into one special and then get a perk card from a different one (and you can also accidentally put a bunch of points into strength without realising if you cycle through the available cards)
---
Yeah and good on you for playing something different. If it wasn‚Äôt for the UNY bonuses I‚Äôd be playing full health most likely.
---
Lmao I'm just kind of memeing but  we don't know for sure but I believe it because there is no evidence of his death in the game.  I believe one day he will return to lead a free-staters faction!  Would be so cool to see him return.
---
Free States 4 Lyfe!!!
---
people have had worse runs of luck crafting it. 
---
Me though. I got 3 3\* pieces out of 20 and i'm not even bloodied or anything. And now i have 4 after about 40 rolls.
---
Fed76.info  about 5k but not sure who uses revolvers?
---
Yeah sure thing let me link my 2 bloodied builds.
---
https://imgur.com/a/9hGZwkB 
---
One is bloodied commando and the other is Bloodied, melee/ shotguns/ heavy weapons. For me I am able to easily solo everything in the game from the SBQ to the Colossus to Encrypted. Feel free to leave comments and advice, but the builds are both pretty well refined especially my heavy gunner one.
---
Is this only affecting PC users or console users as well. I'd like to complete some atom challenges (hack terminals, pick locks, etc) to have more of a cushion to rank up the Legendary Run if I need to (or spend in the shop obviously) but I don't want this to happen.
---
I've held 5 for my max. Even at that point, the CONSTANT notifications about defense/retake quests was unbearable. I can't imagine holding them all.
---
They're probably just trash legendaries that they want you to turn in for scrip.
---
I'm actually using it right now, it's fun headshotting the enemies! (Not just to figure out a pistol build)
---
The people I hate are the ones who are in PA not collecting ore.
---
Did it three times this week and I was the only one running in and out.
---
Like, we have to hit the first approval to end win the event.
---
That's, frankly, a false premise.  1 hit away from death is not really true in practice, if you perk into it right.  I am hammered all the time and survive it, thanks to serendipity, nerd rage, barbarian, etc.  It just isn't a real negative if you build your bloodied build right, it's just a poor excuse to justify why it's supposedly balanced :)
---
I've tried changing it, and they arent in a team and it's still not working :( thanks anyway
---
Yesterday I revived a player twice in a single match. Ughh where‚Äôs that energy when it‚Äôs a daily challenge?
---
I would say it‚Äôs bad luck.  I have gotten 3x unyielding secret service 3 star legs, and countless 1 and 2 star but out of the hundreds of pieces I have made have only gotten 1 3 star vanguard and 2 1 star vanguard.   I do think the more sought after rolls have a lower chance (no statistics just observation), so just keep at it.
---
It certainly made a world of difference in my enjoyment of the game. I bought a month of 1st to test it out and after three days with the survival tent and scrap box I bought a year. With the private world to hoard in and $16.50 a month in atoms for $8 a month it's a bargain. 
---
Only game dlc I'm more satisfied with was the Iceborne expansion for MHW.
---
Damn that was a good one tho ü§£ I‚Äôll have to hop on the wiki when I‚Äôm out of work !
---
Could do with a actual player working for them
---
I think I'm gonna keep it, it's actually super fun! Obviously it's not a viable weapon for higher end activities. Dunno why my post was removed since it isn't against any rules (I'm not actually trading anything)
---
No cap I had 8k at some point I had to put some perks to reduce the weight
---
Luckily for me I already have a full Unyielding SS set, which i must have really lucked out on as i got it all fairly quickly. I'm only rolling more now as I have nothing else to spend my Scrip/Modules on and I want to try my luck on Uny/Weapon weight rolls.
---
The guy saluting is my character üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Yeah you have to try a few every day at different times. I haven‚Äôt rolled over 70 times and I have 3/5 uny 4/5 bolstering and 4/5 vanguards.
---
Yea really disappointed after I found out I can not display my 4 different hazmat suits... Also a small collection of grenades is not possible.
---
Took me 128 crafts to get full set of unyielding armors. Random ones. Now have rolled for couple of weeks (4x a day) trying to get good rolls on top of that. Best pieces i have gotten are 2x uny/sent and 1x uny/cav.
---
it collects chems too? like psycho how fast can he collect those?
---
Wow salty but ok
---
yeah i think that there should be a way to make any effect be viable in the game, Whether it is top tier or not it should still be viable when just going around and playing. It would be cool if bethesda implemented a optional objective that would allow players to change the weather and as a result make it dark  on command for an extended period of time. It could be something similar to nukes where it lasts for awhile, but has a decent cooldown so to balance the effect.
---
Sneak attack is around 1500 with right build. No, then people start asking to increase damage of assault rifle or submachine... There's already enough damage for regular gameplay, as I said it before. Game very easy.
---
Ah yep, that makes sense
---
100% agree. Bring on the downvotes from everyone who wants everything for nothing and dupes for free.
---
I want my, I want my, I want my duped legacies.
---
Yeah you should.  Honestly the pre-wastelanders lore in this game is top fucking notch in my opinion.  The way it is told through notes and tapes and terminals and we are like an archaeologist combing through the ashes of their civilization to determine their downfall.. So many interesting characters like Raleigh that I would like to meet.   
---
Think about a guy like Hank Madigan.. what an exciting journey he went on trying to find a way to combat the scorched plague.  Honestly if this game was a bit different and we came out of the vault when the original factions were still alive his role would probably be the main character role.  Just cool to think about I really was hoping for responders and free states factions in Appalachia with wastelanders.. maybe some day.
---
I can‚Äôt make you understand the design of the game. I‚Äôm not going to even try. It‚Äôs one of those things people just refuse to understand.
---
I just switched to bloodied melee from junkies heavy just for the bonus int xp.  My God, why did I wait so long??  It's a completely different game.  The grind no longer feels like a grind, it's magical.
---
Well, there's the "get grouped with 3 other people and all four of you jump around with Frog Legs like nitwits while spray'n'praying everyone" -playstyle.
---
They usually win.
---
Thankfully no. There isn't much they can steal. If you have a collector, collectron or purifier you can lock them so only you have access.
---
You will occasionally find a griefers that wants to shoot up your house or try to nuke you but in my experience they are so rare.
---
Mostly you'll get people checking your vendor, maybe grab some water (I keep mine unlocked), and do some repairs.
---
I have far more good experiences than bad with players in my camp. It's another sign that this is a great community.
---
The regular one gets either junk, not broken down.  Or it gets scrap already broken down. If you currently have no collectron, I'd say to get the commie bot at half price.
---
[Wiki Lore](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Free_States)
---
Supposedly Raleigh Clay is not dead, although no one knows where his body or what happened to him..
---
I'm just saying, as someone who enjoys playing the game for about 2 hours a day since beta, and usually one of the highest levels in a lobby. the average person is never going to be able to max out 6 perk cards, even if they grind for over a year. plus if they add new legendary perks and don't give the option to de-rank the levels to put them into a new card. then that is a lot more unnecessary grind that would just make XP exploits a lot more appealing. plus the XP required after 1000 go up 10 fold. and the level 1335 assumes that you have scrapped every perk card that you have ever received and have not lost any perks due to getting a duplicate 1*. otherwise, you would need to be over 1500 in level assuming you have kept the perks that you got from level 1-100 and scrapped everything else. this also hurts all the people that have used the level to move a special instead of taking a perk card
---
I agree -- thus my preference to nerf bloodied :D  I think there are some suggestions that are good, honestly.
---
Frankly, what might work best is to just reduce the unyielding armor bonus.  Instead of +1/2/3, make it be +0.3/0.6/0.9, rounding up.  That way a single piece won't add a ton, but if you get a lot together it can still help some.  And if you have 3 pieces but are only at 50% health it'll still give you a little bump with the sum of them together.
---
The other reason to nerf vs amplify is that as you amplify things the #'s compound and get out of control really fast.  It's easier to keep things at lower numbers and balance that way, rather than dealing with the compounding fanout that will happen.
---
The game becomes easy quite quickly
---
You could do this in Fallout 4 and just become a walking god, able to use any weapon at any time
---
My build is specced majorly into semi-auto rifles, but i can use heavy weapons + PA by swapping cards around
---
Neither are godly, but i do enough damage to where im happy in both builds
---
If you could do everything in 76 with any weapon then they might aswell do away with perks completely
---
Agreed with an earlier reply, that the skill point system is a lot better, but this is the system weve got, and apart from perk loadouts, there wont be a change to the perk card system
---
Same, i love it. And I hate it when 50+ 100+ lvl players make a prison camp. Cant find their ventors, cant find a bed, or any crafting workbenches, or even a damn stash box!
---
Yep. So tired of idiots with explosive plasma
---
Or just let the unyeilding bonuses allow more slots
---
Only cause crybabies like you keep flooding my post with your stupid comments
---
Interesting gotta catch up on some reading then ! Thanks again üôèüèº and yea I was curious about that as well the leader of the movement vanishing without a trace üòØ
---
What was flying around? Dead bodies? So those guys did kill the hoards? Sounds confusing.
---
No surprise there since no one was doing it for ore this weekend. It was all about killing the spawns during double XP weekend.
---
This is spot on!
---
This game is far from balanced üëÄ
---
Same I e been in a bunch of servers where that has happened
---
I just finished the take 76 photos of creatures, wasn‚Äôt trying to but I did. I got the atoms, guess I‚Äôm got lucky
---
Awww that‚Äôs cute!
---
Yeah I need to look into how that all works from level 50. I had a build in mind when I started, so I'm tracking nicely in how I wanted to go, just never really took notice of what happens from 50 onwards
---
YES. I am having this exact issue. Bethesda support has done jack shit to help. It's so frustrating.
---
I‚Äôve visited your camp before! Really cool camp :)
---
Fair enough I just wish it had more of a presence in the game since stealth is usually the fixers domain and straight damage is the handmade everything else kind of doesn‚Äôt matter.
---
Is the executive suite locked off till further notice or is using the glitch the only way to access it?
---
I make modded low level weapons and armor and place them around Flatwoods in containers for new players to find.
---
I don‚Äôt know if they buffed the commie collectron but now it occasionally collects handmades and 5.56. In the past it was always just Chinese officer swords and grenades.
---
Are you gonna play your guitar sword on the MTV?
---
It's just  like real life now , they fly at 40'000 feet
---
Awesome stuff!!
---
OMG Thank you. I never thought to check in GHUB. I appreciate your help!!
---
People literally get any gun, mostly auto weapons and shoot you from unknown location, even when you are literally covered by all walls and ground and everything. its THAT bad. Its so crap i wish there was a place where i could disclose their usernames with video evidence,
---
Thanks!  Now I'm looking forward to building one, too.
---
It‚Äôs fine. Finally some Charisma perks a reason to exist for me.
---
Experienced two groups up to now:
---
The teamers - emoting a lot, doing events and adventure together
---
And the Loner Together - thx for boosting my xp but leave me alone.
---
There's some saying game pass users are not seeing the the atoms earned but are finding them when they log in through bethesda launcher (PC). I had gotten 120 that didn't appear. Found them after logging through bethesda launcher.
---
I'm usually too busy whacking off the Brahmin to plunge my hard steel into the Sheepsquatch's thicc ass.
---
Honestly I was the same. It made the game massively different using something like that, and I enjoyed it so much I ended up playing a lot more than I ordinarily would. I just wandered the roads trying to headshot things and eeing what I could find. 
---
I felt slightly fragile and my shots mattered. It was a great little jaunt. I did it until I used all the like 300 odd ammo I had was gone and I don't rregret it for a second. 
---
I've got a thrid toon set up now to save all the weapons I don't have room for right now, but I wanna mess with later. I have 14 different bloodied weapons there and that's still one of them. have fun with it!
---
You only need to scrap a few to learn the sight ring and speedy receiver, you could probably ask a higher level player to craft you a few and that'll be all you need because the mods all have high chances of being learned. There's little reason to buy the plan.
---
The bayonet and extra large magazine are of questionable value because bashing is less effective than firing(and such an efficient use of ammo it's moot) and the already huge magazine doesn't help much by being even larger. Mostly these 2 mods just make it heavier.
---
The Prime receiver is a random drop from scorchedbeasts and presents, it can't be learned from scrapping.
---
I agree with this. Sure some players earned them legit. But you know what. They were a mistake. It‚Äôs a game. They‚Äôll get over it. If they don‚Äôt, they‚Äôll leave.
---
NW challenges are Stupid as hell. NW itself is actually super clogged, buggy, slow, tidious, unbalanced mash up kinda mess.
---
Not being a jerk here: this is why it's important to state what platform you're on when you have an issue with the game. May have noticed the pattern earlier in this case.  
---
Glad it's being tracked down. Good luck to everyone who lost their atoms.
---
Thats the way you do it.
---
Got a great new public group idea!
---
Fashion 76. Being fully bonded allows you to bring your ally with you where ever you go!
---
Join up with your friends for photoshoots, fashions shows and fantastic tea parties.
---
Once all team members are fully bonded the leader can create voting polls on who has best outfit / hairdo / you name it!
---
But ya, mannequins are needed, even just for creep setups.
---
This mode..? I think you mean the whole game my dude, the game shouldnt even be called Fallout.
---
The mobs are running around erratically trying to path to the leechers, which makes them harder to shoot for other players actually playing the area. 
---
These players are not contributing, just trying to tag mobs for free xp/loot, and making it harder for real players in the process.
---
That‚Äôs a good one! I might try that out sometime!
---
Id love to have an ultracite gat. How much?
---
What an incredible pic!   Those guys are nasty and difficult to take out! (For me at least)
---
To craft you one? Nothing. I might just need a few supplies to craft it. But other than that no charge.
---
i see him almoust everyday lol
---
This absolutely screwed people since the beginning of the game.  That and duplicate cards.
---
Sweet ty. Let me know wat you nees. I will probably be on in about 3 hours
---
Are you playing through steam or the game pass by any chance? if so, your atoms may have been added to the bethesda client. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hui4kn/bug_atoms_received_by_challenges_arent/
---
Thanks, I'll give it a shot
---
Dude this looks like it's straight outta monster hunter. I love it.
---
Doesn't mean it needs to stay that way or be made even more imbalanced.  Especially if they're planning any sort of overhaul with One Wasteland then crap like this is going to stick out even more than it does now.
---
And fucking seriously people?  You're down voting the concept of a balanced game?
---
I‚Äôve been seeing them in players vending machines fairly often lately. Check camps. 5-8k seems to be the price range I see.
---
Beckley and Bog Town have been bugged for sooooo long for me, and many players i know have these locations or some other location UNDISCOVERABLE.  
---
i tried discovering it with 5 different side characters, with and without friends, by only walking from the vault 76 or having a friend nearby and fast traveling there and walking ther, Or directly having a friend there and fast traveling there. And I tried all over again many many times since workshop locations time to time have normal location icons. I hoped it would eventually get discovered. NONE worked. UGH! BUGthesda.....
---
I launch between 1-3 nukes per night.  Then run encrypted if it is available.
---
Great Scott! That's a great shot!
---
I bought mine at a player vendor for a lot of caps. I got tired of being the only conduit at the Event.
---
Well a lot of us have been asking for higher level weapons to fight this off for a while...
---
I read about that bug. They can't do anything right.
---
you can buy them from player vendors. that's how I got mine.
---
That is correct, it will only drop as a reward if you have learned the plan. I actually managed to get a nocturnal fixer from doing manhunt the other day. It's crap, but good to know it's in the regular event award pool now.
---
Yup only there or buying from a player, and yes, you can't get them as legendary drops until you learn it. 
---
Takes a while sometimes. It took me 15 attempts to drop my first one, then I got another literally the one after. And since then, I haven't seen the plan drop again for 30 attempts :D
---
I might be on for the rest of the night. Just add and message me whenever. 
---
Killer-Soldier1
---
 yeah this would piss me off so much if I was into NW.
---
I love when people launch nukes cuz I hate going through that whole process üòÇ
---
You can find the plans going for \~5000 caps in trading subs / discord
---
That's why I use Thorn Armor. Also the SS Armor is ugly AF
---
Ah yes, the choice of unequipping a combat perk and equipping a building perk while I‚Äôm building and then unequipping the building perk and reequipping the combat perk before adventuring. 
---
And also the choice of unequipping a combat perk and equipping an ammo crafting perk before crafting ammo, and then unequipping. It and reequipping combat perks when done. 
---
It has nothing to do with choice, it is just a clunky system that forces you to do mundane GUI tasks in a horrifically designed GUI.
---
The map denotes locations that have material deposited you can place a powered extractor over if your camp is there, like the extractors used at workshops
---
Ive had them drop twice this month... Not sure how many times ive done it but i do it every time i see its up.
---
As an update on this we have now implemented a fix for this issue. Challenges that have Atom rewards now once again grant those Atoms correctly.
---
Rad Rumble was all about XP this weekend. People want to tag as many as possible. I don‚Äôt see anything wrong with what they were doing unless they were one shotting all the ghouls. I can solo the ghouls without letting anyone die, it‚Äôs not that hard. 
---
The people who screw it up are the ones who stand at the top of the ramps shooting the ghouls as they spawn in instead of letting them come around the corner so everyone can tag them.
---
I was trade requested by a lvl 20, he asked for some super stims and Radway. I gave 50 Supers and 30 Radaway for zero caps. He seemed so grateful and was probably overencumbered for sure! But I got several thumbs up emoticons, so I assumed they were happy.
---
Moral of the story: throw a bone to the new guys so they keep playing!
---
Yes. Drop from encrypted event or sold by players. Yes.
---
It works in any animal except bugs or mirelurks. Yao Guai, wolves,  hounds, gulpers, etc
---
It does work on SBQ but not the ground mobs.
---
Normal damage against everything else though.
---
Its a pretty good roll tbh.
---
That‚Äôs the main way I farmed XP this weekend on my private server (I don‚Äôt do it in public ones because I don‚Äôt want PvP). I just took several different workshops and kept hopping between them to defend them
---
Do you have demolition expert equipped?
---
I give people things and stuff. Build them things in their camp. If someone on the trade forum wants to buy something small like 37 screws or 50 steel, something small, i agree a price and then i just give them the stuff free because they're usually lower level (could be an alt but whatevs) and i don't really need caps. 
---
And since the release on game pass i show them where to get the small backpack plan and then set them on their way to the big backpack by taking them to the scout camp for the quest and blowing myself up in the water. 
---
Love helping people tbh
---
Yeah. I'm the evil raider queen who takes the noobs under her wings on occasion. Much rather teach them how to play right lol
---
Wow you sure were excited making this post with one continuous sentence. Happy to see stuff like this though.
---
I haven't tried the chems option yet.
---
I'll try this. I have to install it again through bethesda's launcher. Will update later if it works.
---
adrenaline is broken
---
Which made little sense to me since all you need is to collect 25 ore to pass the event AND start spawning a couple handfuls of Deathclaws which are worth probably 3-5 times what the ghouls are worth. 
---
Also, I witnessed maybe one RR event over the weekend where players were actually paying enough attention to the NPCs for us not to come dangerously close to failing the event several minutes early. Even with 5 or more other players it seemed like the only reason we were running out the timer was because I spent half the event smacking the NPCs with my Shiskebab, keeping at least some of them alive. If people were smart they'd realize that they should be paying attention to the NPCs health bars if they actually want to maximize how much they can grind the event. I don't think the majority of players have any idea what they are doing.
---
Yes . I have it maxed . I also have all the shotgun perks and I have nerd rage and bloody mess
---
Likewise. I try to make it functional and asthetic as well.
---
I thought it would be kinda cool if scorchbeasts or atleast the queen could pickup players like how a bird would and drop them for damage. Even people in power armor.
---
Only you choose, how to play. Don't look to other people. Any gun is better then handmade/fixer, if you like it personally. Main reason why people don't play with radium - they just don't have unlocked silencer and other mods. To unlock all 45 mods you need to scrap around 1000 rifles. Good luck!
---
I don‚Äôt use adrenaline perk
---
I‚Äôd rather be banging on the bongos like a chimpanzee.
---
Oh wow, that website seems super helpful. Appreciate it. I'll mess around and see what looks interesting to me. Are rifles viable for end game/NW or am I better going into melee in your opinion? Maybe I'll find something that works well enough with rifles but where I won't be in trouble if I need to resort to another weapon type if I can't make a build viable for two.
---
And do you know where I can find a backpack like that or do I need to get lucky with a drop? That sounds amazing and would be very close to doubling my current carrying capacity. Sorry for all the questions
---
Without adrenaline up he should be sitting a lil over 2k dmg
---
Ok cool sadly just found out I‚Äôve can‚Äôt play until tomorrow or day after
---
Welp straight to my wall paper good job dude looks beautiful
---
I only have like 150 but I also didn't do fascnat every hour every day it was active. I don't actively just do the ! Events. And I still have stuff I want to buy using the gold I get but once that runs out...lol I'll prolly be up to the thousands relatively fast. I am more getting levels at an easy place so that 1. I don't get bored too quick. And 2. I just like playing the game.
---
This got me curious, so I looked for a list of insults.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/RE_SceneSM04_Protectron_InsultBot.txt
---
Sounds like something for Bloodied players in there.
---
I want to yes! But I need vertical half walls and I had some window trapezoid areas and very odd architecture so one day I‚Äôll see how close I can get
---
Hmm weird dude wish I could help more.. without demo I sit at 1600ish dmg.. thought that might have been your problem
---
Also the 2x xp made it so all the new players progressed to high level quickly while still doing low level quests. The result is that every low level area is full of level capped monsters, and someone of appropriate level has no hope to play in those areas because of the way the scaling and mob spawning works.
---
I don't really understand the logic of this crappy sytem. Give us perk points per level. It's fair and It won't pinish past decissions
---
i‚Äôm on pc playing through steam, thanks for the help
---
Have you unlocked the CAMP skin in the Legendary Run?  It‚Äôs bugged and removes your camp icon.
---
Nice job man.
---
I ran it solo once and managed to complete it with all scavengers alive.
---
Hi /u/TheModerateTraveller, this sounds like it may be something else. Can you please send me your Support Ticket # in a PM?
---
Too slow
---
So your advice is "get over it"?
---
Might wanna practice what you preach because legacy weapons aren't going anywhere üòò
---
Thanks for your help. I was shocked i rolled it. I honestly hope it didn‚Äôt come out as trying to brag about the roll. Iv just never rolled a hunters anything before. I had no idea it even existed and I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was worth anything other then scrap. Probably gonna prime it and make it my scorchbeast killer since it works on SBQ.
---
If I see a Level &gt;10 player soloing an event, I go lend a hand. Usually Death Blossoms or Collision Course.
---
X-02 is not in the game. There is a red version of X-03 Hellfire awarded as a universal skin for all power armor if you reach rank 100 in Nuclear Winter mode, but that's quite a grind.
---
Check out Ultracite and T-65 tho, they are pretty sweet too.
---
I'd use it for the SBQ since shes counted as an animal and not a scorched (for some reason¬ø¬ø??) it should be fairly effective
---
Thanks! :)
---
i‚Äôm also having a huge issue with creating and linking a bethesda account, my name in fallout is a long string of numbers and letters i tried creating one but it kept telling me my password needed to be unique to bethesda.net and it got annoying so i gave up. i‚Äôm also level 45 in the game
---
I wish they would EXPAND THE HELL OUT OF THE CAMP SYSTEM! For this very reason! 
---
The problem right now is that everyone can pretty easily get everything for their camp to perform the major functions. If they let people SPECIALIZE in their camp fully and provide a service to others, it would be amazing.
---
Yeah, but I just can't make enough meat piles for it to be accurate enough üòê
---
Any duped stuff should be deleted. But just because a weapon is awesome doesn't mean it's awesome because its duped. Some people I've seen put huge amounts of effort and time into perfecting their builds and their weapons.
---
Okay thanks
---
I had to skin my Strangler Heart arms because of this.  The left arm blocks a third of the screen while holding a 50cal.  I‚Äôve heard T-65 is even worse.
---
Many thanks.
---
I can just imagine everyone unloading ammunition into the scorch queen and your just there in photo mode.
---
Could be a disease or maybe a chem addiction. You should check the stats in your pipboy to see if anything is reducing your damage.
---
3* rolling pins have entered the chat
---
So many questions. Lol
---
You appear to be the subject, fascinating.
---
Yes, I'm aware of this, I don't have anything on display so that shouldn't be an issue. Thank you though.
---
&gt;You have contracted Swamp Itch
---
I hope that fixes it. Us lefties gotta stick together in the face of right-handed gaming oppression.
---
Thanks. Now that i know it works against the queen definitely thinking of priming it and putting it on full auto. See how much damage it can throw  out against her.
---
No you can't. I've played 3, New Vegas, 4, and this one. I have never seen anything above the first. Maybe depending on both where and when the next game takes place we might see new versions of the Enclave PA. Idk if being American makes my next statement unpatriotic but I kinda hope the next one takes place somewhere other than the US. Be cool to see how the rest of the world faired through the war. A rainforest kinda location would be cool I think.
---
Like a complete reset option.  This has been mentioned before.  And a lot of people agree, and even suggested that the first one's free, but the next one cost atoms.  I could go for that myself.
---
If you want Cobalt, you need to nuke Morgantown.
---
I like to throw on the CSA and get the ore in stealth, don't even bother fighting, just sneak on past.
---
I do the same for the Enclave events with the satellites.
---
While I would be sad to see my legacies go, it wouldn't make much sense considering the damage I'm able to do with my primed executioners gauss minigun.
---
Thanks for the website and the write-up! The other user also posted this website and it looks super helpful. I'll probably mess around with it for a while to see what I like. 
---
Do you mind explaining what lone wonderer and gunsmith/makeshift warrior do? I'm assuming lone wonderer is similar to the other games where you get buffs if you play by yourself (which I imagine I will be doing mostly). Gunsmith probably allows you to build certain tiered guns I'd imagine but I haven't heard of makeshift warrior. I'll look it up on the site you posted. Your SPECIAL loadout though seems like it could work for me too, or at least something fairly similar. 
---
Do you play NW at all? Will a rifle build with SPECIAL stats similar to yours be viable? 
---
I've avoided leveling up for the most part but I'm super glad you included that last bit. I put a point into Strength last night and picked a strength perk even though I didn't like any of them. Very helpful to know I don't need to do that. Really appreciate the help!
---
RNG just sucks sometimes. I've been aiming for 3* Unyielding and not picky on 2nd or 3rd rolls at all, but I've also been keeping 3* Weightless, any WWR and any Sentinel for each slot. For my right arm I magically got one of each of my 4 wants within 7 rolls, but for both legs I think I'm up around 70 or 80 on each and still no 3* Unyielding on either.
---
So I just found my first TD in the wild since this thread. So they still exist. And buying one from a bot didn't work the second time sorry for that advice. I have no idea how that worked.
---
Mm gonna eat muh foot now.
---
I have two weapons on display.
---
A legendary the dragon and bloody FFR +1 strength bear claw I got for 18k caps.
---
If they ‚Äúfix‚Äù magic shotguns I‚Äôll pull the bear claw down.
---
Same here! A bit of a side hustle plus it pays out a couple extra $$$ every month which is nice
---
I hate it when you finally find them and they're in a totally unreachable spot, like between a bed and tent wall.
---
Don‚Äôt forget the bobble head and caps finder perks too when you‚Äôre farming.
---
I got a roll like this a few weeks ago, it‚Äôs my new old faithful.
---
*national anthem intensifies*
---
You never know. Bethesda has made radical changes and taken out problematic content before.
---
I've thought about it. My apartment is small enough that I prolly could lol
---
Yeah this, I thought it might clear some camp budget too, but it didn‚Äôt look like it. Only removing the displays lowered the camp budget.
---
I dont know if it could be better than a bloodied but it's worth a try
---
Mine is mostly handmades which aren‚Äôt the nicest looking guns, standard, so I gave them all the M16 look.
---
In minutes I will be there
---
Can you design better? Cause your solution is suspiciously give me everything.
---
Because i suspect it more that you want to have a the combat perks rather than have to choose
---
Hey, thanks for your resposne. Yes I do play on Steam!
---
How do you see the [Bethesda.Net](https://Bethesda.Net) version of atoms? If it's only from loading up the game from the launcher (and not somewhere online) then I guess you'd have to buy the game from their store to see these?
---
Thanks! The lamp post is by far the best/ warmest light in the game. Ceiling bulbs are way too harsh
---
I have an elevated camp for myself and underneath I made beckett a cabin with his bar to one side. 
---
He's cosy and secure down there and is right next to the lake. It means he, and the brahmin, are safe from scorchbeast attacks. It also means he's not so likely to sneak into my bed when I'm  not around. Or worse, when I am.
---
Only you can see your character's name while holding a pylon. To everyone else present, it is your gamertag/gaming ID.
---
Right? It seemed odd and different than other cheats which made me wonder if it is some loophole in the event.
---
Maybe not inefficient as much as type of exploit that doesn‚Äôt require code. Maybe faulty event logic. Like they have a method of switching to spectator from another account. I started thinking about it - If you die from a player then you typically view that player unless you are part of a team. Which means you see your other team members if they are alive. If they are dead, can you switch to other players? If so, maybe this is exploit. If you had two accounts in the same match and weren't on the same team, you can't guarantee you'll end up in the same match. But wait - I DID just THAT with this player, by watching him until the end. Maybe because I watched this player till the end of the match, I ended up in the same match as him three times in a row. So maybe they have two accounts, one that dies early by walking into the flame. If second account is not on his/her team, could they switch to the other players? and then inform on the main account where the players are located. Then by chance (like I did - It's not really chance but maybe a game behavior.) but by watching right up until the end of the match, the two accounts end up back on the same server for the next match. hmmmm.
---
Okay let's try again -
---
1. Have two accounts, two machines, join NW as a team (or have a friend? Friend may have to be in same cloud services geo)
---
2. First match, first account dies and spectates the second account until then end of the match.
---
3. First account watches till end of match (outcome doesn't matter), both accounts exit and go back in NW menu and join but this time without being on a team.
---
4. Two accounts end up on same server but on ~~different teams~~ NO team and First account immediately walks into flame.
---
5. Then can move between members, informing on location. Repeat until they no longer are on same NW server.
---
6. Once accounts are no longer queuing on same server, repeat step 1.
---
This might be difficult to do if there are a lot of players queuing, but lately I've been ending up with a lot of the same players, probably because I like to watch the show. If you have a habit of moving on quickly and not spectating, you do not run into same players as much. Or really, you run into the same ones who are quick to exit on death too.
---
Edit: im a bad speeler and grummurer
---
Edit 2: So I just joined a match and immediately went into the flames. I could spectate everyone. So that much is clear (sorry if that was obvious but I needed to check) The next part is understanding if I watched till the end would I end up in the next queue with the winner, like I did yesterday. If so, that's probably how it's being done, yuck
---
Edit 3: So match ended and I joined next round and I'm on the next round with the winner. So that works. Also makes total sense now the method and the result. Also explains why in the middle of one of the matches, he/she stopped finding players for a minute. There was only 1-2 players left and they couldn't figure out what exact bush was being shown to them from the second account, based on the angle. As soon as the player moved from that spot, he/she could triangulate their position and resumed finding and terminating.I thought it was the nuke that slowed them down but it was the inability to determine the remaining players position based on the spectate view.
---
Edit 4: Second match is going and lo and behold this exploiter from yesterday is back. I just got capped and I'm watching their ass right now. He/she has 17 kills, has leveled up almost 40 times since I saw them yesterday. Is taking out players where location in spectate mode is obvious. Also is using Send damage as described by  /u/_Plums \- The difference is the ability to see all player's locations.
---
It back to 2k again . I had to keep taking off my demo expert and putting it back on til it fixed it
---
Hi! This is an item I badly need 3 of as well, would I be able to ping you if you are on?
---
i have both clients installed on my pc
---
I get sharing but why the fuck does everyone expect a care bear hand holding fest? 
---
The problem isn't the people so much as it is the design that makes it this way.
---
Get a tesla and tag what you can. You can't have everything every time.
---
Thanks :) I wouldn‚Äôt complain if they added foreground focus without making the entire shot blurry
---
Omg right they are! Like between filing cabinets!
---
I salute you as the hero you are, Sir
---
So do I. That's what was weird. This only happened after my account was recovered, it was working perfectly before hand
---
I have not moved my camp for about a year, up in the toxic valley near the Clarksburg shooting club, right in the middle of Snallygaster, Yao Guai, Mothman Cultists, and mirelurk spawns
---
Not a farmer and haven‚Äôt tried this myself, but I am a builder and a lot of this stuff is universal. Try using a flamethrower to destroy the melon, then plant one somewhat merging with the first one. Then repair the first one.
---
Thanks, I agree!
---
I‚Äôve had that happen. Usually after I‚Äôve tossed a grenade or two.
---
Or three.
---
Four. But no more!
---
People who got the weapons legit shouldn‚Äôt have to have things removed they worked hard for, I‚Äôm willing to bet if you put hours upon hours in the game trading you wouldn‚Äôt want your hard work taken away from you. 
---
It‚Äôs only fair to those who put the hours in to get said items. Again, legacies are not required to play the game.
---
Dang lol. Can i see ypur special if you are home already lol
---
That guy follows me like I owe him money. Maybe it's because I shoot him before he gets within 30 feet of me every time.
---
you can use the blueprint method to get more stuff on a tile.

---
Yup, your guesses on lone wanderer and gunsmith are correct and makeshift warrior is the equivalent to gunsmith but for melee weapons.
---
I play NW occasionally. Your SPECIAL points carry over but the perks are separate and you get them in card packs rather than choosing each one. You also can't guarantee what kinds of weapons you'll find so it's a bit of a crapshoot.
---
Whatever floats your boat friend :)  ive Seen lvl 45-60 players launch nukes (i guess for the quest) and launched Mine well into the 100's. So i'd say you'r on a good pace.
---
I have a newer slim ps4 and my wife has the old one. She beats me into every single session.
---
Or to a lesser extent whitespring, silt beans and tree sap
---
Yeah I made a nocturnal cultist character right before they made nights shorter with wastelanders. Was bummed about that. Definitely should be one of the strongest builds now that its so much more useless.
---
Not with PC players even if on Private servers their nonsense would infect the console players and I'm not on board for that
---
You gotta find your passion and go with it. The first time I sat in front of photoshop I absolutely loved it, a few years later and I‚Äôve opened up to the the entire film industry doing cinematography, editing, directing, graphics and more!
---
The market trade issue is not legacy weapons. Legacy weapons are just surrogate for cash. The issue is that the max caps you can have is 22 days of rather slow game play. Takes me about 15 min to get my day caps. However, in 22 days of gaming you probably never get a drop of a high end 3*. So obviously, that 3* is worth more than 22 days worth of caps. Additionally, because caps are capped, even if you valued something at 30k caps you probably couldn‚Äôt actually take 30k caps without loosing a chunk of them. 
---
Something besides caps has to be used In These situations. If you delete legacy items the issue will still be there. You just will have narrowed the field of possible trades even further.
---
The real solution is to remove the cap max in order to allow for items to be bought and sold with a cap value that reflects the rarity and usefulness of the item.
---
To be clear, I am all for deleting legacy items from a game balance and combat point. It‚Äôs just that if you think that deleting legacies will fix the high end trade economy you‚Äôre wrong.
---
thanks, I'm in game now
---
Nice! But try to go for one with one of these prefixes for crazy damage in vats: instigating, junkies, bashing, increased vats, or increased limb damage.
---
Omg!  I'm a stealth sniper that carries everything!  You can get small backpack plans from the overseer stash at Morgantown airport.  I tackled that about lvl 12 or 15.  The perks bandolier, traveling pharmacy and through hiker will do more for your ability to carry more stuff than a few extra strength points.   You will want a combat rifle once you hit lvl 20.  I have a combat shotgun for up close, out of action points fights, without any corresponding perks, and it seems to work just fine.
---
HMP\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* has no camp and doesn't appear on the map but is in public teams, like someone already said, this player is aggressively maximizing XP harvesting, some people take the game VERY seriously to the deficit of common courtesy.
---
Thank you very much.
---
That must be so frustrating to watch.
---
Dropped connection? Yeah I stored my CSA. Never truly cared for it. Maybe I‚Äôll have to give it another go, I just like my outfits and backpacks.
---
I run it with me and one other but only there for kills and legendaries.  Not bothered about completing event but great if someone pops in and grabs the ore.
---
I dont vats for crap tbh I know it's nice but some reason my game bugs out when I do it
---
Nope. Stabilized, heavy gun perks, and that's it. I just shoot her in the face until she dies.
---
What perks/special do you use to get it so high?!
---
That‚Äôs true, I didn‚Äôt think about that. That means Microsoft and Sony alone will have to get along with each other...
---
Cough..broadsider..Cough cough
---
funny you mentioned that. I finally had one appear this weekend at Vault-Tec U while I was looting after dropping the SB sample. Haven't seen another since.
---
Better Criticals isn‚Äôt a good perk because of the way criticals work. Criticals just add your weapons base damage to your damage output, considering only the receiver and ignoring anything else that boosts damage, like Bloody Mess. Because of this, Better Criticals generally increases damage by a tiny amount. You may be better off removing Better Criticals and putting those points into Four Leaf Clover, Grim Reapers Sprint, or Class Freak.
---
Note that you could replace Lone Wanderer with the empath mutation and public teams. The empath mutation counts you as your own teammate, so there is no downside provided you are on a team. With Class Freak maxed out, you get 17% damage reduction from your own mutation. If a teammate has empath, it stacks so you have even more damage reduction. You can still play solo on a public team, but you gain group benefits.
---
I would guess that the people are not being banned or blocked because that is not there actual username. The program or whatever it is they use is showing that name but it is not who they actually are, So when you see the same name over and over you are actually seeing half a dozen different players. When you Block someone, you are blocking the ISP number and not the player name, as the game has no restrictions on "player name already taken" etc
---
I would assume that Bethesda would be able to ban by ISP address though, so it still should not take as long as it does, but i would also assume the program can just generate a new IP etc on demand. Never felt the need to cheat online so not sure how it works but that would be logical.
---
I forgot about that. I love that xpac
---
Was going to bring that one up specifically lol. Says it does hundreds of damage and hits for 12...
---
Dont items you leave in  containers despawn after 15m?
---
Yes.
---
I mean, if you scrap them a bunch you‚Äôll get it. Doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt be made from you.
---
Glad I wasn't alone.
---
Appalachian naming is weird, just don't ask me about garahan.
---
Sorry I didn't see your comments till now. Well said, I agree. And yeah if I get my account back and my shit isn't wiped I'm either never going to trade again, or I might just say fuck it anyways and do a mass giveaway and get rid of all the good weapons and armor I have gotten by myself. Really though, I feel your frustration so much when I read your comments. There is only one person in this game that has helped me and then my friend through it all. When I first started out he gave me gear and even up until recently has helped me tremendously acquire new gear and finish quests etc. That being said, I have helped out so many people. And no, I don't always expect a thank you in return. But honestly I think one of the people I gave one of these weapons to is the one that reported me to Bethesda. He is a guy I don't know very well but I see him in the lfg still to this day trying to trade the TSE Tesla rifle I gave him and he won't respond to my messages. I don't know, I don't know if Bethesda caught me or if someone reported me. Either way something feels very fishy because I really don't think that I technically broke the rules, but I could be wrong I'm just too lazy to actually read up all the rules. I wish you luck in getting your account back, I will DM you if I find anything out or if I get my account back it would be awesome if you could do the same for me! Cheers and good luck
---
That's one damn dope-ass photo!  Wish I could have this as a load screen :)
---
That one I tried, wasn't able to actually destroy the melon (or even the foundation). It worked pretty well to hide as much of the cooking stove as possible, with the help of the doorway-to-wall method and wallpaper.
---
Yes, power armor is normally weaker in both NW and normal play.
---
I try to complete the event only cus I dont have any of the plan rewards and stuff but I'm also there for the experience
---
I've also got a 750 Ti which is the weakest link on my fairly new pc. But with the right ini tweaks I finally got it to run pretty good. It's the game optimization ( or lack of ) which ruins everything.
---
I'm a sucker for being a great tank in RPGs lol. Although I did step out of my comfort zone and became a glass cannon in FFXIV.
---
I will shoot them with my explosive bow all day and if you don't like it server hop. Or complain on reddit, both are equally pointless to me
---
Right? If mine wasn't basically weightless that thing would be a nice bit of script. Just waiting patiently for the fix lol
---
This is what I use. If you need a video tutorial, checkout NoRespawns's video on this.
---
Not that I have found. I tested it with a friend. But i also do it at the start of a session so I‚Äôm generally on for hours.
---
Issue with that is that you now have to add scaled content to the entire game to adjust for this increase.
---
I'm not completely sure on this but there might be a setting in Game Settings that turn area voice on &amp; off. Check that because I *think* it defaults to off.
---
Nicely done my friend
---
Yeah would be nice if they changed the loot distribution to something better, but even with the "automatic loot for everyone" there would be issues like back when Free Range was new it was plagued with low levels who would camp the boss spawn and because they were there it would up the spawns and make the event twice as difficult. 
---
I think I was about level 70 when it came out and I was struggling to kill the boss and then all of a sudden the one time there were two bosses and double the yao guai and I failed it, then see there were two teen level people hiding in the house (mire free range) just to tag the boss. Now I wouldn't care because now I can solo it easily but back then I was pretty annoyed by the freeloaders. That happened to me often enough then that I quit doing free range for a while and still rarely do it because it still pisses me off thinking about it every time I see the event pop.
---
I just figure everyone has the plans after all those damn xmas presents
---
Not everyone does the events for the same reasons... I don't give a shit about the ore, just there for the Xp and the legendaries. The rewards of RR are quite crappy btw
---
Strange right. Definitely changed the drop rate. I would always sell like 12 a day to bots. Better up those rewards, maybe it has to do with the BOS coming back and having a new place to drop it.
---
The only weapons I see that have a problem are the Heavy Legacies people can be dicks and use them on "line in the sand" and never give anybody the chance to shoot a single enemy other than that most legacy are useless and broken and most of them are used in pvp and I don't understand how is it bad in the economy just ignore the seller if he doesn't want any of your offers and move on and clearly way more better weapons than the legacy weapons we have now besides the gatling plasma , most of them break too fast also. I feel they won't make a drastic change anytime soon or probably never.
---
I‚Äôm guessing they‚Äôre the ones from a random encounter. You can come across about six dead bodies that have chalices sitting next to them. They‚Äôre all from the Mothman cult. It‚Äôs kind of a weird take on the Jonestown koolaid.
---
2k damage?! The best I've gotten is 460. What perks effect the damage of the guass shotgun?
---
It‚Äôs worth it if you don‚Äôt care about carry weight being excavator is better but it has the highest damage resistance out of all power armors. I would but all the guns and the secret service armor plus under armor first and the shielded plan for under armor being it will give 4 strength which is the highest you can get
---
People have to get over this whole, I worked hard. You are sitting there literally pushing buttons and pulling triggers with snacks and drinks close at hand. 
---
It‚Äôs not hard work. More so all these games are designed for you to win eventually. 
---
And you would lose that bet. I‚Äôve lost lots of stuff in games. You can always get it back. 
---
That‚Äôs the thing about these games. The stuff in them is infinite in quantity. Caps never run dry. There will be more Nuka Cola tomorrow and the day after. Scrip, gold all of it. Never runs out.
---
I‚Äôll be on later, after dinner.
---
YELLOW
---
Yes. Craft the lowest level, you get mods regardless of the level.
---
I also suggest have green thumb on. Doubles the amount picked up.
---
I never played NW, but I have used Power Armor in Adventure. I feel PA has a larger hitbox resulting in being hit more often. PA has a hidden damage reduction of 7% per armor piece attached adding up to 42% damage reduction before the PA damage resistance is applied. At least that is what the wiki says.
---
But the game only allows you to hang one body in a tree cage.
---
You aren't kidding, I looked at that guy's posts and he is made probably at least 20 post in regards to trying to troll everyone who duped, which in reality I almost guarantee that he is a massive duper he sits in his mom's basement sucking his own cack every night LOL
---
It‚Äôs the strongest armor, but it‚Äôs loud and you don‚Äôt get good mobility and forget about hiding. There is also a perk that gives you 50 energy and damage resistance for -not- wearing power armor specifically, so with that perk on, marine armor should be much much better
---
haha yes
---
Thank you.
---
I feel that I usually like not being able to be blown over by the wind in games
---
It's the armor with the best stats, by far. But you can manage with an X01 or a T51, plus it will be easier to buy plans for the mods.
---
Damnit Bethesda. What, am I made of cages?
---
There‚Äôs typically a note lying around as well ‚ÄúCultist Plea 2‚Äù or something. Kinda morbid but nice detail. I should snag them for my church I‚Äôm planning on building.
---
Hm, okay. I think I will. I'm hoping it'll make FO76 life a little easier at least haha
---
Hope it works. Still $hit it happens.
---
I tried to build there about a year ago, its a bummer because it's a pretty good spot.
---
All the banned people have nothing else to do so their new endgame is downvoting.
---
Ever end up in a match where all 10 of the last competitors are bush wookies? 
---
It's pretty funny to watch everyone dart and dash from cover to cover while avoiding fights.
---
It can be really hard to not fall into the stealth sniper/archer type of player for me! I go into games telling myself I won't but it always happens. Fallout, Skyrim, Outer Worlds, etc. without fail. I am considering using perks that work well with AP but I need time to mess around on that site people mentioned to see if anything works.
---
I've been putting off going to Morgantown but now that I know there's a plan for a backpack I think that's my next stop. Appreciate it! Absolutely cannot stand having no space and needing to stop at my CAMP all the time.
---
#FOR VALHALLA!
---
Yeah honestly I‚Äôve passed up bloodied ones because I knew it wasn‚Äôt worth it. Same with a fat man and a missile launcher
---
Both methods work.
---
Never said collect all 100 ore. Just 25. If you're quick about collecting/depositing them you absolutely get more exp AND you  get to complete the event. The Deathclaws don't prevent the ghouls from spawning.
---
The only reason youd get less exp is if you were slow at collecting the ore and ignored the ghouls while doing so or the rare case that you're already receiving max exp. I ran the event close to two dozen times over the weekend and I can tell you I never received less SCORE on runs where the event was partially completed. I did however receive far less when players completely ignored *all* the objectives and couldn't even keep the NPCs alive.
---
Colorblind :/
---
Sounds like something Butters would do.
---
The banned people?    Banned from the game?
---
It would be nice if you could make ‚Äòblueprints‚Äô or presets for your perk card loads so that you could easily switch between builds that you‚Äôve already made.
---
After using them using them for a bit and learning to LOATHE the ammo expenditure? I'd say yes, actually. I tried a Bloodied one with a Tesla Dynamo and found it underwhelming. Tried the same gun with the prime capacitor, and now I'm hoarding crimson flux in preparation for Earle Williams(A Colossal Problem: whenever that's released). It was a night and day difference to me.
---
The cost of the ammo is stil a pain(I HATE flux farming), but I'm reserving this beast for special occasions.
---
I used to just buy whatever I had the money for, but since this purchase I have started researching any purchase over $50, aside from groceries.  I ask myself "am I getting the most out of my money by buying this doohickey?" And if I'm not certain, I don't buy it.
---
Ok, thanks all for the suggestions. I think it's time for me to switch to automatics now. single shot weapons not cutting it at all right now. I'll work on the build as I go along, look to upgrade my weapon when i can...
---
Id like to keep a fat man 90% on me so whenever I go to low level camps and they're selling 20 mini nukes I dont have to keep crafting one to launch all said nukes I saved said person from lol
---
Yep I agree. :(
---
At my old job when I worked since we didn‚Äôt have breaks I would eat a snack and have a drink, didn‚Äôt mean I wasn‚Äôt working or ‚Äúworking hard‚Äù 
---
Just because you can‚Äôt get a legacy doesn‚Äôt mean others should lose out on it cause your jealous or other motives/emotions. 
---
I don‚Äôt know what you said in your second paragraph did you have a stroke or something?
---
Hahaha
---
Nerd Rage, Serendipity and Radicool are some bloodied favourites.
---
Yea... and the 1 version they crawled is from October. You can click on the link and see it is exactly the same as the version currently up there...
---
Again if you have another version from October that looks different I would love to see it.
---
Do you actually think they said ‚Äúif you buy a private server you can use mods‚Äù? You are the first person who I have ever seen claim this.
---
Mine is just by the agriculture center and I often find new players coming in asking if they can stay and they start using my stations I love when that happens
---
Thanks! It would be an honor. :)
---
I mean if Destiny has been doing it, I‚Äôm sure Bethesda can figure it out...
---
You should take the time to manually go through each perk [here](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks) and find the ones that would compliment your play style the most, not just bloodied. Serendipity and Nerd Rage are two off the top of my head that would compliment a bloodied build, but there are others. Check them out!
---
Y‚Äôall are the reason I have so much fun being a ‚Äútourist.‚Äù I love checking out other 76ers‚Äô camps and seeing what cool ideas people have come up with. Most of my photo album is a collection of cool camps I‚Äôve come across in my travels. Thank you!
---
Is there an anticheat? I feel like it desperately needs one (on PC).
---
Nice video! That would be cool.
---
I'm the same, except when they try to kill my pet molerat Doofus. That makes me sad. LOL. In Fallout 4, I have a ton of mods specifically designed for settlement building, I love it. My Sanctuary has an actual grocery store where the vault-tec sales guy works since he's a top tier vendor when he's put on a General stall. I have shelves with placeable food &amp; drink, laundry stuff, bathroom stuff etc. I even have shopping baskets at the entrance. It has a hardware store too with a top tier vendor, can't remember her name now. I put Marcy on this cool meat chopping table, seems to shut her up &amp; she becomes a top tier food &amp; drink vendor. Love settlement building! As  for Jun, can't shut him up, also he won't sleep in the same house as Marcy. Not sure why. But yeah, building CAMPs FTW. I go round the map just to see other people's CAMPs.
---
I personally have the set, but I don‚Äôt use it as I have my X-01 set fully modded and I don‚Äôt care enough about the T-65 set to do that again. I‚Äôm just not interested in getting everything.
---
PS you can mod the ultracite you just need to do queen fights to get said mods. My vendor is constantly full of Ult PA plans.
---
I'll definitely let you know if I hear from them. Good luck to you as well.
---
:)
---
Unfortunately I don't think I have that perk
---
Wait what are the 4 suits? I know the blue and yellow from radiation rumble, but what are the other 3?
---
Photomode. I hardly ever use the camera.
---
What? Do you not want loot?
---
Yes! Thank you.
---
I made what I think is like a nice little rest stop using the new Red Rocket garage, plus a few other things.
---
Eh not unpatriotic at all i sorta want the same thing and I‚Äôm from the US
---
It's really only good for nuke zones, but even that isn't great since good teams usually have a Pharma Farma guy with enough RadX to cancel the apocalypse.
---
I was thinking that too, that bottom flame is still kinda high. You couldn‚Äôt raise the foundation so it could hit the melon, then lower it again?
---
Cousin to the water wookie and seldom seen, very rare urban wookie.
---
IIRC Modus sells them
---
Here is my build if your interested [Gauss Shotgun Build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f446e58&amp;d=sd2su2so2sp2sb2pc2pq0ee2c72cr0ir2ib4s12ii0i61a72a41&amp;w=lt2lu0l71) . I also have mutations but the main one is adrenal reaction
---
I love when he threatens to burn down my camp and kill me.
---
What loot? He disappears half the time
---
"Wholesome" is exactly the word.
---
Old ring is near the "87" road sign on the overworld map.  Straight east of the lake cabin work shop on a park bench near the lake. About 150 yards off the road.
---
I agree but for goodness sakes we‚Äôre paying $15+ dollars a month for basically just a survival tent and a lonely private world. They need to add more features to people who pay for Fallout 1st or just reduce the monthly cost.
---
Mad a little adjustment[Photo](https://i.imgur.com/ADHCd6Z.jpg)
---
If they came back and explicitly told you that they can't un-suspend you for exploiting, you're straight up fucked and need to start over. Anybody who was experienced otherwise, feel free to speak up and prove me wrong, but from what I know there's no chance for a reversal once the appeal has been denied.
---
From what I know from past friends, the best you can hope for is getting your account completely wiped (except for Atomic Shop acquisitions) and having it turned back to you **several** **months** from now.
---
Preach it brother/sister/non-gender-defining-noun!!! It really would help the vast majority of trading in the future
---
Thank you very much!
---
They did a lot of fixes with wastelanders graphics wise, I‚Äôm on Xbox and can see the difference with old screenshots to new.. I just really hate what they did with the lighting it hurts my eyes, why don‚Äôt we have brightness settings in this game?
---
Of course it's not a fix but it does take a large annoying factor out of the game.  The rarity of legacy weapons is a large impediment when people are expecting them rather than taking an alternative.  It's like trying to buy a house but the seller will only take payment in mint condition vintage comic books.
---
Completed the 76 molotovs by accident, didn't get the atoms...
---
PC, non-steam, non-gamepass.
---
'tis fucked up.
---
But that's skill. /sarcasm
---
The picture is so small I can barely make out the trees let alone a bush wookie.
---
Will second this. With green thumb perk you can leave Morgantown with 50+ cobalt flux. There‚Äôs also a short row of violet flux by fraternity row. Most of the cobalt will be on the outskirts by Mama Dolce‚Äôs and Portside Pub. Also tons of bloated glowing ones spawn in the nuke zone so you‚Äôll get plenty of high rad fluids/glowing n hardened masses for stable flux crafting
---
Because I can? Can I not ask about more specific questions? Is that now not allowed?
---
Hahaha! A lot of the time that's pretty much what happens. People complain about not getting any loot but I stress over pictures. xD
---
xD Language excused! Thanks for the kind words.
---
Squirrels. They‚Äôre wrinkly adorable little things.
---
I still go to my camp to gather collection junk, stock vending machines, complete ally quests, and collect my ArmCo ammunition. I also put a spiked board trap at the edge of a cliff for some ‚Äúup, up, and away!‚Äù action lol.
---
You mean you literally couldn‚Äôt figure out I made a common typo of do instead of so? Or are you just trying to be that guy that thinks he‚Äôs smart? You fail either way.
---
Honestly I‚Äôm at the point where I‚Äôm leaving so many legendary weapons behind because of the cap. I never get through them, also I always pick up the 90% weight reduction to store them in case. Sometime if those people risk letting other get a shot in the herd can get killed and you can‚Äôt get the rare rewards. So between risking the rare rewards (the whole reason high levels do this mission) and letting you get your ‚Äú5 scrip‚Äù it‚Äôs not even a decision.
---
My first time fighting the queen I was only level 23. It was wild, and I couldn't imagine getting any good photos
---
just remember to make yourself a new backpack every 10 levels.  They have levels like all guns and armor do, but you can't loot, drop, or trade backpacks.  The Pioneer Scout challenges will lead you to large backpack plans, but that is a long way off, if ever.
---
Get that man a three claw gont and teach him to use the force
---
It's in the middle of nowhere. Just start checking support pylons near foundation.
---
Yes with Wastelanders came some lighting upgrades. In most cases it looks good but in some instances things look too wet or shiny. Hopefully this will be tweaked sometime.
---
There is body armor and there is Power Armor. 
---
I personally bought the body armor first, but not the helmet since it has no defensive function.
---
Suppressor disables explosives effects.
---
Thanks. That sounds awesome.
---
I love how people spend so much time modifying the bases it's been a major part of the game that's what keeps me coming back been trying to learn all the plans so I can build more stuff but it's been scares finding plans.
---
No, I won't stop doing that. My build is a stealth riflemen.
---
I have no idea what imgur did to it. reuploaded [https://imgur.com/a/vOtlCbA](https://imgur.com/a/vOtlCbA)
---
Salty... lol. I don‚Äôt know about you, but it is extremely frustrating trying to hear people in this game, in many situations. And I should not be forced to turn down my game volume significantly to hear them, when it has been standard practice to include such basic audio output options in games for decades.
---
Directly on Morgantown? I don't know about that, unless I forked over the sub fee for a private server. I don't want to hurt any new players
---
Thanks for the tip gunna check it out! Love pre-existing structures! I‚Äôm building in the barn out behind the cat house. I‚Äôll be posting an album when i‚Äôm done
---
I have a character that lives there. It‚Äôs all about using rugs. Rugs let you place items on floors that would ordinarily say ‚Äúneeds support‚Äù. I also placed the fusion generator up in the rafters. Filled the place up, still have tons of budget. If you want to see it sometime shoot me a message.
---
Never say never.
---
Aha! That's it then! Why doesn't it do that on the Gauss Pistol? Either way, thanks a bunch!
---
no
---
Ok, I take it you are in U.S.? I will keep an eye out for you when I can, thank you!!
---
The crates are randomized, so it's not like you can place your spawn right on one. You can spawn where you know there might be crates, but the chance of the crate not being there or having junk in it is just as likely to kill you as spawning in 15 seconds later than another player.
---
The timer sounds fun though. A 1 or 2 minute period where you have to fight bare fists to defend any crates you find before they unlock sounds pretty epic.
---
Its an exploit, dont do it tho, messes w your budget and risk getting banned
---
In addition to what others wrote below, Dodgy and Blocker will also help you staying alive...
---
Probably the wendigo and its colossal variant.
---
Does the blast also transform the surrounding area? Or just in the blast zone? Do I place the nuke right on top of the whitesprings resort icon?
---
Claiming pylons should be your donation at killing the SS.
---
Me and my friend were saying how slow and useless protectrons where the other day and old Insult Bot showed up like 'I heard you talkin' shit like I wouldn't know.'
---
Gotcha, I figured it was something unintentional since I've not seen it for as long as I've played, but thought I'd check. Thanks and have a good one!
---
Could you share your ini tweaks? I can get the game running pretty well but at times it just stutters badly, mostly when inside buildings
---
Go to Bethesda support main page, click on 76 under ‚Äúselect product‚Äù scroll down and you‚Äôll be able to see ‚Äúsubmit ticket‚Äù at the bottom.
---
Edit: do submit error code
---
Nah man, you actually edited your comment and added more to it then you‚Äôre original comment and grammar/spelling errors. 
---
Like lmao you don‚Äôt think I would have noticed you adding almost a whole paragraph in there while fixing you errors? Get a grip lmaoo
---
I love my camp and building it up, and my favorite part is traveling around and seeing other bases. If its pretty good i usually buy something i dont need as a donation, but if its a work of art I will message the owner and give them kudos. A base review would be something cool to be added at some point.
---
I'm just hoping they put a perk card in to deal with poison eventually. I run pretty much every damage avoidance perk I can, but if they add a 45% less damage from poison, it's going in the stack.
---
Edit: I've gotten to the point to where I can usually melt kings in a second or two with my minigun but that distance attack that they do that staggers you is a real pain.
---
Holy shit that's the friggin grail right there.
---
Not sure, I just run around the foresty outer area collecting the above when other ppl nuke it
---
So I totally must've missed the part where you said you only have 2 hours a week to play my bad on that but I'd imagine  that's contributing to why you dont have or know how to do certain things the ge really requires alotta time. How are you gonna say "try not being a dick all the time" based on one comment? I can certainly be an ass at times but definitely not all the time I do my best to help players whether that's by giving them supplies they need or advice to help them along dont speak like you know me I was rude to you cause I'm sick of people shitting on the game for things they either dont know or dont have it's gotten ridiculous. There are definitely plenty of flaws in the game and people can feel free to point them out and hate the game for those actual flaws as much as they want but the things you pointed out IMO are not flaws of the game but rather your misunderstanding of it. Dont victimize yourself by saying your someone who "just wants to enjoy the game" if you just want to enjoy it then enjoy the good maybe try saying what you like about the game instead of what you dont cause from my perspective you just look like another A hole jumping on the bethesda hate wagon. I dont consider a game that encourages the use of the internet as bad design it would definitely be better if every game made everything transparent and easy to find/understand but everyone who is playing this game has access to the internet and can figure out anything they need to in a few minutes so why wouldn't that be relied upon? Just my thoughts on it but I see your point and it is valid however the specific thing I was referring to was how to get the plans for the PA station which is unbelievably easy to find everyone knows the vendor bots sell loads of plans seems like common sense to check the plans sold be the brotherhood vendor... who are known for using power armor. Anyway you have some very good points about the tone difference between this game and the rest it's a wild change of pace and absolutely makes me miss the classic desolate morbid vibe of the older games but with that I do also really enjoy the environments of 76 they vary greatly and I think it fits in very well lore wise and makes a fun world to play around in and explore rather than just the "everything everywhere is a dead wasteland" gets kinda repetitive after multiple playthroughs ya know? Lastly I am sorry for my attitude like I said just getting sick of people shitting on the game constantly without actually understanding it but I dont want to push you away from it or add to any toxicity so again I'm sorry and hope you enjoy the game more with time. If you're on Xbox and would like any help or advice hit me up I'd love to make up for my unsavory behavior and try to make the ride smoother for you. Good luck and have a good one dude!
---
This is why I want them to make teams with ‚Äúgoals‚Äù like they do for the new public teams in Adventure Mode. I‚Äôm a bush Wookiee who usually makes it into the final 10 and I can sometimes make a kill or two. If I had three other players like me? Hell yeah, we could probably win matches.
---
Good to hear!
---
Wow never had this random encounter happen
---
Thanks for the info
---
What's the visual glitch? The fact that it doesn't have a powered gate? That was why I originally bought it but I suppose I never checked the fine print that it didn't actually have a gate.
---
If you can't manage a single kill, you're terrible at video games.
---
I don‚Äôt understand it, because it seems like everybody but bethesda knows the exact ways in which they could optimize their games? Is there any reason why they don‚Äôt do this?
---
Oh right, I didn't even think of the fact that you don't know what weapons you'll have in NW. 
---
I had a question about what perks you use since you kinda have a similar build to what I want. I noticed on the site you mentioned that many perks have multiple levels. For example, rifleman, expert rifleman, master rifleman. Or the same but for archers in your case. Is it better to have one of each of those perks? Or should I level them up and use the 3* master rifleman?
---
Really tho they indeed need to either buff those perks or delete them, poluting the legendary pool.
---
Yeah I wouldn't rely on magic damage, bugs like that are always a danger of getting patched out.
---
Five is right out.
---
It's the explosive rapid fire stuff that's annoying.  Although tesla's can be annoying, they are not anywhere near as bad as the explosive rapid-fire stuff.
---
He sells x-01 not ultracite
---
The issue I think is that events like this players will care far more about tagging the enemies than paying attention to the objective. In Radiation Rumbles case few people will pay attention to the NPCs and keep them alive. Even if you don't care about collecting ore and your goal is to just run out the timer to farm ghouls, ignoring the NPCs is asinine. 
---
I've seen this event cut 3-4 minutes short when there were more than 6 people running around killing enemies simply because no one would pay attention when a ghoul would slip by and start beating down an NPC. Because their focus was so narrow they lost out on potentially tens of thousands of exp. I don't care whether or not other players are "sharing", but i do care when they're playing so stupidly that it's affecting me.
---
sounds like steam got confused
---
I made my irl camp, which is really more of a house than a camp. I of course did some embellishing with the giant bar and donut selling train car :)
---
You should get it at next level up. When it‚Äôs time to go farm then flux after killing all the mobs, that gets slapped on immediately.
---
Emmet mountain hazmat suit (blue) , prototype hazmat suit (yellow), the regular and the broken suit. Nothing really rare beside the Emmet mountain one but would still look awesome with some rad barrels around the display case and some atom bomb lamps. And it would be some kind of display not everybody has like the teddy bears or Mr.Fuzzys.
---
:) Thanks
---
i‚Äôd love to see fallout san francisco, imagine those hills you‚Äôd have to walk
---
thanks!
---
Holy shit 5k?  I'm currently selling for 1/10th that... time to adjust the price.
---
I ran into a pioneer scout challenge on a bridge, didn't realize it's something late in the game. If a craft a new backpack it just automatically becomes equipped or how does that work? 
---
Really I guess I should just hop into the game and find out for myself but considering I don't know how much time I'll devote to it I'd like to be as prepared as I can be.
---
Personally id buy the armour
---
The 5 pieces you want are; Torso, Right Arm, Left Arm, Right Leg, Left Leg
---
The helmet is basically just cosmetic, the secret service suit is an under armour, and arguably the best one currently
---
Hiding in a bush with a scoped lever gun or hunting rifle and all the rifle perks to buff it along with the ghillie suit is a lot of fun. It's literally what that outfit is meant for and it usually works great.
---
I have a fairly basic stealth rifleman build, but with my perk card distribution on critical and vats bonuses, my shotgun just massacres things. Out of vats its weak as a puppy, but with vats..... monster.  It's nice to play both very different kinds of guns without swapping things around.
---
Oh hell yeah!
---
s c h n o z
---
I still do this 140 levels later.
---
Lol. That and traveling vendors deciding to sleep in my bed when I want to use it.
---
My camp WAS wide open without walls or a roof. Have beds and every possible bench outside on a nice deck.  Ended up building a small elevated condo with a locked door and tinkers bench though to keep the damn vendors out of my bed and keeping me from making more ammo.
---
I read on here they confirmed it is coming and it will be free.If you look for it im sure you find the reply.
---
You should fast travel to friendly camps close to your objectives so you can save caps. And you should try to not spend them until you reach lvl 30 and you can get starched genes. You can look up cap stash farming routes and Make some decent money everyday
---
Then just start one shotting everything at that point and maybe they'll learn. Play according to what's going on around you.
---
xD
---
That feeling when your CAMP is larger than some MMO villages. (Looking at you, Goldshire.)
---
know off hand what stat it's under?
---
Perception.
---
But you don‚Äôt have to increase Perception to sect a Perception perk, FYI.
---
I have a bloodied double barrel with 33% more vats hit chance. EVERYTHING dies. Unless it's one of those stupid assaultrons, because the face layer is always charged and ready to shoot at all times.
---
Looks great. I have a town camp in that same spot! I haven‚Äôt used that character in months,  before there were any prefabs. Bet I could add quite a bit more now!
---
Amazing display on your system, that thing could be a poster or something. Really amazing shot. Be safe out there
---
Then you gotta start wrecking every mob that moves and fight fire with fire.
---
So it does effect the surrounding area outside the blast, alright.
---
My first time was level 18, and I haven't progressed since then. Nice guy gave me a suit of raider power armor and helped me along a lot. Don't know what happened to him, but long story short I'm out of crossbow bolts again.
---
Let‚Äôs hope that some day, this dream will come true. Something that might help you is the light from the mining helmet from a distance. I‚Äôve seen that this hugely improves the lighting you can do.
---
That's why whenever I'm wanted I immediately stash all my junk and play the rest of my playsession scrap-free until murdered by a rando rambo.
---
https://youtu.be/h39-GD83SkY this is pretty much it. Tweek it all ya want... cant wait to see what I can do when adrenaline is fixed
---
Its either Torso or Chest, as long as it says Secret Service, and not T-65 you should be good
---
Certain objects in the junk tab don‚Äôt break down completely so you‚Äôll have to go through and individually scrap them, I noticed it when I was looking for springs and screws and such.
---
Pay attention to all the lore. There‚Äôs a holotape you find that makes it clear the current Maxson is strongly against the use of nuclear weapons.
---
It's got to be the mothman for me. It's a really cool design, creepy as hell to come across somewhere at night with the way it watches you, and it's an interesting/challenging fight.
---
Also each community has its own economy, you could abuse FO1 (which I have) to profit if something is cheaper or more abundant in one. With all the hacking on PC this would probably end up ruining the console economy (I know we just had a mass amount of duping)
---
I‚Äôm happy for full console crossplay though, not just private servers.
---
Okay I shall buy it tonight
---
Wait really? I have an harpoon with explosive and Double shot i got like an year ago super cheap, but i didn't even knew it was legacy cause when i started playing explosive lasers was already super rare and didn't dropped, thinking now maybe i have a legacy without being aware?
---
get the perk hard sell not sure what level that is available , vendor everything you can a day that‚Äôs 1400 caps at railway stations and random vendors 
---
are you on pc , xbox or ps4?
---
rotfl!
---
Full PA ans they melt me it's so goddamn annoying worse during Queens as I can barely react or kill it
---
It really is a pain and can literally get you killed
---
Don't pick up crap you don't need... Or pay up for FO1st , those are about your only options
---
To lazy to edit my gun soloed the SBQ in 5 minutes
---
Yea
---
Yeah most of my weight is from food items because I keep finding more and HAVE to cook it but the vendor doesn't have enough caps.
---
I used to be bumping that 490 all the time until I changed things a bit and upgraded "Science" or whatever to reduce fission core weight and then the one for "explosives weigh less" and now once I clean things out and get ready to play I generally have probably about 325lbs on me.
---
There should be an "unlimited" space for AID items that can only be accessed by ONE container (not like the stash where you can access it from multiple things).
---
Maybe they'll have something with the "personal interiors" or something that's coming down the pipe.  A place to store food that has AT LEAST the same reduction in spoil that we do on our person, because the little fridge only does what 50% reduction?
---
I disagree and here is why:
---
If they were going to get removed they should have when they became "Legacy".
---
They have been nerfed just as every other explosive weapon was when Demolition Expert got nerfed by 50% along with the other nerfs to base effects. 
---
Following the "they ruin the economy" thing; if legacies get removed it will be something else, B2525 comes to mind...
---
The "unbalanced" thing is true but the same can be said for Bloodied, so do you want Bloodied removed as well?
---
Just because you dont like explosive energy weapons doesnt mean somebody else doesn't, it's a game and we are all free to enjoy it using what we want. I dont run Bloodied much, I dont care that people do it doesnt take away or make my experience any less. 
---
-What needed to happen or still needs to happen is legacies need to be brought back and a proper balance needs to be done. This includes "trash" prefixes like Nocturnal and all of the enemy type ones. The reason why Legacies are so prevalent is the same reason Bloodied and Junkies are so sought after. The other choices just dont match the raw damage. If Nocturnal would have a different time of effectiveness, say 7pm-7am it would be more useful but the limited game hours it works holds it back. If the enemy type effects would be increased to say 60% then people could choose, do I want to run Bloodied and get the massive damage at a cost of survivability or do I want to keep situational weapons where I can switch weapons depending on what I am fighting? These are issues that have been demanding change for well over a year now and it would honestly help whatever market is left because there would be way more player choice. 
---
When you limit the choice and make only a few effects truly viable issues arise and those issues are not solely the Legacy weapons problem. If they were no longer legacy but actually dropped in game still and a proper balance was done you wouldnt have people flocking to them. At launch some players used what is now legacy weapons and others didnt because other explosive weapons were just as deadly. The same thing would happen if the real issues were dealt with, some players just dont like legacies like some do not like explosive weapons. Giving more viable choices only brings a better ecosystem of the entire game.
---
U put a bunch of letters and stuff most of the time 
---
edit my phone always gots to auto correct I*
---
you can do some of the pioneer challenges early but doing enough of them to earn badges, which you can turn in for backpack plans seems like a very far off task.
---
After you craft a backpack, you must equip your new one.  Just take the old one and drop it.  It will warn you that the backpack will be destroyed, but you know the plan, so no worries!
---
Lawd..  what about los Angeles?
---
isn't this new group coming to Appalachia disconnecting from maxson? I thought that's what I heard from the leaked audio tapes
---
are you talking about plans you can buy from vendor robots? 
---
if so, their price drop as your charisma stat increase. there are certain armor pieces that greatly increase your SPECIAL stats, combined with drugs as grape mentats and perks like hard bargain you can grealty reduce their prices. 
---
also, after a while you start to gain more caps, either by earning them in quests/events or selling things at your camp vendors. 
---
so, while you‚Äôre still struggling with caps focus on buying things you do need now. later you find plenty :)
---
Mines just north of the workshop that makes the pee war food along the river just next to the power pylon.
---
Love it there and sure it's not the best spot but I love my sunrise
---
You can tank great with junkies.
---
Thanks!!
---
Same.   There's so much cool stuff and not remotely enough space to use it all.
---
I was under the impression that entire division was returning to Appalachia. Well, what remains of it anyway.
---
Yup! I made a fun kill like this over the weekend. I‚Äôm a Grafton Dam mermaid too and I was watching someone run along the lake. When they stopped at the little boat with the safe and tried to pick the lock, I came out of the water and took them out with the lever rifle. That was fun! I‚Äôm going to try to stalk more people from the water and take them down. I‚Äôm bad at combat but can usually make a kill if I have the element of surprise on my side.
---
So the ideal game is just everybody running around with bloodied? We're already pretty close to that as is. Doesn't seem too special when everybody has it
---
They changed them in wastelanders. Gauss weapons (rifles, pistols, miniguns and shotguns) have explosive effect build in (not as major effect).
---
I can pull almost 600 carry weight outside of PA and it's ridiculous. Unless if you like having only 20 stims and that's it at a time it's ridiculous how bad the weight issue is in PA.
---
What about ChYnA??!?!
---
I've been toying with this quite a bit, and I think it is fairly tightly coupled with the damage rubber banding issue of high DPS weapons.  If that's true it will likely be a while before they fix it, if ever.
---
Sounds good, thank you! 
---
I was out in search of specific plans to help build my camp up and noticed the obnoxiously overpriced plans of some vendors.
---
I agree I love camp building one of my favorite parts of the game I put as much detail into it as possible don't even put turrets would rather decorations everyone who comes to my camp always make sure to compliment on it such nice people in the fall out community I put a lot of time and effort in my camp only wish I had more ways to show it off
---
Hell no! Might as well remove every Junkies/Bloodied Explosive weapon too then. And all the presents from the game. 
---
Right now is the most balanced this game has ever been. It's no ones fault you haven't grabbed a godroll gun besides your own. Put in the hours and keep going to the purveyor to get something good OR trade for better weapons and armor.
---
the leaked tapes, thered a detachment coming to Appalachia specifically but not maxson and and the main brotherhood, and then I'm the tapes maxson cant reach the expeditionary force on radio or anything, you should definitely go listen to those tapes
---
Bulk and sell stuff you‚Äôll never use. Make a mule for weapons and armor and ammo
---
but will my name still be ridiculous in the game?
---
Server crashes have been part of this game since the B.E.T.A, dupes or not, they still happen, usually when there is a heavy load like half the server fighting the SBQ or more than 10 people at Radiation Rumble! This is due to poorly optimised code running on rented Amazon servers that weren't designed for this!
---
How about Britain?  Stead of raider punk and shit,. Raider Chav.
---
raider dole scrounger. Etc.
---
Are you on pc?
---
Are they ingame or leaked? Because I heard about some leaks but I doubt their credibility... No mention of a splitoff in them at all.
---
I do that when someone has their camp where my camp would be. Lol. Nothing gets someone to leave like stripping to skivvies and taking a nap in someone else's bed.
---
Idk ask Chyna
---
My commie collectron finds frag grenades, blood packs, and chinese officer swords. On occasion he finds a propoganda flyer or the communist gold pins. I use the chemist and super duper perks to make stimpaks with the blood packs and never run out of stims. I actually sell stimpacks to vendors on occasion when i get too many now.
---
yes i‚Äôm on pc and my in game name has been 66e29499592r3939 or something absurd like that i‚Äôm level 45 and don‚Äôt wanna loose my stuff, can i link my game to a bethesda account?
---
I did the same thing with my alt, I just set up 3 of those backwoods bungalow trailers and called it a day.
---
I remember there was a level 9 attacking the SBQ with a handrill one time...god mauled by an Angler the next second.
---
Depending on your level, some places are really good farms for equipment you can sell to vendors (up to 1400 caps a day).  The Prison's yard is one for slightly lower levels (plus it is is chock full of low level super mutants who always carry a few caps).  Higher level places to farm more lucrative weapons to sell include moleman at and in black water mine and west tek. Radiation Rumble can get you a boat load of glowing blood, which sells high.
---
Special events get you cash, but I found farming for equipment to sell (with the bartering perk card active), is a quick way to get 1400 a day.
---
But don't feel bad about not having a lot of caps  - unless you are really spending time and selling legendary and rare objects, there aren't really fast ways to earn alot.  I tend to fluctuate between 2K and 14K throughout the week, as I buy plans, bullions, and legendary modules.
---
I build, destroy, and rebuild my camp almost daily. I'm only level 48, and I don't care all that much about actually 'playing'  the game. I just buy stuff in the atomic shop and rebuild, rebuild, rebuild. Might seem lame to some, but that's how I enjoy my time in Appalachia!
---
You guys down voting that probably have a hard time adapting to life when it doesn't go your way. Get real.
---
The increased resistances will only give you marginally better protection than any other power armor. Asides from that, the 1 plus it has is all helmet mods are unlocked with the base helmet plan.
---
X-01 is plenty good enough, and you only need caps for the plans. Plus you can buy headlamp color mod plans for next to nothing. Or if you want carry weight, Excavatot is the gold standard.
---
I believe it is part of the last update to halt server lag by not rendering every item in the machine. It didn't work do well.
---
Oooh, cheers, I was just using rank 1 of shotgunner perks
---
Well im sure it‚Äôll you won‚Äôt mind having a bunch of letters as your name I‚Äôm not sure if it changes your name to be honest since I‚Äôm on PS4 and mines didn‚Äôt Change or I was lucky to get my actual username
---
Bad ass
---
I just got to 20 recently, ill keep an eye out for all this. Thank you for the input.
---
Yea I‚Äôm sure you can try to link it I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll suggest watching a video on YouTube
---
Make a secondary account or drop unnecessary junk, I would drop hundreds of junk scrap at the train station and free up a couple hundred pounds. I ended up getting fallout 1st, it makes playing much more enjoyable
---
It‚Äôs the frogs. I stopped and watched their animation earlier today. They‚Äôre ridiculously cute scooping up bugs and going miamiamiam.
---
thank you i think i got it to work finally!!
---
leaks of actual in game voiced dialogue, those shitty radio stations in your pip boy? there's that but completely un-staticy and you can hear the whole message clearly, and you can listen to the other dialogue from maxson straight to the expeditionary force and there's tension between the leader of the force and maxson so they go dark and it's just a mess, you'd have to go listen to them
---
No problem now go have fun without any worry now
---
It is literally one of the best perks in the game
---
If they don't you'll get over it though right?
---
Get rid of stuff you dont need. Its so easy to hoard stuff that seem useful But you never use it. Low weight objects like chems, ammo, plans adds up really quick. My tactic is to hoard like crazy during the weekend, then during work days i basically just log in sell/scrip what i can, do my dailies and log out. Works out pretty good
---
Build up your camp!
---
work out which junk you need for repairing weapons and armour and keep a fair bit of that. Learn which junk is harder to find and keep a little bit more of that. And learn which junk you barely ever use and is easy to find and keep either none or some. Sell stuff you don't need. 
---
Use this to find junk if/when you need it
---
 [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic) 
---
OR get fallout 1st for a month and spend most of your time filling that box. You can still get stuff out but not put stuff in when you cancel
---
Pick up every weapon dropped from scorched, super mutants, and raiders and sell them until you hit the daily vendor cap limit
---
If you don't have fallout 1st, just take note of what junk items you use regularly.  Keep more of those, but if you don't use certain items, bulk them and sell all except about 100 of each.  For instance, you don't need 500 silver.  Sell all of it except about 100 or so.
---
Make 5 builds for 4,000 stash. A second account for all those weapons and armor you‚Äôre not really using
---
Pa has never been end game armor except for f1and f2

*"For example. Let‚Äôs say I only have 3 points in strength. Instead of having unarmed 3 star, in better off have 3 perk cards, of unarmed, and all 3 of them a level 1."* This is correct for other weapon types. Unarmed only has one perk card called *Iron Fist*. So there is no other cards to pick. If you are going melee/unarmed you should consider going max str as str increases your melee/unarmed damage.
---
I never commit to a fully melee character but I always have a blast dabbling. I have enough mojo to run around Uranium Fever with an anti-armor power fist and blast those mole miners in the face pretty good. And nothing is more fun to me than Marsupial jumping and timing a perfect flying punch on unsuspecting Scorched and Super Mutants.
---
It‚Äôs my favorite part of the game. I guess it‚Äôs good for you that you don‚Äôt really NEED to build anything great. When I‚Äôm in ‚Äúspeculating‚Äù mode or learning plans with a new character I just use other player camps for the workshops, bed, decontamination showers, etc.
---
Yeah, evidence suggests it‚Äôs a possibility. But there‚Äôs no evidence that solidly confirms it‚Äôs a split-off. Although I might not be able to enjoy the new content unless I make a new Microsoft account anyway, because guess what? I was suspended six days ago and still no word from them about wether it‚Äôs gonna be permanent or temporary.
---
Antiarmor is good all-around.
---
your info is behind
---
they removed the damage reduction legendary perks for non-power armor's (along with a few others)
---
what rads is good for full hp build's, and rad resist of that perk is near **USELESS.** it is a ok utility card at best.  PA has a 90% rad reduction BEFORE the resist stat, chinese stealth suit and rad suit both have a 99% reduction prior to resist stat.  meaning PA/suit's are still better for nuke zones.  hell it makes PA even better in nuke zone's for full hp
---
if you check the thread's in that link, most of the complaint's that are not coin related are all related to better PA legendary perks
---
here is where to keep track of the changes they are making for legendary perks (test forums are currently public) [https://bethesda.net/community/category/311/fallout-76-pts?language%5B%5D=en](https://bethesda.net/community/category/311/fallout-76-pts?language%5B%5D=en)
---
Sorry is a must.Had multiple times where I killed 3 star legendaries in one shot by accident (muscle memory whenever i see a enemy) and no way to apologise.
---
My day gets ruined whenever I pull such crap
---
There's daily quest. Grinding though is pretty much the endgame. Grind for treasury notes, so you that you can grind for gold, so that you can grind for script, so that you can grind for legendary modules, so that you can grind for legendary weapons and armor lol
---
Ok, so for shotgun. There‚Äôs shotgun, expert, and master. 3 different cards. So instead of having all 3 of them maxed out. I should have 12 cards of 1?
---
There is a easier way... Make sure your scrap box is the last container you look at, the initiate trade with one of the robot vendors. On the robot's side, at the bottom, will be the total weight of all your scrap box items. You can verify by looking at your stash box instead, and the numbers will match.
---
If your innocent. Why did they ban you. What did u do?
---
I have seen some really creative camps I would have liked to be able to tell the builder they did an amazing job on.
---
What about dismantling them for scrap ? Or is that more of a waste ?
---
The only downside is that it will drain your AP fast. If you‚Äôre not reliant on. VATS it‚Äôs a must-have for defense.
---
Try to find an RP discord server
---
 Check your ammo too, I kept hoarding missiles and mini-nukes and honestly they weigh so much it‚Äôs stupid to do so. Same goes for fusion and plasma cores. Scrap any weapons and armour you‚Äôre not using as well and check your perks. Some perks help with junk weight, travelling pharmacy is a godsend.
---
Lake Eloise has tons of cobalt, bloodleaf along riverbanks, but fewer mobs to kill for other materials.
---
This for like the slugger  expert slugger and master slugger. Each card give a total of 20 damage. This first star is 10% and the 2nd and 3rd are 5% each. So if you are only going to have 3*, it is better to get all 3 and keep em at 1* each.
---
at low levels, you'll have less caps - at least I know I did. As soon as I hit 50 and started beefing up my build, caps become no problem.
---
You will quickly have more legendaries than you can sell or trade with NPCs per day. So you'll end up selling those at your player vendor shop. Selling things is the key to making money fast.
---
Besides that, at high levels you'll be getting better weapons which are worth more to sell at NPC vendors. You can get about 1500 caps a day from them. Also, joining public teams will help as you'll get some (albeit a small amount) of caps whenever a team mate completes a quest.
---
EDIT: You'll probably also have a treasure trove of stimpacks or radaway or water etc down the line. These types of things can be sold for pretty good money as well - both to NPCs and in your player vendor. Really no need to hoard 300 stimpacks after all lol
---
My camp is a literal walled fortress with a settlement inside and I'm really happy with it
---
You can't have 12 cards rank 1. If you try to equip Shotgunner rank 1 and Shotgunner rank 2 at the same time, the rank 1 will just be replaced.
---
you cannot equip more than one card of the same name at the same time, regardless of the star rank.  Having a 1 star gladiator and a 2 star gladiator will give you more flexibility in case you need to put on strong back, but having three 1 star of the same card is not helping you at all.
---
I honestly believe we are just seeing the foundations of this game becoming amazing. It started too soon and too rough and unfinished, but it has massive room to grow!
---
i put on my robe and wizard hat
---
The perk is called Hard Bargain and it helps out a lot, also get Travel Agent, helps with the travel costs.
---
Those civilized radroaches with their door opening skills. I am pretty sure they have a culture with arts, meaningful conversations and wine tasting events.
---
Synths are not alive, they are merely programmed to mimic human behaviour.
---
Build an awsome camp, give yourself a goal to get some specific rare item or something and work towards it. The thing that has kept me in the game for over 1k hours is to make new characters with different interesting builds. Its fun when you have several different playstyles to choose from. Makes the grind not feel like a grind.
---
If you only have 3 perk points left on lets say str, you then should use shotgunner rank 1, expert shotgunner rank 1 and master shotgunner rank 1, as the first rank increases the damage by 10% and rank 2 an 3 only 5% each. But if you have 9 points left then ofc go for max rank for each 3 cards.
---
If bgs bans a few, they just come right back with a vengeance.  They need an actual system to deal with them quickly.  As in, an human being being paid specifically to deal with it, and to actually care at all about reports, or a method of accepting videos/screenshots as evidence and actually acting upon it.  Currently, I have no reason to believe reports ever acheive anything at all other than fill your own email inbox.   I play vs the same cheaters damn near every day.  Dirtyolebear for example never misses a single bullet and always spawns at Grafton Dam area.  So if you see him in your lobby, act accordingly.  There are many others that will also never get banned.
---
I saw a firefly do that!
---
Felt bad because I shot it for bioluminescent fluid before I clocked it was just on its way home.
---
Yes! Put the kinetic dynamo on the chest piece and you have 30% less damage for full health instead of emergency protocols which is 50% less damage at 20% health
---
We already know that every game developer can legally do anything but break in your house and take your computer if they say you cheated on their game. It's the time invested and then lost that pisses people off.
---
Alright,  that sounds good.
---
Unrelated question:  what is the end game in 76?
---
And just to add to this in case anyone tries to bring this up the Legendary Perks for increasing Fire and Poison Resistance were change to also affect Power Armor users.
---
Couldn't agree more.
---
If you're on PC I'm in...
---
There are only 3 Shotgun damage perk cards, that should simplify things for you! You can‚Äôt use the same card twice in a build. Get the first level of all three first. If you want to add a star to those cards just know you get 5% boosts instead of the initial 10% you got with the first card.
---
I am usually the only person at scorched earth not using PA or there's maybe 1 or 2 others but the vast majority uses PA. Not doing a very good job of discouraging people are they.
---
You can still gain mutations by drinking serums with starched genes active, you just can't lose them. That advice you got was wrong.

Unfortunately we don‚Äôt know what all is covered by exploits and this ban wave.  Once you get to possession or vendor purchasing of duped weapons, things get really grey, especially when the punishment seems to be account wiping.  Unless you personally found it and held onto it for a year +, one can assume a good legacy has been a product of duping at some point.  
---
Sure, dupers are a problem, but until Bethesda starts hardware bans, they aren‚Äôt serious about duping.  In that regard, if you‚Äôre not serious, don‚Äôt go wiping out people‚Äôs accounts until you are, simply because you MIGHT be wrong.  It‚Äôs just poor customer service, when you really aren‚Äôt doing much about the problem.
---
No, I haven‚Äôt been banned or suspended.
---
Rp is gay, don't taint the name of fallout with rping heresy
---
Bro literally this thing one shots me lol. I've seen the tankiest power armor builds go down in seconds to this thing lol. But shoot the thing if ya want loot
---
I usually sell weapons until I‚Äôve made around 1000 caps then start scrapping but that‚Äôs just me. You could scrap half and sell half  it just depends on wether you need the scrap or the caps more, like if I‚Äôm low on steel I scrap and if I‚Äôm low on caps I sell. Also equip the scrapper perk so you‚Äôll get more resources from scrapping and be able to sell more weapons and armor
---
You can play around with this perk builder thingy to see how it works  [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks)
---
If you‚Äôre not going to use them, collect and sell all chems you find. They don‚Äôt go for loads but they make up for that in abundance
---
I've had this happen too, kinda annoying.
---
It really depends on the situation. If you're trying to farm caps, sell the weapons directly. If you're trying to learn mods or get steel, scrap the weapons. You can sell bulk scrap, but generally speaking you're going to get more profit selling the weapons.
---
Also, super mutants are probably the best source of caps.
---
Edit: Don't forget about collecting meat. Cooked meat provide a decent chunk of change for the weight.
---
Lmao. It‚Äôs an rpg
---
Sounds good, thanks for the tips!
---
Yes I corrected my typo but I also clearly said that it was a typo of do instead of so. 
---
You lose.
---
I just wish we had more camp budget.
---
Stash got an expansion from 400 to 600 then to 800.
---
Fallout 1st got an infinate scrapbox for raw materals.
---
They keep adding more and more stuff to the atomic shop.
---
But the camp budget has been the same ever since beta. 
---
Its time Bethesda.
---
This game has so many issues and it annoys and frustrates me to no end, but I can't seem to stop playing so they must be doing something right.
---
I did it once this weekend by myself, just to see what kind of xp it gave.  I maxed out at 4000 xp for the event and probably another 3K off the bot swarm, but I didn‚Äôt let the Impostor survive any longer than necessary.
---
I think SBQ is much more popular because it‚Äôs low risk/high reward.  Encryptid requires at least one person to do something other than empty their magazine.
---
Still waiting for power armor stands also. Whole thing is crazy considering they sell skins, paints, and outfits.
---
wow how did you get that, looks amazing
---
I have 4 alt mules and 3 of them have camps that took an hour or so to make. I don't play them. They literally sit there overencucumbered. The 4th alt isn't 50 yet but they'll get the same
---
So it could be the fireflies that create the new world order. I always thought it would be the radroaches.
---
I traded for a bloodied double barrel, and it consistently kills everything in VATS.
---
No to the thread title, yes to the first line of the post. 
---
Side with whoever, still build up rep with both after.
---
Provided you have done BOTH sides up to the point of no return, you're fine.
---
I went with the Raiders because it was great AND I got a free plasma rifle from Ra Ra.
---
It's maddening to hear a magazine or bobble head, then spend 5+ minutes searching for it. Also, if you or someone else has used explosives nearby, it could get stuck somewhere unreachable.
---
YES! Let's all start using exploits and get banned together &lt;3 Wonderful idea!
---
The winnebago aka wendigo lol. Was always fascinated from the stories I've read on them and ofc, the video game Until Dawn.
---
Next one is a clear shot of her crop dusting üòÇ
---
Are you seriously suggesting players should use a glitch/exploit after we just had a massive ban wave?
---
Am I missing something?
---
PA gets you easy over the useful 400DR threshold, plus the flat 50% damage reduction from emergency protocols is very good.
---
What rads? is not non-pa exclusive from what I can tell, and with any PA would get you to 1000+ RadRes, which means &lt;1 RAD in a nuke zone, equivalent to wearing chinese stealth or hazmat suit ...
---
PA is still the lazyman way to go for ultimate survival. Will probably never match a full set of legendary armor, but survivability is good, you don't have to waste perk points on defense, can focus more on damage and utility ...
---
I look at it the other way, Non-PA exclusive perks are there so you can catch up with the defences PA provides for free.
---
Camp building is true end game. /s (but no really, camp building)
---
I would say running events to get legendary weapons is end game. You'll want to be getting as many scrips (legendary weapon trade in currency), gold bullion, and caps per day. The legendary weapon grind is mainly because you'll want a very specific type of weapon that fits your build.
---
With the Legendary Run, doing daily and weekly challenges award your SCORE, which is cool. Make sure to claim your rewards as you'll get a lot of free rewards that would usually cost real money.
---
End game content is a bit lacking imo, and I think many others agree. But it's a sandbox game at heart. You can really do whatever you want. Some people grind currency. Others grind for that specific weapon. Some want to be a player vendor for other players. Some want to make the best camps. Some want to perfect their character builds. There's a lot to work towards and it's a lot of fun if you get in to it!
---
Of course, completing all quests can take a while too, and that's good fun.
---
It's useful to a heavy gunner build though...you can use Stabilized which not only increases hip fire with heavies but can ignore up to 75% of armor. Honestly, I used to hate PA and think it was useless too until I built a character strictly for heavy gun use. The choose is clear then, sure the clunkyness gets old but having every weapon be better than anti-armor, a crazy small hip fire spot, along with it kinda making sense that those huge guns go best with PA made me a fan of it. If you are a rifleman then yes I agree 100% but for heavy guns it really is nice.
---
Check out Angry Turtle‚Äôs video on YouTube about magic shotguns. There are certain legendary effects that make shotgun damage in VATS 3 or 4 times higher than it should be. Junkies is one of them. Another is ‚Äòreduce damage by 15% while blocking‚Äô on armor.
---
The only thing I do differently is that I keep one more point in charisma so I can keep travel agent and run one less rank in demolition expert.. I'm cheap
---
definitely, I'm at the same point. Especially with the player reliant nuclear winter challenges. I usually can get a kill or two every other match at least but when I need it for the challenge I cant seem to get a kill to save my life.
---
Thank you. So does that mean If I get max friendship with the raiders but side with the settlers I can still trade Gold Bullion with the Raiders?
---
And Tactics. Literally the original basis staged by Black Isle in the founding titles.
---
EDIT: Wait, and Fallout 4. And I thought 3 as well? Was there something better than Power Armor?
---
Yeah. Because those players that need to be Uber tend to leave games
---
Good unyielding and vanguard are top primaries.  There‚Äôs definitely a market for auto stim, chameleon, bolstering, and life saving with good mods.  Auto and LS tend to be 1-offs not full sets for obvious reasons. Tho I personally run dual LS.
---
AP regen is top secondary though RR, PR, agi and str have their place.
---
Tertiary are pretty obvious id say.
---
I dont think it was ever good for you pc folk
---
Yes I‚Äôd love to have an industrial ammo empire but no this a silly idea.
---
I didn‚Äôt lose anything lol, we are arguing over the internet not playing poker and I lost a hand, calm down buddy.
---
At least you were able to get the Commander.  When I go to the bunker and retrieve the stuff she keeps saying
---
"This place is really doing a number on my back"
---
And she won't leave....
---
The old, I don‚Äôt know about you line. When will people like you stop copying how to respond to people? Seriously it‚Äôs the same bs over and over.
---
I believe if your lvl 45 today your on target, double score weekend should put you ahead of where you need to be.
---
Crazy grinding got me to 52
---
No one turned up for radiation rumble last night except one other person.
---
I waited until the last 5 seconds before starting and was just content to hold my side of the room killing ghouls while the other person did the same...unfortunately they sort of sucked at it (despite being level 173 me being level 79 on this character) so I had to constantly run between both sides shotgunning everything...I didn‚Äôt even have time to try and cripple their legs it was so hectic (just one shotting all them instead).
---
Eventually a few slipped through more than once and killed a scavenger but then other people finally showed up and the event went off Fine after that...with me collecting ore anyway.
---
I like to half fill up the ore container with a couple of minutes to go so I can fight some deathclaws, floaters, and snallygasters...they deathclaw meat
---
Same! Working on it right now but am now wondering if I should have just grinded more xp instead
---
Aka...no more ammo, but it‚Äôs 2xp and needs to keep grinding üòÇ
---
‚ÄúGodspeed you beautiful souls‚Äù
---
Beckett likes to keep it casual. Bathrobe and a visor
---
At least sometimes I've only found bobbleheads because explosions knocked them right out into the open haha.
---
I can officially say today I'm burnt out. But this usually happens after a double XP weekend as I grind hard. I am around rank 67 or so. I'll be pacing it normally now with doing the dailies and weeklies as normal.
---
The dailies and weeklies don't bother me. I've been doing them since beta for atoms.they usually take me no time at all. I do the weeklies in a single day most of the time. But after this weekend (and steam messing up my 1st subscription) I'm a bit burnt. I'll ease up and watch some Netflix.
---
It's one of those things ig
---
Or ran out of bullets üòâ
---
Ok great thanks. I was getting worried about this and you solved it ,Thanks again:)
---
Imgur must be shrinking on mobile or something, because it's too pixelated for me to see any details either.
---
Wrong sub, might i suggest r/fnv
---
I have 50k steel on my new character simply because I haven‚Äôt had to craft any ammo.
---
(Shotgun character, people usually have plenty of shells to sell).
---
It‚Äôs just from scrapping weapons after events
---
Scrap your chassis boys, time to free up some weight.
---
I think it's fine. I enjoy this game's perk cards honestly. It has a lot of flexibility for builds.
---
I get what you're saying, but if we could put every card in a stat, it would be too OP. We could put all the best perks in to one stat - game is easy enough as is with the correct builds.
---
The only annoying thing are the "passive" perks. You have to swap in perks while crafting etc and then swap them back out for the combat/adventuring perks. This should be alleviated a bit once the perk load outs come out tho. You can make different load outs for different situations.
---
That is a great idea about selling extra stuff in my player vendor.
---
What are lucrative items people are always looking for ?
---
Cooked food? Beverages or more so stim packs and other healing items ?
---
Also:
---
Is my camp always there when I'm offline ? So will players be able to visit when I'm offline for the day or night ? Or is it only in game when im online?
---
Yeah I‚Äôd prefer to see them stay in the game because they‚Äôre cool in theory they just need balancing
---
I am very proud of my camp. Add me Cramercy
---
ignore them people they are silly. There are some rare plans in the game that fetch silly caps though.
---
Capture and defend workshops (or let them be captured and retake). you get loot, plans, caps and xp. 
---
Also you can run the athletics course at sunnytop ski lanes for easy xp, caps and loot. It takes about a minute to run the course. I think it was 50 caps a run. Plus the aid you get can be sold. 
---
Pick up everything and sell it. Even a flower goes for 1 cap. Sell ammo in your vendor. People usually do 1 cap per round. Don't bother selling nukes or missiles.
---
Yeah the Mothman is also in my opinion the coolest urban legend there is. He's very mysterious
---
So the winterized t51 now is the best armor in fallout 3 even then reilys ranger combat armor is very good and synergies with perks keep in mid operation anchorage didnt come out for almost 2 years.
---
Fallout new vegas the dusters, riot gear, and even joshua grahms outfits literally had anywhere from 18 Dr to 28 so it easily out classed the armors especially when you add in perks lie light touch and others
---
Fallout 4 literally has sentinel armor in it
---
I thought about doing that too.  I like the idea of a protected compound.
---
I remember back when the game first come out, the thing to farm and sell was mothman eggs. Cook them up and grab a few hundred caps from the vendor bots.
---
I have always wondered this Todd hate and what people think of Jeff Gardiner, Emil Pagliarulo and Chris Cummings.
---
You just need enough faith in yourself! Anything is possible.
---
How does one shotting enemies get players to put more items in the troughs at Project Paradise? How does one shotting enemies get players to take the pylons at Encrypted? How does one shotting enemies get players to notice NPCs getting killed at Radiation Rumble?
---
One shotting enemies doesn't do shit to get other players to pay attention to event objectives. Like I said, I could care less if other people share. I don't switch to a weaker gun or hold off on killing anything for anyone. Yet I still encounter the same douches that come to events with the single purpose of mindlessly killing without any regard for event goals. Even to the point that they are shooting themselves in the foot, cutting events short by failing the most basic sections.
---
Actual savage Shialabot
---
If ur ahead of Zorbo, ur A-Okay
---
Here's my tip for you as a new player go here and plan out a build it will save you a headache later on: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
Also remember you don't have to pick a Perk Card associated with the Special stat you increased when you Level up you can for example Increase your Strength but pick a Luck Perk Card.
---
Ya that‚Äôs mostly what I‚Äôm talking about. It‚Äôs annoying to have to put lock picking perks and crafting perks back on and off all the time
---
Good review on Air B&amp;B, that‚Äôs so legit! maybe there should be a way to review camps. Oh I forgot, trolls exist...guess not üòÇ
---
They are quite the intelligent critters
---
Mine is named Trash Bucket
---
I already have my dream camp :L
---
I‚Äôm still rolling/crafting for a complete SS armor set but use heavy combat otherwise. For prefix, I use 4 unyielding with 1 chameleon, major modifier I use AP refresh, and minor I use 2 50% reduced fall damage and any weight reduction. Many also like sentinel as a minor. 
---
FYI, I‚Äôm a bloodied/sneak/commando build
---
First time the Insult Bot 'insulted' me it told me to off myself then preceded to say 'Boom, roasted' couldn't help but laugh my ass off.
---
Happened at Camp Venture. Very hilarious experience.
---
Great idea about the Ammo! Thank you.
---
I have my vendor on my 2nd floor of my camp. It just seemed fitting at the time. I should change that and put it at the main entrance
---
Alright. So still better for nuke zones. And still useless everywhere else.
---
Not just a reset timing issue. I logged out around 9PM yesterday and just logged back in about 530PM today. Typical start and stop times for me. Daily have all completed, no score, no way to make it up, just screwed. 
---
Bethesda needs to fix it either way. Bad enough this is designed as a grind, now they are screwing players out of score ensuring you have to spend rwm if you want to complete the board. Dont know what's happening over at BGS but it is evident that they just dont care anymore
---
Power armor breaks really slowly so its very resource effective. And with emergency protocols you get 50% damage reduction while at 20% or less HP on top of the 40% reduction you get from PA. I have not found anything that makes you as or more tanky than that without taking up a big chunk of your perk loadout. Not saying PA is The best but its definately not useless
---
Yeah their breathing sound is scary too if you've ever heard it.
---
&gt;If the perk procs...
---
I'm a noob reading these tips.  Can you tell me what 'procs' means?
---
I'd say mostly.
---
Their glow looks like Nuka Cola Quantum ngl
---
Also at level 43. Been trying to grind as much as possible, but I have had to skip a couple of days. 
---
It‚Äôs honestly not as bad as I thought it would be, but I am approaching burnout status. Although, there were a few days where I just did my own thing, and ended up completing the dailies without specifically working towards them.
---
I‚Äôm at level 50
---
The haks are more probable on pc and Xbox but they don‚Äôt seem to be that common.
---
YES! I F#@KING LOVED THAT GAME!
---
Just remember that if you care about Achievements/Trophies you will need to create a 2nd character go through the story again and side with the faction you didn't side with before.
---
Same
---
Although my biggest pet peev is people not closing my doors.
---
Me too. Specially new guys. It really makes me happy when they want me to pose for a pic or take one with me. I usually throw 50 stims at em when the newbies come.
---
Cool!
---
Depends on your build. If you are a heavy weapons build who stays in power armor all the time, then yes you absolutely should get it.  I can't see any reason not to.  And the damage resistance is noticeably better, I don't care what anyone says.
---
Yes, I have seen the goddamn youtube video where a guy demonstrates how you only take three less damage per hit in T65.     He demonstrates that you take something like three 3 less damage- from a single bullet.  In actual combat encounters you aren't getting hit  with 1 bullet at a time from a single enemy. If you are getting attacked by 10 enemies at once with automatic weapons then three extra damage per hit starts to add up pretty quick and makes a big difference.
---
But not the ranged 30% damage reduction? I'll trade ya.
---
I have no problem handling it with my handmade, without creating a mess of noise and chaos for everybody around me.
---
Terrifying. Especially when you can hear them shifting around before they start to run &amp; dive at you! Probably one of the better developed enemies imho.
---
When it first appears, I give it s quick tag and then become a conduit still get the loot.
---
Honey beast are the cutest thing ever. And that huge thing mutated from a bee. Awesome effort in evolution.
---
Literally RP is in the name of the style of gaming.
---
Same for the armor. I had the thought of giving those weaker sets perhaps a set bonus or so to kind of make them more viable.
---
But another issue is that a lot of places have randomized spawns so a lot of the time you don't even know what you'd need.
---
I bring Molotovs to SBQ, all my characters have them. My demolition build takes about 10-15 of them to get minimum damage needed. Others, take 25-30. I bring a heavy weapon while the queen is in flight. When and if she lands, I spam Molotovs. Also tags her spawns for XP.
---
I've been on Reddit for quite a while and I have to say that this is my favorite post. The same you do. And I usually have my headphones on but my mic off and turn on my area listening. I had a man who was obviously probably intoxicated behind his Avatar... But he was like woo wee... this camp is like Disneyland I'm going to stay here for a while I don't ever want to leave. He had a Merry Old Time walking around my property looking at everything playing with everything... Crafting at every bench he was there for well over an hour. I would try to get in his way occasionally to see if he would say anything... While I was wearing that big scribble head. He said "holy s*** that b**** looks just like my ex-wife!" Then continue to work on stuff. He had no idea I was listening to him but I was cracking up the entire time! He finally mentions out loud to himself... that he must head on to his friends and go help with quest. Mind you this was an hour later.
---
Ah. Well, shit. Not much to do then besides grind out events/dailies for scrip, rep and legendary run üòï
---
RIGHT NOW you don't have to choose. At all. The system at the moment is ALREADY "give me everything"
---
I dont have to choose if I want to be able to craft more ammo, or regain AP faster, because as it stands you just equip the ammo card, make the ammo, and unequip it afterwards.
---
There is no difficult decision to decide between AP regain, and ammo crafting, as you can literally have them both right now.
---
As it stands right now, the only barriers to this are people self enforcing hard mode ("I will not swap perks!") and lazy/casual ("I cant be bothered to swap perks")
---
As for solutions/better designs, sure here's three:
---
-If the current system lets you just swap in ammo smith whenever you're crafting ammo anyway, why not just skip the slightly tedious card swapping and make these perks always active? Unless they're playing hardmode or ultra casual, noone is running around with ammo smith equipped all the time. Skip the middleman and make it so that if you own the card, it kicks in when you make ammo.
---
-Lock in perks so they cant be freely swapped around. Either permantly, or a reset for caps etc. This way you would have to choose if you wanted more ammo when crafting, or better AP regain while exploring. It would open up specialisations for trading - characters would be able to craft things others cant.
---
-Give the passive perks an active bonus. At the moment, gunsmith allows you to craft certain guns/mods AND it makes your guns break slower while its equipped. So this is a good example of a card that provides crafting as well as having a good reason to keep it permanently equipped. Same with White Knight (armour breaks slower, cheaper to repair). However there are some cards that are very situational, and currently have no reason to be kept active - the science cards, ammo smith, hacker, lock pick, super duper, construction, happy camper, hard bargain, armourer etc. Give these cards a reason to be kept as part of the active deck.
---
Idk wern't most of the dupers banned playing on console? Maybe we don't want you infecting us with your cancer 13 year olds
---
Congratz on a oct baby.
---
2nd floor is fine. As long as it's not hidden or hard to find. people don't like that (i'm not fussed)
---
They‚Äôre going to address most of the general feedback the game has gotten this year. - Instanced CAMPs, Legendary Perks, Perk Loadouts, Dungeons, new regions through expeditions, return of the BOS. That, in my opinion is when the game will be ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù as a Fallout game.
---
Would be amazing to see what they‚Äôre cooking up for next year - hopefully town building!
---
Wait what?! You found the EndGame?
---
Yeah with armor I wish they could change some of the effects from primary to secondary and secondary to primary. For example I wish that weightless was not a primary stat, because you have to have 5 whole pieces and a mutation together to be on the same level as chameleon.
---
Heh
---
Oh it‚Äôll be the roaches. The fireflies would rebuild the world but they keep getting eaten by toads.
---
I'm rank 86 atm. We are heading into the end of week 3. Double score weekend coming up so I'm not grinding anymore XP. Just going to do the D/W till I finish.
---
I hear you about being burnt out. I grinded 51 levels over the weekend and it wasn't as much fun as it used to be when double XP weekends first came out.
---
Then it was just you setting your own pace. Now we have a metric to gauge where we are and you feel pushed to grind to get ahead from fear you may have a day off or loose a day to RL and can't afford that.
---
Robot game vendor holds 1400 a day. Sell anything you can to max that. I sell through cooked meat first and move to chems I don't use. Grenades as well. Purified water too.
---
team aries.
---
I trade some godly gat laser that was legacy (A high lvl explained to me what that was) for a bloody handmade and instigating explosive pump actually and its soo good with my bloody build
---
I've never created a 2nd character... Am I reading this correctly? Is it an account wide stash for all characters?
---
(and I want eugenie hat with the torch)
---
No, 2nd floor jist has sleeping quarters (4 beds) and thought a vending machine fit up there. But its empty because I'm not 100% sure how it worked. 
---
Also food items.
---
I have a shit ton of spoiled food.
---
Is spoiled food garbage or good for anything?
---
Does it still spoil if I cook it ?
---
I mean could I cook items and throw it in the vending machine to sell ?
---
Good, because I have made some deals with those wise radroaches(at least I think so).
---
Also, check you MISC tab on player and stash for gun powder.
---
Wow, I wouldn't have imagined of combining both. I'll def give that a shot!
---
Progress on this game just seems so messed up
---
Noted. Thanks for the tips
---
Agreed, I do nukes daily and I see far more power armor users than not. The idea that its bad holds no weight. Maybe, like most things Bethesda does that seem to be thought out in a bubble this holds some water, and even then only to the meta optimiz every stat number crowd, but that is an extremely small percentage of the player base and I personally miss pa from time to time as a nonpa user. 
---
examples:
---
Heavy guns perks, built in immunity to falling damage, water breathing, looking and feeling cool as fuck.
---
Not all legendary mods are supposed to be equivalent. Those mods are simply worse that other mods. That said, Junkie's and Bloodied are not necessarily good comparisons since those both have significant tradeoffs. A more direct comparison is Instigating, which is definitely better than enemy specific damage buffs in almost every situation.
---
I think they should increase those buffs to 50%.
---
Agreed, want that change the name too. I know it doesn‚Äôt appear to other people, but it would be nice for me. Hope they change this!
---
thats what i went to do
---
Dont forgot the toilet wookie!
---
Depends on the player, the build, and what they enjoy doing. For PVE, Unyielding, Vanguard and to a lesser extent Bolstering are the most popular primaries. For PVP, a lot of people go for Assassin's, but Unyielding and Vanguard are popular as well (depending on the other perks)
---
As for secondary effects, AP refresh is hands down the most popular, but there's some demand for +1 STR, AGI, and PER depending on the build. Some people with bloodied builds also like 1 or 2 pieces of poison resist because mirelurk poison attacks are about the only thing that can catch you off guard and kill you.
---
Minor effects are highly situational and kind of depend on the other perks and the build. Snipers and stealth commandos like sentinel because of the buff while not moving and/or harder to detect so they can fire off more sneak crits. Melee people like Cavalier so they take less damage while rushing into the fray. Personally I like rocking 2 pieces of fall damage because then I don't have to waste perk points on goat legs or worry about timing my jetpack landing in order to avoid death. Lastly, there's a bit of demand for weapon or ammo weight reduction.
---
No one really seems to care about the lock picking, water breathing, or extra durability, but if the first 2 effects are awesome people will definitely buy them as stepping stones until they find the perfect roll. For example, I rocked an unyielding/AP refresh/lockpicking combat leg for months until I finally found one with sentinel instead.
---
The lasers really add to it
---
Could you explain what you mean by this? Why would I reinstall my OS for this game?
---
I have a theory that they put NW challenges in there hoping that people wouldn't do them and therefore be forced to buy atoms.
---
PA was supposed to redefine warfare. It was meant to replace tanks. Pipe pistol using scorched would disagree.
---
I really hate that they keep giving PA advantages to normal armor: such as carry weight and the jetpack.
---
Aries all the way babyyyyyy
---
If only Appalachia was home to a massive weather control device. \*shrug\* Oh well, I guess we'll never see anything like this.
---
They are pretty adorable with their big eyes, The bee swarms are annoying as heck though
---
The old, when will people like you line. Seriously, it‚Äôs the same bs over and over, just like Bethesda‚Äôs unfixed issues.
---
You too‚úåÔ∏è
---
this is why you should mostly ignore reviews. A lot of the bad reviews were from people who didn't give the game a chance and/or played an hour and some were from people who didn't even play the game (literally.. didn't play it or own it and said as much)
---
Combat shotgun is better tbh
---
But just think, once you get the magazine out you can feast upon the lambs and sloths and carp and anchovies and orangutans and breakfast cereals and fruit bats ...
---
And then their sonic wave screech. Quite the Cryptid
---
I basically avoided launching my first nuke because of stories like this. It wasn‚Äôt until FO1 private servers came out that I made my first attempts before finally finishing it.
---
I moved my alt's camp recently. My blueprinted buildings couldn't be placed. I spent hours building them.
---
Oooh, I'll have to get those perks I think but that'll be very useful. Sounds like a pretty good investment!
---
Oooh, film making sounds fun.  I'll check it out later.
---
I'm still looking into ways of measuring my GPU temp while running the game (I have msi afterburner but it doesn't seem to be an option there). The crashes seem completely random, and I can't play for more than an hour without it happening.
---
Could you share what ini tweaks you have done? I've looked into the files but not changed anything yet myself, and the in game display settings are limited.
---
Im not a big lore person, but i think a cool idea would be to see what the problems were in neighbouring states that caused them (Raiders/Settlers) to return. Maybe after both sides have much more comforting control. It would be cool to work with even the brotherhood to repair some Vertibirds to provide out of appalachia travel.
---
I haven't found anyone who RPs my way but I usually do small things. I'll dress up in a mechanics outfit and go fix the saw mill at foundation. I also wrote up that my main character is a convoyer who helps people travel through the great divide. Mainly solo rp writing and screenshots for me.
---
I just started so I‚Äôm around lower levels (lvl30) I love this game and it‚Äôs even better when I join a team and go check out someone else camp. Honestly I turn other bases into my main for a session and some people make the craziest bases.
---
I always spawn in the same place and always get the same crates, 100%.  Only the contents ever change.  Maybe some appear randomly and some are fixed?
---
spoiled food can be made into fertilizer via the chem bench. 
---
No point cooking food and trying to sell it. It'll probably spoil before it sells.
---
Dump the spoiled stuff as it's weight (unless you want fertilizer)
---
Can confirm - I ended up with this effect on my SS armour. If I wear PA, a normal shotgun takes multiple shells to bring down a max super mutant. If I wear the SS, a normal shotgun will OHK a legendary max super mutant.
---
Short answer, not really. Maybe after you buy everything else you want. 
---
Long answer, it's a pointless side grade with no special abilities, interesting lore, or game history. Its basically a place holder set that appears to have been abandoned by the atomic shop. Most likely it will be made obsolete by the BOS returning. Its lacking basic things like the extra bright lamps other power armors can sport. It's not bad, but outside of higher numbers, it doesn't seem to have in game protection that is more impressive than existing power armors. It was also added at the same time as the best non powered armor set the game will ever see, which really makes how unimpressive it is stand out. 
---
One plus is, if you have all the other items you want, it gives you something to spend gold on. It just takes quite a bit of time. 
---
I actually have a set, but it was more for completing the collection, than need. After I buy some of the other items I'll pick up strangler heart. Just for kicks.
---
I was playing with a group of low level randoms a while back and taught them the way of the bush wookie. They were all very good learners and we ended up winning the match. It was beautiful.
---
It is among the least interesting things for sale for Gold Bullion. I would definitely go with any weapons you want or SS armor first.
---
No. It's just as good as T-51 thanks to diminishing returns. That is except for rad resistance, although I've never had an issue with it on T-51 because I run around with more radaway than any sane person would.
---
Yeah if onlyyyyyyy lol
---
Ahh thats logic people dont actual know who made this game
---
No, camp building is my favorite part of the game.
---
Does anyone know how much the full set is?
---
At any level, doesn't matter how high a level you are they remain a threat
---
I'd love them to start by actually using the character name instead of only using your account name. As it stands, there is not particular reason to even give your characters interesting names. You might as well just name them "rifleman" and "heavy weapons guy".
---
I don't eat *every* corpse I come across.
---
That dude was in 3 games I was this morning...and had that gun all 3 times I spectated him.  Interesting, i just assumed there were static spawns or something
---
I'm at 43, will probably burn some of these 150 atom rewards towards the end to get the Ghillie SS or one of the Space Cadet rewards if I'm close enough and be done. We'll see what happens after double score. I can say that the building teams really helped going from 30-43.
---
Thanks for your input. I really don't think it's a heat issue for me, I'm going to check my GPU temperature and try running the game to see if it is getting out of hand, but there's no real increase in the load before the crash for me.
---
Is the crash the same for you? Does your laptop stay powered on, but with a black screen and a repeated sound?
---
If you get to 45 by today you will be good, you could also grind other ranks too. Don't get mad or sad if you don't go past Zorbo, if you pass him good, if you don't then also good. He is just a marker for the days the legendary run has been going on. He should be at rank 100 once we are at week 10.
---
Ive got a PS4 that I put a SSD in last month and ive been loading slightly faster then my squdmates.
---
Megasloth, because it's cute.
---
&gt;The fact that legacy weapons are a finite and hoarded commodity
---
Not after that massive dupe wave. The reason you're seeeing so many people offering mediocre shit for legacies is because there were thousands of them duped, so they're nowhere near as rare as they used to be and people are just throwing out offers hoping to get lucky.
---
They should have been +100% dmg on that one mob type to make them work/worth using.  Really there just need to be more perks for full health builds/mutations.  Bloody + Adrenal + Unyielding is just too good with little down sides as there you can still be tanky with 10-19% health left.
---
In addition, I think it'd be cool if it gathered things used to make certain colas were included like razorgrain and mutfruit.
---
dunno i‚Äôm australian
---
That's why it's called future camp, they developed invisibility
---
I went from 41 to 47 I think. This was over 8-10 hours this weekend. Mostly me just dicking around since I haven't played in at least a year.
---
Yeah double damage would be really nice with it
---
Found someone AFKing standing in the open, what a saint big thanks to him.
---
Aside from that, the Camper has no proper collision on some of his walls for players and Decor.
---
And what triggers me the most is that it has no door and no snapping point for another door. 
---
I mean, how can I be a cozy camper when the Sheepsquatch can just walk straight through my non-existent door.
---
Thanks :)
---
best spot for lead and scrap
---
Thanks, will investigate that as well :)
---
Huzzah! Someone who hasn‚Äôt been wrongfully punished finally supports the wrongfully punished instead of straight up saying ‚Äúyou shouldn‚Äôt have duped then lol‚Äù.
---
That's just people being dicks and has nothing to do with the weapons. I could do the same thing with just a regular BFFR 50 cal, but I'm not an asshole so I run that event with either a tesla or a vampire explosive handmade that just tickles the bad guys and tags others with the explosive splash damage
---
It has a obsession to me iv seen it leave other players just to come yeet me and then to run to my spawn spot to do it again while other players are shooting at it invisible and not grabbing pylons
---
And they have a nice, easily accessible L3 terminal right inside the elevator door for hacking challenges.
---
I love visiting camps because as soon as i think I've made my camp as many ways as I possibly can, I find someone with a great idea that never even occurred to me. That's not even including the crazy builds like space ships, but just the ones that are houses.
---
No and you‚Äôre gonna need a friend you can trust to help or get fo1st subscription and put things in a random container that says 0/0 carry limit. Then switch characters fast and go back into your private server to pick em up
---
LMG anti armor and/or 50 cal. Explosive one is decent but the explosive damage does nothing against the queen. The other two are good but you could end not doing enough damage if players kill her too quickly.
---
That 50 is pretty much the best but "low level", the Vampire prefix makes it worth it imo, you can tank enemies with it. When crafting ammo make sure to use ammosmith for extra rounds.
---
Reddit is quite stupid
---
Fully wiped. Alleged duping but they couldn‚Äôt prove it... and I didn‚Äôt.
---
gee reddit is indeed quite dumb. " Use descriptive titles " Ill write the post in the tittle next time
---
The only thing I‚Äôd change about my camp is the location. I‚Äôve got it set up as a hunter‚Äôs lodge, I‚Äôve got my wall of mounted creatures set up behind my fireplace and a bedroom and small lab set up in side rooms. It‚Äôs up above the Palace of the Winding Path, mainly because I found a cool lake there, but I wish it was more accessible to low-level players. If anyone‚Äôs on PS4 and wants to come visit the Lodge, my door‚Äôs always open!
---
Same :)
---
Sadly, this doesn't appear to be an option. I submitted a ticket also and after a bit of back-and-forth, the response I got to the same questions was (quoting from my support ticket) "We are not aware of any current work arounds and due to tool limitations were unable to grant quest items or progress quests. "
---
+ INT for those stacking exp gains.
---
Mostly AP refresh, anything that reduces weight, sentinels.
---
This is exactly why i put fallout on my small SSD
---
I agree with the getting rid of NW challenges. Cheaters or not, i just dont want to play this mode, really dont like it.
---
It‚Äôs a tricky drop rate, best option is to buy from a player vendor or go to the market subs.
---
I was given the plan for free. Although it was part of the recent dupe, so paying 5-9k is kinda pointless.
---
If I understood the pieces better sure, but I spent two hours trying to make a specific structure, only to find the pieces don't work like that. I just don't have the patience, I guess.
---
Just out of interest are you on PC and do you happen to be on steam?
---
Ah gotcha. Thanks!
---
For every 2 steps forward non-PA users get we get 1. And it's usually something gimmicky. Basically all PA is at this point. A gimmick Bethesda entertains keeping around for marketing and just because it was a staple of the originals. But yep, now they have our gimmicks too.
---
Just the response I was looking for. Thanks
---
You seem to have the right idea.  You can only snap all of it together when not placing them on a foundation.  Building them out on the ground and blueprinting is the right idea.  Not sure why you can't place it though. This is exactly how I did mine. 
---
I did notice that after blueprinting mine, it wouldn't let me place it if I had *stored* all the pieces.  I actually had to re-scrap all the pieces first and then use the blueprint to build it all from scratch again.
---
They are cute until you realize they can spawn on building walls and jump down on you...
---
on Xbox I know I have spawned in, and gotten shot less than 1 second later.  So obviously that guy with armor and a gun loaded in way before I did.
---
Superb! I live taking pictures especially with the camera you get they just look so nice I barely have to edit them at all! Taking photos has got to be one of my favorite things to do
---
I doubt he's a duper. Lol. You see his trade posts? Nothing but a bunch of garbage he's trying to cash in for a god roll. Haha. Hes just salty he didn't have/get anything worthy of duping.
---
Super duper perk card as well when craftinng ammo.
---
It's a good spot for lead and other scrap, but the robots don't give hardly any xp at all.  Not worth it for killing things.
---
sorry started playing.  anyway all 4 archer perks maxed out so 12 in perception.  endurance I do chem fiend and either fire proof or iron clad maxed out (6).  Charisma party boy and loan wanderer maxed out (7).  intelligence = demolition expert ( may change this) maxed out and what ever is eft over the perk that helps stim pakcs (6).  AGI = maxed adrenaline ( currently broken) 2 in action boy/girl/ and maxed covert operative (10).  luck = maxed bloodied mess and 1 in starched genes ( for serums...4).  Strength I do any of a number of things but usually blocker maxed out (3).  My addictions are alcohol, psycobuff, mentas, calmex, daddyo, psyco buff, and calmex.all of these except menats and including over drive stack.  but use alcohol seperatly as well as mentas.  I am still working out my addictions and just got addicted to overdrive so I need to reset.  I try and run at least 3 pieces of AP refresh armor and i piece chameleon.  I never got the good armor yet but does not seem to matter.  I like the zealots and other stuff cause it's cheap...just get ap refresh, weapon weight reduced and chem weight reduced until you max out rep with the raiders then get the chem back pack. So I try and run full health with damage mitigation.  You should never pay over 20 caps for any drug unless of course you have to.  Learn the plans for the drugs. iif you are ps4 I am more than glad to help out with that.  Gave most my plans away but with a little planning I could craft up a bunch.  Orange mentas is good for vats and bows can be wonky.  Try going into vats first then pulling the bow..it helps.  try and get 33/25 bows and cross bows or at least limb damage.  The head counts as a limb.  I believe mr sand man works with bows and I some times add that in.  I hope this helps.  Again sorry for the late reply and I am more than happy to help you anyway that you need.  even if that is testing stuff.  I have plenty of points to move and have no problems switching back to my archer build.
---
I can remember when I started way back at the games release I had my camp near 76 so yea people stopped by, this was before we had vendors. Most people just were looking for water and the crops and maybe a cooking station. Others were looking to use glitches or some other exploit to trash the camp.  I started locking stuff down, the griefers just kept at it; so when I was ready and i had finally had enough I moved my camp to the bog. I get a lot less visitors, I have nice neighbors as we all seem to be there for the view and the seclusion and the griefers have much harder time even locating the camp.  I don't have my vendor up, haven't since the inventory glitch and I haven't missed it since.  It seems no matter where the camp was located, or what I did to keep people from messing with it the griefers wouldn't stop messing with it. So it sits with its stunning view  of EL-7 all locked up, if people don't mess with it  I don't have to fix it.  I'm fine with that it means I can spend more time focused on playing and less time fixing my camp.
---
I have a more open camp for some of my other toons, one of them is even in a different spot in the bog, I do have to spend some time fixing the other camp in the bog because for some strange reason there is a fixed elite spawn near by that will occasionally pop out 5 mirelurk kings, or 5 Supermutants, mole miners, or floaters. I do not have to fix it because of player action that I can tell, and thats odd because its closer to where other players are likely to be.
---
I don't really see myself putting a lot of effort into any of my camps until the issue of players being able to use the various glitches to damage them is addressed, I have lots of plans for when that day does come but its probably a long way off.
---
Congratulations.
---
Lower player damage, especially certain builds like junkies and bloodied, they should be more inline with the bane weapon.  
---
30% increase damage and not 50%.
---
Furious should be 25% like two shot and not 40%
---
melee it tricky but maybe nerfing instigating would also be good, make it 50% increase damage and not 100%
---
Adrenal mutation needs to removed or changed to also accommodate it.
---
You‚Äôll never look back. You don‚Äôt need vats on a heavy power build anyways. The only time I use vats on my heavy build is on sbq, imposter sheepsquatch, and colossal Wendigo while taking sunshine oil and nuka quantums for huge ap pool
---
I love my camp so much, finally, I have a customized room for Commander Daguerre, a hidden room for me (nuka cola door) and a guest room for my best friend who plays with me. And a kitchen and dining area, and more! Then I have a garage I built with barn walls for crafting. I'm constantly torn between wanting to just restart and never wanting to restart again, so whenever that happens I just move my budget around and add a new room instead. I love seeing other people's camps, it's my favorite
---
Once got 3 or 4 plans in a row, since that time just some apparel drops :(
---
I was just reading about that today. Got it to level 2 so far. Ammosmith as well right?
---
God no, with the right cards you can snipe with it. People are using it as a multi round rapid fire sniper with splash, on top of its power as a shotgun.
---
I confirmed this worked for my alt today ‚Äî quest diamond was hovering in the air 6 feet above where the waterfall lands, but one grenade and bingo, there was the wendigo (unhurt by the grenade, but that's okay).
---
I know. Imagine being able to cross that river into Ohio.  Man..  they better expand this game beyond of Appalachia.
---
Damn, this is super high quality.
---
Wendigo and Sheepsquatch, for me they are the most "creepy" creatures and i love the lore behind them, and their holotape stories. Not to mention, i love the boss characteristics and mechanics from them (Wendigo Colossus in Wendigo's case but still applies)
---
Good job!  Uranium fever is sweet when solo!
---
It's still not as bad as 'revive a player', but it requires luck. Gauss Shotgun is basically a semi-auto explosive shotgun. It's as OP as it is rare to find. That or any fully auto gun should do the trick. Things like the SMG are very forgiving if you aren't that great at aiming.
---
See how unoriginal you are?!?? Lol you proved my point.
---
I'm haven't been looking for him for almost a year and go months without seeing him lol. 
---
Meat week is coming up at least so it won't be hard to find him if you haven't by then.
---
&gt;ve a melee fighte
---
Oh, when you commit to it you can totally be a tank, you need strength, luck, and  Agility and let me tell you its amazing how much damage you can avoid taking. and no you don't need power armor for this actually power armor is to your peril if you do it right. Obviously you need the right perks to make it work though. I've taken a deathclaw out with nothing but a knife. That is satisfying.
---
You from Western Pennsylvania?
---
I've noticed more random dupes due to crashes. Not really anything that could be done on purpose as far as I can tell and it's random items in my inventory that get duped. Combat Armor Chest, Preserved Instamash, Bladed Baseball Bat Mod. No rhyme or reason to it. I mainly seem to crash when trying to fast travel to a team mate on a public team.
---
I had a look at the build and I would recommend only running perks like contractor when you will actually get use out of them, such as building in a workshop. Getting concentrated fire would also benefit you better than a maxed out lone wanderer. Gauss shotgun is insane in vats
---
the amount of NW hackers is truly insane, no clue how bethshit still doesn't do anything about it
---
Same applies to Ultralight on arms &amp; legs for SS armor, btw
---
I ran into one last night, scared the hell out of me. Reminded me of the PUBG days üòÇ
---
Well, there is a lot of space west of the Ohio River to add a ton of stuff.
---
What platform are you? i have an extra fixer plan you can have
---
same for me. im not getting atoms from challenges. PC Steam
---
Yeah. I find myself heading no true direction, struggling to find a faction I want to join, because the Enclave is cool and all but I need to be level 50 for X-01 and the Brotherhood of Steel I already joined in Fallout 4. Maybe I'm just stupid, but there should be missions for each faction so you can find them easier and decide which one to join.
---
Thank you to you and the dev team for getting this sorted out. However, I think I and many other Steam users still have atoms locked up in our [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) account. While I'm successfully getting atoms from challenges put into my Steam account, I still have 700 atoms in my [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) account I can't use since I don't own that version of the game. Are you guys working on any fix to this? Thank you in advance.
---
Search on YouTube where the marine helmet plan drops.
---
Use server hopping and try find it. Just do not pick up anything in that location or you will get some kind of item rspawn timer for 20 or so hours.
---
Once you will find that plan craft and sell to vendor, with good charisma its like 30+ caps per item.
---
Dont nuke SBQ if looking for Cobalt. There is literally only one plant there that will give you raw cobalt. Morgantown, as others have suggested, is your best bet. Whitesprings, at least parts of it have decent number as well, but all mostly roadside and down hill by service entrance.
---
Lol stop dramatising
---
I don't think that you need either. I got a bloodied combat shotgun with 33% in vats an I can sneak kill a lv 50 sb with 1 hit. A lv 65 sb takes 2 shots.
---
Ammosmith as well.
---
I got one from a dude I met &amp; teamed wit a bit earlier...but I had grinded for about a week &amp; half two weeks prior too that,wit No drops at all...
---
Tons of ammo &amp; meds wasted though.
---
It is a good fun though,the few I had bought &amp; trades off,I really liked.
---
I mean,I guess it‚Äôs not like the best gun,but it‚Äôs a good one.
---
You need to get away from this mindset.  People can simply server hop.  Just nuke it.  There's ghouls that'll spawn for the hardened/glowing mass/high rad fluids, and lots of plants that mutate into cobalt flux.  
---
If you're still worried about it, [use this map](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/7/75/Mappalachia_fluxes_cobalt.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190626173721) and find a spot that has a lot of cobalt flux plants and nuke that area.  Thing is, if you nuke somewhere that mobs don't spawn in high numbers, you're doing yourself a disservice because you'll just load up on flux and watch it rot away into inert flux because you don't have enough of the other stuff to stabilize it.
---
That giant bug in a trailer. One love.
---
It's so much easier without ten others all gunning for the legendary's.
---
You can always ask
---
"Want to play Nuclear Winter with me?"
---
That's the way to the heart right there!
---
I'm definitely burnt out. Currently sitting at Level 50. Just been doing the dailies and getting straight off as well.
---
It's been fixed
---
They need to do it
---
Pre-Wastelanders, this wasn't much of an issue.  There was a way to bypass the initial 'frozen in place' mechanic, but people more or less started at the same time because everyone knew the trick except the noobs.  Post-Wastelanders, it now loads in people unevenly into the match based on their machine specs, so some people can literally be playing for half a minute before you even load in.  That is part of the reason I stopped playing the mode, because it makes it virtually impossible to compete if you spawn near anyone else who happens to have a fast SSD and closer proximity with the Bethesda server cluster.
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat as you, around the same level.  I only manage to play about an hr to an hr/half a day throughout the whole week (including weekends).  So sadly I probably won‚Äôt eclipse level 60 lol
---
Solo in events is so Nice. Feels like everyone are just competing for the kills otherwise when there is too many there.
---
Good job!
---
It probably can work you just have to get the build order right. The order you have to place things can be super counterintuitive.
---
The vendor is a random spawn.  I'd join a fo76 discord server and lurk around there until someone mentions they found him.  Sometimes people are nice enough to broadcast that he's on their server and they'll hold him there until other people show up.
---
Otherwise, you could also just ask on a market page.  This post is likely going to get flagged for breaking rule 10 anyways, so you're better off asking elsewhere.
---
After 400'ish or so Damage Resistance the curve is already making it moot. Like X-01 vs T-65, the DR is something like 50-100 difference (dont know doesn't matter) but the curve makes it like an actual 2-4% damage reduction in reality. I did the math when secret service armor came out using data mined numbers and the difference between that and the T-65 was like &lt;5% damage reduction. But yeah, you're missing a few things. We've got emergency protocols but if you're not wearing PA the most valuable damage mitigation perks open up. i.e. Serendipity being the most ridiculous (40% chance to completely AVOID damage vs a FLAT damage REDUCTION with protocols).
---
Oh no they just don't have the same versatility that a normal mod could fix whee anything snaps together the way you'd want it too. I understand completely what you mean no cap
---
This really is the wrong sub for this....
---
But what system?
---
Alright thanks
---
Despite others who say the whitespring is the place to go for technical data; I've found the silos to be a much more reliable place to get it.  Took me about 2 weeks to find all the BOS T60 paint schemes.
---
Check all the round blue file cabinets in the launch prep room itself and adjacent rooms.  There have been times where I've found up to 5 technical documents (data) in one instance.  Granted you can only take one at a time but drop your 1st tent at camp venture (if you have it) and make round trips.
---
(Don't know this for sure but Luck may factor into finding them; I have 10+ luck)
---
I use the newest xbox and I've picked a lock, looted it, and got to the next loot box before the guy beside me loaded in. It's kinda sad how much of an advantage you can get
---
This one here can spot a fellow bush wookiee. I see him there in the green bush that‚Äôs place on top of the rock on the far left.
---
Griefing in this game is non existent. The worst you can do is contest a workshop and steal some junk. Tame as compared to ark or rust
---
I actually got lucky and managed to trade for the plan I needed. No doubt I'll bump into him now that I have it :)
---
Same here, I‚Äôve barely moved my camp but tinkered to the point where I‚Äôm quite proud of it. I love people coming by and checking it out.
---
Look up vendor bot responder spawn locations and you'll find it in time.
---
They're fun in PvE. Not so fun in PvP.
---
I love inviting random low levels to my team and build them an entire camp with all the ins and outs :) it's just so fun to me
---
Also happened to me after getting atoms from the Legendary run. Says i have 485, reverts back to 225. I need 490 for the thing I want.
---
Haha! That‚Äôs awesome! I need to get on one of those runs for xp, I‚Äôm still doing the early story and side missions though.
---
When a bush wookie finds a chameleon serum, it's beautiful.  I only died because someone nuked all the was left of the safe area.  Made it to top 3 though :)
---
The damage needed is between 1.2k-1.5k
---
I am on PC. Much appreciated for the thought either way!
---
Bush Wookiees amuse me when I find them. And to be honest...annoy me when there on my team. funnyest one was a one Guy who aparently hid in a building in Morgantown, and died last when the fire moved one last time. The guys on my team with live mikes could not stop laughing.
---
I've had a hard time with deciding too.
---
You're going to get downvoted like hell. 
---
Have an upvote,  i miss just have single star legendaries like FO4. Much simpler and becomes less avout gear chasing and more about playing the game.
---
The Fixer is arguably the best commando weapon in the game followed very closely by Handmades.  As a bloodied stealth rifleman I use Levers and Handmades with hardened receivers.  I don't get the same sustained DPS as commando but one-shot most things anyway.  High health version of this would be same but with Junkies.
---
Yeah for sure totally agree!
---
the hero we need :)
---
The Travelling Responder Vendor Bot carries it as part of a random loot list. It will only have 2 clothing items in its inventory from that list at any time so you have to keep server hopping and retrying until its there. Same bot also carries the Hunters Long Coat which probably has the lowest chance of appearing in inventory of all of the things he stocks.
---
I find the best spawn location for me to find him is at Lady Janets Ice Cream. Fast travel to there and head down the road to the west. Theres an overturned Whitespring Bus and a random spawn point there. Just keep revisiting that spot every 20 mins or so or do a server hop. Eventually you will get the bot. Good luck
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox, I have one you can buy!
---
beths fault for making 3 shotgun cards...
---
If you have a Radeon gpu, you should have that Crimson Radeon stuff where you can find the temperature of your GPU under "performances".
---
About the ini tweaks, you should check this post first https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9u0xtb/pc_fallout_76_optimizationperformance_tweaks_ini/ and start working from there. My ini tweaks are heavily reduced since my config is much lower than yours so I doubt it would be interesting for you.
---
Anyway, reducing the distances at which the game render stuff is a solid start. Just don't put values as low as stated in the post since those values are mostly good for potatoe computers.

fBlockLevel1Distance=10000.0000
---
fBlockLevel0Distance=5000.0000
---
Those are my values in the fallout76prefs.ini file for rendering distances. By default, it should be much higher than that so you can try different values.
---
Also, check sAntiAliasing=TAA in the same file. Mine is set on TAA or else it's just too fugly lol. You can remove TAA   for FXAA or leave nothing, that's up to you.
---
Fantastic!  Good job.
---
RX 570 here. The game runs very inconsistently
---
People wait no one shows up, people stop waiting
---
bloodied is 90% i believe
---
bloodied and junkies should be a bit higher than bane as they have "drawbacks" the "drawbacks" is mainly for bloodied.
---
Thank you for looking into this. Keep it up!
---
I would like that to but that would not stop the bloodied and junkies builds one shotting everything.
---
I had a Uranium Fever yesterday and everyone couldn't stop one shotting everything,  All there weapons where to high damage. It was pretty funny seeing the rage people got.
---
Had no clue where to ask, the market subreddit wouldn't let me post, I'm on pc
---
My Bad! It wasn't on the main page. And I apologize to you. I have found a video with the Article from one of Todd Howard's Interviews (Your so called BOSS) and I am sure I can find others!
---

---
Yeah, I agree. This game is really good about that. I was referring mostly to when I played GTA, which is pretty bad for that sort of thing.
---
Trading posts are just against the rules here is all. If you were on Xbox I would craft for you
---
 I happen to be on pc
---
I've read a lot of your posts I don't think you know what your saying to be honesy
---
you can change your ingame name and login names
---
exactly, as long as you pay for fallout 1st you can do literally anything especially ruin the game for others and you will never ever get permabanned
---
Would be fun if we all started on a high mountain and had to catapult ourselves to our destinations!
---
i mainly just slap down a fusion generator and tell them not to delete it
---
Same... funny how theres so many complaints on here about waiting but no1 shows up
---
one of the only things I dont do üòÇ I never have copper or aluminum or something
---
You are doing your part!  When I go, I'll get one or two shots on the assualtron, just to tag it, and then I put myself on robot swarm duty.
---
Junkies barely has a drawback since the withdrawal negatives really don't mean much.  
---
Bloodied is better than high health builds since you prioritise damage reduction perks and some a stupidly op like Serendipity.

I have a PS4 Pro with SSD in addition to gigabit internet and I load in a full 30-40 seconds faster than most everyone else.  It‚Äôs a massive advantage.  I am kitted up already by the time people spawn in.
---
I want to side with the Enclave, but the thing is, I can't find them and this game just lacks something that I find in Fallout 4. Maybe because the quests seem too hard for lower levels such as me who struggle with their good guns breaking or running into a bunch of higher level enemies that are complete bullet sponges unless I use my explosive crossbow or my shotgun. What I like about Fallout 4 and 76 is they do shotguns right. They have decent, respectable range unlike some other games where past 10 feet you are basically shooting an airsoft gun at them.
---
Finishing your scout badges and finding the TnT keys will keep you occupied.
---
"1 v. 4-5 me bro!"
---
Sure, if you like how the armor looks or because you have everything else you want. After making a set off SS armor, mostly Vanguard with a Bolstering and Unyielding thrown in, plus the new shielded SS underarmor, I very rarely wear my X01 armor anymore. I'll start saving for it soon as I've purchased all the weapon plans I want. It'll be more of a collecting, and looking cool thing than needing the T-65 armor. But, whatever blows up your skirt, and w/e rp-ing you're into as well.
---
Believe it or not, we are probably the nicest community when it comes to online multiplayer games. We tend to care for those who take interest in a game such as 76. Toxicity is quite rare in this game, and people tend to be kind lest you join NW (Nuclear Winter) those words change lol.
---
5k
---
The TnT keys? What are those?
---
That looks grate, I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs in FO76
---
My issues with this:
---
- I have a j/e gatling plasma that I aquired legitimately. So by doing this you punish me the same way you do to a hacker/cheater/exploiter and that makes me sad. 
---
- Implement unique item tracking so you can remove hacked and duped items. They should have done this from the beginning. 
---
- Unobtainable items are part of many online games especially mmos. They are (were) a high level goal to work towards that required significant wealth to purchase of which I grinded and traded for. Aside from that, its also a badge for people that got them when they came out which if you have been playing that long is nice to be noticed for. Runecape comes to mind and it would be a bit of a joke if the entire mechanic behind the atom store is hypocritically shut down in regards to items you aquire by playing the game. 
---
- You touched on my main point in your OP. The problems with the combat system and resistances are what causes certain weapons/effects to be OP nor do you need a legacy to be that asshole that kills everything in one hit. Remember that stealth commando build that could kill the queen in a few shots? No legacies needed. Fix the combat system and keep the weapons is the best solution here. 
---
- Explosive bullets/strangler pa and several other explosive effects need a pass to not lag everyone out/drive them insane. Again dont throw the baby out with the bathwater. 
---
- The trade discord is currently on fire with everyone and their mother who heard about the dupe. It will die down, and ideally the supply is cut off since the dupe exploit has been fixed and I am certain a great deal of hacked weapons now exist on banned accounts which effectively removes them from the game. Also negotiate. Every now and again I see the spreadsheet commandos who have the best shit and are looking for this 1/100000 roll and wont even consider currency offers and that is their right as frustrating as it is.
---
I do post alot on this reddit.  
---
I really like the game but don't like the min-maxing much.
---
i'm losing charisma and intelligence. How am i supposed to charm the extra xp out of enemies?
---
Yes mine was near a fish gutter rack and they would chop fish.
---
Wow. This worked. Man I love this game but holy shit..
---
Edit: Steam version STILL shows I have 0 atoms, whereas Bethesda launcher version shows i have 285. What kinda broken ass game cant correctly display the amount on one platform.
---
Guess I need to have 2 installs and only open the beth one when i want to buy something. Just wow.
---
I have everything I've ever wanted, started from literally nothing, got 1 decent roll 50 cal and now I have rare outfits, legacies, anything I've always thought I'd never get. I dont know why people are mad about legacies just because they dont have any, just trade you lazy bums üòÇ
---
Thank you didn‚Äôt want to go over!
---
i tried scrapping them like you said and trying to place it into my camp with the blueprint but it still doesn‚Äôt work, it keeps telling me that it can‚Äôt be placed because it intersects with an existing object
---
Sugar Grove is a great screw run. Can be a little tough at low levels, but theres a ton of fans in there and even more clipboards with springs.
---
Hidden quests.  I'm sure Google knows about them.
---
My so called boss?
---
What are you talking about?
---
Isn‚Äôt that quote from before the game came out? It isn‚Äôt part of the fallout 1st advertising... the quote even says they are still designing the service...
---
Are you at the max amount. 5000?   You‚Äôll need to spend it before you can collect more.  Don‚Äôt cash in anymore or it‚Äôs for nothing I believe. Until you‚Äôre below the 5000
---
The *potential* spawn points for crates are fixed, and some crates actually always do spawn in the exact same place.
---
For example, when spawning at the southern end of the railroad bridge leading to the trainyard in Morgantown, if you don't see a yellow crate on the tracks, it means a blue crate has spawned below the bridge next to the support structure. If you do see the yellow crate on the tracks, there's no blue crate below the bridge. And, the blue crate at the northern end of the bridge is always there.
---
Also in Morgantown, the large supply crate across the bridge from Portside Pub seems to always spawn on top of the small shack. If not always then at least very often since it seems to always be there when I go that way.
---
The bobblehead seems to always spawn on the aforementioned railroad bridge as well, although I'm not sure if all bobbleheads and magazines are always guaranteed spawns, but I would assume that at the very least some are.
---
Terminals and safes are also fixed, as far as I know. Locked chests might also be fixed, although I'm not 100% sure about that.
---
So, yes. There's *absolutely* a big advantage in loading into the game before other people. Bethesda should definitely make it so that the game does not start until the system gets a confirmation from the client of every single player that they've done loading in 100%.
---
Thanks very very much, havent played in awhile a miss just roaming and taking pictures of the scenery. New wallpaper forsure
---
Between quarantine and double xp weekend I'm almost done I'm just shy of 83
---
1 intelligence and maybe 2-3 charisma for 50% increase damage. Sign me up any day, i don't run it since i like my themed build of Vats criticals.
---
Tbh, I didn't even know the enclave or the brotherhood were in this game. I don't even know what the main story is. The quests are so confusing
---
You ever play dnd
---
this site can also help you plan out your build, there's a handy check list to let you mark which perk to take when.    [https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/)
---
When I need to clear stash room, I'll look to see if there are any noobs in the vault, or hanging around the overseer's camp, and bring them stuff.
---
Also, if a high lvl player starts shooting the ground near you, look for the loot bag!  They have brought you presents!
---
You can also add pictures that arent from fallout or that you didn't take by opening the respective folder in your PC. Although I dont know if this is possible in a console.
---
I think it's the best. I have a buddy who puts locks on every door and I'm like who's going to buy from you if you can't even get in the door.
---
Cool! Thanks
---
Where is your camp?
---
Interesting. I guess Bethesda has really just been slowly phasing out power armor.
---
**Fallout: A Post Nuclear Role Playing Game** is literally the name of the first game in the entire series, my dudebro.
---
Edit: Anybody wanna take a guess on the full title of the sequel? You guessed it! **Fallout 2: A Post Nuclear Role Playing Game**!
---
It‚Äôs almost like the Fallout games are supposed to be based around roleplaying since the 90s. Huh.
---
Yes and we always frowned upon min-maxing.  
---
When i DM i generally make it harder on anyone who does.
---
You should enjoy the game and not feel like you have to be bloodied or junkies.
---
Naw, it‚Äôs resistance to all explosive damage, including the splash damage from Gauss weapons. Can be a bit deceptive since the damage numbers will show sometimes, but you need to go off health bar alone (in spite of the issues with that) since many times the damage numbers are inaccurate or sometimes even state damage has been done when it hasn‚Äôt at all. The reason for the massive buff to her against explosives was because of the TSE weapons that were shredding her, even after they reduced the damage of the extra projectiles, but they went wild and put in resistance that some data miners claimed at 300% to all explosive damage. Not only is this excessive, it seems dangerous from a programming standpoint since values over 100% can mess with things in weird ways sometimes, but I don‚Äôt claim to know their system at all.
---
Don‚Äôt carry any drinks except inert flux. Cook what you find and eat. Don‚Äôt carry any pre war food. Each time you get to a vendor sell all your chems and food except 10 stimpaks, 5 disease cure and ten Radaway, plus maybe one or two each of the rare stuff you use regularly. You will find everything else you need as you go. Obviously tweak this if you regularly use psycho or something, but generally you don‚Äôt need to carry as much as you think and each time you get back to a vendor you‚Äôll be selling meaning you‚Äôre finding what you need.
---
Yes. I literally have 10 pieces of each kind of scrap and only accumulate plastic, acid, copper lead and steel. Ammo making materials.
---
Bulk it, sell it vendors.
---
What the fuck are you even talking about?
---
Eugenie is my Ghirl....
---
Adamantium Skeleton in Endurance reduces limb damage (and completely eliminates it at level 3).
---
You dont have to be bloodied or junkies but this is a rpg not a fps
---
And also I haven‚Äôt bought any kind of legacies or  used any legacies from anyone  before this ban wave. I haved my legacies or same weapons and armor for like you said for a year.
---
Are you on Xbox? PC? PS4? I was having an issue where friends on Xbox weren't showing up as friends in the 76 social tab. I figured out that if I changed my friendship to favorite and let them see my real name it fixed the issue. Nothing else worked until I let them see my real name.
---
Not sure this will help you out, but I hope it does.
---
i lose a few other points but it's still more of a drawback than bloodied.
---
I solo her...no PA required
---
Great pic!
